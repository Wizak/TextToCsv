youll take the case she said im so gladi she glanced at her watch and rose quickly i must go now the rain has stopped i was on a call in this neighborhood and decided to drop by on the chance you were at home could you meet me at headquarters about three oclock this afternoon certainly nancy replied fine ill tell you all about it then and well go see joan and her mother by the way she added when they reached the door do you know heath castle a big estate some miles outside of town yes i do nancy said ive seen it from the river its that spookylooking place with those stone towers and the high walls around it find out all you can about the place lieu tenant masters said its julianas inheritance and thank you nancy little joan really needs your help after the policewoman had left nancy went to the kitchen and told hannah about the mys tery now youre happy the kindly middleaged woman said fondly you have a new easel i just hope it wont be dangerous mrs gruen had been with the family since the death of mrs drew when nancy was three years old the warm hearted housekeeper had always been like a mother to the girl what do you know about heath castle nancy asked her not much it was built hannah nancy exclaimed she was facing the window lookin the yard what is it the housekeeper asked peering through the glass oh what a shame she cried out all the hollyhocks are snapped off in the middle and the daisies are flattened into the mud from the rain thats not what i mean said nancy look at the flower border where my new rosebushes were why theyre gone said hannah she stared in amazement at two holes filled with rain water the bushes were dug up said nancy and stolen probably by the same thief who took plants from some of our neighbors hannah remarked theres been a rash of these thefts lately ill report it when i go to headquarters this afternoon nancy said while she set the table and heated soup han nah made sandwiches by the time the two had finished their lunch the ground had dried a lit tle and the sun was out they hurried into the back yard to inspect the damage except for the rosebushes no plants were missing nancy could not find any clues to the thief she and hannah began cleaning up debris from the storm suddenly they heard the familiar song of one of river heights wellknown ec centric characters here comes my old friend salty down the street nancy laughed shaking off her somber mood the goodnatured elderly man once a sailor had received his nickname from nancy when she was a little girl he had introduced himself to the drew household as boatswain bostwick bumple ton home from the salty seas nancy had tried to say his whole name but sometimes mixed it up once she addressed him as bumple boat and another time as humpty dumpty bumpleton much to his amusement finally the little girl settled on salty and her nickname stuck to him the mans cart bell tinkled merrily and a moment later the jolly weatherbeaten sailor wheeled his wagon around the corner of the drive way spying nancy and hannah he sang again clams by the bushel clams by the lot clams for the kettle clams for the pot none for us today mrs gruen called salty smiled come now he coaxed ye cant turn down my clams theyre nutritious delicious delectable respectable matter of fact ye might even find a pearl in one of em nancy turned to hannah dont you think we could use a few pearly clams she asked with a wink the housekeeper gave in okay a dozen nancy please get my purse nancy darted away but soon returned with the pocketbook and a container for the clams after the elderly sailor had left she and hannah took the clams into the kitchen and nancy started to open them with a sharp knife soon she had a pile of empty shells but no pearls i guess these havent anything in them but meat well heres the last one nancy opened the clam and was about to toss away the attractive rainbowcolored shell when a tiny object inside drew her attention a pearl she cried holding it out for the housekeeper to see hannah stared at the small white object i declare it is one she acknowledged and may be worth some money ill take it to sam weatherby nancy said eagerly she removed the pearl and washed it then drove to mr weatherbys shop the owner was a dealer in curios and antique jewelry nancy had to wait fifteen minutes while an unpleasant man bargained with the shop owner over a piece of jewelry he wanted to sell it was a mans antique watch chain with an attractive gold charm at last the customer accepted an offer pocketed the money mr weatherby paid him and turned on his heel remarking i might as well have given it to you after the man had left mr weatherby said to nancy that was daniel hector how he loves to argue if all my customers were like him id have to close up shop well what can i do for you nancy she removed the pearl from her purse and asked the curio dealer what it was worth well well he said examining the object carefully its nice but river pearls are not valuable he named a modest sum ill buy it if youll bring me the shell from which it was taken i want to display the pearl with the shell nancy promised to return with the shell the next day then she put the pearl in her pocket book and left the shop she started walking the few crowded blocks to police headquarters as nancy stopped to look in the window of a department store a boy drew close to her then suddenly he jerked the purse from beneath her arm and fled chapter ii heath castle it took nancy a moment to recover from her astonishment by the time she whirled around the purse snatcher was already running down the street nancy dashed after him but tried to avoid bumping into pedestrians whats the matter asked a man she side stepped just in time to avoid a collision my purse he took up the chase with her as word spread other people followed but the boy was running fast nancy caught a glimpse of him as he dashed into a narrow alley between two buildings when she reached it there was no sign of him well there goes my pearl she thought un happily besides the pearl her purse had contained her drivers license car registration some credit cards money and cosmetics i suppose i should be thankful i didnt lose more nancy said to herself ruefully she thanked the stranger who had tried to assist her then hurried down the street to headquarters and was taken into lieutenant masters office after greetings were exchanged nancy said i want to report two thefts first she told about the boy who had snatched her purse can you describe him the policewoman asked i didnt get a look at his face said nancy but i think he was about ten or twelve years old he was stocky with tousled blond hair and wore blue jeans and a tee shirt many boys could fit that description lieu tenant masters commented well do our best but i doubt that youll get back your bag with the contents then she frowned did i hear you say two thefts yes said nancy and told about the missing rosebushes the officers dark eyes gleamed with interest i think i can give you the answer to the second one right away she said the culprit is prob ably little joan fenimore oh no nancy said in dismay yes said the officer i told you she had been in difficulty with the law just before i came to see you i was checking into another report of flowers stolen from your neighborhood the woman of the house caught a glimpse of the child and described her joan has a passionate love for flowers lieu tenant masters went on and an amazing knowl edge of them i arranged for her to join a nature study class at the museum but im afraid that my rehabilitation program backfired recently she has taken plants and shrubs from other homes what a shame nancy said joans father is not living the young officer resumed her widowed mother is ill and very poor nancy listened sympathetically as the police woman went on ill see that joan returns the bushes to your garden mrs fenimore will insist upon it anyway shes greatly distressed by her childs behavior lieutenant masters stood up come along she said well go there now and you can hear everything firsthand the two rode to the fenimore house located in a rundown section of the city the tiny yard was a mass of colorful flowers however and vines halfcovered the unpainted weatherbeaten porch as nancy and the officer went up the flagstone walk the policewoman called attention to two young newly planted rosebushes are these yours she asked they look like the ones that were in our yard nancy said but she broke off because a little girl in a faded pink dress had just come around the corner of the house when the child saw the woman in uniform she stopped short and then turned as if to run off dont be afraid the lieutenant said gently did you come to take me away joan asked indeed we didnt but we will have to send you to a special school unless you decide to be good i am good joan said tossing her tangled blond curls just ask my mother in many ways you are very good i know you work hard to take care of your mother but why do you dig up shrubs and plants that dont belong to you joans gaze roved to the telltale rosebushes she hung her head and didnt answer im sure you dont really mean to be naughty the policewoman continued why do you take flowers because theyre pretty joan said we can never buy anything nice the child sank down on the porch steps and began to cry lieutenant masters comforted her soon she gained an admission from the little girl that an older boy teddy hooper who lived next door had suggested that joan help herself to some pretty plants i dont know why i did it joan began to sob i wish my aunt juliana would come home im sure shed buy us some nice things in an undertone lieutenant masters explained to nancy that joan knew about her aunt only from her mother mrs fenimore wasnt married when her sister disappeared come inside and let her tell you the story nancy received a distinct shock as joan led the way into the living room lying on a wellworn couch was a slender woman with deep lines in her pallid face nancy was sure mrs fenimore was not more than thirty years old but she looked fifty upon seeing the policewoman a concerned ex pression appeared on mrs fenimores face has joan done something wrong again at her mothers question the child turned her head away neither lieutenant masters nor nancy spoke immediately after a brief pause the police officer introduced the new visitor im glad to meet you mrs fenimore said softly im sorry youre not feeling well nancy re plied perhaps it would be better if i came back some other time no no i wish youd tell nancy drew about your sis ter lieutenant masters urged nancys a detec tive and will try to find out what happened to juliana you really will mrs fenimore looked at the girl hopefully you see julie went away by her self for a months rest and never was heard of again have you any idea at all where she may have gone nancy asked do you think she disap peared deliberately no i cant believe that and i keep telling joan im sure her aunt will come home someday mrs fenimore explained that the dancer had been engaged to a wealthy manufacturer named walter heath five years after her mysterious disappearance he died and left heath castle to juliana he tried to trace her before his death but was unsuccessful theres a provision in his will which stipulates that it juliana does not claim his estate within five years it is to be sold and the money given to charities he specified the time is almost up after a pause mrs fenimore went on the grounds of heath castle were beautiful once with walled gardens and sunken pools now im told it looks like an overgrown jungle full of weeds nevertheless i am hoping julie will be found and can come to claim the castle the story deeply interested nancy she could hardly wait to begin the search for the missing dancer she was also eager to visit heath castle she mentioned this to mrs fenimore the woman smiled ill lend you a key to the front door that walter left with me to give to julie joan dear bring my jewel case here the little girl hurried off to get it in a few moments she returned with the box her mother took the key from inside and handed it to nancy i wish you luck mrs fenimore said before nancy and lieutenant masters left the house they helped joan prepare supper for her self and her mother wishing to spare mrs feni more any further worry they refrained from dis cussing the childs thieving instincts in depth as they drove away nancy remarked its pos sible juliana met with foul play yes said lieutenant masters if thats true you may find yourself up against a dangerous ad versary when the two young women walked into head quarters a little later the desk sergeant said youre in luck miss drew he held up her stolen purse a patrolman found it in a trash an nothing but the money and the pearl was taken nancy was thrilled im especially glad to have roy drivers license and car registration back she said and the credit cards please thank the patrolman for me the following day nancy related mrs feni mores story to her closest friends bess marvin and george fayne who had dropped in the two girls were cousins and helped nancy when she was working on a mystery bess was blond and slightly plump she was less inclined toward adventure than her spunky cousin an attractive brunette who liked athletics and was proud of having a boys name bess said soberly its a shame about joan and teddy ill help you all i can with them george was eager to pursue work on the mys tery what are we waiting for she asked why not go now and explore the castle cautiously bess asked will it be safe it wont be easy nancy warned her friends i was told the undergrowth is like a jungle maybe the best way to get there is by motorboat up the muskoka river twenty minutes later the three girls rented a small motorboat at campbells landing the craft was old and the engine clattered and threw oil but it was the only boat available lucky we all know how to swim bess said with some misgiving as they pulled away from the dock i have a feeling this old tub leaks and may sink before we go very far well be all right if george keeps busy with the bailer nancy laughed heading the craft up stream the river was wide near town but the upper reaches were narrow and twisted and turned at such sharp angles that fast travel was out of the question at the wheel nancy kept an alert watch for shoals water was slowly seeping in at the bow its really pretty out here but so wild bess commented her gaze wandering along the solid line of trees fringing the shores better forget the scenery for a while nancy advised and give george a hand with the bail ing if you dont our shoes will be soaked the water was coming in faster now both bess and george worked vigorously dipping the water and throwing it over the side listen nancy said presently whats that bess and george stopped bailing to look around they had heard no unusual sound another boat nancy exclaimed as the noise of an engine grew louder but where is it just then a small blueandwhite craft shot into view from harpers inlet one of the rivers many small hidden bays look out bess cried in alarm the pilot in the oncoming boat seemed to be unaware of the girls in their little craft at high speed he raced straight toward it desperately nancy spun the wheel there was not enough space to clear with a splintering crash the two boats collided chapter iii a runaway boat the speeding boat which had struck the girls craft now veered sharply away and raced down stream meanwhile the impact had caused bess to lose her balance she hit her head on the side of the boat and toppled into the water instantly nancy turned off the motor if bess were unconscious there was no time to lose george had already dived over the side when she located her cousin she grasped the inert form with her left arm and struck out with the other for the boat nancy leaned over and helped pull the unconscious bess aboard is she nancy began at that moment bess opened her eyes and coughed several times nancy patted her on the back imallright bess said weakly our boat she tried to point for the first time the others realized that water was filling the craft at an alarming rate through a small hole in its side quick george bail nancy cried george picked up the bucket she had been us ing before and started to work nancy crumpled up a newspaper lying on the bottom of the boat and stuffed the hole with it in a tackle box she found a small burlap sack which she rolled up and added to the paper in a moment the inflow of rushing water was reduced to a trickle good george panted and sat down now we can chase that other boat it was not in sight however and nancy de cided it would be useless to try pursuing the faster craft she turned her attention to bess how are you feeling she asked all right but id like to go home we will said nancy im afraid this boat cant stand much more i wish we hadnt lost the fellow who ruined it said george if i ever see him would you recognize him nancy asked george said she would not and bess had not gotten a good look at him either i saw him nancy said slowly im sure id rcognize his face and he was thin and wore a lightblue cap the girls dreaded returning to campbells landing with their damaged craft but when the owner saw the damaged craft he was not angry it wont cost more than twentyfive dollars to repair it he assured them my boat rental insurance will take care of it after saying goodby nancy drove her friends home as bess got out of the car she said im sorry our trip to heath castle was ruined nancy smiled well go another time the following days investigation unearthed no clue to the identity of the boatman though nancy described him and his blueandwhite craft to several persons not one of them was able to identify it finally she thought of salty the clam digger ill drive down to his place on the river and talk with him she told hannah gruen he might also know something about the heath estate nancy invited bess to go along and proceeded toward the river sallys home was very quaint once it had been a small attractive yacht now it was a beached wreck weathered by sun and rain its only claim to any former glory was the hag which flew proudly from the afterdeck anyone here nancy called come in come in the former sailor invited he was sitting with his feet up on a builtin table and eating beans out of a can when he saw the girls he stood up ye honor me comin here he said his blue eyes twinkling but im goin to have to disappoint ye ive nary a clam today oh we didnt come to buy clams nancy re plied glancing curiously at the furnishings of the yacht the room was small and cluttered but very clean saltys bunk was neatly made on a shelf above it was an amazing array of sea shells i collect em the sailor explained following nancys gaze some o those shells came from the orient an some from right here in the mus koka he walked over to the shelf and pointed to a curious specimen thats called the washboard clam its one o the biggest of our river clams and this is a whelk from the seashore you can get dye out of it when the critters fresh how interesting the girls exclaimed pleased by their attention the man showed them other shells which were too large to stand on the narrow shelf one measuring three feet across had come from an island in the pacific nancy grinned what a pearl that might hold she told of her own loss saying she was glad the pearl was not large and valuable the former sailor showed the girls other treas ures from the sea huge fluted specimens and tiny delicate shells amazed at the variety nancy asked salty if he had collected them during his travels no the clam digger laughed mr heath gave em to me the name startled nancy not walter heath no ira heathwalts father salty an swered he gave me the shells when he had his button factory on the inlet a button factory near here bess asked in surprise its been closed for years it was shut down when the supply o freshwater mussels gave out mollusk motherofpearl shells are used you know to make pearl buttons what became of mr heath nancy inquired ira was born in england an went back there on a visit he died in london his son walt was left in charge here did ira build the castle bess asked salty nodded warming to the story yes heath castle was built to look like one o those fancy english places the gardens were beauti fula sight to set your eyes ablaze with admira tion stone walls everywhere with flowers an vines an all kinds o trees from everywhere in the world nancy was becoming more eager every minute to see the estate but for me salty went on the place is too lonesome no houses close by the old gent built it bout a mile up the river from the button factory walter lived in it too an he used to do some o his scientific experimentin there what kind of experiments nancy asked dont know said salty since walt died no one ever goes near the castle or the factory on harpers inlet harpers inlet nancy repeated thoughtfully someone must have been there yesterday thats right bess agreed we saw a motor boat coming out of the inlet it crashed into our boat queer salty commented i dont know what business anyone would have at the factory who was the fellow thats what we came to ask you nancy re plied she gave a complete account of the incident salty could not identify the man or his boat from her description but he promised to watch tor such a person ill keep an eye out for the boat too he added cant figure what the fellow would be doin there fishins no good there maybe ill run up an have a look satisfied that salty would be able to locate the boat if anyone could nancy and bess thanked him and left as they stepped onto the dock they saw that the weather had changed dark clouds filled the sky and the wind was whipping the river into whitecaps i wanted to visit heath castle today nancy said but it wouldnt be wise to take a boat out now lets do it tomorrow bess suggested then george can go with us nancy said a surprise awaited nancy when she reached home while she and mrs gruen had been away the two rosebushes had been replanted in the garden they were only slightly wilted from hav ing been moved twice oh im so glad joan brought them back nancy declared im sure she wouldnt have taken them if that hooper boy hadnt urged her to nancy was pressing earth firmly about the bushes when her father drove into the garage she stopped her work and ran to greet him mr drew was a distinguishedlooking man tall and handsome im happy youre back from your trip she said hello nancy he smiled hows the gar den better today the rosebushes that were taken day before yesterday are home again the drews went into the house together and nancy told him about the boat the fenimore problems and the mystery of julianas disap pearance dad tell me all you can about ira heath and his son walter she said did you know them only by reputation for years they operated a very successful pearl button factory then the business went to pieces i already know that part nancy said what about heath castle after walter heath died who took charge of the place daniel hector is the executor i believe nancys mind flew to the unpleasant customer in the curio dealers shop the lawyer she asked yes mr drew replied but i must say his sharp practice of law never appealed to me do you think mr hector did everything pos sible to find juliana nancy asked thoughtfully i believe so did you know her i saw her perform many times and admired her dancing very much mr drew replied why she disappeared at the height of her career has always puzzled me apparently she left no clues behind the case was a strange one her father said i guess her fiance was pretty broken up over her disappearance ive always wondered if he might have had something to do with it after a pause he added heath castle might provide a key to the mystery i was thinking the same thing nancy ex claimed with a mysterious twinkle in her eyes tomorrow ill go there and take a look around that castle and those old walls chapter iv the haunted walk shortly after breakfast the following morning nancy bess and george drove to heath castle by studying a map of the area they had dis covered a littleused road which led to the aban doned estate though this woodland route was rough and dusty bess preferred it to another boat trip hope we dont get a flat tire nancy re marked maneuvering the car to avoid jagged rocks how much farther is it george peered at the odometer and noted that they had traveled about five miles from the out skirts of river heights were coming to something she exclaimed a moment later through the trees the girls caught a fleeting glimpse of a tall tower the car rounded a sharp curve blotting it from view then the road ended abruptly in front of a high vinecovered stone wall the front boundary of the estate bess an nounced theres the name heath castle on the gate nancy jumped from the car and led the girls to the iron gate it was fastened by a heavy iron chain secured by a huge padlock the key i have wont open this padlock nancy said its tor the front door who put the padlock on bess asked probably daniel hector the executor george replied whoever it was is determined to keep every one out nancy said thoughtfully how do we get in bess asked over the top commando style george urged lucky we wore jeans nancy and bess looked with misgivings at the sharp iron spikes of the high rusty gate i dont like the idea of climbing over that there must be an easier way to get in nancy said her gaze roving along the crumbling ivy covered wall the girls walked alongside for some distance finally they came to a spot which was a bit lower than the gate and offered good toe holds it was not difficult for them to grasp vines and pull themselves to the top bess was reluctant to go but decided to follow the three friends leaped down on the other side of the wall and started through the dense growth of trees and shrubs it was damp and cool beneath the canopy of leaves there were many eerie noises as they progressed bess said she felt very uneasy listen she commanded tensely whats that the cooing of a pigeon nancy replied come along or well all have the jitters just ahead stretched a long avenue of oak trees which the girls thought might lead to the castle they tramped through the waisthigh grass and came to a vinetangled fernmatted bower two handsome stone vases lay on their sides broken apparently rain water had filled them and frozen during the winter bursting the vases what a shame this place is being neglected nancy commented pausing a moment mr hector ought to take care of it surely there must be money in mr heaths estate set aside for that purpose if juliana should come back she would hardly recognize the place at the end of the oaklined avenue the girls came to a weatherstained loggia of stone its four handsomely carved pillars rose to support a balcony over which vines trailed steps led to the upper part after mounting to the balcony nancy and her friends obtained a fine view of the nearby gar dens they had been laid out in formal sections each one bounded by a stone wall or an un trimmed hedge here and there were small cir cular pools now heavy with lichens and moss and fountains with leaffilled basins over the treetops about half a mile away the girls could see two stone towers thats the castle said george amid the wild growth nancy spotted a bridge lets go that way she suggested starting down from the balcony in a few minutes the trio had crossed the rick ety wooden span before them lay a slippery moss grown path the haunted walk nancy read aloud the name on a rustic sign why not try another approach bess said with a shiver this garden looks spooky enough without deliberately inviting a meeting with ghosts oh come on nancy laughed taking her friend firmly by the arm its only a name be sides the walk may lead to something interest ing spreading lilac bushes canopied the trail their branches caught at nancys hair and clutched at her clothing impatiently she pushed them aside and held back the branches for her friends to pass beneath i wish wed gone some other way bess com plained this is no fun i think it is nancy replied its mysterious here its so her voice trailed away suddenly george and bess glanced at her quickly nancy was staring directly toward a giant evergreen what is it bess demanded fearfully nothing you didnt act as if it were nothing george said to nancy i thought i saw something but i must have been mistaken despite their coaxing nancy would not reveal what had startled her for an instant she thought a pair of penetrating human eyes had been star ing at the girls from behind the evergreen then they had blinked shut and vanished it must have been my imagination nancy told herself she walked on hurriedly as bess and george sensed her thoughts they drew closer to the young detective nancy rounded the evergreen and saw that it partially hid a vinecovered decay ing summerhouse the building was empty but her eye quickly caught a slight quivering of the vines beside the doorway although there was no wind she stopped short struck by the realization that someone had been lurking there quietly she told the others i knew we shouldnt have chosen this walk bess muttered it is haunted haunted by a human being nancy said grimly i wish i knew who was spying on us there was no sign of anyone now the girls heard neither the rustle of leaves nor the sound of retreating footsteps lets go back to the car bess proposed sud denly weve seen enough of this place i havent nancy said im getting more curious every minute not far from the summerhouse was a stone wall it occurred to nancy that the person who had observed them might have scrambled over it to avoid detection she announced her intention of climbing up to make sure while bess and george watched uneasily nancy began to scale the vinecovered wall near the top however she lost her footing with a suppressed cry she fell backward george and bess helped nancy to her feet al though uninjured she was visibly shaken i guess id better not try that again she said ruefully those are the most sensible words ive heard you say today bess declared lets get out of here before we find ourselves in real trouble im with you george said i have an ap pointment in town and anyway it may rain nancy was reluctant to leave the estate without exploring the castle but she had noticed that clouds were darkening the sky all right she agreed but well come back the girls retraced their way across the bridge from that point on however they could not find the right direction to the road were probably a long way from the car george said finally ill climb a tree and see if i can spot it nimble as a monkey she went high among the branches then she shouted down that the river was close by and the road far away weve wandered a great distance from where we started george reported as she slid down the tree and pointed out the route we must cut straight through that woods ahead are you sure we wont get hopelessly lost bess asked just follow me nancy and bess were quite willing to have george lead the way she pushed ahead con fidently tramping down the high grass and thrust ing aside thorny bushes but as the going became more difficult her pace slackened it seems to me were moving in a wide circle nancy said at last george paused to catch her breath her gloomy silence confirmed nancys suspicion george are we lost she asked i dont know about you the girl answered ruefully myselfyes its going to rain any minute too bess said sinking down on a mossy log oh why did we come to this horrible gloomy place imagine any one building a home here if the roads were opened and some shrubs cut down the estate would be very lovely nancy pointed out after resting for a few minutes the girls decided to continue their trek nancy proved a better pathfinder than george and before long they came to recently trampled grass now i know where we are nancy ex claimed jubilantly were near the front bound ary wall a few hundred feet farther on they saw the wall itself and scrambled over it the trio reached the shelter of the car just as the first raindrops splashed against the windshield fortunately nancy was able to drive to the paved highway before the side road became a mire of mud she dropped the cousins at their houses then went home over a late lunch of milk and a sandwich she thought about the mystery i might get some kind of a lead from walter heaths will she decided and id like to find out where juliana did her banking there might be a clue in the last withdrawals nancy called lieutenant masters the police couldnt locate any bank accounts the officer told her a very large sum of money was found in julianas apartment in new york but she had several bills from stores and by the time they were paid from this cash there was nothing left then thats a dead end said nancy how about the will i dont know said the officer she agreed to meet nancy the next morning at the courthouse to examine the document daniel hector was named as sole executor a quick reading confirmed what mrs feni more had told her the entire heath estate had been bequeathed to juliana johnson on the con dition that she claim it within five years of wal ter heaths death one clause in the will held nancys attention it read it is my belief and hope that juliana still lives and will claim the property within the allotted time she will be able to identify herself in a special way thus insuring that no impostor can receive my estate i wonder what that means nancy mused i havent any idea lieutenant masters said they went over the document again but it gave no clue to the way in which juliana might establish her identity i must find out what mr heath meant by this said nancy obviously its a very impor tant duel chapter v suspicious figures nancy suggested to lieutenant masters that they go at once to see mrs fenimore she may know by what special means walter heath expected juliana to identify herself the young officer agreed she and nancy drove to the fenimore house in their own cars they found the woman seated in the living room good morning mrs fenimore who seemed to be feeling better greeted the visitors warmly she stared anxiously at the policewoman its its not joan again no in fact my two rosebushes have been re turned we came to ask you a few more questions about your sister nancy replied the woman relaxed but spoke wearily ill tell you everything i can a couple of years ago i gave up hope that she would be found but ive never told joan this then you believe that your sister may not be living nancy asked soberly oh no im sure julie is alive mrs fenimore replied but im afraid she may have disappeared for good and ill never see her again would you give us some personal information about your sister lieutenant masters asked kindly was she younger than you no julie was seven years older our parents died when we were children and we lived with an aunt who was pretty strict i never minded aunt matties scolding but julie who was high strung resented it she took dancing lessons secretly and when aunt mattie found out and punished her for it julie ran away for several years julie danced wherever she could get an engagement and studied during her spare moments the policewoman asked did you see juliana often after she became famous only now and then but she called me every week i was so excited when she became engaged to walter heath it was to be kept from the press so of course i told no one could anything have happened between juli ana and mr heath to make her unhappy enough to disappear nancy asked mrs fenimore shook her head julie was beautiful and talented he was handsome wealthy and kind they adored each other im sure he had nothing to do with her disappearance mention of the deceased estate owner reminded nancy of the real purpose of her call she asked mrs fenimore about the strange identification clause in the will i wondered myself what that meant when i read it the woman replied do you think daniel hector might have an answer nancy asked mrs fenimores face darkened please dont mention that mans name i detest him all these years hes only been pretending to search for julie pretending once in a while he would call to tell me about his attempts to find her but they sounded half hearted now he doesnt even phone im sure hes stopped trying im counting on you nancy to solve the mystery nancy promised to do everything she could to trace the missing dancer secretly she wondered if she could find the woman in time to save the inheritance for her may i see a photograph of your sister she requested i have a number of excellent ones mrs feni more replied ill give you one theyre in the drawer of this table she took them out there were six taken years suspicious figures before when the dancer was at the height of her career several were inscribed with her name and a greeting the face was a distinctive one care fully nancy noted the perfect features the beauti ful dark eyes the straight nose and firm chin julie may have changed a great deal since i last saw her mrs fenimore remarked ten years have gone by your sister is lovely nancy commented joan looks a little like her yes she does and certainly my daughter has julies vivacious ways shes quite a little actress maybe someday mrs fenimore looked sadly into space lieu tenant masters fearing the conversation had up set the woman said they must leave please try not to worry nancy urged mrs fenimore who handed her a photograph as they said goodby when she and the officer reached their cars nancy thanked lieutenant masters for her help call on me any time the young woman said as she drove off nancy decided to take a walk and think about the case as she wandered up the street children were coming home from school to lunch she saw joan playing with an older boy in a vacant lot they were tossing a ball for a dog to retrieve that boy looks familiar nancy thought as she walked over to the children suddenly in a fit of temper the boy hit the dog with a stick cut it out he shouted youre chewing my ball to pieces joan screamed stop that nancy ordered the dog hasnt hurt your ball he was only playing the boy gazed at her with hard unfriendly eyes is he your dog he asked impudently no then its none of your business if i hit him nancy started to reply but it was not neces sary the dog dropped the ball and slunk off the boy picked it up then giving nancy a baleful look he ran away nancy took joan by the hand and led her off as tactfully as possible she suggested that the child ought to find a girl playmate teddy hoopers okay hes the only one that lives close to me joan replied skipping happily along beside her companion i dont like him when hes mean but most of the time hes a lot of fun he always thinks up exciting things to do youd better hurry home to lunch nancy said ill go with you my cars there when they reached the house joan hugged nancy then ran inside nancy was sure she had made a firm friend of the little girl im not far from saltys the young detec tive said to herself ill drive there and find out if he has seen that man who crashed into our boat in a little while she came to the clam diggers home the sailor was on the shore repairing his rowboat well now me lass im glad to see you he said but im afraid i havent got good news you mean about the boat ive looked high an low for that damaged boat the man said regretfully its not tied up anywhere along here how about harpers inlet nancy asked salty admitted he had not been there too busy he explained maybe ill go this after noon i need a mess o clams an there be some up the inlet you want to come along ill show you the heath factory for nancy the opportunity was too good to pass up she was eager to visit the spot just tell me when to be here she said after settling on three oclock she remarked ill bring along one of my friends nancy hurried home for a quick lunch then telephoned george promptly at three oclock the two girls met salty at the waterfront ill put ye to work the sailor chuckled as he gathered together his fishing and clamming equipment help me load these into the row boat will you the old mans muscular arms rippled as he dug the oars into the tranquil waters of the muskoka river presently he and his passengers were skimming along at a rapid rate behind the craft trailed a long copper wire which gleamed in the sunlight im trollin for my dinner tonight salty ex plained theres somethin yankin on my line right now i do believe he rested the oars and pulled in the line fi nally a fourpound speckled bass flopped into the boat shes a beauty he said grinning while the girls kept the craft from drifting downstream salty removed the hook from the fish and dropped his catch into a woven basket then he wound up the copper troll line and put it away fishins not much good in the inlet he re marked but well find clams the upper river was very still as the boat entered harpers inlet some time later there was no sound except the occasional chirping of a bird nancy hunched low now and then to avoid the overhanging bushes and watched the coves for a hidden boat there was none it doesnt look as if were goin to find your friend salty remarked after he had rowed a quarter of a mile upstream were almost to heaths button factory now ill anchor here the man had located a bed of clams in the shallow water he asked the girls to balance his fish basket on the gunwale then waded in to dig the clams from the mud and sand with his rake as he tossed them one by one he kept singing snatches of familiar sea songs baskets full nancy called several minutes later salty got into the boat and started off again as they rounded a bend the girls saw a large square building set some distance back from the shore the banks nearby were littered with dis carded bits of clamshells thats the heath button factory salty said shes sure gone to pieces nancy gazed curiously at the neglected brick structure vines which had grown up the build ings walls lay thick on the shingle roof and all the windows were broken suddenly nancy spotted two figures near the factory entrance as they vanished into the build ing salty pointed to an object hidden near some bushes a boat he exclaimed and her prows damaged too the bow of the boat had been drawn up on the sand nancy and george recognized it immedi ately as the blueandwhite craft that had struck themi oh salty please pull in herel nancy begged as he did she told him about the men humph salty grunted ill bet ye a mess o clams they aint got no right in there nancy nodded i want to talk to them will you stay here near the damaged boat if the men come out try to hold them until we get back the sailor did not like being left out of the search but before he could protest the girls were splashing through kneedeep water to shore chapter vi a mysterious explosion nancy and george had to cross a stretch of low marshy land in order to reach the old button factory their sneakers already watersoaked be came caked with mud the girls were grateful for the high wild grass that screened their approach you know nancy said those two men looked familiar who are they im not sure but one of them was thin and wore a blue cap like the fellow who crashed into our motorboat the other resembled daniel hector the lawyer while still twenty yards from the factory the girls were startled to hear the sound of hammer ing the pounding noise came from inside the building i wonder what those men are doing in there nancy said cautiously pulling aside the tall vines maybe theyre workmen who were sent to re pair the place george replied nancy offered no comment it was possible that daniel hector had brought another man to the property either to inspect it or to do some work but she seriously doubted this as the girls moved closer the hammering ceased though they waited several minutes it did not resume we may have been seen by the men nancy said i hope they havent left when george and nancy had pushed through to the end of the marsh they saw that the front door to the factory stood wide open nancy peered inside a long corridor opened into several of fices and led to a large workroom at the rear no one was in sight as the girls started along the hallway they heard retreating footsteps they glanced out a dirtsmudged window and noticed two men run ning in the direction of the river oh nancy george exclaimed they must have heard us theyre going to their boat nancy said ex citedly already the men were well hidden by the high marsh grass the girls ran quickly toward a rear door with nancy far in the lead as they neared it deafening sounds of an explosion filled the air the walls of the factory rocked a huge amount of plaster crashed down between the girls nancy george cried out in panic as she gazed at the high pile of debris that separated them one whole corridor wall had caved in nancy must be buried underneath it george thought in horror the air was thick with white dust coughing and choking george frantically began to pull away boards and chunks of plaster in the meantime the two men who had paused in the tall grass were just about to go back to the factory when they heard someone running up the path salty fearful for the girls safety was racing toward the building clam rake over his shoulder he passed within a few feet of the men but did not see them oh dear oh dear he kept mumbling i hope nothins happened to the lassies he found george still digging feverishly at the pile of debris salty the girl cried i cant find nancy she must be buried the old man began raking furiously at the pile of plaster that blocked the corridor at that mo ment nancy was lying stunned on the floor of a closet some distance from where her friends were working the force of the explosion had hurled her into the large storage closet then the door had slammed shut the corridor ceiling had fallen sealing off the entrance to the closet when she regained consciousness nancy found herself in total darkness and wondered where she was slowly the dazed girl got to her feet and felt around her prison at last she found a door and tried it it would not budge and there was no other exit whatll i do she thought and where is george suddenly nancy heard her name being called with all her strength she pushed against the door it yielded slightly through the crack she shouted george nancy where are you came a muffled reply here in the closet salty and george leaped across the rubble with the rake and their hands and feet they cleared away enough of the debris to free nancy as she squeezed outside salty mumbled thank goodness youre alive george embraced her friend in excited relief you feel all right i think so what caused the explosion suddenly nancy recalled the two men who had run from the building what became of those men who were in here did you see them salty the clam digger shook his head i saw no one nancy george and salty plunged through the marsh grass toward the riverbank the damaged motorboat was no longer there those rascals sneaked away drat em salty muttered in disgust do you think that makes em guilty nancy guilty on two counts the girl replied guilty of damaging the boat i rented and most likely guilty of causing the explosion but why set off an explosion george asked nancy shrugged she did not want to mention any of her theories just yet but it occurred to her that daniel hector may have been covering up some incriminating evidence against himself mrs fenimore had vehemently declared that she did not trust the lawyer during the trip back to saltys dock the clam digger and the girls kept their eyes open for the blueandwhite motorboat but they did not see it ill be glad to take ye on a trip again the amiable man offered when they reached river heights nancy thanked him on the way home she was thoughtful and could hardly wait for the moment when she could talk to her father in his den after dinner she told about daniel hectors apparent connection with the explosion at the heath but ton factory but why would hector want to damage prop erty hes obligated to look after mr drew asked it doesnt make sense im sure theres a great deal more to the heath case than julianas disappearance nancy de clared the explosion today for example there may be something pretty sinister in back of it all i agree with you mr drew said soberly nancy i know its useless to ask you to give up trying to solve a mystery oh it is dad at least i can ask you to be careful remem ber youre my one and only daughter ill keep it in mind she said hugging him affectionately now about the heath affair isnt it possible that hector has been investigating the property himself hoping to discover the due walter heath mentioned in his will you mean the one by which juliana can iden tify herself beyond all doubt yes dad if a dishonest person stumbled upon that clue it might be possible for him to have an impostor claim the fortune that wouldnt be so easy nancy a number of persons knew juliana but nancy countered if she has been through a terrible experience of some kind she could have changed so much even her own sister wouldnt recognize her true i follow your reasoning nevertheless any woman who put in a claim would have to satisfy the court that it was a just one nancy glanced steadily at her father do you think mr hector has really tried to find juliana if he isnt honest nancy i dont like to think the man would be involved in anything underhanded i dont ap prove of his methods in handling law cases but there is no proof that he has actually done any thing dishonest but you admit nancy said that the heath case looks suspicious yes i do nancy his daughter went on ive even thought that maybe juliana is being held a prisoner some where mr drew looked surprised in the castle who knows nancy replied dad i cant decide where to begin looking for her the ex plosion today kind of changed my plans in what way i heard that walter heath made scientific ex periments at his estate if mr hector suspects theres a secret within those crumbling walls mr drew gazed at nancy young lady youre leading up to something he declared with a twinkle in his eye out with it im only trying to arouse your curiosity nancy confessed with a laugh why not go to the factory with me you may find a clue i over looked i need your help dad well if you put it that way her father said actually i havent the time to spare but ill go to please you tomorrow morning then so soon dad dont forget i must solve this mystery in three weeks chapter vii a puzzling message nancy and her father were up early the next morning they hastily made breakfast before hannah came downstairs then drove to the lane mr drew knew led to the damaged button fac tory the road was in very bad condition and there was no gate i see why those men came by boat said mr drew stopping the car some distance from the building well walk from here nancy led the way through the dewladen grass to the scene of the explosion there was no sign of anyone near the factory the explosion did a good job of destruction the lawyer commented as the drews cautiously en tered the building heres where the wall caved in between george and me nancy explained looks as if it might have been dynamited her father remarked lets see if we can find any evidence for the next half hour father and daughter scrambled among the rubble when they discov ered nothing of importance in the corridor they decided to investigate the large workroom at the rear it was necessary to go outside and climb in through a window to reach the room because the inside entrance was blocked oh its like a ghost town nancy said as she surveyed the rusted machinery covered with lay ers of dust to think that this once was a pros perous factory dad she pointed what was this machine used for cutting her father explained the mollusk shell is placed inside an operator moves a lever and down comes the circular steel saw presto a little shell disk drops into the hopper another machine slices the disk into pieces of uniform thickness and there you have some pearl but tons how clever said nancy the buttons pass through still another ma chine which polishes them mr drew went on in the last operation thread holes are drilled through them dad look nancy cried suddenly a scrap of torn paper was sticking from a comer of the rubble in the doorway near it in a thick layer of dust were several footprints nancy picked up the paper which had part of a message on it the writing was bold and read dear c some cret which i in a wall famous worthy interesting mr drew commented scanning the paper but i cant say that it makes much sense the footprints might be a better clue he stooped to examine them freshly made no doubt he said perhaps the two men have visited here since the explosion if so it proves theyre searching for some thing they think was hidden and could be found only by blasting it out not necessarily the explosion could have been an accident or was set off for some other purpose and may have nothing to do with juli anas inheritance mr drew remarked nancy was staring at the torn note i believe ive stumbled upon a worthwhile clue just the same im sure the partially missing word is se cret she pocketed the message and reluctantly left the factory with her father at home later on nancy spent more than an hour trying to figure out the missing words of the note who had written them the paper appeared old the ink slightly faded it wouldnt surprise me if walter heath had written this she told hannah gruen i know how you might find out the house keeper said how walter heath was a member of the river heights historical society before his death im sure the society has specimens of his handwrit ing hannah youre a genius nancy cried giv ing the woman a hug im off to the historical society this very minute luck was with the young detective on labels books and pieces of furniture which walter heath had given to the organizations museum she found several samples of the deceased estate owners handwriting its the same as that in the note nancy ob served excitedly now if only i can find the miss ing part of the message but daniel hector may have the rest nancy decided to seek her fathers aid once more and asked him to talk to the lawyer about the heath case carson drew did and then re ported to his daughter hector certainly was reluctant to discuss the case didnt he tell you anything nancy asked nothing worth mentioning as soon as i spoke of heath castle and the button factory he dosed up as tight as saltys clams did you mention julianas name yes mr hector stressed that he was still searching for her the heath castle mystery was no nearer a solu tion than before eager as nancy was to revisit the estate that afternoon she found it impossible her father had made her promise not to go there alone neither bess nor george was free to ac company her until the next day the next day after sunday church services the three girls set out in nancys car carrying a picnic lunch on the way nancy explained the latest developments in the mystery she added nothing must drive us away from the castle grounds until weve investigated every nook and corner soon the familiar ivycovered front boundary wall loomed ahead nancy parked beneath a cool tunnel of overhanging trees the car was well hidden she and her friends got out and walked to the rusty gate and peered between the bars the grounds seemed as deserted as ever but suddenly the girls heard dogs barking listen nancy exclaimed an instant later she added theyre inside the grounds and coming closer bess said nervously that settles it we cant possibly go in now she wanted to return to the car but george and nancy lingered reluctant to leave soon they glimpsed two large blackandwhite hounds dangerouslooking brutes george com mented evidently theyve been left here on guard when the dogs saw the intruders they barked louder than ever one of them came to the gate growled fiercely at nancy and clawed the iron bars with his front paws instead of retreating she spoke soothingly to him hello old fellow when did you come to live here to the amazement of bess the animal began to wag his tail nancy reached a hand through the gate and patted his head be careful bess warned sharply the other dog had stopped barking and now came forward too nancy stroked his head these dogs are not vicious she said girls im sure we can explore the grounds safely im willing to try if you are george said bess was afraid of the dogs but agreed to go ill climb over first nancy said if they dont attack me you two follow george and bess watched uneasily as their friend climbed the crumbling wall on the ledge she hesitated a moment the dogs had set up a loud barking again nancy realized that although the animals had been friendly to her on the op posite side of the enclosure there was no guaran tee they would let her enter the grounds dont attempt it bess called nancy spoke gently but firmly to the hounds then taking a chance she lowered herself gradu ally one of the dogs leaped up to her nancys heart began to beat wildly but she showed no fear easy boy she murmured to her relief the animal became friendly once more its all right nancy called to her friends and continued to pat the hounds she talked to them as george climbed the wall and leaped down the dogs did not make a fuss as soon as besss head appeared however they began to snarl theyll leave you alone if you dont show any fear nancy assured her but it was impossible for bess to do this go on without me she said after two vain attempts ill wait in the car all right nancy agreed adding with a grin dont eat up all the lunch while were gone she and george set off the dogs remained be hind soon the girls located the avenue of trees which led to the loggia heres a path that may go to the castle nancy said as they came to a forked trail maybe george smiled but heres a sign that reads to the goblin gallery lets see where it goes nancy urged they passed a finely chiseled statuette in a wall niche lingered a moment to gaze at a rose garden choked with weeds then went on to a clearing before them rose an artistic structure the sides were formed of slender twisted stone columns while sprawling over them was a roof of un trimmed vines supported by thick stalks how pretty nancy said dreamily george surveying the gallery closely remarked practically it looks as if father time has taken over here instead of the goblins those stone columns might tumble down any minute remarking that she was amazed stone could be damaged so greatly by weather nancy stooped to inspect the base of one of the pillars george she exclaimed suddenly someone has deliber ately tampered with these columns see the marks theyve been weakenedprobably with a pickax why would anyone do that george asked as the girls looked over the other columns nancy told george about the note she had found at the heath button factory and the word in a wall im sure someone is searching various walls of that old building for an article of value she said but why try to destroy these lovely columns maybe the person didnt find what he wanted in the walls and was looking in the columns george was not listening attentively to her friend instead she was gazing down the path as if transfixed what do you see nancy asked in a low voice george motioned toward the bushes its an old man she whispered hes pointing his fin ger at something ahead of us nancy was startled too when she saw the man amid the heavy shrubbery her pulse quickened as she moved toward the figure nearing it she laughed softly why its only a lifesize statue george embarrassed her friend went over to inspect the figure that pointing finger might have a special significance nancy said noting the path ahead lets see where this takes us the trail had been nearly obliterated by weeds it twisted in and out among the trees and seemed to lead nowhere the girls were about to turn back when nancy caught a flash of water in sun light the girls made their way through the under growth and came out on the shore of a very large pond dotted with rank grass george hurried ahead to look at it why do you suppose someone pointed the statue to this it doesnt look like any her words ended in a little scream as the soft bank beneath her feet gave way before nancy could grab her george had slipped into the water it was not deep but she was soaked hypers look at me im a mess george cried out and say this water is kind of salty nancy helped her friend scramble up the slip pery bank she gazed about her and noticed a stone house nearby apparently it once had been used as a tool shed go in there and get out of your wet clothes she advised george ill lay them in the sun they shouldnt take long to dry quickly george ducked into the stone house she tossed her slacks shirt and sneakers through an open window nancy spread them on the bank in the sun then started walking around the pond suddenly she noticed something shiny on the bank it was the shell of a whelk how beautiful she thought picking it up the motherofpearl lining gleamed with a blend of delicate pink and purple after a moments hesitation nancy stripped off shoes and socks and waded into the shallow water when she dipped her hands into the sand she dis covered that the bottom was thick with mussels among them were discarded shells with the same lovely blending of colors nearby on the shore she spotted a large pile of cracked shells and went to examine them why are they here she wondered these are seashore whelks then nancy remembered what salty had told her about dye being obtained from this type of shellfish and that walter heath had spent much of his time on scientific experi ments suppose he was using the whelks to make a special kind of dye nancy tucked two unbroken shells into her shirt pocket as she put on her shoes she thought of the hacked stone columns and the explosion at the factory someone may be looking for a secret connected with walter heaths experiments nancy george called are my clothes dry nancy rose and felt them not yet im getting hungry george complained and bess will have a fit if we dont go back soon at that moment bess was fuming in nancys concealed car as the sun climbed high overhead and the girls failed to return she became hun gry and annoyed guess theyve forgotten me she thought to add to her irritation the hounds would dash back to the gate whenever she walked over to look through it they bayed savagely oh bess fretted wait until i see nancy and george ill just then she heard a car coming up the road bess barely had time to hide herself in the bushes before it swung around the bend she was glad that she had followed her instinct for she was sure from nancys description that the driver was daniel hector he was alone the lawyer stopped in front of the gate but did not shut off the engine he got out of his two door car leaving the door on his wide open hes going to drive into the grounds bess thought nancy and george will be caught i must warn them her anxiety mounting bess tried to think what to do mr hector still had his back turned toward her as he unlocked the big gates the car was less than ten feet away from her hiding place there was little time for bess to think or plan impulsively she darted to the car after climbing into the back she crouched on the floor hector returned to the automobile unaware of his passenger he drove through the opening into the estate grounds chapter viii locked in george would you mind if i do a little explor ing nancy asked ill be back by the time your clothes are dry okay george called im not going far ive found some whelk shells and i think they may indicate something important maybe dye made from them is hidden in containers nearby theyre not in here george said nancy moved off looking about carefully for any possible place where dye might have been stored she found none and in her search wan dered farther than she had intended nancy paused abruptly as she became aware of a low rumble which shook the earth whats that she wondered she stood still and waited for more sounds but there were none in the distance however a cloud of white powdery dust caught her attention another explosion she murmured excitedly cautiously nancy went toward the area but soon her path was blocked by a high brier hedge after following the bushes some distance to find an opening the young detective was startled to hear a car somebody with a key to the gate padlock must have driven into the estate grounds she thought as the sound drew nearer nancy decided to find out who was coming she plunged through the woodland and reached a weedgrown clearing just as daniel hector drove up and stopped nancy backed quickly into the shelter of the bushes the lawyer did not see her he parked his car under a gnarled maple got out and set off on foot ill follow him nancy decided mr hector walked so fast that she could scarcely keep him in sight he seemed thoroughly acquainted with the layout of the trails for he never hesitated when he came to a turn before long the man vanished from view when nancy came to a fork in the path she wondered which way he had gone fearful she would lose track of him entirely nancy pressed her ear to the ground and very faintly could dis cern a steady beat to her right she hastened on presently the trail branched off in three direc tions again nancy was baffled when she flat tened herself on the ground this time she could hear nothing ive lost him she thought in dismay nancy chose a path at random and went on doggedly she was so intent on her sleuthing she completely forgot about george and bess meanwhile bess still hidden in daniel hec tors car was wondering what to do id better find george and nancy she decided she cautiously climbed out and started up the trail the lawyer had taken bess had not gone far when the dogs began to bark they were coming closer each moment theyve picked up my scent bess was in a panic the hounds leaped into view in terror bess shinned up a tree and hoped the dogs would pass by instead they took up a vigil at the base of the trunk by this time george had grown tired of wait ing for nancy to return to the tool house from the window she could see her clothes apparently dry on the sunny bank of the pond i cant wait another minute she thought im patiently ill get them myself george went to the door and stopped short a boy in faded overalls had emerged from among the trees he seemed to be eleven or twelve years old george slipped out of sight behind the door and watched him he suddenly snatched up her clothes and hurried off hey you those are mine george cried angrily from the window the boy paid no attention hypers george thought in despair now whatll i do nancys done a disappearing act and im stranded here without any clothes nancy unaware of her friends problems was intent on another subject the trail she had chosen had not led her to daniel hector but to heath castle she could not resist the temptation to see the wonderful building at close range its beauty even at a distance awed her it was constructed of massive gray stone covered with ivy the roof line was broken by several turrets a large one at each end of the residence with smaller ones in between its a perfect copy of an old english castle nancy thought only smaller curious she began to circle the castle walls what a pity this stately home has to stand in the midst of ruined gardens she mused a massive side door of the big house stood ajar nancy wondered if mr hector had opened it quietly she slipped inside she found herself in a long corridor which twisted and turned crazily large rooms lined with beautiful paneled wood opened from it many were empty others contained a few pieces of fine old mahogany furniture at a glance it was apparent to nancy that nearly everything of value had been removed from the place odd she said to herself i thought the castle was left to juliana intact did thieves break in or did hector sell the furniture the inside wooden shutters in the gloomy rooms were closed lending a ghostly appearance to the few sheetdraped chairs the unexpected sight of herself in a long mirror gave nancy a start before long she found steps leading to the sec ond floor a search of the rooms there including the many closets revealed nothing of special in terest the only places left to visit are the towers nancy thought but how do i get into them she could locate no entrance then glancing from a window she realized that the castle was built around a hollow square which was another tangled garden nancy figured that some of the smaller turrets actually were bedrooms the high towers must be separate with doors opening from the courtyard nancy hurried down the stairway to hunt for an exit to the inner garden at length she found a door in the shadows of the corridor after trip ping the bolt so she would not lock herself out nancy stepped into the sunshine she glanced around and discovered that her guess had been right there were entrance doors to the two high round towers she opened the one on her left it held one room which had a low ceiling and contained nothing the walls how ever had been chipped and damaged even the castle hasnt escaped the hackers nancy mused she turned her attention to the other tower glad that the massive door to it was unlocked it was hollow and only dimly lighted by a high window a circular iron stairway led to a small balcony at the top nancy looked around on the ground floor but saw nothing of interest she climbed up and found a little door at the head of the stairway cautiously pushing on it she peered beyond as her eyes became accustomed to the somber light she saw that there was nothing in the tiny room nor on the open parapet beyond it in dis appointment nancy leaned on the wide rail all this work just to get a view she thought but at least i have an idea of the layout suddenly her attention focused on a figure running far in the distance a boy had moved to ward the wall and was carrying a bundle under his arm just before he disappeared from sight be hind tall trees he dropped something it looked like a pair of slacks oh my goodness nancy thought with a fear ful pang of conscience maybe he stole georges clothes i should never have left her alone at the tool house and the boy looked like teddy hooper the youngster appeared again but this time outside the walls running across the beach to ward a boat there must be a way out besides the main gate nancy thought since the boy was much too far away for her to call him she quickly retraced her steps to the courtyard door below when she tried to pull it open the door would not budge she yanked and yanked finally she realized that somebody must have locked it she tried the key she had to the castle but it did not fit she was a prisoner in the tower oh i must get out she murmured nancy refused to panic and told herself there must be some way to escape she returned to the open parapet and looked about it was a fortyfoot drop to the ground and there was no possible way to climb down the tower wall thoroughly discouraged nancy went to try the locked door again as she twisted the knob vainly she heard voices her heart leaped two men were outside well get caught i tell you one was arguing in a loud voice and if we do the old manll say he never saw us before nancy wondered if the old man might be hector oh quit worrying the other man growled just leave the brainwork of this job to me well find that clue yet its somewhere in one of the walls of the estate yeah which wall the first man asked sar castically the place is full of them anyhow im satisfied with what weve found and kept when he sees all the walls weve blasted he cant say we didnt do a pretty thorough job for him the other snickered the voices faded out and nancy assumed that the two speakers had moved away who were they their voices had been unfamiliar well a few of my theories are confirmed any way nancy said to herself the walls of heath castle and the gardens have been damaged de liberately and on orders from a person who wants to find a valuable secret nancy hoped to catch a glimpse of the men and returned to the parapet she did not see them but a moment later heard them whistling and calling to the dogs then all became quiet theyve gone nancy thought in relief maybe i should have let them know i was in here when i had the chance but no theyre not honest and they probably would have ruined all my plans ill get out somehow nancy was in a predicament nevertheless george stranded without clothes at the tool house could not help her bess she assumed was still waiting in the parked car outside the castle gate nancy roved restlessly about the ground floor of the tower in her vain search for an exit look ing at her watch for the first time the imprisoned girl was amazed to discover that it was after four oclockand she was hungry by this time bess and george must be pretty annoyed with me she thought guiltily while nancy worried bess was perched in a tree a considerable distance from the castle sur rounded by the watchful dogs she would not descend for fear they might tear her to pieces badly shaken and near tears she suddenly heard a whistle the dogs pricked up their ears then raced away thank goodness bess gasped sliding down from her leafy prison so much time had elapsed she decided it would do no good to look for nancy and george if they had not encountered mr hector already they surely would have returned to the car ill go back there bess concluded but which way hopelessly confused she started off after a while bess came to the estate wall just ahead of her she noticed something in the grass georges slacks bess thought with a start there was no sign of either her cousin or nancy bess could not believe that they had gone for a swim as she picked up the slacks she won dered apprehensively what had happened this path seems to run along the wall bess said to herself if i take it i should get back to the gate eventually but she found that the trail changed direction instead of the main gate she reached a large pond oh where am i bess fretted desperately suddenly she heard her name called she whirled around no one was in sight a few yards away stood a stone tool house its window hidden by overhanging branches bess george shouted impatiently over here im in the tool house bess hastened to the small building and looked inside ive been stranded here for hours george fumed how did you lose your clothes i fell into the water and took them off to dry nancy put them on the bank then she went off to do some exploring a boy came along and ran away with my things how terrible what became of nancy i wish i knew shes been gone a long while but tell me how did you get up your courage to climb the wall when bess told of her secret ride with hector george burst into laughter despite her worry about nancy then she sobered hector is on the grounds maybe nancy ran into him the cousins were not sure what they should do finally bess said lets go back to the car nancy might be there how can i go anywhere like this george cried bess handed the girl her slacks i found these by the wall the boy must have dropped them and you can wear my sweater ill be warm enough in my blouse george put on the clothes and was relieved to find her sneakers still lying near the bank of the pond the girls hurried off without meeting anyone or being attacked by the dogs they managed to find their way to the front wall and climbed over nancy was not in the car lets drive to town and get help bess said nancy has the car keys oh id forgotten well we are in an awful mess well have to find nancy thats all there is to it bess declared each of the girls ate a sandwich from the picnic lunch then started to scale the wall again on the ledge they hesitated the dogs had come back and began to growl fiercely maybe if we feed them george said she got the rest of the sandwiches from the car at the sight of the food the hounds became friendly but the instant they had gobbled it up they lay down on the ground panting again and again george tried to descend but each time the dogs rose menacingly bess would not even try to reenter the grounds its no use she said i suppose youre right george said and jumped down on the outside tell you what bess said you stay here and ill go for help chapter ix trap door for hours nancy had refused to acknowledge that there was no means of escape from the tower she had pried at the lock with a nail file from her bag she had tried to break the door panels by sheer force but their strength had defied her now she wandered aimlessly about the dimly lighted circular room hungry and thirsty she grew more and more desperate what had become of george and bess in utter dismay nancy realized that she had the car keys with her she sank down on the bottom step of the wind ing iron staircase to try to figure things out staring straight ahead at the dusty wooden floor she thought this is the worst trap ive ever been in suddenly she became aware of something in the floor a tiny crack outlined a space about three feet square because of the gloom and dust she had not noticed it before speaking of traps nancy muttered maybe this is a trap door quickly she dropped to her hands and knees and inspected the crack obviously it marked the outline of an opening but there was no ring or handle with which to pull up the wood nancy pried at first with her fingers then with the nail file the slender bit of steel snapped in her hands oh how can i get this door open she thought looking for something heavier there was not a single object in the tower room after a while she sighed in despair the room seemed to be growing stuffy or was it be cause she felt almost ill from hunger her tongue parched and her head aching she slowly climbed the stairs and went out on the parapet for some fresh air the sky became overcast in a short time it would be almost dark except for the occasional hoot of an owl and the intermittent croaking of frogs there was no sound then suddenly nancy heard approaching foot steps her first impulse was to shout but intu ition warned her to remain silent cautiously she looked over the parapet a man was unlocking the door far below her he snapped on a flashlight and entered the tower nancys heart pounded should she walk boldly down the stairs and try to bluff her way out no she decided im sure something sinister is going on at heath castle and this man proba bly is involved maybe i can get out of here while hes busy he may have opened that trap door and gone below nancy tiptoed across the little balcony room suddenly a light flashed through the open door way the beam missed her by a fraction of an inch as she shrank into the shadows nancy heard the man coming up the iron staircase with sink ing heart she stepped in back of the door and pressed herself against the wall the intruder went directly to the parapet as nancy peered out he began to flash his light slowly as if he were signaling the backward re flection of the rays dimly revealed his face nancy had never seen this cruellooking man before though the young detective longed to watch what he was doing she dared not linger silently she slipped through the door and darted down the steps upon reaching the courtyard garden she hurried to the arched doorway luckily it was still unlocked nancy groped her way through the dark corri dor in the castle a moment later she bumped her knee into a piece of furniture and struck it so hard that she nearly cried out in pain precious minutes were lost as she carefully felt along walls for a door to the grounds at last her efforts were rewarded with a deep sigh of relief she rushed into the open what an adventure nancy shuddered now if only i can find george and bess nancy made her way back to the tool house it was empty from there she walked toward the main gate but because of weedgrown paths and treacherous rocks it took her quite a while before she saw the vague outline of a wall ahead of her i hope its close to the gate she thought oh something was moving through the bushes in an instant the stillness was broken by the sharp barking of dogs can i make it nancy wondered she leaped for the wall and scrambled up just as the two hounds arrived breathlessly she dropped to the other side five minutes later she came to the car to her amazement and delight george was hud dled on the back seat she was half asleep george the girl sat bolt upright nancy im so sorry i left you nancy apologized then asked wheres bess gone to get your father what in the world happened to you plenty but first tell me what time bess left it seems hours ago its a long walk to a bus or a phone somebody should be here any minute though as the girls sat in the car they told each other their adventures after bess left george concluded i heard a noise in the distance i hid in the bushes near the gate mr hector drove out while he was locking the gate i peeked into his car to see if you were there i really expected you to be lying on the floor bound and gagged i was a prisoner all right but not tied up id like to find the boy who took my clothes george said grimly did you recognize him i never saw him before he was about twelve years old but id like to wring his neck i spotted him from the tower nancy said he looked like teddy hooper but im not sure george changed the subject where do you suppose that man in the tower came from no one besides hector drove in here he must have entered from the beach the way the boy did nancy replied headlights cut the darkness was it carson drew or was daniel hector returning the two girls ducked out of sight the car stopped and bess alighted why george is gone she exclaimed no she isnt her cousin spoke up coming out of hiding nancy was already running to the car from which her father had stepped in an instant she was in his arms why dad youre trembling she said nancy nancy im so glad to see you you gave me such a fright where im sorry i made a mess of things his daugh ter apologized but maybe youll forgive me when you hear what happened tell me about it on the way back bess can drive george and herself home in your car well follow them and you can take the car the rest of the way on the drive to river heights mr drew lis tened to nancys story without comment im convinced she concluded that a group is searching for something at heath castle the walls there arent crumbling from age theyre being tampered with i agree it looks mighty suspicious mr drew said and daniel hector seems to be involved but suppose you put the whole case out of your mind until youve had a square meal upon reaching home nancy went directly to the kitchen hannah gruen who had been nearly beside herself with worry embraced the girl you poor child she said ill fix you a warm supper right away hannah hastened to prepare the meal too hungry to wait nancy helped herself to a glass of milk and a few cookies as she ate and drank she related her adventure to the housekeeper oh nancy mrs gruen sighed your love of mystery will prove your undoing you must be more careful mr drew said i think youd better stay away from heath castle oh dad she protested why not forget the whole affair for a few days but time is so short as it happens im going away on a little trip nancy i thought you might enjoy coming along nancy shook her head if youll excuse me dad i believe id rather stay here and try to solve the mystery of juliana im sorry mr drew said his eyes twinkling i thought hampton might prove of interest to you especially since it was the town where juli ana johnson was advised to go nancy could scarcely believe her ears say that again dad i was talking with dr gibson in henryville today mr drew revealed i learned he was juli anas physician in fact he told her to take the trip from which she never returned tell me more theres not much to tell juliana was thin and rundown so the doctor advised her to take a vacation he suggested she slip off to a quiet place without letting anyone know where she was going did the doctor know where she went no but he had suggested hampton at the time of her disappearance the police tried to lo cate her there but were unsuccessful oh dad i give in nancy said excitedly ill go with you i rather thought you would mr drew said with a smile when do we leave tomorrow morning better pack tonight chapter x in search of a clue when nancy appeared in the kitchen the next morning hannah gruen said cheerily good morning theres a letter for you i think youll want to see right away nancy went to the hall table to get it a glance at the handwriting caused her pulse to quicken the letter was from ned nickerson nancy eagerly opened the envelope she missed her special friend who had gone to south america on a school project ned wrote im doing some interesting work but i miss you and the fun we had solving mys teries ill bet youre head over heels in one this very minute right you are ned nancy smiled happily as she tucked the letter away for another reading mr drew came downstairs and said they should eat at once and then leave nancy sug gested that they stop at mrs fenimores house she wanted to ask a question about juliana all right mr drew agreed mrs fenimore said she was happy to see nancy again and pleased to meet her father were en route to hampton mr drew ex plained ive given your sisters strange disap pearance considerable thought apparently she abandoned her career very suddenly oh juliana loved her work mrs fenimore protested of course she was tired but a few weeks rest should have restored her to good health nancy remarked but after leaving here juli ana never danced againat least not under her own name she may be doing some other kind of work did your sister have any special aptitudes for something besides dancing mrs fenimore shrugged she loved garden ing there was nothing more the woman could tell the drews so nancy and her father said goodby you know the lawyer commented as he led the way to the car juliana may have married but dad she was engaged to walter heath true well perhaps in hampton well find a clue to her disappearance mr drew got into the car nancy was about to follow when she observed a thin sharpfaced woman with unkempt hair hanging clothes in the yard adjoining the fenimore house that must be teddy hoopers mother she thought her attention was not centered on the woman but on the clothes she was pinning to the line a blue shirt looked familiar to nancy if that isnt georges stolen shirt its just like it she decided on impulse she ran over to the yard the woman saw her coming and eyed the girl suspiciously is teddy here nancy inquired no hes at school same as every day nancy asked mrs hooper if teddy liked to go boating on the river all boys play around the water the woman answered then she added quickly he aint been on the river lately though nancy was convinced mrs hooper was not telling the truth thats a lovely shirt she went on aint i got a right to have nice things like other folks the woman demanded defiantly why certainly nancy said evenly but she was still sure the shirt belonged to george you must be another one of those snoopy policewomen teddys mother snapped well i wont talk to you she snatched the shirt from the line and hurried into the house nancy returned to the car and related the con versation to her father i must talk to teddy when we get back she added the drews started for hampton an un expected detour extended the trip by many miles and a lunch with slow service delayed them they did not arrive until twothirty at the hampton motel meet me here at six nancy the lawyer said and drove off the young detective decided there was no use going to the usual places to make inquiries about juliana since the police had investigated them years ago if juliana wanted to live here incognito where would she go nancy asked herself she felt that inconspicuous tourist homes might be the answer she hurried to the chamber of commerce and obtained a list of guesthouses with the photo graph of juliana for identification of the dancer she walked from one house to another some of the owners recognized the woman in the picture but none had rented a room to her finally nancy rang the doorbell of the last place on her list after a few minutes a small grayhaired woman appeared if youre looking for a room im afraid ill have to disappoint you she said before nancy could speak i dont take guests any more i dont want a room nancy replied with a smile i came to ask about someone who might have stayed with you at some time she showed the photograph come in the woman said cordially i think i can help you nancys heart leaped could it be true im mrs delbert the woman said as she led her caller into a neat oldfashioned living room you are nancy drew im a stranger in hampton what name did your guest give you let me think i remember now she was miss flower julia flower is she a friend of yours mrs delbert it she really was the person in this picture she was a famous dancer who dis appeared ten years ago i know her sister it was mrs delberts turn to look shocked my my she said how dreadful it was ten years ago that she was here just one more question did miss flower say where she was going after she left here yes she spoke of staying on a farm between hopewell and plainville but she didnt tell me the name of the people is it far from here nancy asked about thirty miles miss flower said shed take the bus and walk into the farm from the main road all she had was a purse and a small suitcase you have a terrific memory nancy said mrs delbert smiled julia flower was the most beautiful guest i ever had nancy got up and put an arm around the woman thank you so much she said youve been a great help after saying goodby nancy hurried back to the motel and told her father what she had learned youve done well nancy and picked up an excellent clue you should have a reward for that good bit of detecting nancy grinned as a reward will you take me to plainville when you finish your work here yes indeed ill be through by noon to morrow the drews checked out at twelve oclock the next day and drove toward plainville when they came to hopewell nancy suggested they inquire at police headquarters about the missing dancer she spoke to a middleaged sergeant and showed him julianas picture he looked at it thoughtfully and finally said i dont know that this will help you but about ten years ago another officer and i were called on an accident case a young woman had been struck by a car on a side road and was found unconscious and badly bruised hitandrun driver and no wit nesses she was taken to a hospital in plainville no identification or purse or luggage probably stolen mr drew commented she looked a little like the person in this photograph the officer went on a funny thing about the case was when nurses undressed her at the hospital they found several thousands of dol lars on her did the police find out why nancy asked no she insisted she had drawn it from her savings account because she was traveling why dont you stop at the hospital maybe they can answer your questions nancy said she was grateful for this good lead she returned to the car and told her father they set off at once for the hospital the superintendent received them courteously after hearing their story she showed them some old records no one by the name of juliana or julie johnson had been a patient at the institu tion but a julia flower had been only the word traveler had been written in the space for the home address the superintendent anticipated nancys next question where did she go after she was released from here i dont know seeing the girls disappointment she said you might talk to joe hes been our maintenance man for twenty years a friendly fellow and his memory tor patients is amazing while mr drew waited in the lobby nancy went to the basement to find joe when she showed him the photograph a wide grin spread over his face indeed i remember that girl she called her self julia flower i felt sorry for her when she left here in a wheelchair she was crying her eyes out as the nurse rolled her to the elevator why was she crying nancy asked i overheard dr barnes tell miss flower shed never be able to walk properly again is dr barnes still with the hospital no he went to new york to head up a large clinic how about nurses who took care of her nancy inquired i remember one she was nicemiss emily foster i dont know what became of her do you have any idea where miss flower went joe shook his head she didnt say the mans information threw new light on the mystery nancy thanked him and hurried back to her father such an injury could have prevented juliana from ever dancing again she said mr drew nodded the thought of her admir ers feeling pity for her may have been too much for juliana to bear perhaps she dropped out of sight on purpose she probably took an assumed name in order to avoid publicity then disappeared because she didnt want to be a burden to her sister nancy said julianas pride kept her from marrying walter heath nancy paused a moment oh dad were really getting somewhere at the main desk nancy and her father tried to obtain the doctors and the nurses address dr barnes died three years ago the re ceptionist said as for emily foster i have an old address but i understand she left the place some time ago however the people who live there might be able to tell you where she is while mr drew registered at the local motel for his daughter and himself nancy hurried on foot to the designated address to her disappoint ment she found the residence occupied by new tenants who had never heard of emily foster another blind alley nancy sighed as she started back to join her father as she walked along the street nancy became aware of a man walking a little distance behind her at first she thought nothing of it but after three blocks she concluded someone must be following her nancy quickened her pace after six blocks she still had not shaken the person and decided to get a good look at him she dropped her hand bag on purpose as she turned to pick it up nancy gazed directly at the man he wore a brown suit and had a sharp angular face and dark eyes when he realized that nancy knew she was being followed he wheeled around and turned down a side street he was tailing me nancy thought she had never seen the man before and won dered why he was trailing her she was eager to tell her father but found that he had invited a client to dinner by ten oclock after the caller had gone she had stopped thinking about the incident before retiring father and daughter sat down in mr drews bedroom to discuss the mystery isnt emily foster our best lead yet nancy asked mr drew did not answer in tact for several seconds he had not been paying strict attention to nancys conversation now so suddenly that the young detective was startled he tiptoed to the door and yanked it open a man in a brown suit crouched just outside thrown off balance he fell forward into the room chapter xi a warning so you were eavesdropping mr drew said sternly as he pulled the man to his feet no thats not true the fellow stammered after recovering his balance he tried to retreat mr drew blocked the doorway sit down he ordered the man into the room we want to talk to you nancy recognized the man as the one who had followed her what were you doing outside my door mr drew asked him sharply nothing he replied in a sullen voice i thought this room belonged to a friend thats hard to believe but easy enough to check whats his name none of your business i can turn you over to the police nancy spoke up i can report to them that you trailed me today the stranger squirmed uneasily in the chair you cant prove anything this man followed you today mr drew asked his daughter in surprise yes i forgot to tell you about it that settles it the lawyer said well turn him over to the police for questioning no no dont do that ill tell anything you want to knowexcept my name the stranger said very well the lawyer nodded why were you following my daughter because i was paid to do it by whom i dont know the guys name what were your instructions to make a complete report on where miss drew went whom she talked to and what she did mr drew turned so that the man could not see him full face with a wink and a quick movement of his hand he signaled nancy to step into the ad joining room for a moment the young detective was puzzled then it dawned upon her that her rather wanted her to slip quietly downstairs and arrange to have the stranger followed so you wont tell us your name mr drew repeated facing the stranger once more and walk ing up so close to him the man could not see nancy no i wont the man replied nancy stole noiselessly into the adjoining room she hastened downstairs and used a public tele phone to call police headquarters after identify ing her father and herself she said please send a plainclothesman at once ill meet him in the lobby and explain everything when he arrives how will i know him hell pretend to have a bad cold the officer said nancy was worried that the detective might not reach the hotel in time but in less than five min utes a man entered coughing uncontrollably she told him why he had been called and asked him to trail the eavesdropper here he comes now she whispered as the brownsuited stranger emerged from an elevator he must not see me she hid behind a pillar and noticed with satis faction that the eavesdropper did not realize he was being followed from the hotel then she went upstairs mr drew praised his daughter tor having in terpreted his signals correctly by the way he asked have you called hannah since we left home there may be some messages for us at once nancy dialed the drew number han nah gruen answered im glad you phoned she said i tried to reach you in hampton but you had already left is anything wrong mrs fenimore called this morning and wanted to see you mrs fenimore nancy echoed in curiosity did she say why she called she wouldnt tell me over the phone han nah resumed when i told her you werent home she said you had to be warned to be care ful careful of what she thinks youre in danger oh nancy ill be so relieved when youre home again safe and unharmed well be back tomorrow nancy assured her dont worry after completing the call nancy speculated on why mrs fenimore thought the young detective was in danger could the woman have learned that nancy was to be shadowed it was too late she decided to call mrs fenimore ill see her tomorrow nancy and her father waited until midnight to hear from the plainclothesman when he failed to return to the hotel they telephoned head quarters the officer had not checked in yet in the morning there was no word either so mr drew requested that a full report be sent to him in river heights after nancy arrived home in the afternoon she lost no time calling on mrs fenimore the woman was reclining on a couch she was ex hausted from strain and worry i shouldnt have become so upset she said but mr hectors attitude always disturbs me he came to see you yes i had a dreadful session with him he asked me so many questions about your sister the woman nodded he wanted to know it i had hired someone to search tor julie did you mention my name well i did say you had offered to help me mrs fenimore admitted though i feel unhappy about having told him from the way he behaved im sure he intends to make trouble tor you im not afraid of daniel hector nancy said oh but you should have heard him talk he said he wouldnt let anyone meddle in his affairs he acted as if heath castle belongs to him mr hector is worried nancy commented frowning his remarks and the fact that he came to talk to you regarding your sister indicate a guilty conscience would you risk going to heath castle again nancy i would if i could accomplish something the young detective said but i believe the mystery may be solved in another way she thought it best not to tell mrs fenimore about the possibility that her sister might have been crippled as a result of an automobile acci dent she merely said there was an interesting new lead to follow one which would not involve her coming in contact with daniel hector later at home nancy reviewed the develop ments in the mystery intruders prowling around the heath estate were looking for something im portant she had heard them mention the clue in a stone wall and unnamed items they had already found where did hector fit in were they all working together whatif anythingdid the search have to do with julianas disappearance and then theres the man who was eavesdrop ping nancy thought as she opened the top drawer of her dresser to get a handkerchief there lay the torn note she had found in the debris at the heath factory in the recent excitement she had forgotten about it this may be my most valuable clue she chided herself i must try to figure it out she sat down to piece out the message just then the telephone rang the caller was george who wanted to know how the detective work was progressing i have a clue to your stolen clothes nancy said and told of the shirt at mrs hoopers why the nerve of that woman george cried indignantly im going there at once and demand that she return my property you cant prove anything george nancy said better forget the matter for the time being and come over here i have lots to tell you bring bess along be there pronto george replied and hung up if it was really teddy who took those clothes nancy reasoned what was he doing in the heath gardens she was still trying to figure this out when her friends arrived nancy told them every thing that had happened on her trip poor juliana bess said how dreadful to have her career cut off that way i wish you could have found the nurse emily foster george added well what are you going to work on next this note or rather this piece of a note nancy produced the bit of paper and the girls pored over it for some time each with a pencil and paper trying to fill in the lines to form a logi cal message bess was the first one to claim having pieced together the missing words listen to this she said ive got it dear c some place is the se cret which i hid in a wall i want to be famous if i can sell it i will be worthy of you george scoffed if he was going to sell it why would he hide it in a wall well it fits the missing words bess defended herself one guess is as good as another nancy said then she stared thoughtfully at the paper before her suddenly she jumped up from the chair and said the solution to this mystery might be right in this very house without explaining her strange remark nancy ran from her room and down the stairs a few minutes later she returned with a large book how in the world are you going to find juli ana with that george asked the book contained a collection of colored photographs and descriptions of famous old homes and gardens in england i forgot i had this nancy said quickly turn ing the pages look here heath castle exclaimed george the original one in england only it wasnt called heath of course and the gardens cried bess as they scanned picture after picture nancy was reading a de scription under one of them when suddenly a paragraph below caught her eyes listen to this i think we have the clue weve been looking for chapter xii secret entrance george and bess studied the paragraph to which nancy had pointed it had been written in mid dle english nancy had learned in school to read the works of the poet chaucer who wrote in that language eagerly she translated the quotation i have hidden my treasures in the niches of the cloister through which all unsuspecting the noble men and fair ladies pass each day to bathe sounds quaint bess said but how does it help us dont you see nancy said ira heath built his estate to resemble the one in england prob ably he and his son knew about the old cloister granted george nodded but so what if the heaths had a treasure to hide wouldnt their cloister have been a good place to put it do you really think they had a treasure bess asked i dont know nancy replied but i have a hunch they did we know certain men are search ing for a clue but they also mentioned having found other things perhaps those were part of the treasure is there a cloister in the heath gardens george asked i havent seen one nancy turned the page the three girls looked at the picture on it which showed a long passage way flanked by columns leading toward a river this is the cloister said nancy excitedly oh i wonder whether theres one at heath castle you didnt notice it from the tower bess in quired nno nancy answered slowly but there was something leading from the castle toward the rivera kind of tunnel covered with vines ill bet thats it george said enthusiastically listen the bell someones at the door nancy went downstairs to see who it was the caller proved to be salty and how are ye lass he asked with a smile sorry i cant give ye any report about that fellow what crashed into ye i been lookin high an low for his boat but i aint seen any part o her thank you youve been very helpful nancy said then added salty im thinking of going to the heath gardens by boat have you ever noticed aa sort of tunnel there leading from the beach cant say i have the clam digger replied are you figurin on lookin for one nancy smiled as she said perhaps some time when youre not busy salty suddenly slapped his thigh and chuckled women he said they never come right out an say what they want nancy ill meet you an your friends at campbells landing ten oclock sharp tomorrow mornin barrin rain nancy thanked him another thing salty id like to find out about walter heaths experi ments are you sure you cant tell me more about them the man shook his head i dont know a thing more but maybe sam weatherby can help ye the curio dealer sam worked at the heath factory before he went into business for himself he knew walt as well as anyone in town then ill go to sec sam weatherby nancy said grateful for the information soon after salty had gone down the street bess and george left for home promising to be on hand the next morning nancy drove to sam weatherbys shop havent seen you in a while he greeted her cheerfully did you bring that pearl and the shell i offered to buy nancy told him the pearl had been stolen thats too bad the man said sympathetically well maybe youll find a bigger one i hope so nancy said with a smile but right now im more interested in walter heaths experiments she told about the pile of crushed and broken whelk shells she had found at the pond the colors were so beautiful ive been wondering if he was trying to make dye from them you guessed right mr weatherby said eye ing her intently so far as i know walt had no luck but he kept working at it and once he said to me sam even if i dont succeed in making a fortune in dye theres another treasure on my estate then he winked and said its right in plain sight tool what did he mean by that nancy asked the dealer shrugged who knows walt was like thatfull of riddles and secrets in one way his experimental work brought him luck how he found a big pearl at least thats what he told me said he was going to present it to a young lady friend of hisa dancer nancy blinked in astonishment at the reve lation had he really given the pearl to juliana or was it hidden in one of the cloister walls and was that what someone was looking for nancy thanked the curio dealer for his infor mation and turned to leave an object in the showcase caught her eye lying in a velvetlined case was the antique charm from a mans watch chain that daniel hector had sold to mr weatherby handsome isnt it the jeweler remarked taking the charm from its case an old english family design a genuine heirloom nancy admired the piece of jewelry mr weatherby also showed her a pair of earrings a bracelet and a brooch all bearing the same de sign daniel hector sold me this entire set mr weatherby revealed that lawyer is a hard cus tomer though he argues for the last penny did he inherit these from english ancestors nancy asked thats what he said between you and me i think he got them from a client who couldnt pay a bill nancy wondered if hector had received the charm and the other pieces of jewelry honestly but kept quiet when nancy reached home she learned that during her absence a call had come from hope well either she or her father was to get in touch with the man who had phoned he was a detective hannah gruen told her and he wouldnt give me a message nancy called headquarters at hopewell the plainclothesman was out at the time but had left his report for her the stranger he had shadowed the night before had driven to river heights from there he had gone to the abandoned heath factory to meet another man if i only knew who that person was nancy exclaimed i have a description of him said the police sergeant and read it nancy was almost certain he was the same man who had damaged her motor boat she thanked the officer then hung up the young detective mulled over what she had just heard obviously the intruders at heath castle knew she was working on the case and had sent someone to shadow her would they stop there or was she in danger her father was out of town on business so she could not discuss the matter with him finally she went to bed the next morning nancy put the key to the front door of heath castle in a pocket of her slacks then hastened to campbells landing she was the first to arrive and arranged to rent a motorboat she was just getting it ready when george and bess arrived finally salty showed up in his rowboat which he fastened securely to the larger craft then jumped in with the girls all set he announced cast off the girls enjoyed the ride upstream not only because it was beautiful on the river but because the clam digger entertained them with songs and stories of the sea soon the girls saw the high turrets of heath castle in the distance nancy recalled the man she had seen signaling from one of them with a flash light his helper was probably waiting on the water she thought the shoreline was matted thickly with bushes and only a narrow beach was visible above it stood a high weatherstained wall the river bar rier of heath castle lets anchor the motorboat in the river and take the little one ashore salty suggested they untied the rowboat and climbed aboard with powerful strokes the sailor sent it surging through the water presently it grounded on the shore and they stepped out the girls left salty who wanted to look for clams along the beach the young sleuths turned their attention to the high wall which marked the rear boundary of the heath estate only the tree tops above the gardens were visible directly in front of the wall grew tall brier bushes nancy and her friends walked along the beach that boy who stole your clothes seemed to ap pear out of nowhere nancy said i didnt see him scale a wall he must have reached the beach some other way you mean by the cloister asked bess maybe im sure theres an opening along here pushing ahead she began to examine the base finally parting some brier bushes she saw several large stones which apparently never had been ce mented into the wall she pushed against the center one it moved easily girls this may be an entrance nancy cried out chapter xiii treasure nancy pressed against the center stone in the wall it moved inward to reveal a flight of eight steps leading upward to an arched passageway the cloister bess and george exclaimed one side of the passageway was set with square stone columns heavy vines grew up and over them forming a roof of leaves through which sun light filtered into the cool tunnel the other side was a high crumbling fieldstone wall with deep alcoves about twentyfive feet apart just like the picture we saw in the book bess said oh what an attractive walk to the beach now to find the hidden treasure george said come on hopefully the girls examined the niches along the wall some of which had builtin stone shelves in one a statuette lay on its side in another a vase had tipped over and broken george felt among the vines nothing here she started to say when nancy interrupted her she held up a finger in warning listen she whispered the three girls stood still faintly they heard mens voices from the other side of the wall they stole along the flagstones cautiously hardly daring to breathe as they reached another niche the deep voices came to them distinctly this looks like a good spot one man said making no attempt to speak low bring your pick cobb nancy recognized the voices she had heard them the night of her imprisonment in the tower the men started to work with chisel pick and sledgehammer tiny stones and bits of mortar rattled down at the girls feet theyre wrecking this lovely wall george whispered indignantly just then a decorative ledge in the alcove came loose and threatened to crash to the flagstone floor quickly nancy stepped forward and caught the slab with besss help she laid it carefully on the ground nancy straightened up and gasped as she looked at the wall niche where the ledge had been a long narrow pocket was now exposed nancy ran her hand into the dark opening her groping fingers touched something cold and hard a metal box nancy george warned in a whisper directly above the girls hand a stone chisel was poking through the wall in another moment the men would succeed in making a large opening into the niche nancy drew out the flat metal box then the three girls turned and fled through the cloister toward the castle the sound of the men working gradually died away were safe nancy exclaimed now lets open the box her hands trembled with excitement as she lifted the lid of the rusty container hm said george only papers and photo graphs bess too was disappointed theres nothing valuable here i and after all our trouble too lets not be too hasty nancy advised and lifted out the top photograph carefully yellowed with age it showed a middleaged man in old fashioned clothes at the bottom was scrawled the name ira heath and a date nancy was about to hand the picture to george when a detail of the mans clothing attracted her attention a watch chain which hung from mr heaths vest pocket had an unusual charm at tached to it look at this she said i saw the very same charm at sam weatherbys curio shop daniel hector sold it to him along with some other jewelry youre kidding bess exclaimed no hector told mr weatherby the jewelry was from his own family that certainly sounds suspicious george said reaching for another photograph she held up the picture of a sweetfaced woman wearing a long gown and upswept hair an inscription identified her as heaths wife ida her earrings nancy said hector sold those to mr weatherby too he has been robbing the estate bess de clared there were more pictures in the box but none were of particular interest to the girls under neath the pile was a small leatherbound diary the flyleaf bore walter heaths name and the dates of many of the notations showed they had been made less than a month before his death this may be the most valuable thing in this box nancy remarked skimming through the book many of the pages were blank but under one date was an item important enough to read aloud i stumbled upon something which may prove to be a treasure in the salted pond there are many marine mollusks placed there by my father they not only have beautiful shells but their glands give off a purple dye i am mixing it with certain chemicals and so far have produced six shades of purple dye but the color does not last i will keep trying for a perfect formula i wonder it he did perfect it and what became of the formula bess mused good question said george nancy turned more pages in the diary heres something she said listen to this i dont trust the new chauffeur biggs have decided to hide all the bottles of dye until my ex periments are complete does it say where he hid them george asked read the next page theres nothing more this is the last para graph in the book what a shame maybe well find other clues when we read the entire diary nancy said but theres no time now ill say there isnt george agreed sh wed better duck out of here and fast from just across the stone barrier came the barking of a dog voices were audible and each moment they grew louder the two men were approaching how about looking on the opposite side of this wall one of them asked okay the other man replied may as well climb over and make a good job of it while were here fearful of being seen the girls tiptoed along the cloister wall nancy carried the metal box which was heavy we should have gone the other way toward the beach she whispered i hope we dont get trapped as they rounded a curve the girls noticed that the cloister ended abruptly in a rear wall of the castle with a huge wooden door it was locked nancy tried her key it would not fit oh whatll we do bess asked this is awfull the men could be heard moving slowly up the flagstone passageway in a moment or two they certainly would see the girls nancy well have to hide the box george said wed better hide ourselves bess urged maybe we could break through the vines nancy suggested no chance george decided theres a net work of thick stalks between the pillars i touched them before when we were searching tor the treasure not far from the castle wall was a large nook in their haste the girls had passed it with only a fleeting glance now nancy thought that it might make a safe hiding place follow me she directed above the arched entrance to the refuge had been chiseled the words poets nook but the girls scarcely noticed it as they slipped into the niche i must hide this box so the men cant take it even if they catch us nancy declared grimly frantically the girls looked about them nancy noticed a loose stone in the wall directly above a bench in the back of their hiding place george she said see if it will move luckily the stone could be eased out a large empty space was behind it nancy slipped the box inside and george quickly fitted the stone into place by this time the men were very near and had stopped walking how about working in the poets nook one asked suddenly maybe well find something there the girls flattened themselves against the wall and waited tensely scarcely daring to breathe we looked there once that hiding place over the bench was empty sure but it we take out the whole wall we might find another one youre lazy if you ask me did i ask you the first man growled this is hard work were not getting much money for it either the other laughed what we found already is good enough pay for me and if we find the other loot we can live anyway we please nancy and her friends surmised that the men would not search the poets nook again and re laxed slightly but their hopes were dashed how about it cobb the first man de manded do we take out the wall or dont we okay the one addressed as cobb replied you go ahead ill be with you in a minute heres the sledgehammer chapter xiv cinderellas slipper nancy bess and george retreated deeper into the shadows but their hearts sank the men were sure to find them ill be right there biggs cobb called just want to see if theres anything hidden in any of these other niches biggs the name electrified the girls hadnt walter heath mentioned the name biggs in the diary as that of a suspicious person could he be the chauffeur searching perhaps for the bottles of dye his former employer had hidden the next moment a tall figure appeared in the entrance of the niche with a sledgehammer his back was turned to the girls as he called out hurry up im not going to do the heavy work alone at that instant the sound of running footsteps could be heard startled the speaker moved off in their direction nancy tiptoed forward and peered out biggs was the man who had signaled from the tower then she saw a boy who was racing toward the two men teddy hooper hey come quick he shouted ive got something to show you cobb was irritated you again he exclaimed we told you to keep away from here but ive got something to tell you what is it first you pay me the boy replied get out of here and leave us alone maybe wed better hear what teddy has to say biggs urged it may be important gimme a dollar and ill tell you the boy de manded impudently there cobb snapped handing over the money now talk you know where the hole is in the beach wall somebody came through it how do you know footprints want to see em okay cobb sounded concerned if anyone is on these premises wed better find out about it maybe the place is being watched im clear ing out of here biggs added dont be a fool cobb replied if anyone came into the gardens through this passageway hes got to go out the same way all we have to do is watch the hole and well catch him the two men followed teddy around the curve when their voices died away nancy and the girls stepped from their hiding place the boy was teddy hooper nancy said thoughtfully i wonder how he got mixed up with these men never mind him now bess said anxiously we must get out of here somehow and fast as long as the men stay on the beach were pretty safe nancy replied but im worried about salty if only we had some way to warn him but how can we bess asked those men might pounce on us if we try to go theres one possibility george announced pointing to a stone stairway between two of the columns which were intertwined with vines see if theres a way out through these the girls managed to force two of the heavy vines apart below them lay a small tangled gar den we can squeeze through here bess said come on you go ahead nancy said ill get the metal box a few minutes later she wriggled between the vines to join her friends eagerly they explored the little garden it had sheer walls on three sides too high to climb they could not find a single opening bess sat down in the middle of a weedgrown path im so discouraged i could cry she ad mitted maybe a drink of water will revive you her cousin suggested practically on the rear wall of the garden hung an artistic fountain from which spouted a little stream bess walked over to it and drank freely its wonder ful water she said and cold must come from a spring nancy and george cupped their hands and filled them several times it certainly tastes dif ferent from river heights water nancy de clared and youre right its delicious she was about to drink more when she spotted something on the crumbling wall just beneath the fountain parting the vines to get a better view nancy stared in astonishment girls look on the wall she exclaimed the vines had grown over a small block of cement which had been set into the stones in it was the imprint of a womans shoe beneath had been chiseled a single word cinderella cinderellas dancing slipper george laughed whoever would do such a crazy thing im not sure it was crazy nancy replied its rather romantic and may have been walter heaths way of paying a compliment to juliana dont you recall that note i found in his hand writing which began dear c c could stand tor a dozen other names george said nancy measured the dainty little shoe print with her hand but if its julianas it could be the clue walter heath mentioned in his will he said she would be able to identify herself in a special way and this could be it couldnt it the print is very small bess admitted not many girls wear such a tiny size if weve really stumbled upon a secret nancy we mustnt breathe a word of it bess warned the other girls agreed and carefully covered the imprint with the vines i wonder if theres anything of value hidden behind the cement block nancy mused we cant find out today george said wed have to use tools to move it it would be just our luck if cobb and biggs decide to smash the fountains nancy said then wed be too late suddenly she stiffened i hear someone the girls became aware of a loud creaking noise from the cloister the rear castle door whispered george instantly they thought of the vines they had torn apart to get into the garden whoever was going in or out of the castle might notice the opening and come to investigate quick nancy directed lie down here in the tall grass and weeds bess and george flattened themselves on the ground nancy darted behind a bush leafy enough to hide her but not too thick to block her view a man slightly stooped came through the parted vines he paused to examine them nancys heart stood still he was daniel hector the lawyer peered into the garden but evi dently saw nothing unusual because he went on toward the beach lets go nancy whispered jubilantly a mo ment later the cloister entrance to the castle may have been left unlocked the three girls stole noiselessly along and eventually reached the castle the door was in deed unlocked it made such a loud noise when nancy pulled it that she feared the sound would carry to the men what a weird place george commented as they hurried inside nancy led the way through the long winding corridor toward the front hall lets get out of here as soon as we can bess urged nancy was fairly familiar with the floor plan and found the main entrance it was locked but the key she had fitted at least we can get out she said no no bess interrupted hector probably has a guard on watch not paying heed to her cousins warning george peeked outside then stopped short oh oh whats the matter bess asked following her tied at the foot of the steps were the two huge dogs the girls had met before they began to growl menacingly well hello old fellows we meet again nancy called cheerily but her friendly attitude did not work this time the animals would not allow the girls to descend you try it alone nancy bess suggested nancy had no success the hounds are acting very strangely she whispered what can be wrong the other day they let me pass she shitted the metal box under her arm and the animals growled even more fiercely why maybe its this box she said the dogs think im trying to steal something from the castle telling her friends she would be right back nancy ran inside in a minute she had emptied the box of photographs and the diary and stuffed them under her sweater now where can i hide the box she thought nancy caught sight of a narrow door partially open thatll do she decided as she placed the metal container on the floor of the closet she heard footsteps not far away someone was coming along the winding cor ridor she hurried outside the dogs growled but nancy was determined to pass by them she ran down the steps her friends behind her bess was fearful but tried not to show it the hounds bayed loudly and the next second mr hectors figure framed the doorway hey you i the lawyer shouted furiously stop stop the girls ignored him as hector ran down the steps to untie the dogs he tripped over the long rope and tell down on his face nancy urged her friends to run faster while the man bellowed in pain quick to the wall she panted holding the treasure dose inside her sweater chapter xv saltys plight the three girls raced madly to the front wall of the estate clutching vines to pull themselves up they reached the top and scrambled over then they paused for breath what a narrow escape nancy murmured daniel hector saw me did he recognize you bess asked we have never really been introduced and i only turned around briefly when i first realized he was there what did you do with the metal box bess queried i hid it but not these nancy produced the photographs and the diary from beneath her sweater i still have the evidence great george said but whats next were a long way from the boat after catching their breath the girls debated what to do they were worried about salty and what might have happened to him to reach him they would have to go far out of their way through jungle growth next to the estate and theres a chance said george hes in trouble and might not even be where we left him well have to return to town and rent a boat nancy concluded the trio walked as fast as they could and made their way to the main highway bess pointed out that public transportation was infrequent along this route last time i was here i thought the bus would never come she said the girls waited impatiently for twenty min utes they were almost in despair when nancy saw a familiar car headed in their direction its lieutenant masters she cried holding up her hand to signal the officer the young woman stopped hop in she in vited and nancy introduced her friends did you go to heath castle the officer asked yes nancy said we found several good leads in fact we were following one this morn ing salty came with us salty hes the singing clam digger of muskoka river bess explained we left him on the beach he may be in the hands of the thieves by now quickly nancy explained the situation and asked the officer if she could arrange to send out a police boat to rescue salty id like to go along if theyll let me nancy added im worried and feel responsible for him well go too if we may put in george lieutenant masters radioed headquarters in a few minutes she had arranged for the girls to accompany the rescue party but be careful she warned them meanwhile ill tell the chief to search for biggs and cobb on their way to the police dock lieutenant masters said that she had planned to stop at the drew home to discuss the problem of joan feni more and teddy hooper i had hoped joan wouldnt play with teddy any more said nancy im inclined to think she may have tried not to the officer said slowly butwell heres the story teddy really causes me more worry than a dozen other boys on my list he hasnt been to school for three days it does no good to talk to his mother she always sides with teddy im con vinced shes unsuited to look after him ill say she is george burst out and told lieutenant masters about her stolen clothes were sure he took them she concluded nancy said hes friendly with biggs and cobb she explained about teddy and the two men at the castle the lieutenant listened seriously im afraid the boy may be a thief she agreed this morn ing i caught him trying to sell a pearl at weath erbys curio shop when i asked him where he had gotten it he refused to answer me maybe he was the one who snatched your purse nancy anyway when i took him home his mother said she knew nothing about the pearl teddy finally said that joan fenimore had given it to him but she denied this what a pity hes involved her nancy said shes too nice a child a few minutes later lieutenant masters pulled up to the dock where two officers were waiting in a motorboat the girls were introduced to lieutenant car ney a stocky muscularlooking man and officer mellon who was tall and soft spoken the girls climbed aboard and the craft roared off in a short time they reached the heath estate the rented motorboat was anchored in the same spot but there was no sign of salty and his row boat he wouldnt have had time to row home bess said worried and we didnt pass him on the way lieutenant carney cast anchor and everyone waded ashore they started an intensive hunt before long george spotted the sailor lying mo tionless near the entrance to the cloister she gasped but suddenly he sat up and looked at her thought yed never come he muttered there was blood on his face and shirt salty exclaimed nancy who had hurried over youre hurt her cry brought lieutenant carney on the run salty stood up and insisted he was all right though he was somewhat unsteady what happened nancy asked and lieu tenant carney pulled out his notebook i was diggin for clams when a couple omen an a boy seemed to come right out o nowhere they asked me who id brought to the heath gardens did you tell them bess asked no but they said theyd beat me up if i didnt an then go after the intruders themselves i tried to argue em out o it but they was stubborn as mules when they started to go after you i tried to stop em but there were three against you george said yere right fraid i got knocked out but i come to pretty soon in fact just in time to see one o the rascals takin my boat salty told how he had seen one man going through the section of wall with the stone steps beyond and decided to follow but the sailor had gone no farther than the opening before every thing went black again before his eyes later i come to he said but i couldnt seem to move for a while somewhere in the gar den i heard two men talkin nancy you must be very careful from now on he warned those guys are plannin to kidnap you lieutenant carney spoke up wed better get back to headquarters salty you can give us a description of the men there also i want you to see a doctor to make sure youre all right in a few minutes the police boat was skimming down the river with salty aboard nancy and her friends took the rented craft back to campbells landing then headed home in her car it was midaftemoon when nancy reached her house she found mr drew there looking through some old newspapers he and nancy ate a late lunch while she eagerly showed him the photo graphs and the diary from the heath estate you certainly had an exciting time her father remarked but i have some interesting news too nancys eyes lighted with curiosity something that will help solve the mystery dad her father nodded it concerns julianas miss ing nurse emily foster yes ive located her and heres the best part tomorrow morning shell see you and tell you all she knows chapter xvi news of juliana oh dad where is emily foster nancy asked thrilled by the newshow did you find her what did she say about juliana one question at a time please mr drew said laughing i talked to her only by telephone go i didnt get any details is she here in river heights no in hampton i traced her by contacting the state board of nursing miss foster is on a case in hampton shell be free tomorrow and has promised to meet us at the hampton motel thats great maybe now well find juliana dont build your hopes too high the lawyer warned his daughter miss foster may not know what became of the dancer even if shes able to provide a clue you have only a short time to fol low it up thats the trouble nancy agreed worried only ten days are left before heath castle will be lost to juliana anyway it seems to me youve built up a case against daniel hector and thats something her father said even if juliana is never found theres no reason why that unscrupulous lawyer and his henchmen should help themselves to any of the estate the drews planned to leave for hampton that evening and spend the night at the motel in order to be on time for their earlymorning appoint ment nancy knowing she had a dozen things to do before leaving rushed to do them before they left she suggested that they stop at the fenimores to see if joan and her mother needed anything i cant help worrying about them she said mr drew agreed when they arrived at the house the little girl was asleep her mother how ever was up and in surprisingly good spirits the hoopers have moved she said now joan and teddy will be separated i wonder why they left so suddenly nancy mused it was strange mrs fenimore replied mrs hooper never talked about moving a truck drove up with mr hooper and another man and they loaded up all the furniture then mrs hooper and teddy left in a taxi with their lug gage mrs fenimore went on to say that teddy had been boasting to joan lately he said his father was a smart manhe knew how to make money without working for it oh how the talk frightened me ive never seen mr hooper nancy said can you describe him cobb hooper is a tall thin man sullenfaced and unkempt in appearance did you say cobb nancy was startled by the name yes nancy did not show her excitement as she recognized the name of the suspicious man she had overheard in the cloister at heath castle she asked mrs fenimore if she knew anything about teddy and his family i never knew when that boy was telling the truth the woman replied but he told joan he knew where there was a hidden treasure nancys mind was whirling as pieces of evi dence seemed to fall into place mrs fenimore she asked did joan ever talk to the hoopers about juliana and the property she was to in herit dear me yes the child told everybody and teddy repeated it to his parents i dont know he told joan he went to the castle himself but she was to keep it a secret when did teddy tell your daughter this oh some time ago there was nothing more of importance that mrs fenimore could remember after learning that the family was not in need of food or any thing else nancy and her father got up to leave nancy remarked that they were on their way to interview a woman who might have information about juliana oh i hope she does mrs fenimore said as soon as the drews were in the car nancy told her father of her suspicion regarding cobb hooper i thought cobb was a last name she com mented it never occurred to me that biggs companion might be teddys father the man i overheard in the cloister didnt act very paternally toward the boy maybe its only a coincidence possibly but cobb is not a common name shouldnt we talk to the police again mr drew glanced at his watch all right but we havent much time if were to get to hampton tonight at headquarters the sergeant on duty consulted the files and informed the drews that cobb hooper had a prison record have you a mug shot of him carson drew asked sure the photograph was brought out with only one glance nancy knew that he was the same man she had seen in the castle garden cobb hooper was one of the men who was hacking at the stone walls she revealed he also rammed me with his boat ill try to get a warrant for his arrest the of ficer said nancy and her father thanked him and left for hampton they arrived at ten oclock and the next morning waited in the motel lobby to meet emily foster she was fifteen minutes late im sorry i couldnt make it on time she said as she rushed in breathlessly you are mr and miss drew arent you as the two nodded she went on the nurse who was to relieve me was late nancy and her father liked miss foster at once she was in her early forties brisk and efficient with a friendly smile after some polite conversation she came right to the point mr drew you said over the tele phone that you wanted to ask me about a former patient of mine ill be glad to help you if i can the information we are seeking concerns juliana johnson mr drew began but i be lieve she gave the name julia flower at the hos pital she was injured in a hitandrun accident he showed emily foster julianas photograph yes i knew her as miss flower the nurse said tell us about her mr drew urged what ever you can remember well i had a hunch right away that miss flower gave us an assumed name emily foster recalled for one thing she never had any visi tors no messages came for her no letters she would not allow the authorities to notify anyone of her accident i dont want anyone to know she would say not until im well did she believe she would recover nancy asked quickly only in the beginning then the doctor told her the truththat shed be lame for the rest of her life how did she take it mr drew questioned very hard miss flower cried for days saying the strangest things one remark i recall was his little cinderella will never dance for him again oh it was heartbreaking to listen to her cinderella nancy was so sure she was on the right track that her mind leaped from one possibility to an other she nearly missed hearing her fathers next question where did miss flower go after she left the hospital i dont know miss foster admitted regret fully from her remarks i surmised she in tended to live in some secluded place near hope well that name flower nancy mused juliana was interested in gardening she added recalling what mrs fenimore had told her about the dancer she would pick a place with flowers and trees and vegetables probably a farm miss flower no doubt did the nurse said she was always asking me to buy her garden magazines why the day before her release i re member she cut an advertisement from the local paper what was it nancy asked eagerly the ad offered a small fruit and vegetable farm for salea place known as clover farm where is it it seems to me there used to be a clover farm at milton about ten miles from here i dont know whether its the same one though nancy turned to her father he sensed her thoughts and said yes well go there today it may be a futile trip but we must follow every lead oh i hope its the right place said nancy we must find juliana soon time is getting short chapter xvii kidnapped after the drews had said goodby to emily fos ter they drove toward milton at a service station near the edge of town they stopped and inquired where clover farm was never heard of it was the attendants disap pointing reply he also did not know of a julia flower or juliana or julie johnson the local telephone book had no listing for any of the names oh dad nancy said have we run into an other dead end she had never felt more frustrated her father went into two shops to make the same inquiry but had no better luck a distressing thought came to nancy that maybe the former dancer had moved to another part of the country or was no longer alive mr drew trying to cheer his daughter suggested that the elusive woman might be living in the area under another name at once nancy took heart lets drive all over this place maybe well pick up a clue silence followed as they rode up one road and down another about a mile out of town nancy suddenly exclaimed look on one side of the road was an attractive white arched arbor at the entrance to the grounds fields of flowers shrubs and a nursery of trees lined either side a neatly painted sign on the arbor read jardin des fleurs juliette fleur prop im sure this is the place nancy cried ex citedly julia flower translated her name into french and calls her place garden of flowers it was a quarter of a mile to the house which was surrounded by a high white picket fence with a locked gate a terrier with a staccato bark raced from the building toward the callers theres no bell or knocker said nancy how does one get in her question was answered when two garden ers hurried from the rear of the enclosure no visitors allowed here one of them said curtly we came to see miss fleur mr drew ex plained then introduced himself and his daugh ter did she send for you no mr drew admitted but if shes the person were looking for we have important in formation for her nancy pulled out julianas photograph and showed it to the men who stared at it finally one of them said its her all rightwhen she was younger but shes not here where is she nancy asked well usually she never leaves the place on ac count of being such a cripple but when that gov ernment man came for her last night she had to go he took her away in a car what government man mr drew asked quickly did he give his name he probably told miss fleur we didnt hear it did she say why she had to go with him nancy asked it was something about income tax miss fleur always thought she paid the government every penny she owed shes very honest but the man claimed shed made a false report and might have to go to prison this seems very irregular to me mr drew commented even if miss fleur made a mistake in the amount of her tax she would not be sen tenced without a hearing the usual procedure is to notify the accused by letter and have the person call at the tax office to explain his or her side of the matter dad nancy said it looks as if someone was very eager to get miss fleur away from here we must end her first of all well check with the internal rev enue service that is if i can use a telephone the two gardeners sensing that nancy and her father were sincere invited them into the farm house mr drew called when he finished he looked grim just as we feared he revealed the internal revenue service has no case pending against juliette fleur juliana johnson or julia flower then it was a hoax nancy exclaimed yes the man who came here was an im postor the gardeners suddenly looked alarmed one of them said are you saying miss fleur maybe was kidnapped possibly mr drew replied the two workmen were speechless oh find her one said we think an awful lot of her have you any idea where she may have been taken nancy asked both men said they had told her everything they knew they spread the news of the incident to miss fleurs other two employees who came in from the fields their faces became sad those kidnappers may hurt her one of the gardeners said i wouldnt worry about that mr drew said to comfort the man miss fleur probably will receive good treatment but unfortunately she will lose a fortune unless she can be found but how shall we call the police the man asked well stop at headquarters on the way home mr drew said and promised the gardeners he would do everything he could to find juliette fleur tell me what did the alleged government man look like he asked the gardeners description was not very help ful he was tall and slender one said and wore dark glasses he had a beard and a mustache probably a disguise nancy concluded after the drews had told their story to the local police they returned to the hampton motel on their way to the dining room carson drew pur chased a copy of the river heights newspaper a startling headline caught his eyes famous dancer returns in time to claim heath fortune the article stated that after a long search daniel hector had found the missing juliana who now was staying at the riverview hotel in river heights for many years the famous dancer had been fulfilling professional engagements in south america under another name so thats what hector has been up to nancy said hotly he had the real juliana kidnapped to be able to present this impostor it certainly seems that way mr drew agreed if daniel hector can establish the impostor as the heiress he will probably pay her well and then take over the estate lets hurry back to river heights nancy suggested after hastening through lunch she and her father checked out of the motel and soon were driving along the road toward home i wonder where the abductor has hidden juliana nancy said it was early afternoon when the drews reached river heights the lawyer said he had to stop in his office for a couple of hours and that nancy could use the car in the meantime i think ill go see mrs fenimore and find out whether she has heard the news nancy decided as she got out of the car she drove off and turned in the direction of the little house joan and her mother were happy to see her they had not read the newspapers however and had not heard from daniel hector when nancy told them about the article mrs fenimore be came excited you mean my sister has really been found oh i just cant believe it where is she mrs fenimore nancy said i dont want to disappoint you but i believe that the woman hector claims to have located is an impostor what do you mean mrs fenimore looked bewildered nancy told about the result of her investiga tion and of her suspicion that the real juliana had been kidnapped but thats terrible mrs fenimore finally said its an unscrupulous scheme to cheat my sister out of her inheritance and who knows she might be a prisoner of hectors for years we must tell the police i wish we could nancy said but so far i cant prove anything unless we find your sister in time hector may get away with his crooked scheme but i can tell if the claimant is my sister cant i i dont know whether your word against hers would be proof enough anyway i think we should meet the dancer who claims to be juliana joan insisted upon coming along and soon the three of them arrived at the rivervicw hotel you mean senora fernandez the desk clerk replied when nancy inquired for the woman ill see if shes receiving callers mrs fenimore became more and more appre hensive as they waited finally the clerk told them to go up to room they knocked and a voice said come in a beautiful woman was reclining on the bed her back braced by several embroidered pillows she wore an exotic negligee which set off to ad vantage her dark hair and creamy white skin vera i am so glad to see you again she said and got up to embrace mrs fenimore and this is joan isnt it she kissed the little girl lightly on the cheek mrs fenimore was so confused that for a mo ment she could not speak nancy broke the silence by giving her name miss drew the dancer looked perplexed but only for an instant yes i believe mr hector told me about you by now mrs fenimore had relaxed julie why did you go away ii eloped with my mexican husband but how could you desert walter heath i couldnt marry him because i didnt love him but i didnt want to hurt him either thats why i disappeared but now youve come back to claim his for tune nancy put in by the way what are your plans for the estate ill sell it mr hector has a buyer for it al ready then you wont stay in river heights mrs fenimore asked of course not i have my career and my home in mexico mrs fenimore looked at the woman calmly mr hector wont be able to sell the estate for you because you are not my sister the other woman blanched i may have changed in those ten years but i can prove who i am how nancy asked quickly i have all necessary identification and i also have this from beneath her pillow the dancer brought out a torn paper nancy instantly knew that it was the missing half of the note she had found at the heath factory she read the words day the sec am hiding may make me then i shall be of you love walt nancy did not have the other half of the note with her but she knew its contents by heart the complete message would read dear c someday the sec cret which i am hiding in a wall may make me famous then i shall be worthy of you love walt the young sleuth concluded that walter heath had not sold the formula on which he had been working instead he had hidden the dyes some where in the old estate walls to keep them safe from men like biggs do you have the other half of the note nancy asked senora fernandez no i lost it years ago what does the c stand for ohwalt used to call me carita it was a nickname he gave me when we first met you are not my sister mrs fenimore cried out again she could hardly control her anger and this note proves nothing nancy took her arm lets go now and dont worry she said as the three left back on the street nancy said daniel hector did a good job senora fernandez does resemble your sister doesnt she mrs fenimore nodded so much so that at first i wasnt sure myself i noticed the woman had rather large feet nancy said she must wear at least a size nine or ten shoe and juliana had extremely small feet mrs fenimore remarked that should help prove mrs fernandez is a phony yes please dont worry about it right now all im concerned about is finding your sister nancy dropped the fenimores off at their house the clue in the crumbung wall and drove home on the way she passed besss house and noticed that georges car stood in front ill stop to tell them the latest news about the case nancy decided bess invited both girls to stay to dinner nancy accepted after calling hannah gruen your father wont be back until late any way the housekeeper said by the time nancy arrived home it was dark as she pulled into the driveway the young detec tive noticed that there were no lights on in the house thats funny she thought stopping when ever hannah goes out she leaves a lamp on nancy hurried to the front door with a surge of alarm she found it standing slightly ajar cau tiously she pushed it open but saw only the dark hallway hannah she called out reaching for the hall switch before she could turn on the lights a powerful arm seized her and a hand was clapped over her mouth at the same time the assailant yanked her into the hall and slammed the door shut chapter xviii tower trouble the man held nancy in an iron grip and though she struggled she could not break away did she know him he kept in back of her so she could not see his face frightening questions raced through her mind where was hannah had the housekeeper been harmed were going to take you for a little ride now her captor said in a whisper youre through meddling at heath castle will you shut up a harsh voice put in the second man tied a scarf over her eyes lets get her out of here before her father comes home suddenly nancy had an idea of how to throw the men off guard with a moan she slumped into her captors arms and dropped her purse he exclaimed angrily shes fainted so what snapped the other we follow the orders ill get the car and bring it up the drive way you carry her out when i signal her body limp but her senses sharply alert nancy waited for her chance to escape when the other man left her captor released his grasp in stead of crumpling to the floor nancy pulled off the scarf and dashed up the stairs to her fathers room the man gave a startled cry and ran after her but nancy locked the door before he reached it im calling the police she shouted and raced to the telephone for a few moments the intruder pounded on the door wildly and banged himself against it then suddenly stopped nancy had just finished dialing when she heard him run downstairs and slam the front door quickly she reported the incident to head quarters then went to look out the window she saw the intruder round the end of the drive and flee into the darkness despite the thumping of her heart she smiled grimly as nancy hurried through the house she switched on the lights and called hannahs name she found the housekeeper gagged and tied to a chair in the kitchen are you all right nancy asked anxiously as she released the woman im not hurt hannah said hoarsely but the nerve of those two she added angrily i was expecting you or your father and when the bell rang i thought one of you had forgotten your key i didnt look out just opened the door those men pushed right in turned off the lights and tied me up in my own kitchen a few minutes later two officers arrived han nah described one intruder as tall and thin the other as short stocky and powerfully built both were masked nancy suspected they were cobb and biggs they must have been watching for me she said because they apparently knew my father was out also they were careful to park some distance away so i wouldnt see a strange car in front of the house before leaving one of the policemen called headquarters and arranged for a plainclothesman to keep an eye on the drew house that night in case the suspects made another attempt to kidnap nancy mr drew arrived home half an hour later he listened deeply concerned as his daughter and the housekeeper told what had happened youre a brave and clever girl he said to nancy but from now on you must be extra careful obviously these men are desperate to get you off this case someone is giving them orders she said i have a hunch its daniel hector that night nancy lay awake long after the others in the house were asleep the kidnappers wanted to keep me from going to heath castle she reasoned surely not because of anything ive seen there already it must be because of something else hidden in the place an amazing idea struck her nancy could hardly wait to call bess and george early the next morning she phoned them what time is it bess asked sleepily finally she became awake enough to say yes to nancys request that the three girls go out to the heath estate okay bess said but lets play it safe i dont want to be scared to death again george was eager for the adventure she put a flashlight and police whistle into her pants pocket all three girls left notes at their homes since the families were not yet up nancy added to hers please phone lieutenant masters where i am i want to follow up a hunch connected with the mystery out there when nancy picked up the cousins in her car they demanded a full explanation of the days mission its my opinion that daniel hector or one of his men kidnapped the real juliana nancy said hell hold her until senora fernandez can estab lish her claim to the fortune hell take the lions share of it and then disappear but what does heath castle have to do with it bess asked do you think juliana is im prisoned there yes i do mr hector found out recently that i was hot on the trail of the real juliana and he had to get her out of the way what better hiding place for his prisoner than the castle then of course hed have to keep me away from there so he tried to have me kidnapped your reasoning sounds logical george ad mitted the crippled woman could have been brought to the place the night she left jardin des fleurs at the estate nancy and her friends scaled the wall and dropped to the ground as the three made their way toward the castle they did not see nor hear the dogs what worries me said nancy is whether we can get in of course i have a key to the front door but it may have been padlocked when they reached it the girls were amazed to find the door ajar hector may be here bess whispered wor riedly or perhaps cobb and biggs there was not a sound of anyone stirring about the premises noiselessly nancy and the girls slipped inside the castle i have a hunch nancy whispered that juli ana is imprisoned in the tower not in this build ing lets look there first the girls tiptoed along the winding corridor to the courtyard garden where the entrances to the towers were nancy tried the door of the one in which she had been imprisoned it was unlocked will you two please stand guard while i go upstairs she asked her friends they nodded and nancy ascended the circular iron staircase she was gone several minutes bess was becoming uneasy about her friend when she heard nancy returning no one there the young detective reported i looked out over the grounds too but didnt see anything suspicious where next george asked heres a trap door nancy replied pointing toward the floor what it opens into i havent been able to find out but some tools that werent here before are in that corner now i believe someone left them to lift the trap door carefully nancy inserted a finely edged tool in the crack then slipped a thin chisel through the space and depressed a catch using a crowbar the girls raised the heavy metal door cautiously they peered into the darkness be low nancy and george snapped on their flash lights they revealed a flight of iron steps leading into a long corridor grilled doors opened from it anyone down there nancy called no answer her own voice echoed weirdly just then nancy thought she heard a sound like a moan she hurried down the stairway followed by bess and george several cells lined one wall nancy flashed her light into the first cell it was a tiny room musty and dark the only visible sunlight filtered in through a high barred win dow these rooms look like old dungeons bess commented with a little shiver probably the heaths used them for storing food and other things george said the next two cells were empty but as the girls approached the fourth they distinctly heard some one moan pausing to listen they caught a pitiful cry from the far end of the corridor let me out let me out please help me nancy bess and george hurried up the pas sageway a small woman crippled and weak had pulled herself to the grilled doorway she clung there frightened and beseeching juliana johnson nancy said recognizing the lovely face in mrs fenimores photographs no no the prisoner shrank back i am miss fleur well talk about that later nancy told her kindly and unbolted the door she and bess assisted the woman along the musty corridor while george beamed the flash lights it was slow work because of julianas weak condition nancy introduced herself and the girls weve come to help you she added who brought you here have you been mistreated bess put in ive had enough to eat and drink the former dancer said but ive been so perplexed questioned by nancy she revealed what had happened to her a man who had shown an identification card of a government agent had taken her away from jardin des fleurs in a car it was dark when we reached this place i was hurried inside and locked in the cell i was told it was because of not paying enough income tax she ended the story what does it all mean thats not true nancy replied my father inquired a great deal has happened since you left your home ten years ago she added ii dont know what youre talking about you are juliana johnson nancy said with quiet conviction why not admit it no no never do you realize where you are now nancy asked taking a different tack you are at heath castle heath castle you meanwalt walter heath died a number of years ago nancy said gently he loved you to the end and willed all his property to you waltdead the woman whispered then he thought of me as i used to bebeautiful and a talented dancer he loved you for yourself bess spoke up not for your fame juliana brushed a wisp of straggling gray hair from her eyes her slumping shoulders stiffened but ive lost all my beauty вhe cried out oh i want to be left alone i have my farm take me back there please you mean you dont want heath castle george asked i loved heath castle and i loved walt juliana said brokenly but i hid myself away so that he never would see me in this condition per haps this is foolish pride but it seems best that i finish out my days as i am doing your sister vera wants to be with you very much said nancy she is a widow now with a little girl who looks a great deal like you juliana was deeply moved vera has a daugh ter she murmured where is she the childs name is joan she and her mother now mrs fenimore live in river heights joan likes flowers and gardening just as you do i cant tell you the whole story now but the two of then need you if i had known before juliana began at the beginning of my retirement i sent a letter to my sister but it came back i had no idea where the was mrs fenimore and joan want to leave the neighborhood where they live nancy put in joan would be so happy in these surroundings are the gardens still beautiful the former dancer asked dreamily nancy hated to tell the woman the truth she tried to soften it by saying they have been badly neglected but they could be landscaped again however only a person who truly loved the place would want to do it to me it would be a challenge juliana said with sudden spirit a memorial to walt but the castle and its grounds really are pretty large for three people what a wonderful place it would be for hand icapped children bess mused and id like to help them juliana an nounced yes ill make this place a beautiful spot again ill bring joan and vera here and later well see about the other children good nancy said well take you right to your sister and then ill go to settle my score with mr hector the group had finally reached the foot of the stairway before the former dancer could be helped up the steps a sardonic laugh echoed down to them ill make sure you dont get out a voice threatened the next instant the trap door dropped into place with a crash a heavy object was placed on top of it then all was quiet in the dungeon chapter xix release and capture nancy darted up the stairway to try opening the trap door as she had feared it did not budge george and bess pushed with all their might its hopeless said bess panting were all prisoners juliana johnson ex claimed nancy was fearful this new shock might under mine julianas health completely so she said i feel sure theres no cause for alarm when we fail to show up help will come i left a note at home but will the trap door be noticed by anyone juliana asked dubiously perhaps i can find another exit nancy said while bess remained with juliana nancy and george using flashlights searched the various cells they could find no exit the only openings were the high grilled windows nancy george said suddenly i brought a police whistle suppose i blow it great said nancy if you stand on my shoulders you should be able to reach one of the windows and signal for help george and nancy stepped into the nearest cell and went to the window with agility george climbed to nancys shoulders and clung to the iron grills of the window she blew a dozen shrill blasts with her whistle i hope itll work she said after dropping lightly to the floor she and nancy wondered how long they might have to wait and how long juliana could stand the added strain they returned to the others and sat down on the steps juliana had lapsed into silence but nancy gradually drew her out one of the first questions nancy asked was whether or not walter heath had given her a large pearl no but he was going to it was being made into a ring when i went away nancy next inquired if julianas fiance had had a special name for her yes he called me his little cinderella she said smiling at the recollection once walt asked me to put on one of my dancing slippers and make a print in a block of newly made ce ment he said he was going to set it in the garden wall opposite poets nook i suppose it was a lovers foolish idea that wasnt foolish nancy replied it was very sensible that footprint clue in the crum bling wall will prove your right to the heath fortune against any claim of an impostor juliana said please tell me the whole story i am terribly confused as kindly as she could nancy related all she knew how dreadful juliana exclaimed and what harrowing experiences you have had tell me something said nancy it was re ported that the hospital found a lot of money on you did you plan to stay away a long time oh no i was going to buy an expensive per sonal gift for walt from a man who wanted cash also i planned to purchase something for our home the former dancer sighed deeply suddenly the woman slumped forward in an instant nancy caught her and placed the limp body on the floor juliana has fainted bess cried out nancy was fearful that the woman was suffering from something more serious than a faint because the former dancers pulse was very weak under the flashlight her face looked chalkwhite the poor woman bess murmured she has been through so much the girls tried to revive juliana and finally succeeded we must get out of here said nancy at that moment they heard distant shouts out side listen george commanded the voices were coming closer george blew several loud blasts on her whistle where are you somebody called were the police there are four of us nancy shouted that they were below the trap door in the tower she called out directions and in another five minutes the four prisoners were re leased lieutenant masters exclaimed nancy how glad i am to see you did my father get in touch with you no hannah gruen did and who is this she asked smiling at the former dancer juliana herself replied to the question when nancy suggested that she ought not to expend her strength talking the woman insisted she felt much better who shut you in here the policewoman de manded im not sure nancy answered the voice was disguised i think but it might have been daniel hector he must have escaped oh no he didnt said a voice triumphantly we nabbed him climbing over a wall also these two birds two more policemen appeared with them handcuffed were cobb and biggs behind the men was daniel hector this is an outrage the lawyer snapped you cant arrest me i have a perfect right to be on this property the others are trespassing coolly nancy presented her evidence against the lawyer she accused him of stealing jewelry from the estate a claim that could be proved by photographs found in walter heaths box and thats not the worst she said to him you pretended to look for the woman who was to inherit the estate but when you did locate her you kept it a secret so you could help yourself to the estate when you found out i was on the trail of the real juliana johnson you had her kid napped and locked in the dungeon here to pro tect yourself you produced an impostor with whom you had made a bargain ridiculous hector cried furiously lies lies nothing but lies hector had not seen juliana yet she was seated on the winding stairs in the tower behind nancy the young sleuth now stepped aside hector stared at the crippled dancer so what he demanded after a moment i had nothing to do with bringing her here and she cant prove shes the missing dancer just look at her oh yes i can prove it juliana retorted with spirit the imprint of my dancing shoe is em bedded in a wall at heath castle furthermore i still have the slipper that made the imprint whats that got to do with it the real juliana is at the riverview hotel the lawyer blustered she has a note to prove her identity a note signed walt dont you mean half a note nancy asked i have the rest cobb and biggs looked startled you biggs cried where did you find it at the factory after the explosion the three men hung their heads guiltily ad mitting they had been there biggs added hooper here found the note in a desk hector sold he tore it in two pieces expecting the law yer to put up more money for the second half when one piece was lost we thought hector had found it in answer to nancys question if he were ted dys father the man nodded sullenly nancy explained to juliana that teddy had learned about the estate from joan teddy had told his father that juliana was missing cobb and biggs got together biggs suspected his former em ployer had hidden some valuable things in the estate walls and the two men convinced hector he ought to hire them to look for the treasure when they found a few items the men kept them you guessed right but i cant figure out how said biggs i know nothing about all this shouted the lawyer yes you do cobb hooper said bitterly you were behind the whole thing you brought the dogs to guard the estate but later i kept em tied up and then took em back to the kennel we were afraid of them ourselves biggs added mr hector said lieutenant masters it looks as if the case against you is pretty serious i tell you i never saw these men before the lawyer insisted nor that crippled woman either now all of you get out of here for a long second there was silence then juli ana slowly got to her feet her eyes ablaze she pointed a finger at hector and exclaimed arrest that man arrest him for kidnapping the wily lawyers jaw dropped then he re covered the woman is crazy he shouted the night you came to my farm and brought me here you wore a disguise juliana said ac cusingly at first i didnt recognize you but your voicei know your voice her eyes snapped with anger as she added i will bring charges against you to the fullest extent of the law for walter heaths sake daniel hector knew he was beaten but he would not give up yet he glared at nancy and cried out if you had minded your own business there wouldnt have been all this trouble but dont be so smug you think there are treasures and money for juliana youre wrong theres noth ing in the estate but debts she has inherited a wreck chapter xx a last surprise nothing in the estate nancy exclaimed what do you mean the angry lawyer refused to reply he and the other prisoners were led away by the police nancymiss masters and juliana headed for the fenimore home when they arrived juliana asked nancy to go in first and break the news oh youve found my sister mrs fenimore cried after nancy had told her you wonderful girl i dont care if we never have heath castle to think juliana is alive and we can be together again gently nancy warned her about julianas con dition the news was a shock but mrs fenimore took it bravely as juliana was brought in the sisters embraced and both cried a little then over and over the joyful women expressed their gratitude to nancy the young sleuth said she was glad to have ac complished what she had but was not satisfied to leave the case yet for days afterward she was tormented by all the distressing angles of the af fair in the meantime juliana had claimed her in heritance and had requested that all legal matters be attended to by mr drew the lawyer had lost no time in having hector and the other men prosecuted and also brought charges against the woman who had impersonated the dancer hooper and biggs admit having found several bottles of dye and a formula marked perfected formula hidden in the cloister walls mr drew told nancy theyve surrendered them and ive had an analysis made the dye has dried up but a newly made liquid would be of great value commercially if produced under the same condi tions that walter heath used what were they nancy asked sea salt was mixed with the spring water in the pond marine whelks which are a huge type of mollusk were imported and put into it they exude a beautiful purple dye after heaths death the whelks vanished nancy was thoughtful it would take a good bit of money to start up that business wouldnt it yes her father replied but it would be profitable for juliana the special shade of pur ple is difficult to imitate synthetically nancy had been hoping that hectors dire statement regarding the estate would not be true but part of it was mr drew had learned that the total heath assets were twenty dollars the walled grounds and a ruined castle with a few pieces of furniture the debts however were illegal loans which hector had made against the estate and which he would have to pay back account books had been falsified to show that huge sums had been paid to various detective agencies supposedly for the purpose of conduct ing a search for the missing juliana but the wily lawyer had kept the money unfortunately we cant recover it mr drew remarked to his daughter hector has spent it all and has little of his own left how about the heath pearl dad you didnt find it no ill keep on trying of course frankly i dont feel hopeful somewhere on those grounds said nancy there must be something of value hidden after all walter heath told sam weatherby there was another treasure ive had the place searched nancy workmen even removed the imprinted block of cement be low the wall fountain but there was nothing be hind it heath castle will have to be sold but im afraid he went on the sale price wont be much considering its present condition juliana wants to keep the property but she cant she has barely enough funds to operate jardin des fleurs it was some consolation to nancy that she had brought the sisters together but she felt as if she had failed in one of the most vital tasks of her life even if i did find juliana i wasnt able to save the estate or help the fenimores financially and they need money so badly unwilling to give up nancy drove out to the estate one day after lunch to try to find the treas ure which walter heath had mentioned what can it be and where she asked herself its supposed to be in plain sight nancy worked her way doggedly through the neglected grounds and examined the statuary though not an expert she could tell that none of it was unusual she looked at a grove of fruit trees which might become a source of profit but the trees were too old finally the young detective hot thirsty and discouraged arrived at the little garden off the cloister as nancy walked toward the fountain she suddenly stopped short and stared at the sparkling stream of water thats it she exclaimed softly spring water cold clear delicious and probably pure it might even have minerals in it nancy could visualize the estate as a health resort where people came to rest and drink the water or it could be bottled and sold the thought excited by the idea nancy quenched her thirst then hurried home to telephone her father he promised to have the spring tested in the morning the next afternoon the drews were delighted to learn that the water was pure and rich in minerals a further search of the grounds revealed several more beneficial springs the supply is plentiful nancy told bess and george dad will probably make arrangements with a bottling company to market it in the meantime nancy had remembered the beautiful shells she had found in the pond saying nothing to juliana she sent one of them to a company in new york which specialized in mak ing fine motherofpearl jewelry the answer came back promptly the firm would buy at a good price all similar shells nancy youre wonderful exclaimed juliana when nancy telephoned her about it the bottling company also offered financial backing to convert part of the castle and grounds into a health resort thats wonderful juliana cried out now i can afford to turn a section of the castle and grounds into a free vacation spot for handicapped children and of course my sister and joan and i will occupy some of the rooms youve certainly changed our lives nancy she added gratefully and now the heath prop erty will become beautiful again a year later upon invitation nancy bess george mr drew and lieutenant masters jour neyed to the estate to view the many changes the great gate stood open the visitors drove up a winding road between avenues of trimmed hedge and trees the three girls smiled when they re called how different everything had seemed to them on their former trips there it doesnt make me feel a bit creepy now bess remarked those penetrating eyes that spied on us from behind the evergreen nancy said were hoopers or biggs with cobb hooper in jail what has become of mrs hooper and teddy asked george shes working the policewoman replied teddy has been sent to a special school where hes doing very well the visitors got out of the car near the restored loggia and paused to admire the repairs to the crumbling walls the gardens were a mass of bloom the lawn in front of the castle was velvety smooth with no weeds how did juliana ever accomplish so much in such a short time george asked nancy replied she imported her gardeners from jardin des fleurs bess called the girls attention to the children who had come out on the lawn to play a few were in wheelchairs but they pushed themselves about with amazing skill juliana is doing remarkable work with these youngsters said lieutenant masters shes put ting new spirit into them joan is developing into a fine little girl too shes proving to be a great help to her aunt what is she doing bess asked juliana with the help of a therapist teaches exercises to the children to restore nimbleness to their bodies joan does the demonstrating and incidentally joan is the delight of her aunt shes going to be a wonderful dancer someday and carry on from where juliana left off bess said dreamily the callers were greeted cordially by the mis tress of heath castle and her sister mrs feni more now restored to health and looking very attractive with a fashionable new hairdo both women thanked bess and george tor their excel lent assistance to nancy in solving the mystery joan hugged nancy and the others happily oh come see my garden she exclaimed and showed them a small plot of beautifully tended flowers in front of the castle tea was served on the terrace afterward juli ana led her guests to the little garden where nancy had discovered the spring children were playing on the shady walks the water is helping to build strong bodies juliana said proudly oh it means so much to me to bring these boys and girls here id never have forgiven myself if i had returned to a lonely life at jardin des fleurs by the way i sold it at a nice profit mr drew had been waiting for this very mo ment he took a tiny box from his pocket and slipped it into julianas hand a little surprise he explained smiling the woman slowly raised the lid nestled in purple velvet was a ring set with a huge pearl not the one walt meant for me juliana asked dazed yes but how did you recover it i thought mr hector had found the ring and sold it he had but dad was able to trace it nancy spoke up mr hector failed to notice the in scription inside tears filled julianas eyes as she read to my cinderella ill wear the ring always in mem ory of walt she whispered her voice trembling oh nancy my dear friendand mr drew and bess and george and lieutenant masters also my dear friendsyouve made me very very happy the young detective smiled glad that every thing had worked out so successfully her gaze wandered along the stately cloister of heath cas tle with the afternoon sun sinking low the shadowy passageway had never looked more beau tiful it was peaceful and quiet and nothing was fur ther from nancys thoughts than a new mystery yet in a short time she would be working on an other exciting case called mystery of the tolling bell dont thank me for helping you juliana she said earnestly taking the womans hand thank the crumbling walls they contained the clues that brought you here to me heath castle will always remain a symbol of mystery and romance
