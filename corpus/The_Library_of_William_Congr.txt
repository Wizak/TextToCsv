the library of william congreve introduction when william congreve died in he left a collection of books which his old friend and publisher jacob tonson described in a letter preserved at the bodleian as genteel well chosen tonson thought so well of the collection that he urged his nephew then his agent in london to purchase congreves books but congreve had willed them to henrietta the young duchess of marlborough who was much concerned with keeping intact as she wrote in her will all mr congreaves personal estate that he left me in order to pass it along to her youngest daughter mary this daughter said by gossip to have been congreves daughter also married the fourth duke of leeds in and thus congreves books eventually found their way to hornby castle chief seat of the leeds family in yorkshire there apparently most of congreves books remained until about when the eleventh duke of leeds sold his english estates and authorized sothebys to auction off aselected portion of the valuable library at hornby castle among the items advertised for sale on june and were ten books containing the signature of william congreve these ten along with a few others that have been discovered here and there with congreves name on the title page and nine books published by subscription with congreves name in the printed list of subscribers made a total of some thirtyodd books known to have been in congreves library these we may presume were but a small part of the congreve books which had been incorporated with the leeds family library in finding and identifying congreves book list and his books among the voluminous papers of the leeds family now stored in the british museum the public record office and several other depositories in england are at least a halfdozen manuscript lists or catalogues of leeds books in one list from the middle of the eighteenth century appear a few of the books known to have been in congreves library the same is true of lists dated and but it is impossible to use any of these to determine exactly which of the books had once been congreves fortunately another manuscript list proves to be not a combination of congreve and leeds books but a separate catalogue of congreves private library this list herewith printed was found by the editor in an english county depository the yorkshire archaeological society in the city of leeds let us see why we may accept this list as congreves and not simply another catalogue of leeds family books as the librarian of the society had classified it in the first place it was found among the leeds papers in one of the sixteen boxes of manuscripts brought away from hornby castle shortly before it was torn down about among the same papers interestingly enough is a copy of the marriage settlement on the original parchment whereby mary godolphin brought to the leeds family the books which she had inherited through her mother from congreve the list was just where a congreve document might have been expected in fact the list was discovered incidentally while the leeds papers were being searched as the most promising place to find congreve letters not a single letter to or from congreve was to be found perhaps because the gossip to the effect that mary was the natural daughter of congreve had caused the family to destroy or mutilate documents bearing his name congreves copy of terence number in the list is a good illustration on the title page the signature will congreve was once entirely blotted out by the same ink that wrote leeds at the side but the two centuries that have since passed have caused the leeds ink to fade and thus show very distinctly the clear black signature of the dramatist as for congreves page manuscript book list evidently it was too useful to destroy too valuable a record of the fine collection acquired by the leeds family so the list was kept but the identifying title at the head of the list was crossed out except for its opening word bibliotheca although the name following that word is illegible for the average reader one who knows what to look for can still trace out gulmi congreve armigeri see frontispiece we do not however need to depend on this reading to prove that the manuscript lists the books of william congreve esquire all the proof needed is to be found in the list itself the items bear dates between and with fourteen entries for the last year of congreves life the list includes every one of the works and the exact edition of it for which congreve is known to have subscribed such as rowes translation of lucans pharsalia and bononcinis cantate e duetti furthermore it includes the identical edition of each book said by the sotheby catalogue for the leeds sale of to bear the signature of congreve but the most convincing proof that the list could have belonged only to congreve is provided by three quarto volumes each with congreves signature on the title page bound together as one volume this volume as described by the sotheby catalogue for the leeds sale was made up of drydens of dramatick poesie horaces art of poetry made english by the earl of roscommon and the rehearsal in other words the three separate quartos had been specially bound together to form a unique volume one to be found only in congreves library this same unique volume appears as item number in the manuscript list where it is described as one of the miscellanies bound together consisting of drydens essay on dram poetry horaces art of poetry by ye e of roscommon and the rehearsal the identical three quartos described in the sotheby catalogue in june while the selected books from the leeds library were being sold at sothebys in london in a threeday sale referred to hereafter as the leeds sale the remaining contents of hornby castle were auctioned off by knight frank and rutley at old hornby castle in yorkshire in a sevenday sale referred to hereafter as the hornby castle sale the books which made only a minor part of the latter sale were all auctioned off on the sixth day these books were catalogued as lots through with from to books in a single lot making a total of about only a very small fraction of these were mentioned by title in the printed catalogue and nothing was said about signatures on title pages but among those mentioned appear twentyone of the exact editions in congreves list numbers among the selected books catalogued for the leeds sale appear sixtyone of the exact editions in congreves list numbers or since congreves books had been incorporated with the leeds library in we can understand how eightytwo of the identical editions in the list could turn up in sales of leeds books in most of the eightytwo exact editions named and many of the thousands of unnamed books in these sales were probably once congreves the fact that sothebys catalogue mentions the congreve signature in only ten books suggests that he usually failed to write his name in his books sotheby lists most of the books for which congreve is known to have subscribed and yet no mention is made of a congreve signature in any of them nor does any signature appear in the special edition of rowes shakespeare number in the list now in the folger shakespeare library and almost certainly once congreves but other books besides the ten mentioned by sothebys were signed by congreve one example is sothebys item number congreves number which was sold to mcleish and sons and then to es de beer esq before the unmistakable signature of the dramatist was noted another example is congreves number which was in the hornby castle sale and bears the true signature wm congreve especially significant is a letter to the editor dated august from her grace katherine duchess of the tenth duke of leeds stating that many years ago she had herself made a great hunt for any books at hornby castle bearing the signature of congreve had found numbers of them and had made a full catalogue with the aid of mr charles whibley the writer bibliophile unfortunately this catalogue has been lost if it is ever found it will be an interesting record of autographed congreve books held together by one family for nearly two centuries but the catalogue could not include all the items on the congreve list since as we have seen the dramatist evidently owned many books in which he failed to write his name in the twentyodd books known to have been autographed by the dramatist the signature is commonly will congreve but the surname is sometimes preceded by w wm willm gul gulielmi or gulielmus one of congreves books number in the list preserved in the yale library uses both w congreve and gulielmus congreve in different signatures none of the signatures should be accepted as that of the dramatist until the handwriting is verified for william has long been a common christian name in the congreve family in there were living no fewer than five congreves bearing this name all descended from the same grandfather one of these was colonel william congreve of highgate acousin of the dramatist whose papers have been confused with those of the dramatist in many sales as well as in many american libraries the colonel usually signed will as did the dramatist but the two cousins formed the w in strikingly different ways the colonel rounded the first upper prong of this letter and brought the middle prong to only little more than half the height of the other prongs the dramatist sharpened the first prong and brought the middle prong fully up to the height of the others since the present duke of leeds reports that he no longer has books bearing congreves signature we may presume that they were largely if not fully disposed of in the two sales of and are now widely scattered books with congreves signature are preserved at the yale library congreves numbers at the library of the university of tennessee numbers at the morgan library number at the boston public library number at the brotherton library of the university of leeds number and in the private libraries of es de beer esq number and the reverend jf gerrard number the editor of this work will be grateful for information concerning the location of other volumes bearing the true signature of william congreve such volumes will be doubly interesting if annotated in the dramatists handwriting some of the books were thus annotated according to jacob tonson in his letter of january afew days after congreves death to his nephew jacob tonson junior his congreves collection of books were very genteel well chosen iwish you should think them worth your buying ithink there are in these books several notes of his own or corrections everything from him will be very valuable editing and printing the book list the manuscript list consists of entries arranged in rough alphabetical order on fortyfour pages in a sort of journal approximately seven by eleven inches in size the normal entry gives the name of the author for perhaps threefourths of the entries the short title the format the place and date of publication and sometimes the publisher and finally after most of the items appears the theca or shelf number one of shelves on which congreve arranged his books at his lodgings in surrey street london the list is set down in three distinct hands that no one of these is congreves need not surprise us since congreve had very defective eyesight during the last half of his life an adequate income from government posts enabled him at this period to employ a secretary perhaps the young amanuensis that he speaks of in writing to pope about that was the year it seems when the bulk of the list of the items was made out the year is indicated by the fact that this hand enters titles of books published through but none later after each alphabetical group a space is left as if for additions and into these spaces a distinctive second hand has made thirtyone entries including some as late as but none later then follow fortyone entries by a third hand including four for and fourteen for but none later entries by the third hand are probably for books added to the library during congreves final illness it is interesting to note that none of the entries in this last hand are followed by a theca or shelf location an omission indicating that by the time these titles were entered the library had been moved from the original quarters in surrey street perhaps the young duchess owner of the books after congreves death had already moved them to her house in st jamess and possibly the hand is that of her secretary a small cross is marked before most of the items before all but fiftyeight or thirtyseven when allowance is made for duplicates perhaps these crosses were used in connection with an inventory taken in when the books were inherited by the young duchess of marlborough or in when the books were incorporated by marriage settlement into the leeds library the thirtyseven items then missing as indicated by the lack of a cross in congreves list were numbers and the two books that had been lent to ld hervy see congreves number and to the duchess of marlborough see number were in place at the time of the inventory and each was duly acknowledged by a cross an additional larger cross surrounded by four dots appears before eleven items numbers and to indicate books sent so the librarian says in a marginal note to the duchess of leeds these larger crosses could not have been made of course before congreves book list is here edited and printed for the first time after the numbers which are supplied by the editor to facilitate cross references and indexing the items of the list are printed with spelling capitalization and punctuation as in the manuscript occasional raised letters such as the r in mr and the e in ye are brought down into the line the great variety of dots and dashes used to indicate shortened titles are consistently eliminated underscored words are printed in italics the line breaks in the manuscript are indicated by shilling marks in the manuscript many of the theca numbers have been written over older numbers indicating no doubt ashifting of the books to different shelves most of the older numbers are illegible and only the newer more legible numbers are printed the occasional use of brackets in the manuscript as in numbers and makes impractical the editorial expansion in brackets of such abbreviations as p in no for par and in no for per the thirtyone entries by the second hand and the fortyone by the third hand numbers etc are designated by the first line of the annotation in the paragraph following each item from the manuscript list the editor attempts to give the authors name with dates of his birth and death to fill out the short title somewhat when it seems interesting or helpful in identification and to show the place of publication the name of the publisher the year of publication and the format the letters v for u and i for j are usually given the english equivalents otherwise the short title follows the spelling and punctuation of the title page of the copy examined usually a copy in one of the key libraries with capitalization for only the first word of the title and for proper names the line immediately below this paragraph is reserved for the number if any in the shorttitle catalogue abbreviated stc for the period ending and wing for the later period and specialized bibliographies and for a short list of libraries in which a copy of the exact edition may be consulted then follows for some items asecond paragraph of pertinent editorial comment all the items in congreves list have been identified at least tentatively there is most uncertainty perhaps about numbers and besides these twenty others though well enough known in some edition have not been found in any library in the identical edition of congreves list numbers and furthermore numbers and present difficulties perhaps due to errors on the part of the person making the manuscript entry it will be noticed that forty or more of the items have not been found in the format given by the manuscript list this discrepancy may be explained at least in part by the tendency of the makers of the list to judge the format merely by size for example alarge duodecimo number is called an octavo while many small octavos numbers etc are called duodecimos the discrepancies involve chiefly the smaller volumes not a single folio volume is involved the finding lists of libraries where copies of the exact editions in congreves list may be consulted have been arranged geographically including usually one european library and several american libraries located from new england to the pacific coast the ideal has been to find a copy in each of seven key libraries the british museum europe harvard new england the new york public library the folger shakespeare library and the library of congress middle atlantic the newberry library middle west and the huntington library west the editor has checked congreves list with the catalogues of the seven key libraries except for the new york public library and the newberry library where the checking was done by members of the respective library staffs occasionally an ideal distribution in the seven libraries is found as for numbers and whenever an edition is not available in the key library an effort has been made to find it in another library of the region for books not at the british museum references are made to the bodleian the bibliothque nationale or other european libraries books not at harvard are most frequently found at yale or the boston public library those not at the huntington library are frequently at the nearby william andrews clark memorial library of the american libraries in the finding lists exclusive of the key libraries the editor has examined practically all editions cited at the boston public library the yale library and the clark library other american libraries are for the most part cited on the authority of the union catalog of the library of congress of the european libraries exclusive of the british museum the editor has examined practically all editions cited at libraries in paris brussels the hague leiden amsterdam florence rome oxford and cambridge and at the various legal and medical libraries in london other english libraries are cited on the authority of the national central library london in congreves list about sixtytwo of the entries are cross references or else duplicate entries on the other hand some entries account for more than a single title numbers for example include a total of twentysix titles there are approximately separate titles in the list of these about per cent may be found in the british museum per cent in the harvard library per cent in the library of congress per cent in the new york public library per cent in the huntington library per cent in the newberry library and per cent in the folger shakespeare library at the bodleian may be consulted about thirtyfour titles not in the british museum and at the bibliothque nationale about thirtyseven titles in neither the british museum nor the bodleian at yale there are about sixtyeight titles not at harvard and at the clark library about fortyseven titles not at the huntington using congreves book list we may well ask what are some of the uses that can be made of congreves book list for one thing it may be studied as a carefully selected private library of the period what authors what editions what subjects are to be found in such a library which of congreves contemporaries are represented which of the current books seemed important enough for a fellow writer to buy or to subscribe for in advance of publication to what extent did the literature of ancient greece of rome of modern italy of france of spain of germany find its way into a private library in englands augustan age and to what extent were such books in their original language one scholar has found in congreves book list the information he needed about certain early editions of horace another inquiring into the italian influence on england during the eighteenth century has found a partial answer in the italian books and in the books about italy set down in congreves list fortunately the list can be made to give information about the one who collected and used the books we know less perhaps about congreve than about any other equally significant writer of the period and consequently additional information about him is especially important we have long known of course that he made translations from the french the latin and the greek and have assumed that he read those languages we feel more confident about the extent of his reading when we find a full fourth of his library in french nearly a fifth in latin and a goodly number of volumes in greek about twenty titles in italian make us reasonably sure that he read that language also and since he had in spanish only a spanishenglish dictionary and two spanish books for each of which he had a translation in another language we may assume that his knowledge of spanish must have been slight indeed his deficiency in german is strongly suggested by the fact that german is represented in the list only in translation as a translator from the greek and the latin congreve first brought himself to the attention of dryden who pronounced the youthful congreve more capable than any man i know to translate the whole of homer congreve never completed that proposed translation but years later he was singled out by pope for the dedication of his homer that congreves genuine interest in the classics continued throughout his life is attested by the constant and carefully chosen additions to his library his collection is richest in the works of cicero homer horace and virgil but he owned the collected works of many other classical authors the breadth of his interest is shown by the fact that over sixty greek and latin writers are either represented in his library or referred to in his own writings the italian louis riccoboni visited congreve in and was surprised to find that a dramatist could be so scholarly in congreve he said taste was joined with great learning footnote from riccobonis an historical and critical account of the theatre in europe p one of the last books added to congreves library was riccobonis histoire du thtre italien paris see number certain items in the inventory tend to confirm reports that have hitherto been given little credit one of these has to do with congreves interest in horses and horseback riding which seems to be supported by item number the gentlemans jockey and approved farrier instructing in the natures causes and cures of all diseases incident to horses vo london many people will find it difficult to associate with congreve a special interest in horses particularly an interest that extended beyond his youth as suggested by the late date another report that has seemed even less in keeping with congreve concerns the impact of quakerism on him could he have taken a special interest in one of the quakers visited him repeatedly and could he have seriously considered adopting the beliefs of the quakers the report that he did so has not been taken seriously but we must not overlook the fact that congreve owned as item number in his list the most important document of quakerism the page analysis and defense by robert barclay entitled an apology for the true christian divinity as the same is held forth and preached by the people called in scorn quakers london or congreve did not like his friend jonathan swift lose interest in the purchase of books during the last third of his life for swifts library we have an inventory made when swift was about fifty another inventory at his death more than twentyfive years later showed but few additions in the case of congreve the earliest inventory the items in the first hand made out about came only three years before his death but active buying must have continued throughout his life as shown by the dates in the imprints the thirtyone entries by the second hand seem to indicate approximately the purchases for and the fortyone entries by the third hand approximately those for congreve was evidently an active purchaser of books from his youth and did not stop during his last years congreves list emphasizes collected editions especially for plays and contains very few quartos when he collected his works in three volumes in he apparently destroyed at least he did not list the earlier editions of his plays in quarto he loved to write such ballads as the racy jack frenchmans defeat but he never recognized these by including them in his book list or in his collected works nor did he list his youthful novel incognita if indeed he had a copy of it such omissions were later made by men with much greater novels to their credit in the sales catalogues listing the books of defoe and fielding one looks in vain for robinson crusoe or tom jones but perhaps most important is the information given by the list about congreves special fields of interest and the fact that the list provides likely sources for his literary work mention should be made of his fine collection of drama greek roman french and english of some one hundred titles of literary criticism of nearly as many carefully selected works in biography and history of a choice collection of thirty travel books and somewhat smaller lots in medicine music and cookery many of the books might be classified under religion and philosophy the poets both english and foreign are well represented and surprisingly enough there are more than one hundred items of prose fiction chiefly french the influence of this fiction if any on congreves own incognita and the influence of the literary criticism on his essay concerning humour in comedy are only two of many studies that might be based on congreves book list perhaps someone will use the works on astrology to help account for one of his humorous characters old foresight of love for love since many of the items consist of collected works the library is actually more extensive than the number of items might indicate jacob tonson had good reason for wanting his nephew to buy congreves genteel well chosen library acknowledgments the editor is deeply grateful to the many librarians on both sides of the atlantic and to others who have generously assisted in the preparation of this study agrant from the american philosophical society in made possible the search which incidentally turned up congreves manuscript book list and grants from the henry ehuntington memorial library and the folger shakespeare library provided time and rare faculties for the editing the staff of the union catalog of the library of congress has located in america editions in the book list not already included in the catalog splfilon esq of the national central library in london has helped with english books neither in the british museum nor in the libraries at oxford and cambridge and dr stanley pargellis has very kindly had congreves list checked for all items in the newberry library the reserve division has noted all titles in the new york public library to his grace the duke of leeds and to the trustees
