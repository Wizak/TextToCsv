bit of the village from the wharf the day of rest a provincetown fishingvessel i the shipwreck wishing to get a better view than i had yet had of the ocean which we are told covers more than twothirds of the globe but of which a man who lives a few miles inland may never see any trace more than of another world i made a visit to cape cod in october another the succeeding june and another to truro in july the first and last time with a single companion the second time alone i have spent in all about three weeks on the cape walked from eastham to provincetown twice on the atlantic side and once on the bay side also excepting four or five miles and crossed the cape half a dozen times on my way but having come so fresh to the sea i have got but little salted my readers must expect only so much saltness as the land breeze acquires from blowing over an arm of the sea or is tasted on the windows and the bark of trees twenty miles inland after september gales i have been accustomed to make excursions to the ponds within ten miles of concord but latterly i have extended my excursions to the seashore i did not see why i might not make a book on cape cod as well as my neighbor on human culture it is but another name for the same thing and hardly a sandier phase of it as for my title i suppose that the word cape is from the french cap which is from the latin caput a head which is perhaps from the verb capere to take that being the part by which we take hold of a thing take time by the forelock it is also the safest part to take a serpent by and as for cod that was derived directly from that great store of codfish which captain bartholomew gosnold caught there in which fish appears to have been so called from the saxon word codde a case in which seeds are lodged either from the form of the fish or the quantity of spawn it contains whence also perhaps codling pomum coctile and coddle to cook green like peas v dic cape cod is the bared and bended arm of massachusetts the shoulder is at buzzards bay the elbow or crazybone at cape mallebarre the wrist at truro and the sandy fist at provincetown behind which the state stands on her guard with her back to the green mountains and her feet planted on the floor of the ocean like an athlete protecting her bay boxing with northeast storms and ever and anon heaving up her atlantic adversary from the lap of earth ready to thrust forward her other fist which keeps guard the while upon her breast at cape ann on studying the map i saw that there must be an uninterrupted beach on the east or outside of the forearm of the cape more than thirty miles from the general line of the coast which would afford a good sea view but that on account of an opening in the beach forming the entrance to nauset harbor in orleans i must strike it in eastham if i approached it by land and probably i could walk thence straight to race point about twentyeight miles and not meet with any obstruction we left concord massachusetts on tuesday october th on reaching boston we found that the provincetown steamer which should have got in the day before had not yet arrived on account of a violent storm and as we noticed in the streets a handbill headed death one hundred and fortyfive lives lost at cohasset we decided to go by way of cohasset we found many irish in the cars going to identify bodies and to sympathize with the survivors and also to attend the funeral which was to take place in the afternoon and when we arrived at cohasset it appeared that nearly all the passengers were bound for the beach which was about a mile distant and many other persons were flocking in from the neighboring country there were several hundreds of them streaming off over cohasset common in that direction some on foot and some in wagons and among them were some sportsmen in their huntingjackets with their guns and gamebags and dogs as we passed the graveyard we saw a large hole like a cellar freshly dug there and just before reaching the shore by a pleasantly winding and rocky road we met several hayriggings and farmwagons coming away toward the meetinghouse each loaded with three large rough deal boxes we did not need to ask what was in them the owners of the wagons were made the undertakers many horses in carriages were fastened to the fences near the shore and for a mile or more up and down the beach was covered with people looking out for bodies and examining the fragments of the wreck there was a small island called brook island with a hut on it lying just off the shore this is said to be the rockiest shore in massachusetts from nantasket to scituate hard sienitic rocks which the waves have laid bare but have not been able to crumble it has been the scene of many a shipwreck the brig st john from galway ireland laden with emigrants was wrecked on sunday morning it was now tuesday morning and the sea was still breaking violently on the rocks there were eighteen or twenty of the same large boxes that i have mentioned lying on a green hillside a few rods from the water and surrounded by a crowd the bodies which had been recovered twentyseven or eight in all had been collected there some were rapidly nailing down the lids others were carting the boxes away and others were lifting the lids which were yet loose and peeping under the cloths for each body with such rags as still adhered to it was covered loosely with a white sheet i witnessed no signs of grief but there was a sober dispatch of business which was affecting one man was seeking to identify a particular body and one undertaker or carpenter was calling to another to know in what box a certain child was put i saw many marble feet and matted heads as the cloths were raised and one livid swollen and mangled body of a drowned girl who probably had intended to go out to service in some american family to which some rags still adhered with a string half concealed by the flesh about its swollen neck the coiledup wreck of a human hulk gashed by the rocks or fishes so that the bone and muscle were exposed but quite bloodless merely red and white with wideopen and staring eyes yet lustreless deadlights or like the cabin windows of a stranded vessel filled with sand sometimes there were two or more children or a parent and child in the same box and on the lid would perhaps be written with red chalk bridget suchaone and sisters child the surrounding sward was covered with bits of sails and clothing i have since heard from one who lives by this beach that a woman who had come over before but had left her infant behind for her sister to bring came and looked into these boxes and saw in one probably the same whose superscription i have quoted her child in her sisters arms as if the sister had meant to be found thus and within three days after the mother died from the effect of that sight we turned from this and walked along the rocky shore in the first cove were strewn what seemed the fragments of a vessel in small pieces mixed with sand and seaweed and great quantities of feathers but it looked so old and rusty that i at first took it to be some old wreck which had lain there many years i even thought of captain kidd and that the feathers were those which seafowl had cast there and perhaps there might be some tradition about it in the neighborhood i asked a sailor if that was the st john he said it was i asked him where she struck he pointed to a rock in front of us a mile from the shore called the grampus rock and added you can see a part of her now sticking up it looks like a small boat i saw it it was thought to be held by the chaincables and the anchors i asked if the bodies which i saw were all that were drowned not a quarter of them said he where are the rest most of them right underneath that piece you see it appeared to us that there was enough rubbish to make the wreck of a large vessel in this cove alone and that it would take many days to cart it off it was several feet deep and here and there was a bonnet or a jacket on it in the very midst of the crowd about this wreck there were men with carts busily collecting the seaweed which the storm had cast up and conveying it beyond the reach of the tide though they were often obliged to separate fragments of clothing from it and they might at any moment have found a human body under it drown who might they did not forget that this weed was a valuable manure this shipwreck had not produced a visible vibration in the fabric of society about a mile south we could see rising above the rocks the masts of the british brig which the st john had endeavored to follow which had slipped her cables and by good luck run into the mouth of cohasset harbor a little further along the shore we saw a mans clothes on a rock further a womans scarf a gown a straw bonnet the brigs caboose and one of her masts high and dry broken into several pieces in another rocky cove several rods from the water and behind rocks twenty feet high lay a part of one side of the vessel still hanging together it was perhaps forty feet long by fourteen wide i was even more surprised at the power of the waves exhibited on this shattered fragment than i had been at the sight of the smaller fragments before the largest timbers and iron braces were broken superfluously and i saw that no material could withstand the power of the waves that iron must go to pieces in such a case and an iron vessel would be cracked up like an eggshell on the rocks some of these timbers however were so rotten that i could almost thrust my umbrella through them they told us that some were saved on this piece and also showed where the sea had heaved it into this cove which was now dry when i saw where it had come in and in what condition i wondered that any had been saved on it a little further on a crowd of men was collected around the mate of the st john who was telling his story he was a slimlooking youth who spoke of the captain as the master and seemed a little excited he was saying that when they jumped into the boat she filled and the vessel lurching the weight of the water in the boat caused the painter to break and so they were separated whereat one man came away saying well i dont see but he tells a straight story enough you see the weight of the water in the boat broke the painter a boat full of water is very heavy and so on in a loud and impertinently earnest tone as if he had a bet depending on it but had no humane interest in the matter another a large man stood near by upon a rock gazing into the sea and chewing large quids of tobacco as if that habit were forever confirmed with him come says another to his companion lets be off weve seen the whole of it its no use to stay to the funeral further we saw one standing upon a rock who we were told was one that was saved he was a soberlooking man dressed in a jacket and gray pantaloons with his hands in the pockets i asked him a few questions which he answered but he seemed unwilling to talk about it and soon walked away by his side stood one of the lifeboatmen in an oilcloth jacket who told us how they went to the relief of the british brig thinking that the boat of the st john which they passed on the way held all her crew for the waves prevented their seeing those who were on the vessel though they might have saved some had they known there were any there a little further was the flag of the st john spread on a rock to dry and held down by stones at the corners this frail but essential and significant portion of the vessel which had so long been the sport of the winds was sure to reach the shore there were one or two houses visible from these rocks in which were some of the survivors recovering from the shock which their bodies and minds had sustained one was not expected to live we kept on down the shore as far as a promontory called whitehead that we might see more of the cohasset rocks in a little cove within half a mile there were an old man and his son collecting with their team the seaweed which that fatal storm had cast up as serenely employed as if there had never been a wreck in the world though they were within sight of the grampus rock on which the st john had struck the old man had heard that there was a wreck and knew most of the particulars but he said that he had not been up there since it happened it was the wrecked weed that concerned him most rockweed kelp and seaweed as he named them which he carted to his barnyard and those bodies were to him but other weeds which the tide cast up but which were of no use to him we afterwards came to the lifeboat in its harbor waiting for another emergency and in the afternoon we saw the funeral procession at a distance at the head of which walked the captain with the other survivors on the whole it was not so impressive a scene as i might have expected if i had found one body cast upon the beach in some lonely place it would have affected me more i sympathized rather with the winds and waves as if to toss and mangle these poor human bodies was the order of the day if this was the law of nature why waste any time in awe or pity if the last day were come we should not think so much about the separation of friends or the blighted prospects of individuals i saw that corpses might be multiplied as on the field of battle till they no longer affected us in any degree as exceptions to the common lot of humanity take all the graveyards together they are always the majority it is the individual and private that demands our sympathy a man can attend but one funeral in the course of his life can behold but one corpse yet i saw that the inhabitants of the shore would be not a little affected by this event they would watch there many days and nights for the sea to give up its dead and their imaginations and sympathies would supply the place of mourners far away who as yet knew not of the wreck many days after this something white was seen floating on the water by one who was sauntering on the beach it was approached in a boat and found to be the body of a woman which had risen in an upright position whose white cap was blown back with the wind i saw that the beauty of the shore itself was wrecked for many a lonely walker there until he could perceive at last how its beauty was enhanced by wrecks like this and it acquired thus a rarer and sublimer beauty still illustration cohasset the little cove at whitehead promontory why care for these dead bodies they really have no friends but the worms or fishes their owners were coming to the new world as columbus and the pilgrims did they were within a mile of its shores but before they could reach it they emigrated to a newer world than ever columbus dreamed of yet one of whose existence we believe that there is far more universal and convincing evidence though it has not yet been discovered by science than columbus had of this not merely mariners tales and some paltry driftwood and seaweed but a continual drift and instinct to all our shores i saw their empty hulks that came to land but they themselves meanwhile were cast upon some shore yet further west toward which we are all tending and which we shall reach at last it may be through storm and darkness as they did no doubt we have reason to thank god that they have not been shipwrecked into life again the mariner who makes the safest port in heaven perchance seems to his friends on earth to be shipwrecked for they deem boston harbor the better place though perhaps invisible to them a skillful pilot comes to meet him and the fairest and balmiest gales blow off that coast his good ship makes the land in halcyon days and he kisses the shore in rapture there while his old hulk tosses in the surf here it is hard to part with ones body but no doubt it is easy enough to do without it when once it is gone all their plans and hopes burst like a bubble infants by the score dashed on the rocks by the enraged atlantic ocean no no if the st john did not make her port here she has been telegraphed there the strongest wind cannot stagger a spirit it is a spirits breath a just mans purpose cannot be split on any grampus or material rock but itself will split rocks till it succeeds the verses addressed to columbus dying may with slight alterations be applied to the passengers of the st john soon with them will all be over soon the voyage will be begun that shall bear them to discover far away a land unknown land that each alone must visit but no tidings bring to men for no sailor once departed ever hath returned again no carved wood no broken branches ever drift from that far wild he who on that ocean launches meets no corse of angel child undismayed my noble sailors spread then spread your canvas out spirits on a sea of ether soon shall ye serenely float where the deep no plummet soundeth fear no hidden breakers there and the fanning wing of angels shall your bark right onward bear quit now full of heart and comfort these rude shores they are of earth where the rosy clouds are parting there the blessed isles loom forth one summer day since this i came this way on foot along the shore from boston it was so warm that some horses had climbed to the very top of the ramparts of the old fort at hull where there was hardly room to turn round for the sake of the breeze the datura stramonium or thornapple was in full bloom along the beach and at sight of this cosmopolite this captain cook among plants carried in ballast all over the world i felt as if i were on the highway of nations say rather this viking king of the bays for it is not an innocent plant it suggests not merely commerce but its attendant vices as if its fibres were the stuff of which pirates spin their yarns i heard the voices of men shouting aboard a vessel half a mile from the shore which sounded as if they were in a barn in the country they being between the sails it was a purely rural sound as i looked over the water i saw the isles rapidly wasting away the sea nibbling voraciously at the continent the springing arch of a hill suddenly interrupted as at point alderton what botanists might call premorse showing by its curve against the sky how much space it must have occupied where now was water only on the other hand these wrecks of isles were being fancifully arranged into new shores as at hog island inside of hull where everything seemed to be gently lapsing into futurity this isle had got the very form of a ripple and i thought that the inhabitants should bear a ripple for device on their shields a wave passing over them with the datura which is said to produce mental alienation of long duration without affecting the bodily health springing from its edge the most interesting thing which i heard of in this township of hull was an unfailing spring whose locality was pointed out to me on the side of a distant hill as i was panting along the shore though i did not visit it perhaps if i should go through rome it would be some spring on the capitoline hill i should remember the longest it is true i was somewhat interested in the well at the old french fort which was said to be ninety feet deep with a cannon at the bottom of it on nantasket beach i counted a dozen chaises from the publichouse from time to time the riders turned their horses toward the sea standing in the water for the coolness and i saw the value of beaches to cities for the sea breeze and the bath at jerusalem village the inhabitants were collecting in haste before a thundershower now approaching the irish moss which they had spread to dry the shower passed on one side and gave me a few drops only which did not cool the air i merely felt a puff upon my cheek though within sight a vessel was capsized in the bay and several others dragged their anchors and were near going ashore the seabathing at cohasset rocks was perfect the water was purer and more transparent than any i had ever seen there was not a particle of mud or slime about it the bottom being sandy i could see the seaperch swimming about the smooth and fantastically worn rocks and the perfectly clean and tresslike rockweeds falling over you and attached so firmly to the rocks that you could pull yourself up by them greatly enhanced the luxury of the bath the stripe of barnacles just above the weeds reminded me of some vegetable growth the buds and petals and seedvessels of flowers they lay along the seams of the rock like buttons on a waistcoat it was one of the hottest days in the year yet i found the water so icy cold that i could swim but a stroke or two and thought that in case of shipwreck there would be more danger of being chilled to death than simply drowned one immersion was enough to make you forget the dogdays utterly though you were sweltering before it will take you half an hour now to remember that it was ever warm there were the tawny rocks like lions couchant defying the ocean whose waves incessantly dashed against and scoured them with vast quantities of gravel the water held in their little hollows on the receding of the tide was so crystalline that i could not believe it salt but wished to drink it and higher up were basins of fresh water left by the rain all which being also of different depths and temperature were convenient for different kinds of baths also the larger hollows in the smoothed rocks formed the most convenient of seats and dressingrooms in these respects it was the most perfect seashore that i had seen i saw in cohasset separated from the sea only by a narrow beach a handsome but shallow lake of some four hundred acres which i was told the sea had tossed over the beach in a great storm in the spring and after the alewives had passed into it it had stopped up its outlet and now the alewives were dying by thousands and the inhabitants were apprehending a pestilence as the water evaporated it had live rocky islets in it this rock shore is called pleasant cove on some maps on the map of cohasset that name appears to be confined to the particular cove where i saw the wreck of the st j aim the ocean did not look now as if any were ever shipwrecked in it it was not grand and sublime but beautiful as a lake not a vestige of a wreck was visible nor could i believe that the bones of many a shipwrecked man were buried in that pure sand but to go on with our first excursion the jamestown weed or thornapple this being an early plant was gathered very young for a boiled salad by some of the soldiers sent thither ie to virginia to quell the rebellion of bacon and some of them ate plentifully of it the effect of which was a very pleasant comedy for they turned natural fools upon it for several days one would blow up a feather in the air another would dart straws at it with much fury and another stark naked was sitting up in a corner like a monkey grinning and making mows at them a fourth would fondly kiss and paw his companions and sneer in their faces with a countenance more antic than any in a dutch droll in this frantic condition they were confined lest they should in their folly destroy themselves though it was observed that all their actions were full of innocence and good nature indeed they were not very cleanly a thousand such simple tricks they played and after eleven days returned to themselves again not remembering anything that had passed beverlys history of virginia p ii stagecoach views after spending the night in bridgewater and picking up a few arrowheads there in the morning we took the cars for sandwich where we arrived before noon this was the terminus of the cape cod railroad though it is but the beginning of the cape as it rained hard with driving mists and there was no sign of its holding up we here took that almost obsolete conveyance the stage for as far as it went that day as we told the driver we had forgotten how far a stage could go in a day but we were told that the cape roads were very heavy though they added that being of sand the rain would improve them this coach was an exceedingly narrow one but as there was a slight spherical excess over two on a seat the driver waited till nine passengers had got in without taking the measure of any of them and then shut the door after two or three ineffectual slams as if the fault were all in the hinges or the latch while we timed our inspirations and expirations so as to assist him we were now fairly on the cape which extends from sandwich eastward thirtyfive miles and thence north and northwest thirty more in all sixtyfive and has an average breadth of about five miles in the interior it rises to the height of two hundred and sometimes perhaps three hundred feet above the level of the sea according to hitchcock the geologist of the state it is composed almost entirely of sand even to the depth of three hundred feet in some places though there is probably a concealed core of rock a little beneath the surface and it is of diluvian origin excepting a small portion at the extremity and elsewhere along the shores which is alluvial for the first half of the cape large blocks of stone are found here and there mixed with the sand but for the last thirty miles boulders or even gravel are rarely met with hitchcock conjectures that the ocean has in course of time eaten out boston harbor and other bays in the mainland and that the minute fragments have been deposited by the currents at a distance from the shore and formed this sandbank above the sand if the surface is subjected to agricultural tests there is found to be a thin layer of soil gradually diminishing from barnstable to truro where it ceases but there are many holes and rents in this weatherbeaten garment not likely to be stitched in time which reveal the naked flesh of the cape and its extremity is completely bare i at once got out my book the eighth volume of the collections of the massachusetts historical society printed in which contains some short notices of the cape towns and began to read up to where i was for in the cars i could not read as fast as i travelled to those who came from the side of plymouth it said after riding through a body of woods twelve miles in extent interspersed with but few houses the settlement of sandwich appears with a more agreeable effect to the eye of the traveller another writer speaks of this as a beautiful village but i think that our villages will bear to be contrasted only with one another not with nature i have no great respect for the writers taste who talks easily about beautiful villages embellished perchance with a fullingmill a handsome academy or meetinghouse and a number of shops for the different mechanic arts where the green and white houses of the gentry drawn up in rows front on a street of which it would be difficult to tell whether it is most like a desert or a long stableyard such spots can be beautiful only to the weary traveller or the returning native or perchance the repentant misanthrope not to him who with unprejudiced senses has just come out of the woods and approaches one of them by a bare road through a succession of straggling homesteads where he cannot tell which is the almshouse however as for sandwich i cannot speak particularly ours was but half a sandwich at most and that must have fallen on the buttered side some time i only saw that it was a closely built town for a small one with glassworks to improve its sand and narrow streets in which we turned round and round till we could not tell which way we were going and the rain came in first on this side and then on that and i saw that they in the houses were more comfortable than we in the coach my book also said of this town the inhabitants in general are substantial livers that is i suppose they do not live like philosophers but as the stage did not stop long enough for us to dine we had no opportunity to test the truth of this statement it may have referred however to the quantity of oil they would yield it further said the inhabitants of sandwich generally manifest a fond and steady adherence to the manners employments and modes of living which characterized their fathers which made me think that they were after all very much like all the rest of the world and it added that this was a resemblance which at this day will constitute no impeachment of either their virtue or taste which remark proves to me that the writer was one with the rest of them no people ever lived by cursing their fathers however great a curse their fathers might have been to them but it must be confessed that ours was old authority and probably they have changed all that now illustration an old windmill our route was along the bay side through barnstable yarmouth dennis and brewster to orleans with a range of low hills on our right running down the cape the weather was not favorable for wayside views but we made the most of such glimpses of land and water as we could get through the rain the country was for the most part bare or with only a little scrubby wood left on the hills we noticed in yarmouth and if i do not mistake in dennis large tracts where pitchpines were planted four or five years before they were in rows as they appeared when we were abreast of them and excepting that there were extensive vacant spaces seemed to be doing remarkably well this we were told was the only use to which such tracts could be profitably put every higher eminence had a pole set up on it with an old stormcoat or sail tied to it for a signal that those on the south side of the cape for instance might know when the boston packets had arrived on the north it appeared as if this use must absorb the greater part of the old clothes of the cape leaving but few rags for the pedlers the windmills on the hills large weatherstained octagonal structures and the saltworks scattered all along the shore with their long rows of vats resting on piles driven into the marsh their low turtlelike roofs and their slighter windmills were novel and interesting objects to an inlander the sand by the roadside was partially covered with bunches of a mosslike plant hudsonia tomentosa which a woman in the stage told us was called povertygrass because it grew where nothing else would i was struck by the pleasant equality which reigned among the stage company and their broad and invulnerable goodhumor they were what is called free and easy and met one another to advantage as men who had at length learned how to live they appeared to know each other when they were strangers they were so simple and downright they were well met in an unusual sense that is they met as well as they could meet and did not seem to be troubled with any impediment they were not afraid nor ashamed of one another but were contented to make just such a company as the ingredients allowed it was evident that the same foolish respect was not here claimed for mere wealth and station that is in many parts of new england yet some of them were the first people as they are called of the various towns through which we passed retired seacaptains in easy circumstances who talked of farming as seacaptains are wont an erect respectable and trustworthylooking man in his wrapper some of the salt of the earth who had formerly been the salt of the sea or a more courtly gentleman who perchance had been a representative to the general court in his day or a broad redfaced cape cod man who had seen too many storms to be easily irritated or a fishermans wife who had been waiting a week for a coaster to leave boston and had at length come by the cars a strict regard for truth obliges us to say that the few women whom we saw that day looked exceedingly pinched up they had prominent chins and noses having lost all their teeth and a sharp w would represent their profile they were not so well preserved as their husbands or perchance they were well preserved as dried specimens their husbands however were pickled but we respect them not the less for all that our own dental system is far from perfect still we kept on in the rain or if we stopped it was commonly at a postoffice and we thought that writing letters and sorting them against our arrival must be the principal employment of the inhabitants of the cape this rainy day the postoffice appeared a singularly domestic institution here ever and anon the stage stopped before some low shop or dwelling and a wheelwright or shoemaker appeared in his shirt sleeves and leather apron with spectacles newly donned holding up uncle sams bag as if it were a slice of homemade cake for the travellers while he retailed some piece of gossip to the driver really as indifferent to the presence of the former as if they were so much baggage in one instance we understood that a woman was the postmistress and they said that she made the best one on the road but we suspected that the letters must be subjected to a very close scrutiny there while we were stopping for this purpose at dennis we ventured to put our heads out of the windows to see where we were going and saw rising before us through the mist singular barren hills all stricken with povertygrass looming up as if they were in the horizon though they were close to us and we seemed to have got to the end of the land on that side notwithstanding that the horses were still headed that way indeed that part of dennis which we saw was an exceedingly barren and desolate country of a character which i can find no name for such a surface perhaps as the bottom of the sea made dry land day before yesterday it was covered with povertygrass and there was hardly a tree in sight but here and there a little weatherstained onestoried house with a red roof for often the roof was painted though the rest of the house was not standing bleak and cheerless yet with a broad foundation to the land where the comfort must have been all inside yet we read in the gazetteer for we carried that too with us that in one hundred and fifty masters of vessels belonging to this town sailed from the various ports of the union there must be many more houses in the south part of the town else we cannot imagine where they all lodge when they are at home if ever they are there but the truth is their houses are floating ones and their home is on the ocean there were almost no trees at all in this part of dennis nor could i learn that they talked of setting out any it is true there was a meetinghouse set round with lombardy poplars in a hollow square the rows fully as straight as the studs of a building and the corners as square but if i do not mistake every one of them was dead i could not help thinking that they needed a revival here our book said that in there was erected in dennis an elegant meetinghouse with a steeple perhaps this was the one though whether it had a steeple or had died down so far from sympathy with the poplars i do not remember another meetinghouse in this town was described as a neat building but of the meetinghouse in chatham a neighboring town for there was then but one nothing is said except that it is in good repair both which remarks i trust may be understood as applying to the churches spiritual as well as material however elegant meetinghouses from that trinity one on broadway to this at nobscusset in my estimation belong to the same category with beautiful villages i was never in season to see one handsome is that handsome does what they did for shade here in warm weather we did not know though we read that fogs are more frequent in chatham than in any other part of the country and they serve in summer instead of trees to shelter the houses against the heat of the sun to those who delight in extensive vision is it to be inferred that the inhabitants of chatham do not they are unpleasant but they are not found to be unhealthful probably also the unobstructed seabreeze answers the purpose of a fan the historian of chatham says further that in many families there is no difference between the breakfast and supper cheese cakes and pies being as common at the one as at the other but that leaves us still uncertain whether they were really common at either illustration a street in sandwich the road which was quite hilly here ran near the bayshore having the bay on one side and the rough hill of scargo said to be the highest land on the cape on the other of the wide prospect of the bay afforded by the summit of this hill our guide says the view has not much of the beautiful in it but it communicates a strong emotion of the sublime that is the kind of communication which we love to have made to us we passed through the village of suet in dennis on suet and quivet necks of which it is said when compared with nobscusset we had a misty recollection of having passed through or near to the latter it may be denominated a pleasant village but in comparison with the village of sandwich there is little or no beauty in it however we liked dennis well better than any town we had seen on the cape it was so novel and in that stormy day so sublimely dreary captain john sears of suet was the first person in this country who obtained pure marine salt by solar evaporation alone though it had long been made in a similar way on the coast of france and elsewhere this was in the year at which time on account of the war salt was scarce and dear the historical collections contain an interesting account of his experiments which we read when we first saw the roofs of the saltworks barnstable county is the most favorable locality for these works on our northern coast there is so little fresh water here emptying into ocean quite recently there were about two millions of dollars invested in this business here but now the cape is unable to compete with the importers of salt and the manufacturers of it at the west and accordingly her saltworks are fast going to decay from making salt they turn to fishing more than ever the gazetteer will uniformly tell you under the head of each town how many go afishing and the value of the fish and oil taken how much salt is made and used how many are engaged in the coasting trade how many in manufacturing palmleaf hats leather boots shoes and tinware and then it has done and leaves you to imagine the more truly domestic manufactures which are nearly the same all the world over late in the afternoon we rode through brewster so named after elder brewster for fear he would be forgotten else who has not heard of elder brewster who knows who he was this appeared to be the modernbuilt town of the cape the favorite residence of retired seacaptains it is said that there are more masters and mates of vessels which sail on foreign voyages belonging to this place than to any other town in the country there were many of the modern american houses here such as they turn out at cambridgeport standing on the sand you could almost swear that they had been floated down charles river and drifted across the bay i call them american because they are paid for by americans and put up by american carpenters but they are little removed from lumber only eastern stuff disguised with white paint the least interesting kind of driftwood to me perhaps we have reason to be proud of our naval architecture and need not go to the greeks or the goths or the italians for the models of our vessels seacaptains do not employ a cambridgeport carpenter to build their floating houses and for their houses on shore if they must copy any it would be more agreeable to the imagination to see one of their vessels turned bottom upward in the numidian fashion we read that at certain seasons the reflection of the sun upon the windows of the houses in wellfleet and truro across the inner side of the elbow of the cape is discernible with the naked eye at a distance of eighteen miles and upward on the county road this we were pleased to imagine as we had not seen the sun for twentyfour hours illustration the old higgins tavern at orleans the same author the rev john simpkins said of the inhabitants a good while ago no persons appear to have a greater relish for the social circle and domestic pleasures they are not in the habit of frequenting taverns unless on public occasions i know not of a proper idler or tavernhaunter in the place this is more than can be said of my townsmen at length we stopped for the night at higginss tavern in orleans feeling very much as if we were on a sandbar in the ocean and not knowing whether we should see land or water ahead when the mist cleared away we here overtook two italian boys who had waded thus far down the cape through the sand with their organs on their backs and were going on to provincetown what a hard lot we thought if the provincetown people should shut their doors against them whose yard would they go to next yet we concluded that they had chosen wisely to come here where other music than that of the surf must be rare thus the great civilizer sends out its emissaries sooner or later to every sandy cape and lighthouse of the new world which the censustaker visits and summons the savage there to surrender iii the plains of nauset the next morning thursday october th it rained as hard as ever but we were determined to proceed on foot nevertheless we first made some inquiries with regard to the practicability of walking up the shore on the atlantic side to provincetown whether we should meet with any creeks or marshes to trouble us higgins said that there was no obstruction and that it was not much farther than by the road but he thought that we should find it very heavy walking in the sand it was bad enough in the road a horse would sink in up to the fetlocks there but there was one man at the tavern who had walked it and he said that we could go very well though it was sometimes inconvenient and even dangerous walking under the bank when there was a great tide with an easterly wind which caused the sand to cave for the first four or five miles we followed the road which here turns to the north on the elbow the narrowest part of the cape that we might clear an inlet from the ocean a part of nauset harbor in orleans on our right we found the travelling good enough for walkers on the sides of the roads though it was heavy for horses in the middle we walked with our umbrellas behind us since it blowed hard as well as rained with driving mists as the day before and the wind helped us over the sand at a rapid rate everything indicated that we had reached a strange shore the road was a mere lane winding over bare swells of bleak and barrenlooking land the houses were few and far between besides being small and rusty though they appeared to be kept in good repair and their dooryards which were the unfenced cape were tidy or rather they looked as if the ground around them was blown clean by the wind perhaps the scarcity of wood here and the consequent absence of the woodpile and other wooden traps had something to do with this appearance they seemed like mariners ashore to have sat right down to enjoy the firmness of the land without studying their postures or habiliments to them it was merely terra firma and cognita not yet fertilis and jucunda every landscape which is dreary enough has a certain beauty to my eyes and in this instance its permanent qualities were enhanced by the weather everything told of the sea even when we did not see its waste or hear its roar for birds there were gulls and for carts in the fields boats turned bottom upward against the houses and sometimes the rib of a whale was woven into the fence by the roadside the trees were if possible rarer than the houses excepting appletrees of which there were a few small orchards in the hollows these were either narrow and high with flat tops having lost their side branches like huge plumbushes growing in exposed situations or else dwarfed and branching immediately at the ground like quincebushes they suggested that under like circumstances all trees would at last acquire like habits of growth i afterward saw on the cape many fullgrown appletrees not higher than a mans head one whole orchard indeed where all the fruit could have been gathered by a man standing on the ground but you could hardly creep beneath the trees some which the owners told me were twenty years old were only three and a half feet high spreading at six inches from the ground five feet each way and being withal surrounded with boxes of tar to catch the cankerworms they looked like plants in flowerpots and as if they might be taken into the house in the winter in another place i saw some not much larger than currantbushes yet the owner told me that they had borne a barrel and a half of apples that fall if they had been placed close together i could have cleared them all at a jump i measured some near the highland light in truro which had been taken from the shrubby woods thereabouts when young and grafted one which had been set ten years was on an average eighteen inches high and spread nine feet with a flat top it had borne one bushel of apples two years before another probably twenty years old from the seed was five feet high and spread eighteen feet branching as usual at the ground so that you could not creep under it this bore a barrel of apples two years before the owner of these trees invariably used the personal pronoun in speaking of them as i got him out of the woods but he doesnt bear the largest that i saw in that neighborhood was nine feet high to the topmost leaf and spread thirtythree feet branching at the ground five ways illustration a nauset lane in one yard i observed a single very healthylooking tree while all the rest were dead or dying the occupant said that his father had manured all but that one with blackfish this habit of growth should no doubt be encouraged and they should not be trimmed up as some travelling practitioners have advised in there was not a single fruittree in chatham the next town to orleans on the south and the old account of orleans says fruittrees cannot be made to grow within a mile of the ocean even those which are placed at a greater distance are injured by the east winds and after violent storms in the spring a saltish taste is perceptible on their bark we noticed that they were often covered with a yellow lichenlike rust the parmelia parietina the most foreign and picturesque structures on the cape to an inlander not excepting the saltworks are the windmills graylooking octagonal towers with long timbers slanting to the ground in the rear and there resting on a cartwheel by which their fans are turned round to face the wind these appeared also to serve in some measure for props against its force a great circular rut was worn around the building by the wheel the neighbors who assemble to turn the mill to the wind are likely to know which way it blows without a weathercock they looked loose and slightly locomotive like huge wounded birds trailing a wing or a leg and reminded one of pictures of the netherlands being on elevated ground and high in themselves they serve as landmarks for there are no tall trees or other objects commonly which can be seen at a distance in the horizon though the outline of the land itself is so firm and distinct that an insignificant cone or even precipice of sand is visible at a great distance from over the sea sailors making the land commonly steer either by the windmills or the meetinghouses in the country we are obliged to steer by the meetinghouses alone yet the meetinghouse is a kind of windmill which runs one day in seven turned either by the winds of doctrine or public opinion or more rarely by the winds of heaven where another sort of grist is ground of which if it be not all bran or musty if it be not plaster we trust to make bread of life there were here and there heaps of shells in the fields where clams had been opened for bait for orleans is famous for its shellfish especially clams or as our author says to speak more properly worms the shores are more fertile than the dry land the inhabitants measure their crops not only by bushels of corn but by barrels of clams a thousand barrels of clambait are counted as equal in value to six or eight thousand bushels of indian corn and once they were procured without more labor or expense and the supply was thought to be inexhaustible for runs the history after a portion of the shore has been dug over and almost all the clams taken up at the end of two years it is said they are as plenty there as ever it is even affirmed by many persons that it is as necessary to stir the clam ground frequently as it is to hoe a field of potatoes because if this labor is omitted the clams will be crowded too closely together and will be prevented from increasing in size but we were told that the small clam mya arenaria was not so plenty here as formerly probably the clam ground has been stirred too frequently after all nevertheless one man who complained that they fed pigs with them and so made them scarce told me that he dug and opened one hundred and twentysix dollars worth in one winter in truro illustration nauset bay we crossed a brook not more than fourteen rods long between orleans and eastham called jeremiahs gutter the atlantic is said sometimes to meet the bay here and isolate the northern part of the cape the streams of the cape are necessarily formed on a minute scale since there is no room for them to run without tumbling immediately into the sea and beside we found it difficult to run ourselves in that sand when there was no want of room hence the least channel where water runs or may run is important and is dignified with a name we read that there is no running water in chatham which is the next town the barren aspect of the land would hardly be believed if described it was such soil or rather land as to judge from appearances no farmer in the interior would think of cultivating or even fencing generally the ploughed fields of the cape look white and yellow like a mixture of salt and indian meal this is called soil all an inlanders notions of soil and fertility will be confounded by a visit to these parts and he will not be able for some time afterward to distinguish soil from sand the historian of chatham says of a part of that town which has been gained from the sea there is a doubtful appearance of a soil beginning to be formed it is styled doubtful because it would not be observed by every eye and perhaps not acknowledged by many we thought that this would not be a bad description of the greater part of the cape there is a beach on the west side of eastham which we crossed the next summer half a mile wide and stretching across the township containing seventeen hundred acres on which there is not now a particle of vegetable mould though it formerly produced wheat all sands are here called beaches whether they are waves of water or of air that dash against them since they commonly have their origin on the shore the sand in some places says the historian of eastham lodging against the beachgrass has been raised into hills fifty feet high where twentyfive years ago no hills existed in others it has filled up small valleys and swamps where a strongrooted bush stood the appearance is singular a mass of earth and sand adheres to it resembling a small tower in several places rocks which were formerly covered with soil are disclosed and being lashed by the sand driven against them by the wind look as if they were recently dug from a quarry we were surprised to hear of the great crops of corn which are still raised in eastham notwithstanding the real and apparent barrenness our landlord in orleans had told us that he raised three or four hundred bushels of corn annually and also of the great number of pigs which he fattened in champlains voyages there is a plate representing the indian cornfields hereabouts with their wigwams in the midst as they appeared in and it was here that the pilgrims to quote their own words bought eight or ten hogsheads of corn and beans of the nauset indians in to keep themselves from starving in the town of eastham voted that every housekeeper should kill twelve blackbirds or three crows which did great damage to the corn and this vote was repeated for many years in an additional order was passed namely that every unmarried man in the township shall kill six blackbirds or three crows while he remains single as a penalty for not doing it shall not be married until he obey this order the blackbirds however still molest the corn i saw them at it the next summer and there were many scarecrows if not scareblackbirds in the fields which i often mistook for men illustration a scarecrow from which i concluded that either many men were not married or many blackbirds were yet they put but three or four kernels in a hill and let fewer plants remain than we do in the account of eastham in the historical collections printed in it is said that more corn is produced than the inhabitants consume and about a thousand bushels are annually sent to market the soil being free from stones a plough passes through it speedily and after the corn has come up a small cape horse somewhat larger than a goat will with the assistance of two boys easily hoe three or four acres in a day several farmers are accustomed to produce five hundred bushels of grain annually and not long since one raised eight hundred bushels on sixty acres similar accounts are given today indeed the recent accounts are in some instances suspectable repetitions of the old and i have no doubt that their statements are as often founded on the exception as the rule and that by far the greater number of acres are as barren as they appear to be it is sufficiently remarkable that any crops can be raised here and it may be owing as others have suggested to the amount of moisture in the atmosphere the warmth of the sand and the rareness of frosts a miller who was sharpening his stones told me that forty years ago he had been to a husking here where five hundred bushels were husked in one evening and the corn was piled six feet high or more in the midst but now fifteen or eighteen bushels to an acre were an average yield i never saw fields of such puny and unpromising looking corn as in this town probably the inhabitants are contented with small crops from a great surface easily cultivated it is not always the most fertile land that is the most profitable and this sand may repay cultivation as well as the fertile bottoms of the west it is said moreover that the vegetables raised in the sand without manure are remarkably sweet the pumpkins especially though when their seed is planted in the interior they soon degenerate i can testify that the vegetables here when they succeed at all look remarkably green and healthy though perhaps it is partly by contrast with the sand yet the inhabitants of the cape towns generally do not raise their own meal or pork their gardens are commonly little patches that have been redeemed from the edges of the marshes and swamps all the morning we had heard the sea roar on the eastern shore which was several miles distant for it still felt the effects of the storm in which the st john was wrecked though a schoolboy whom we overtook hardly knew what we meant his ears were so used to it he would have more plainly heard the same sound in a shell it was a very inspiriting sound to walk by filling the whole air that of the sea dashing against the land heard several miles inland instead of having a dog to growl before your door to have an atlantic ocean to growl for a whole cape on the whole we were glad of the storm which would show us the ocean in its angriest mood charles darwin was assured that the roar of the surf on the coast of chiloe after a heavy gale could be heard at night a distance of sea miles across a hilly and wooded country we conversed with the boy we have mentioned who might have been eight years old making him walk the while under the lee of our umbrella for we thought it as important to know what was life on the cape to a boy as to a man we learned from him where the best grapes were to be found in that neighborhood he was carrying his dinner in a pail and without any impertinent questions being put by us it did at length appear of what it consisted the homeliest facts are always the most acceptable to an inquiring mind at length before we got to eastham meetinghouse we left the road and struck across the country for the eastern shore at nauset lights three lights close together two or three miles distant from us they were so many that they might be distinguished from others but this seemed a shiftless and costly way of accomplishing that object we found ourselves at once on an apparently boundless plain without a tree or a fence or with one or two exceptions a house in sight instead of fences the earth was sometimes thrown up into a slight ridge my companion compared it to the rolling prairies of illinois in the storm of wind and rain which raged when we traversed it it no doubt appeared more vast and desolate than it really is as there were no hills but only here and there a dry hollow in the midst of the waste and the distant horizon was concealed by mist we did not know whether it was high or low a solitary traveller whom we saw perambulating in the distance loomed like a giant he appeared to walk slouchingly as if held up from above by straps under his shoulders as much as supported by the plain below men and boys would have appeared alike at a little distance there being no object by which to measure them indeed to an inlander the cape landscape is a constant mirage this kind of country extended a mile or two each way these were the plains of nauset once covered with wood where in winter the winds howl and the snow blows right merrily in the face of the traveller i was glad to have got out of the towns where i am wont to feel unspeakably mean and disgraced to have left behind me for a season the barrooms of massachusetts where the fullgrown are not weaned from savage and filthy habits still sucking a cigar my spirits rose in proportion to the outward dreariness the towns need to be ventilated the gods would be pleased to see some pure flames from their altars they are not to be appeased with cigarsmoke as we thus skirted the backside of the towns for we did not enter any village till we got to provincetown we read their histories under our umbrellas rarely meeting anybody the old accounts are the richest in topography which was what we wanted most and indeed in most things else for i find that the readable parts of the modern accounts of these towns consist in a great measure of quotations acknowledged and unacknowledged from the older ones without any additional information of equal interest town histories which at length run into a history of the church of that place that being the only story they have to tell and conclude by quoting the latin epitaphs of the old pastors having been written in the good old days of latin and of greek they will go back to the ordination of every minister and tell you faithfully who made the introductory prayer and who delivered the sermon who made the ordaining prayer and who gave the charge who extended the right hand of fellowship and who pronounced the benediction also how many ecclesiastical councils convened from time to time to inquire into the orthodoxy of some minister and the names of all who composed them as it will take us an hour to get over this plain and there is no variety in the prospect peculiar as it is i will read a little in the history of eastham the while when the committee from plymouth had purchased the territory of eastham of the indians it was demanded who laid claim to billingsgate which was understood to be all that part of the cape north of what they had purchased the answer was there was not any who owned it then said the committee that land is ours the indians answered that it was this was a remarkable assertion and admission the pilgrims appear to have regarded themselves as not anys representatives perhaps this was the first instance of that quiet way of speaking for a place not yet occupied or at least not improved as much as it may be which their descendants have practised and are still practising so extensively not any seems to have been the sole proprietor of all america before the yankees but history says that when the pilgrims had held the lands of billingsgate many years at length appeared an indian who styled himself lieutenant anthony who laid claim to them and of him they bought them who knows but a lieutenant anthony may be knocking at the door of the white house some day at any rate i know that if you hold a thing unjustly there will surely be the devil to pay at last thomas prince who was several times the governor of the plymouth colony was the leader of the settlement of eastham there was recently standing on what was once his farm in this town a peartree which is said to have been brought from england and planted there by him about two hundred years ago it was blown down a few months before we were there a late account says that it was recently in a vigorous state the fruit small but excellent and it yielded on an average fifteen bushels some appropriate lines have been addressed to it by a mr heman doane from which i will quote partly because they are the only specimen of cape cod verse which i remember to have seen and partly because they are not bad two hundred years have on the wings of time passed with their joys and woes since thou old tree put forth thy first leaves in this foreign clime transplanted from the soil beyond the sea these stars represent the more clerical lines and also those which have deceased that exiled band long since have passed away and still old tree i thou standest in the place where princes hand did plant thee in his day an undesigned memorial of his race and time of those out honored fathers when they came from plymouth oer and settled here doane higgins snow and other worthy men whose names their sons remember to revere old time has thinned thy boughs old pilgrim tree and bowed thee with the weight of many years yet mid the frosts of age thy bloom we see and yearly still thy mellow fruit appears there are some other lines which i might quote if they were not tied to unworthy companions by the rhyme when one ox will lie down the yoke bears hard on him that stands up one of the first settlers of eastham was deacon john doane who died in aged one hundred and ten tradition says that he was rocked in a cradle several of his last years that certainly was not an achillean life his mother must have let him slip when she dipped him into the liquor which was to make him invulnerable and he went in heels and all some of the stonebounds to his farm which he set up are standing today with his initials cut in them the ecclesiastical history of this town interested us somewhat it appears that they very early built a small meetinghouse twenty feet square with a thatched roof through which they might fire their muskets of course at the devil in the town agreed that a part of every whale cast on shore be appropriated for the support of the ministry no doubt there seemed to be some propriety in thus leaving the support of the ministers to providence whose servants they are and who alone rules the storms for when few whales were cast up they might suspect that their worship was not acceptable the ministers must have sat upon the cliffs in every storm and watched the shore with anxiety and for my part if i were a minister i would rather trust to the bowels of the billows on the backside of cape cod to cast up a whale for me than to the generosity of many a country parish that i know you cannot say of a country ministers salary commonly that it is very like a whale nevertheless the minister who depended on whales cast up must have had a trying time of it i would rather have gone to the falkland isles with a harpoon and done with it think of a w hale having the breath of life beaten out of him by a storm and dragging in over the bars and guzzles for the support of the ministry what a consolation it must have been to him i have heard of a minister who had been a fisherman being settled in bridgewater for as long a time as he could tell a cod from a haddock generous as it seems this condition would empty most country pulpits forthwith for it is long since the fishers of men were fishermen also a duty was put on mackerel here to support a freeschool in other words the mackerelschool was taxed in order that the childrens school might be free in the court passed a law to inflict corporal punishment on all persons who resided in the towns of this government who denied the scriptures think of a man being whipped on a spring morning till he was constrained to confess that the scriptures were true it was also voted by the town that all persons who should stand out of the meetinghouse during the time of divine service should be set in the stocks it behooved such a town to see that sitting in the meetinghouse was nothing akin to sitting in the stocks lest the penalty of obedience to the law might be greater than that of disobedience this was the eastham famous of late years for its campmeetings held in a grove near by to which thousands flock from all parts of the bay we conjectured that the reason for the perhaps unusual if not unhealthful development of the religious sentiment here was the fact that a large portion of the population are women whose husbands and sons are either abroad on the sea or else drowned and there is nobody but they and the ministers left behind the old account says that hysteric fits are very common in orleans eastham and the towns below particularly on sunday in the times of divine service when one woman is affected five or six others generally sympathize with her and the congregation is thrown into the utmost confusion several old men suppose unphilosophically and uncharitably perhaps that the will is partly concerned and that ridicule and threats would have a tendency to prevent the evil how this is now we did not learn we saw one singularly masculine woman however in a house on this very plain who did not look as if she was ever troubled with hysterics or sympathized with those that were or perchance life itself was to her a hysteric fit a nauset woman of a hardness and coarseness such as no man ever possesses or suggests it was enough to see the vertebrae and sinews of her neck and her set jaws of iron which would have bitten a boardnail in two in their ordinary action braced against the world talking like a manofwarsman in petticoats or as if shouting to you through a breaker who looked as if it made her head ache to live hard enough for any enormity i looked upon her as one who had committed infanticide who never had a brother unless it were some wee thins that died in infancy for what need of him and whose father must have died before she was born this woman told us that the campmeetings were not held the previous summer for fear of introducing the cholera and that they would have been held earlier this summer but the rye was so backward that straw would not have been re adv for them for they he in straw there are sometimes one hundred and fifty ministers and five thousand hearers assembled the ground which is called millennium grove is owned by a company in boston and is the most suitable or rather unsuitable for this purpose of any that i saw on the cape it is fenced and the frames of the tents are at all times to be seen interspersed among the oaks they have an oven and a pump and keep all their kitchen utensils and tent coverings and furniture in a permanent building on the spot they select a time for their meetings when the moon is full a man is appointed to clear out the pump a week beforehand while the ministers are clearing their throats but probably the latter do not always deliver as pure a stream as the former i saw the heaps of clamshells left under the tables where they had feasted in previous summers and supposed of course that that was the work of the unconverted or the backsliders and scoffers it looked as if a campmeeting must be a singular combination of a prayermeeting and a picnic illustration millennium grove campmeeting grounds the first minister settled here was the rev samuel treat in a gentleman who is said to be entitled to a distinguished rank among the evangelists of new england he converted many indians as well as white men in his day and translated the confession of faith into the nauset language these were the indians concerning whom their first teacher richard bourne wrote to gookin in that he had been to see one who was sick and there came from him very savory and heavenly expressions but with regard to the mass of them he says the truth is that many of them are very loose in their course to my heartbreaking sorrow mr treat is described as a calvinist of the strictest kind not one of those who by giving up or explaining away become like a porcupine disarmed of its quills but a consistent calvinist who can dart his quills to a distance and courageously defend himself there exists a volume of his sermons in manuscript which says a commentator appear to have been designed for publication i quote the following sentences at second hand from a discourse on luke xvi addressed to sinners thou must erelong go to the bottomless pit hell hath enlarged herself and is ready to receive thee there is room enough for thy entertainment consider thou art going to a place prepared by god on purpose to exalt his justice in a place made for no other employment but torments hell is gods house of correction and remember god doth all things like himself when god would show his justice and what is the weight of his wrath he makes a hell where it shall indeed appear to purpose woe to thy soul when thou shalt be set up as a butt for the arrows of the almighty consider god himself shall be the principal agent in thy misery his breath is the bellows which blows up the flame of hell forever and if he punish thee if he meet thee in his fury he will not meet thee as a man he will give thee an omnipotent blow some think sinning ends with this life but it is a mistake the creature is held under an everlasting law the damned increase in sin in hell possibly the mention of this may please thee but remember there shall be no pleasant sins there no eating drinking singing dancing wanton dalliance and drinking stolen waters but damned sins bitter hellish sins sins exasperated by torments cursing god spite rage and blasphemy the guilt of all thy sins shall be laid upon thy soul and be made so many heaps of fuel sinner i beseech thee realize the truth of these things do not go about to dream that this is derogatory to gods mercy and nothing but a vain fable to scare children out of their wits withal god can be merciful though he make thee miserable he shall have monuments enough of that precious attribute shining like stars in the place of glory and singing eternal hallelujahs to the praise of him that redeemed them though to exalt the power of his justice he damn sinners heaps upon heaps but continues the same writer with the advantage of proclaiming the doctrine of terror which is naturally productive of a sublime and impressive style of eloquence triumphat ventoso gloriж curru orator qui pectus angit irritat et implet terroribus vid burnet de stat mort p he could not attain the character of a popular preacher his voice was so loud that it could be heard at a great distance from the meetinghouse even amidst the shrieks of hysterical women and the winds that howled over the plains of nauset but there was no more music in it than in the discordant sounds with which it was mingled the effect of such preaching it is said was that his hearers were several times in the course of his ministry awakened and alarmed and on one occasion a comparatively innocent young man was frightened nearly out of his wits and mr treat had to exert himself to make hell seem somewhat cooler to him yet we are assured that treats manners were cheerful his conversation pleasant and sometimes facetious but always decent he was fond of a stroke of humor and a practical joke and manifested his relish for them by long and loud fits of laughter this was the man of whom a wellknown anecdote is told which doubtless many of my readers have heard but which nevertheless i will venture to quote after his marriage with the daughter of mr willard pastor of the south church in boston he was sometimes invited by that gentleman to preach in his pulpit mr willard possessed a graceful delivery a masculine and harmonious voice and though he did not gain much reputation by his body of divinity which is frequently sneered at particularly by those who have read it yet in his sermons are strength of thought and energy of language the natural consequence was that he was generally admired mr treat having preached one of his best discourses to the congregation of his fatherinlaw in his usual unhappy manner excited universal disgust and several nice judges waited on mr willard and begged that mr treat who was a worthy pious man it was true but a wretched preacher might never be invited into his pulpit again to this request mr willard made no reply but he desired his soninlaw to lend him the discourse which being left with him he delivered it without alteration to his people a few weeks after they ran to mr willard and requested a copy for the press see the difference they cried between yourself and your soninlaw you have preached a sermon on the same text as mr treats but whilst his was contemptible yours is excellent as is observed in a note mr willard after producing the sermon in the handwriting of mr treat might have addressed these sage critics in the words of phaedrus en hie declarat quales sitis judices mr treat died of a stroke of the palsy just after the memorable storm known as the great snow which left the ground around his house entirely bare but heaped up the snow in the road to an uncommon height through this an arched way was dug by which the indians bore his bod to the grave the reader will imagine us all the while steadily traversing that extensive plain in a direction a little north of east toward nauset beach and reading under our umbrellas as we sailed while it blowed hard with mingled mist and rain as if we were approaching a fit anniversary of mr treats funeral we fancied that it was such a moor as that on which somebody perished in the snow as is related in the lights and shadows of scottish life the next minister settled here was the rev samuel osborn who was born in ireland and educated at the university of dublin he is said to have been a man of wisdom and virtue and taught his people the use of peat and the art of drying and preparing it which as they had scarcely any other fuel was a great blessing to them he also introduced improvements in agriculture but notwithstanding his many services as he embraced the religion of arminius some of his flock became dissatisfied at length an ecclesiastical council consisting of ten ministers with their churches sat upon him and they naturally enough spoiled his usefulness the council convened at the desire of two divine philosophers joseph doane and nathaniel freeman in their report they say it appears to the council that the rev mr osborn hath in his preaching to this people said that what christ did and suffered doth nothing abate or diminish our obligation to obey the law of god and that christs suffering and obedience were for himself both parts of which we think contain dangerous error also it hath been said and doth appear to this council that the rev mr osborn both in public and in private asserted that there are no promises in the bible but what are conditional which we think also to be an error and do say that there are promises which are absolute and without any condition such as the promise of a new heart and that he will write his law in our hearts also they say it hath been alleged and doth appear to us that mr osborn hath declared that obedience is a considerable cause of a persons justification which we think contains very dangerous error and many the like distinctions they made such as some of my readers probably are more familiar with than i am so far in the east among the yezidis or worshippers of the devil socalled the chaldaeans and others according to the testimony of travellers you may still hear these remarkable disputations on doctrinal points going on osborn was accordingly dismissed and he removed to boston where he kept school for many years but he was fully justified methinks by his works in the peatmeadow one proof of which is that he lived to be between ninety and one hundred years old the next minister was the rev benjamin webb of whom though a neighboring clergyman pronounced him the best man and the best minister whom he ever knew yet the historian says that as he spent his days in the uniform discharge of his duty it reminds one of a country muster and there were no shades to give relief to his character not much can be said of him pity the devil did not plant a few shadetrees along his avenues his heart was as pure as the

practised name any vice and that vice he shunned but if peculiar qualities marked his character they were his humility his gentleness and his love of god the people had long been taught by a son of thunder mr treat in him they were instructed by a son of consolation who sweetly allured them to virtue by soft persuasion and by exhibiting the mercy of the supreme being for his thoughts were so much in heaven that they seldom descended to the dismal regions below and though of the same religious sentiments as mr treat yet his attention was turned to those glad tidings of great joy which a saviour came to publish we were interested to hear that such a man had trodden the plains of nauset turning over further in our book our eyes fell on the name of the rev jonathan bascom of orleans senex emunctж naris doctus et auctor elegantium verborum facetus et dulcis festique sermonis and again on that of the rev nathan stone of dennis vir humilis mitis blandus advenarum hospes there was need of him there suis commodis in terrв non studens reconditis thesauris in coelo an easy virtue that there for methinks no inhabitant of dennis could be very studious about his earthly commodity but must regard the bulk of his treasures as in heaven but probably the most just and pertinent character of all is that which appears to be given to the rev ephraim briggs of chatham in the language of the later romans seip sepoese sepoemese wechekum which not being interpreted we know not what it means though we have no doubt it occurs somewhere in the scriptures probably in the apostle eliots epistle to the nipmucks let no one think that i do not love the old ministers they were probably the best men of their generation and they deserve that their biographies should fill the pages of the town histories if i could but hear the glad tidings of which they tell and which perchance they heard i might write in a worthier strain than this there was no better way to make the reader realize how wide and peculiar that plain was and how long it took to traverse it than by inserting these extracts in the midst of my narrative they touched after this at a place called mattachiest where they

save their soles if they cared libvfab iv the beach at length we reached the seemingly retreating boundary of the plain and entered what had appeared at a distance an upland marsh but proved to be dry sand covered with beachgrass the bearberry bayberry shruboaks and beachplum slightly ascending as we approached the shore then crossing over a belt of sand on which nothing grew though the roar of the sea sounded scarcely louder than before and we were prepared to go half a mile farther we suddenly stood on the edge of a bluff overlooking the atlantic far below us was the beach from half a dozen to a dozen rods in width with a long line of breakers rushing to the strand the sea was exceedingly dark and stormy the sky completely overcast the clouds still dropping rain and the wind seemed to blow not so much as the exciting cause as from sympathy with the already agitated ocean the waves broke on the bars at some distance from the shore and curving green or yellow as if over so many unseen dams ten or twelve feet high like a thousand waterfalls rolled in foam to the sand there was nothing but that savage ocean between us and europe having got down the bank and as close to the water as we could where the sand was the hardest leaving the nauset lights behind us we began to walk leisurely up the beach in a northwest direction towards provincetown which was about twentyfive miles distant still sailing under our umbrellas with a strong aft wind admiring in silence as we walked the great force of the ocean stream greek potamoio mega sthenos hфeanoio the white breakers were rushing to the shore the foam ran up the sand and then ran back as far as we could see and we imagined how much farther along the atlantic coast before and behind us as regularly to compare great things with small as the master of a choir beats time with his white wand and ever and anon a higher wave caused us hastily to deviate from our path and we looked back on our tracks filled with water and foam the breakers looked like droves of a thousand wild horses of neptune rushing to the shore with their white manes streaming far behind and when at length the sun shone for a moment their manes were rainbowtinted also the long kelpweed was tossed up from time to time like the tails of seacows sporting in the brine illustration a cape cod citizen there was not a sail in sight and we saw none that day for they had all sought harbors in the late storm and had not been able to get out again and the only human beings whom we saw on the beach for several days were one or two wreckers looking for driftwood and fragments of wrecked vessels after an easterly storm in the spring this beach is sometimes strewn with eastern wood from one end to the other which as it belongs to him who saves it and the cape is nearly destitute of wood is a godsend to the inhabitants we soon met one of these wreckers a regular cape cod man with whom we parleyed with a bleached and weatherbeaten face within whose wrinkles i distinguished no particular feature it was like an old sail endowed with life a hanging cliff of weatherbeaten flesh like one of the clay boulders which occurred in that sandbank he had on a hat which had seen salt water and a coat of many pieces and colors though it was mainly the color of the beach as if it had been sanded his variegated back for his coat had many patches even between the shoulders was a rich study to us when we had passed him and looked round it might have been dishonorable for him to have so many scars behind it is true if he had not had many more and more serious ones in front he looked as if he sometimes saw a doughnut but never descended to comfort too grave to laugh too tough to cry as indifferent as a clam like a seaclam with hat on and legs that was out walking the strand he may have been one of the pilgrims peregrine white at least who has kept on the backside of the cape and let the centuries go by he was looking for wrecks old logs waterlogged and covered with barnacles or bits of boards and joists even chips which he drew out of the reach of the tide and stacked up to dry when the log was too large to carry far he cut it up where the last wave had left it or rolling it a few feet appropriated it by sticking two sticks into the ground crosswise above it some rotten trunk which in maine cumbers the ground and is perchance thrown into the water on purpose is here thus carefully picked up split and dried and husbanded before winter the wrecker painfully carries these things up the bank on his shoulders by a long diagonal slanting path made with a hoe in the sand if there is no hollow at hand you may see his hooked pikestaff always lying on the bank ready for use he is the true monarch of the beach whose right there is none to dispute and he is as much identified with it as a beachbird crantz in his account of greenland quotes dalagens relation of the ways and usages of the greenlanders and says whoever finds driftwood or the spoils of a shipwreck on the strand enjoys it as his own though he does not live there but he must haul it ashore and lay a stone upon it as a token that some one has taken possession of it and this stone is the deed of security for no other greenlander will offer to meddle with it afterwards such is the instinctive law of nations we have also this account of driftwood in crantz as he the founder of nature has denied this frigid rocky region the growth of trees he has bid the streams of the ocean to convey to its shores a great deal of wood which accordingly comes floating thither part without ice but the most part along with it and lodges itself between the islands were it not for this we europeans should have no wood to burn there and the poor greenlanders who it is true do not use wood but train for burning would however have no wood to roof their houses to erect their tents as also to build their boats and to shaft their arrows yet there grew some small but crooked alders c by which they must procure their maintenance clothing and train for warmth light and cooking among this wood are great trees torn up by the roots which by driving up and down for many years and rubbing on the ice are quite bare of branches and bark and corroded with great woodworms a small part of this driftwood are willows alder and birch trees which come out of the bays in the south of ie greenland also large trunks of aspentrees which must come from a greater distance but the greatest part is pine and fir we find also a good deal of a sort of wood finely veined with few branches this i fancy is larchwood which likes to decorate the sides of lofty stony mountains there is also a solid reddish wood of a more agreeable fragrance than the common fir with visible crossveins which i take to be the same species as the beautiful silverfirs or zirbel that have the smell of cedar and grow on the high grison hills and the switzers wainscot their rooms with them the wrecker directed us to a slight depression called snows hollow by which we ascended the bank for elsewhere if not difficult it was inconvenient to climb it on account of the sliding sand which filled our shoes this sandbank the backbone of the cape rose directly from the beach to the height of a hundred feet or more above the ocean it was with singular emotions that we first stood upon it and discovered what a place we had chosen to walk on on our right beneath us was the beach of smooth and gently sloping sand a dozen rods in width next the endless series of white breakers further still the light green water over the bar which runs the whole length of the forearm of the cape and beyond this stretched the unwearied and illimitable ocean on our left extending back from the very edge of the bank was a perfect desert of shining sand from thirty to eighty rods in width skirted in the distance by small sandhills fifteen or twenty feet high between which however in some places the sand penetrated as much farther next commenced the region of vegetation a succession of small hills and valleys covered with shrubbery now glowing with the brightest imaginable autumnal tints and beyond this were seen here and there the waters of the bay here in wellfleet this pure sand plateau known to sailors as the table lands of eastham on account of its appearance as seen from the ocean and because it once made a part of that town full fifty rods in width and in many places much more and sometimes full one hundred and fifty feet above the ocean stretched away northward from the southern boundary of the town without a particle of vegetation as level almost as a table for two and a half or three miles or as far as the eye could reach slightly rising towards the ocean then stooping to the beach by as steep a slope as sand could lie on and as regular as a military engineer could desire it was like the escarped rampart of a stupendous fortress whose glacis was the beach and whose champaign the ocean from its surface we overlooked the greater part of the cape in short we were traversing a desert with the view of an autumnal landscape of extraordinary brilliancy a sort of promised land on the one hand and the ocean on the other yet though the prospect was so extensive and the country for the most part destitute of trees a house was rarely visible we never saw one from the beach and the solitude was that of the ocean and the desert combined a thousand men could not have seriously interrupted it but would have been lost in the vastness of the scenery as their footsteps in the sand the whole coast is so free from rocks that we saw but one or two for more than twenty miles the sand was soft like the beach and trying to the eyes when the sun shone a few piles of driftwood which some wreckers had painfully brought up the bank and stacked up there to dry being the only objects in the desert looked indefinitely large and distant even like wigwams though when we stood near them they proved to be insignificant little jags of wood for sixteen miles commencing at the nauset lights the bank held its height though farther north it was not so level as here but interrupted by slight hollows and the patches of beachgrass and bayberry frequently crept into the sand to its edge there are some pages entitled a description of the eastern coast of the county of barnstable printed in pointing out the spots on which the trustees of the humane society have erected huts called charity or humane houses and other places where shipwrecked seamen may look for shelter two thousand copies of this were dispersed that every vessel which frequented this coast might be provided with one i have read this shipwrecked seamans manual with a melancholy kind of interest for the sound of the surf or you might say the moaning of the sea is heard all through it as if its author were the sole survivor of a shipwreck himself of this part of the coast he says this highland approaches the ocean with steep and lofty banks which it is extremely difficult to climb especially in a storm in violent tempests during very high tides the sea breaks against the foot of them rendering it then unsafe to walk on the strand which lies between them and the ocean should the seaman succeed in his attempt to ascend them he must forbear to penetrate into the country as houses are generally so remote that they would escape his research during the night he must pass on to the valleys by which the banks are intersected these valleys which the inhabitants call hollows run at right angles with the shore and in the middle or lowest part of them a road leads from the dwellinghouses to the sea by the word road must not always be understood a visible carttrack there were these two roads for us an upper and a lower one the bank and the beach both stretching twentyeight miles northwest from nauset harbor to race point without a single opening into the beach and with hardly a serious interruption of the desert if you were to ford the narrow and shallow inlet at nauset harbor where there is not more than eight feet of water on the bar at full sea you might walk ten or twelve miles farther which would make a beach forty miles long and the bank and beach on the east side of nantucket are but a continuation of these i was comparatively satisfied there i had got the cape under me as much as if i were riding it barebacked it was not as on the map or seen from the stagecoach but there i found it all out of doors huge and real cape cod as it cannot be represented on a map color it as you will the thing itself than which there is nothing more like it no truer picture or account which you cannot go farther and see i cannot remember what i thought before that it was they commonly celebrate those beaches only which have a hotel on them not those which have a humane house alone but i wished to see that seashore where mans works are wrecks to put up at the true atlantic house where the ocean is landlord as well as sealord and comes ashore without a wharf for the landing where the crumbling land is the only invalid or at best is but dry land and that is all you can say of it we walked on quite at our leisure now on the beach now on the bank sitting from time to time on some damp log maple or yellow birch which had long followed the seas but had now at last settled on land or under the lee of a sandhill on the bank that we might gaze steadily on the ocean the bank was so steep that where there was no danger of its caving we sat on its edge as on a bench it was difficult for us landsmen to look out over the ocean without imagining land in the horizon yet the clouds appeared to hang low over it and rest on the water as they never do on the land perhaps on account of the great distance to which we saw the sand was not without advantage for though it was heavy walking in it it was soft to the feet and notwithstanding that it had been raining nearly two days when it held up for half an hour the sides of the sandhills which were porous and sliding afforded a dry seat all the aspects of this desert are beautiful whether you behold it in fair weather or foul or when the sun is just breaking out after a storm and shining on its moist surface in the distance it is so white and pure and level and each slight inequality and track is so distinctly revealed and when your eyes slide off this they fall on the ocean in summer the mackerel gulls which here have their nests among the neighboring sandhills pursue the traveller anxiously now and then diving close to his head with a squeak and he may see them like swallows chase some crow which has been feeding on the beach almost across the cape though for some time i have not spoken of the roaring of the breakers and the ceaseless flux and reflux of the waves yet they did not for a moment cease to dash and roar with such a tumult that if you had been there you could scarcely have heard my voice the while and they are dashing and roaring this very moment though it may be with less din and violence for there the sea never rests we were wholly absorbed by this spectacle and tumult and like chryses though in a different mood from him we walked silent along the shore of the resounding sea greek bк d akeфy para thina polnphloisboio thalassкst i put in a little greek now and then partly because it sounds so much like the ocean though i doubt if homers mediterranean sea ever sounded so loud as this the attention of those who frequent the campmeetings at eastham is said to be divided between the preaching of the methodists and the preaching of the billows on the backside of the cape for they all stream over here in the course of their stay i trust that in this case the loudest voice carries it with what effect may we suppose the ocean to say my hearers to the multitude on the bank on that side some john n maffit on this the reverend poluphloisboios thalassa there was but little weed cast up here and that kelp chiefly there being scarcely a rock for rockweed to adhere to who has not had a vision from some vessels deck when he had still his landlegs on of this great brown apron drifting half upright and quite submerged through the green water clasping a stone or a deepsea mussel in its unearthly fingers i have seen it carrying a stone half as large as my head we sometimes watched a mass of this cablelike weed as it was tossed up on the crest of a breaker waiting with interest to see it come in as if there were some treasure buoyed up by it but we were always surprised and disappointed at the insignificance of the mass which had attracted us as we looked out over the water the smallest objects floating on it appeared indefinitely large we were so impressed by the vastness of the ocean and each one bore so large a proportion to the whole ocean which we saw we were so often disappointed in the size of such things as came ashore the ridiculous bits of wood or weed with which the ocean labored that we began to doubt whether the atlantic itself would bear a still closer inspection and wold not turn out to be a but small pond if it should come ashore to us this kelp oarweed tangle devilsapron soleleather or ribbonweed as various species are called appeared to us a singularly marine and fabulous product a lit invention for neptune to adorn his car with or a freak of proteus all that is told of the sea has a fabulous sound to an inhabitant of the land and all its products have a certain fabulous quality as if they belonged to another planet from seaweed to a sailors yarn or a fishstory in this element the animal and vegetable kingdoms meet and are strangely mingled one species of kelp according to bory st vincent has a stem fifteen hundred feet long and hence is the longest vegetable known and a brigs crew spent two days to no purpose collecting the trunks of another kind cast ashore on the falkland islands mistaking it for driftwood see harvey on algж this species looked almost edible at least i thought that if i were starving i would try it one sailor told me that the cows ate it it cut like cheese for i took the earliest opportunity to sit down and deliberately whittle up a fathom or two of it that i might become more intimately acquainted with it see how it cut and if it were hollow all the way through the blade looked like a broad belt whose edges had been quilled or as if stretched by hammering and it was also twisted spirally the extremity was generally worn and ragged from the lashing of the waves a piece of the stem which i carried home shrunk to one quarter of its size a week afterward and was completely covered with crystals of salt like frost the reader will excuse my greenness though it is not seagreenness like his perchance for i live by a rivershore where this weed does not wash up when we consider in what meadows it grew and how it was raked and in what kind of hay weather got in or out we may well be curious about it one who is weatherwise has given the following account of the matter when descends on the atlantic the gigantic stormwind of the equinox landward in his wrath he scourges the toiling surges laden with seaweed from the rocks from bermudas reefs from edges of sunken ledges on some faroff bright azore from bahama and the dashing silverflashing surges of san salvador from the trembling surf that buries the orkneyan skerries answering the hoarse hebrides and from wrecks and ships and drifting spars uplifting on the desolate rainy seas ever drifting drifting drifting on the shifting currents of the restless main but he was not thinking of this shore when he added till in sheltered coves and reaches of sandy beaches all have found repose again these weeds were the symbols of those grotesque and fabulous thoughts which have not yet got into the sheltered coves of literature ever drifting drifting drifting on the shifting currents of the restless heart and not yet in books recorded they like hoarded household words no more depart the beach was also strewn with beautiful seajellies which the wreckers called sunsquall one of the lowest forms of animal life some white some winecolored and a foot in diameter i at first thought that they were a tender part of some marine monster which the storm or some other foe had mangled what right has the sea to bear in its bosom such tender things as seajellies and mosses when it has such a boisterous shore that the stoutest fabrics are wrecked against it strange that it should undertake to dandle such delicate children in its arm i did not at first recognize these for the same which i had formerly seen in myriads in boston harbor rising with a waving motion to the surface as if to meet the sun and discoloring the waters far and wide so that i seemed to be sailing through a mere sunfish soup they say that when you endeavor to take one up it will spill out the other side of your hand like quicksilver before the land rose out of the ocean and became dry land chaos reigned and between high and low water mark where she is partially disrobed and rising a sort of chaos reigns still which only anomalous creatures can inhabit mackerelgulls were all the while flying over our heads and amid the breakers sometimes two white ones pursuing a black one quite at home in the storm though they are as delicate organizations as seajellies and mosses and we saw that they were adapted to their circumstances rather by their spirits than their bodies theirs must be an essentially wilder that is less human nature than that of larks and robins their note was like the sound of some vibrating metal and harmonized well with the scenery and the roar of the surf as if one had rudely touched the strings of the lyre which ever lies on the shore a ragged shred of ocean music tossed aloft on the spray but if i were required to name a sound the remembrance of which most perfectly revives the impression which the beach has made it would be the dreary peep of the piping plover charadrius melodus which haunts there their voices too are heard as a fugacious part in the dirge which is ever played along the shore for those mariners who have been lost in the deep since first it was created but through all this dreariness we seemed to have a pure and unqualified strain of eternal melody for always the same strain which is a dirge to one household is a morning song of rejoicing to another a remarkable method of catching gulls derived from the indians was practised in wellfleet in the gull house it is said is built with crotchets fixed in the ground on the beach poles being stretched across for the top and the sides made close with stakes and seaweed the poles on the top are covered with lean whale the man being placed within is not discovered by the fowls and while they are contending for and eating the flesh he draws them in one by one between the poles until he has collected forty or fifty hence perchance a man is said to be gulled when he is taken in we read that one sort of gulls is called by the dutch mallemucke ie the foolish fly because they fall upon a whale as eagerly as a fly and indeed all gulls are foolishly bold and easy to be shot the norwegians call this bird havhest seahorse and the english translator says it is probably what we call boobies if they have eaten too much they throw it up and eat it again till they are tired it is this habit in the gulls of parting with their property disgorging the contents of their stomachs to the skuas which has given rise to the terms gull guller and gulling among men we also read that they used to kill small birds which roosted on the beach at night by making a fire with hogs lard in a fryingpan the indians probably used pine torches the birds flocked to the light and were knocked down with a stick we noticed holes dug near the edge of the bank where gunners conceal themselves to shoot the large gulls which coast up and down afishing for these are considered good to eat we found some large clams of the species mactra solidissima which the storm had torn up from the bottom and cast ashore i selected one of the largest about six inches in length and carried it along thinking to try an experiment on it we soon after met a wrecker with a grapple and a rope who said that he was looking for tow cloth which had made part of the cargo of the ship franklin which was wrecked here in the spring at which time nine or ten lives were lost the reader may remember this wreck from the circumstance that a letter was found in the captains valise which washed ashore directing him to wreck the vessel before he got to america and from the trial which took place in consequence the wrecker said that tow cloth was still cast up in such storms as this he also told us that the clam which i had was the seaclam or hen and was good to eat we took our nooning under a sandhill covered with beachgrass in a dreary little hollow on the top of the bank while it alternately rained and shined there having reduced some damp driftwood which i had picked up on the shore to shavings with my knife i kindled a fire with a match and some paper and cooked my clam on the embers for my dinner for breakfast was commonly the only meal which i took in a house on this excursion when the clam was done one valve held the meat and the other the liquor though it was very tough i found it sweet and savory and ate the whole with a relish indeed with the addition of a cracker or two it would have been a bountiful dinner i noticed that the shells were such as i had seen in the sugarkit at home tied to a stick they formerly made the indians hoe hereabouts at length by midafternoon after we had had two or three rainbows over the sea the showers ceased and the heavens gradually cleared up though the wind still blowed as hard and the breakers ran as high as before keeping on we soon after came to a charityhouse which we looked into to see how the shipwrecked mariner might fare far away in some desolate hollow by the seaside just within the bank stands a lonely building on piles driven into the sand with a slight nail put through the staple which a freezing man can bend with some straw perchance on the floor on which he may lie or which he may burn in the fireplace to keep him alive perhaps this hut has never been required to shelter a shipwrecked man and the benevolent person who promised to inspect it annually to see that the straw and matches are here and that the boards will keep off the wind has grown remiss and thinks that storms and shipwrecks are over and this very night a perishing crew may pry open its door with their numbed fingers and leave half their number dead here by morning when i thought what must be the condition of the families which alone would ever occupy or had occupied them what must have been the tragedy of the winter evenings spent by human beings around their hearths these houses though they were meant for human dwellings did not look cheerful to me they appeared but a stage to the grave the gulls flew around and screamed over them the roar of the ocean in storms and the lapse of its waves in calms alone resounds through them all dark and empty within year in year out except perchance on one memorable night houses of entertainment for shipwrecked men what kind of sailors homes were they illustration wreckage under the sandbluff each hut says the author of the description of the eastern coast of the county of barnstable stands on piles is eight feet long eight feet wide and seven feet high a sliding door is on the south a sliding shutter on the west and a pole rising fifteen feet above the top of the building on the east within it is supplied either with straw or hay and is further accommodated with a bench they have varied little from this model now there are similar huts at the isle of sable and anticosti on the north and how far south along the coast i know not it is pathetic to read the minute and faithful directions which he gives to seamen who may be wrecked on this coast to guide them to the nearest charityhouse or other shelter for as is said of eastham though there are a few houses within a mile of the shore yet in a snowstorm which rages here with excessive fury it would be almost impossible to discover them either by night or by day you hear their imaginary guide thus marshalling cheering directing the dripping shivering freezing troop along at the entrance of this valley the sand has gathered so that at present a little climbing is necessary passing over several fences and taking heed not to enter the wood on the right hand at the distance of threequarters of a mile a house is to be found this house stands on the south side of the road and not far from it on the south is pamet river which runs from east to west through body of salt marsh to him cast ashore in eastham he says the meetinghouse is without a steeple but it may be distinguished from the dwellinghouses near it by its situation which is between two small groves of locusts one on the south and one on the north that on the south being three times as long as the other about a mile and a quarter from the hut west by north appear the top and arms of a windmill and so on for many pages we did not learn whether these houses had been the means of saving any lives though this writer says of one erected at the head of stouts creek in truro that it was built in an improper manner having a chimney in it and was placed on a spot where no beachgrass grew the strong winds blew the sand from its foundation and the weight of the chimney brought it to the ground so that in january of the present year it was entirely demolished this event took place about six weeks before the brutus was cast away if it had remained it is probable that the whole of the unfortunate crew of that ship would have been saved as they gained the shore a few rods only from the spot where the hut had stood this charityhouse as the wrecker called it this humanehouse as some call it that is the one to which we first came had neither window nor sliding shutter nor clapboards nor paint as we have said there was a rusty nail put through the staple however as we wished to get an idea of a humane house and we hoped that we should never have a better opportunity we put our eyes by turns to a knothole in the door and after long looking without seeing into the dark not knowing how many shipwrecked mens bones we might see at last looking with the eye of faith knowing that though to him that knocketh it may not always be opened yet to him that looketh long enough through a knothole the inside shall be visible for we had had some practice at looking inward by steadily keeping our other ball covered from the light meanwhile putting the outward world behind us ocean and land and the beach till the pupil became enlarged and collected the rays of light that were wandering in that dark for the pupil shall be enlarged by looking there never was so dark a night but a faithful and patient eye however small might at last prevail over it after all this i say things began to take shape to our vision if we may use this expression where there was nothing but emptiness and we obtained the longwishedfor insight though we thought at first that it was a hopeless case after several minutes steady exercise of the divine faculty our prospects began decidedly to brighten and we were ready to exclaim with the blind bard of paradise lost and regained hail holy light offspring of heaven first born or of the eternal coeternal beam may i express thee unblamed a little longer and a chimney rushed red on our sight in short when our vision had grown familiar with the darkness we discovered that there were some stones and some loose wads of wool on the floor and an empty fireplace at the further end but it was not supplied with matches or straw or hay that we could see nor accommodated with a bench indeed it was the wreck of all cosmical beauty there within turning our backs on the outward world we thus looked through the knothole into the humane house into the very bowels of mercy and for bread we found a stone it was literally a great cry of seamews outside and a little wool however we were glad to sit outside under the lee of the humane house to escape the piercing wind and there we thought how cold is charity how inhumane humanity this then is what charity hides virtues antique and far away with ever a rusty nail over the latch and very difficult to keep in repair withal it is so uncertain whether any will ever gain the beach near you so we shivered round about not being able to get into it ever and anon looking through the knothole into that night without a star until we concluded that it was not a humane house at all but a seaside box now shut up belonging to some of the family of night or chaos where they spent their summers by the sea for the sake of the sea breeze and that it was not proper for us to be prying into their concerns my companion had declared before this that i had not a particle of sentiment in rather absolute terms to my astonishment but i suspect he meant that my legs did not ache just then though i am not wholly a stranger to that sentiment but i did not intend this for a sentimental journey illustration herring river at wellfleet we have no word in english to express the sound of many waves dashing at once whether gently or violently greek polnphloioboios to the ear and in the oceans gentle moods an greek anarithmon gelasma to the eye v the wellfleet oysterman having walked about eight miles since we struck the beach and passed the boundary between wellfleet and truro a stone post in the sand for even this sand comes under the jurisdiction of one town or another we turned inland over barren hills and valleys whither the sea for some reason did not follow us and tracing up a hollow discovered two or three soberlooking houses within half a mile uncommonly near the eastern coast their garrets were apparently so full of chambers that their roofs could hardly lie down straight and we did not doubt that there was room for us there houses near the sea are generally low and broad these were a story and a half high but if you merely counted the windows in their gableends you would think that there were many stories more or at any rate that the halfstory was the only one thought worthy of being illustrated the great number of windows in the ends of the houses and their irregularity in size and position here and elsewhere on the cape struck us agreeably as if each of the various occupants who had their cunabula behind had punched a hole where his necessities required it and according to his size and stature without regard to outside effect there were windows for the grown folks and windows for the children three or four apiece as a certain man had a large hole cut in his barndoor for the cat and another smaller one for the kitten sometimes they were so low under the eaves that i thought they must have perforated the plate beam for another apartment and i noticed some which were triangular to fit that part more exactly the ends of the houses had thus as many muzzles as a revolver and if the inhabitants have the same habit of staring out the windows that some of our neighbors have a traveller must stand a small chance with them generally the oldfashioned and unpainted houses on the cape looked more comfortable as well as picturesque than the modern and more pretending ones which were less in harmony with the scenery and less firmly planted illustration a characteristic gable with many windows these houses were on the shores of a chain of ponds seven in number the source of a small stream called herring river which empties into the bay there are many herring rivers on the cape they will perhaps be more numerous than herrings soon we knocked at the door of the first house but its inhabitants were all gone away in the meanwhile we saw the occupants of the next one looking out the window at us and before we reached it an old woman came out and fastened the door of her bulkhead and went in again nevertheless we did not hesitate to knock at her door when a grizzlylooking man appeared whom we took to be sixty or seventy years old he asked us at first suspiciously where we were from and what our business was to which we returned plain answers how far is concord from boston he inquired twenty miles by railroad twenty miles by railroad he repeated didnt you ever hear of concord of revolutionary fame didnt i ever hear of concord why i heard the guns fire at the battle of bunker hill they hear the sound of heavy cannon across the bay i am almost ninety i am eightyeight year old i was fourteen year old at the time of concord fight and where were you then we were obliged to confess that we were not in the fight well walk in well leave it to the women said he so we walked in surprised and sat down an old woman taking our hats and bundles and the old man continued drawing up to the large oldfashioned fireplace i am a poor goodfornothing crittur as isaiah says i am all broken down this year i am under petticoat government here the family consisted of the old man his wife and his daughter who appeared nearly as old as her mother a fool her son a brutishlooking middleaged man with a prominent lower face who was standing by the hearth when we entered but immediately went out and a little boy of ten while my companion talked with the women i talked with the old man they said that he was old and foolish but he was evidently too knowing for them these women said he to me are both of them poor goodfornothing critturs this one is my wife i married her sixtyfour years ago she is eightyfour years old and as deaf as an adder and the other is not much better he thought well of the bible or at least he spoke well and did not think ill of it for that would not have been prudent for a man of his age he said that he had read it attentively for many years and he had much of it at his tongues end he seemed deeply impressed with a sense of his own nothingness and would repeatedly exclaim i am a nothing what i gather from my bible is just this that man is a poor goodfornothing crittur and everything is just as god sees fit and disposes may i ask your name i said yes he answered i am not ashamed to tell my name my name is my greatgrandfather came over from england and settled here he was an old wellfleet oysterman who had acquired a competency in that business and had sons still engaged in it nearly all the oyster shops and stands in massachusetts i am told are supplied and kept by natives of wellfleet and a part of this town is still called billingsgate from the oysters having been formerly planted there but the native oysters are said to have died in various causes are assigned for this such as a ground frost the carcasses of blackfish kept to rot in the harbor and the like but the most common account of the matter is and i find that a similar superstition with regard to the disappearance of fishes exists almost everywhere that when wellfleet began to quarrel with the neighboring towns about the right to gather them yellow specks appeared in them and providence caused them to disappear a few years ago sixty thousand bushels were annually brought from the south and planted in the harbor of wellfleet till they attained the proper relish of billingsgate but now they are imported commonly fullgrown and laid down near their markets at boston and elsewhere where the water being a mixture of salt and fresh suits them better the business was said to be still good and improving the old man said that the oysters were liable to freeze in the winter if planted too high but if it were not so cold as to strain their eyes they were not injured the inhabitants of new brunswick have noticed that ice will not form over an oysterbed unless the cold is very intense indeed and when the bays are frozen over the oysterbeds are easily discovered by the water above them remaining unfrozen or as the french residents say degиle our host said that they kept them in cellars all winter without anything to eat or drink i asked without anything to eat or drink he answered can the oysters move just as much as my shoe illustration a welfleet oysterman but when i caught him saying that they bedded themselves down in the sand flat side up round side down i told him that my shoe could not do that without the aid of my foot in it at which he said that they merely settled down as they grew if put down in a square they would be found so but the clam could move quite fast i have since been told by oystermen of long island where the oyster is still indigenous and abundant that they are found in large masses attached to the parent in their midst and are so taken up with their tongs in which case they say the age of the young proves that there could have been no motion for five or six years at least and buckland in his curiosities of natural history page says an oyster who has once taken up his position and fixed himself when quite young can never make a change oysters nevertheless that have not fixed themselves but remain loose at the bottom of the sea have the power of locomotion they open their shells to their fullest extent and then suddenly contracting them the expulsion of the water forwards gives a motion backwards a fisherman at guernsey told me that he had frequently seen oysters moving in this way some still entertain the question whether the oyster was indigenous in massachusetts bay and whether wellfleet harbor was a natural habitat of this fish but to say nothing of the testimony of old oystermen which i think is quite conclusive though the native oyster may now be extinct there i saw that their shells opened by the indians were strewn all over the cape indeed the cape was at first thickly settled by indians on account of the abundance of these and other fish we saw many traces of their occupancy after this in truro near great hollow and at highhead near east harbor river oysters clams cockles and other shells mingled with ashes and the bones of deer and other quadrupeds i picked up half a dozen arrowheads and in an hour or two could have filled my pockets with them the indians lived about the edges of the swamps then probably in some instances ponds for shelter and water moreover champlain in the edition of his voyages printed in says that in the year he and poitrincourt explored a harbor barnstable harbor in the southerly part of what is now called massachusetts bay in latitude degrees about five leagues south one point west of cap blanc cape cod and there they found many good oysters and they named it le port aux huistres oyster harbor in one edition of his map the r aux escailles is drawn emptying into the same part of the bay and on the map novi belgii in ogilbys america the words port aux huistres are placed against the same place also william wood who left new england in speaks in his new englands prospect published in of a great oysterbank in charles river and of another in the mistick each of which obstructed the navigation of its river the oysters says he be great ones in form of a shoehorn some be a foot long these breed on certain banks that are bare every spring tide this fish without the shell is so big that it must admit of a division before you can well get it into your mouth oysters are still found there also see thomas mortons new english canaan page our host told us that the seaclam or hen was not easily obtained it was raked up but never on the atlantic side only cast ashore there in small quantities in storms the fisherman sometimes wades in water several feet deep and thrusts a pointed stick into the sand before him when this enters between the valves of a clam he closes them on it and is drawn out it has been known to catch and hold coot and teal which were preying on it i chanced to be on the bank of the acushnet at new bedford one day since this watching some ducks when a man informed me that having let out his young ducks to seek their food amid the samphire salicornia and other weeds along the riverside at low tide that morning at length he noticed that one remained stationary amid the weeds something preventing it from following the others and going to it he found its foot tightly shut in a quahogs shell he took up both together carried them to his home and his wife opening the shell with a knife released the duck and cooked the quahog the old man said that the great clams were good to eat but that they always took out a certain part which was poisonous before they cooked them people said it would kill a cat i did not tell him that i had eaten a large one entire that afternoon but began to think that i was tougher than a cat he stated that pedlers came round there and sometimes tried to sell the women folks a skimmer but he told them that their women had got a better skimmer than they could make in the shell of their clams it was shaped just right for this purpose they call them skimalls in some places he also said that the sunsquall was poisonous to handle and when the sailors came across it they did not meddle with it but heaved it out of their way i told him that i had handled it that afternoon and had felt no ill effects as yet but he said it made the hands itch especially if they had previously been scratched or if i put it into my bosom i should find out what it was he informed us that no ice ever formed on the back side of the cape or not more than once in a century and but little snow lay there it being either absorbed or blown or washed away sometimes in winter when the tide was down the beach was frozen and afforded a hard road up the back side for some thirty miles as smooth as a floor one winter when he was a boy he and his father took right out into the back side before daylight and walked to provincetown and back to dinner when i asked what they did with all that barrenlooking land where i saw so few cultivated fields nothing he said then why fence your fields to keep the sand from blowing and covering up the whole the yellow sand said he has some life in it but the white little or none when in answer to his questions i told him that i was a surveyor he said that they who surveyed his farm were accustomed where the ground was uneven to loop up each chain as high as their elbows that was the allowance they made and he wished to know if i could tell him why they did not come out according to his deed or twice alike he seemed to have more respect for surveyors of the old school which i did not wonder at king george the third said he laid out a road four rods wide and straight the whole length of the cape but where it was now he could not tell this story of the surveyors reminded me of a longislander who once when i had made ready to jump from the bow of his boat to the shore and he thought that i underrated the distance and would fall short though i found afterward that he judged of the elasticity of my joints by his own told me that when he came to a brook which he wanted to get over he held up one leg and then if his foot appeared to cover any part of the opposite bank he knew that he could jump it why i told him to say nothing of the mississippi and other small watery streams i could blot out a star with my foot but i would not engage to jump that distance and asked how he knew when he had got his leg at the right elevation but he regarded his legs as no less accurate than a pair of screw dividers or an ordinary quadrant and appeared to have a painful recollection of every degree and minute in the arc which they described and he would have had me believe that there was a kind of hitch in his hipjoint which answered the purpose i suggested that he should connect his two ankles by a string of the proper length which should be the chord of an arc measuring his jumping ability on horizontal surfaces assuming one leg to be a perpendicular to the plane of the horizon which however may have been too bold an assumption in this case nevertheless this was a kind of geometry in the legs which it interested me to hear of our host took pleasure in telling us the names of the ponds most of which we could see from his windows and making us repeat them after him to see if we had got them right they were gull pond the largest and a very handsome one clear and deep and more than a mile in circumference newcombs swetts slough horseleech round and herring ponds all connected at high water if i do not mistake the coastsurveyors had come to him for their names and he told them of one which they had not detected he said that they were not so high as formerly there was an earthquake about four years before he was born which cracked the pans of the ponds which were of iron and caused them to settle i did not remember to have read of this innumerable gulls used to resort to them but the large gulls were now very scarce for as he said the english robbed their nests far in the north where they breed he remembered well when gulls were taken in the gullhouse and when small birds were killed by means of a fryingpan and fire at night his father once lost a valuable horse from this cause a party from wellfleet having lighted their fire for this purpose one dark night on billingsgate island twenty horses which were pastured there and this colt among them being frightened by it and endeavoring in the dark to cross the passage which separated them from the neighboring beach and which was then fordable at low tide were all swept out to sea and drowned i observed that many horses were still turned out to pasture all summer on the islands and beaches in wellfleet eastham and orleans as a kind of common he also described the killing of what he called wild hens here after they had gone to roost in the woods when he was a boy perhaps they were prairie hens pinnated grouse he liked the beachpea lathyrus maritimus cooked green as well as the cultivated he had seen it growing very abundantly in newfoundland where also the inhabitants ate them but he had never been able to obtain any ripe for seed we read under the head of chatham that in during a time of great scarcity the people about orford in sussex england were preserved from perishing by eating the seeds of this plant which grew there in great abundance on the seacoast cows horses sheep and goats eat it but the writer who quoted this could not learn that they had ever been used in barnstable county he had been a voyager then o he had been about the world in his day he once considered himself a pilot for all our coast but now they had changed the names so he might be bothered he gave us to taste what he called the summer sweeting a pleasant apple which he raised and frequently grafted from but had never seen growing elsewhere except once three trees on newfoundland or at the bay of chaleur i forget which as he was sailing by he was sure that he could tell the tree at a distance at length the fool whom my companion called the wizard came in muttering between his teeth damn bookpedlers all the time talking about books better do something damn em ill shoot em got a doctor down here damn him ill get a gun and shoot him never once holding up his head whereat the old man stood up and said in a loud voice as if he was accustomed to command and this was not the first time he had been obliged to exert his authority there john go sit down mind your business weve heard you talk before precious little youll do your bark is worse than your bite but without minding john muttered the same gibberish over again and then sat down at the table which the old folks had left he ate all there was on it and then turned to the apples which his aged mother was paring that she might give her guests some applesauce for breakfast but she drew them away and sent him off illustration welfleet when i approached this house the next summer over the desolate hills between it and the shore which are worthy to have been the birthplace of ossian i saw the wizard in the midst of a cornfield on the hillside but as usual he loomed so strangely that i mistook him for a scarecrow this was the merriest old man that we had ever seen and one of the best preserved his style of conversation was coarse and plain enough to have suited rabelais he would have made a good panurge or rather he was a sober silenus and we were the boys chromis and mnasilus who listened to his story not by hжmonian hills the thracian bard nor awful phoebus was on pindus heard with deeper silence or with more regard there was a strange mingling of past and present in his conversation for he had lived under king george and might have remembered when napoleon and the moderns generally were born he said that one day when the troubles between the colonies and the mother country first broke out as he a boy of fifteen was pitching hay out of a cart one doane an old tory who was talking with his father a good whig said to him why uncle bill you might as well undertake to pitch that pond into the ocean with a pitchfork as for the colonies to undertake to gain their independence he remembered well general washington and how he rode his horse along the streets of boston and he stood up to show us how he looked he was a r a ther large and portlylooking man a manly and resolutelooking officer with a pretty good leg as he sat on his horse there ill tell you this was the way with washington then he jumped up again and bowed gracefully to right and left making show as if he were waving his hat said he that was washington he told us many anecdotes of the revolution and was much pleased when we told him that we had read the same in history and that his account agreed with the written o he said i know i know i was a young fellow of sixteen with my ears wide open and a fellow of that age you know is pretty wide awake and likes to know everything thats going on o i know he told us the story of the wreck of the franklin which took place there the previous spring how a boy came to his house early in the morning to know whose boat that was by the shore for there was a vessel in distress and he being an old man first ate his breakfast and then walked over to the top of the hill by the shore and sat down there having found a comfortable seat to see the ship wrecked she was on the bar only a quarter of a mile from him and still nearer to the men on the beach who had got a boat ready but could render no assistance on account of the breakers for there was a pretty high sea running there were the passengers all crowded together in the forward part of the ship and some were getting out of the cabin windows and were drawn on deck by the others i saw the captain get out his boat said he he had one little one and then they jumped into it one after another down as straight as an arrow i counted them there were nine one was a woman and she jumped as straight as any of them then they shoved off the sea took them back one wave went over them and when they came up there were six still clinging to the boat i counted them the next wave turned the boat bottom upward and emptied them all out none of them ever came ashore alive there were the rest of them all crowded together on the forecastle the other parts of the ship being under water they had seen all that happened to the boat at length a heavy sea separated the forecastle from the rest of the wreck and set it inside of the worst breaker and the boat was able to reach them and it saved all that were left but one woman he also told us of the steamer cambrias getting aground on his shore a few months before we were there and of her english passengers who roamed over his grounds and who he said thought the prospect from the high hill by the shore the most delightsome they had ever seen and also of the pranks which the ladies played with his scoopnet in the ponds he spoke of these travellers with their purses full of guineas just as our provincial fathers used to speak of british bloods in the time of king george the third quid loquar why repeat what he told us aut scyllam nisi quam fama secuta est candida succinctam latrantibus inguina monstris dulichias vexвsse rates et gurgite in alto ah timidos nautas canibus lacerвsse marinis in the course of the evening i began to feel the potency of the clam which i had eaten and i was obliged to confess to our host that i was no tougher than the cat he told of but he answered that he was a plainspoken man and he could tell me that it was all imagination at any rate it proved an emetic in my case and i was made quite sick by it for a short time while he laughed at my expense i was pleased to read afterward in mourts relation of the landing of the pilgrims in provincetown harbor these words we found great muscles the old editor says that they were undoubtedly seaclams and very fat and full of seapearl but we could not eat them for they made us all sick that did eat as well sailors as passengers but they were soon well again it brought me nearer to the pilgrims to be thus reminded by a similar experience that i was so like them moreover it was a valuable confirmation of their story and i am prepared now to believe every word of mourts relation i was also pleased to find that man and the clam lay still at the same angle to one another but i did not notice seapearl like cleopatra i must have swallowed it i have since dug these clams on a flat in the bay and observed them they could squirt full ten feet before the wind as appeared by the marks of the drops on the sand now im going to ask you a question said the old man and i dont know as you can tell me but you are a learned man and i never had any learning only what i got by natur it was in vain that we reminded him that he could quote josephus to our confusion ive thought if i ever met a learned man i should like to ask him this question can you tell me how axy is spelt and what it means axy says he theres a girl over here is named axy now what is it what does it mean is it scripture ive read my bible twentyfive years over and over and i never came across it did you read it twentyfive years for this object i asked well how is it spelt wife how is it spelt she said it is in the bible ive seen it well how do you spell it i dont know a c h ach s e h seh achseh does that spell axy well do you know what it means asked he turning to me no i replied i never heard the sound before there was a schoolmaster down here once and they asked him what it meant and he said it had no more meaning than a beanpole i told him that i held the same opinion with the schoolmaster i had been a schoolmaster myself and had had strange names to deal with i also heard of such names as zoleth beriah amaziah bethuel and shearjashub hereabouts at length the little boy who had a seat quite in the chimneycorner took off his stockings and shoes warmed his feet and having had his sore leg freshly salved went off to bed then the fool made bare his knottylooking feet and legs and followed him and finally the old man exposed his calves also to our gaze we had never had the good fortune to see an old mans legs before and were surprised to find them fair and plump as an infants and we thought that he took a pride in exhibiting them he then proceeded to make preparations for retiring discoursing meanwhile with panurgic plainness of speech on the ills to which old humanity is subject we were a rare haul for him he could commonly get none but ministers to talk to though sometimes ten of them at once and he was glad to meet some of the laity at leisure the evening was not long enough for him as i had been sick the old lady asked if i would not go to bed it was getting late for old people but the old man who had not yet done his stories said you aint particular are you o no said i i am in no hurry i believe i have weathered the clam cape they are good said he i wish i had some of them now they never hurt me said the old lady but then you took out the part that killed a cat said i at last we cut him short in the midst of his stories which he promised to resume in the morning yet after all one of the old ladies who came into our room in the night to fasten the fireboard which rattled as she went out took the precaution to fasten us in old women are by nature more suspicious than old men however the winds howled around the house and made the fireboards as well as the casements rattle well that night it was probably a windy night for any locality but we could not distinguish the roar which was proper to the ocean from that which was due to the wind alone the sounds which the ocean makes must be very significant and interesting to those who live near it when i was leaving the shore at this place the next summer and had got a quarter of a mile distant ascending a hill i was startled by a sudden loud sound from the sea as if a large steamer were letting off steam by the shore so that i caught my breath and felt my blood run cold for an instant and i turned about expecting to see one of the atlantic steamers thus far out of her course but there was nothing unusual to be seen there was a low bank at the entrance of the hollow between me and the ocean and suspecting that i might have risen into another stratum of air in ascending the hill which had wafted to me only the ordinary roar of the sea i immediately descended again to see if i lost hearing of it but without regard to my ascending or descending it died away in a minute or two and yet there was scarcely any wind all the while the old man said that this was what they called the rut a peculiar roar of the sea before the wind changes which however he could not account for he thought that he could tell all about the weather from the sounds which the sea made old josselyn who came to new england in has it among his weathersigns that the resounding of the sea from the shore and murmuring of the winds in the woods without apparent wind sheweth wind to follow being on another part of the coast one night since this i heard the roar of the surf a mile distant and the inhabitants said it was a sign that the wind would work round east and we should have rainy weather the ocean was heaped up somewhere at the eastward and this roar was occasioned by its effort to preserve its equilibrium the wave reaching the shore before the wind also the captain of a packet between this country and england told me that he sometimes met with a wave on the atlantic coming against the wind perhaps in a calm sea which indicated that at a distance the wind was blowing from an opposite quarter but the undulation had travelled faster than it sailors tell of tiderips and groundswells which they suppose to have been occasioned by hurricanes and earthquakes and to have travelled many hundred and sometimes even two or three thousand miles illustration hunting for a leak before sunrise the next morning they let us out again and i ran over to the beach to see the sun come out of the ocean the old woman of eightyfour winters was already out in the cold morning wind bareheaded tripping about like a young girl and driving up the cow to milk she got the breakfast with despatch and without noise or bustle and meanwhile the old man resumed his stories standing before us who were sitting with his back to the chimney and ejecting his tobacco juice right and left into the fire behind him without regard to the various dishes which were there preparing at breakfast we had eels buttermilk cake cold bread green beans doughnuts and tea the old man talked a steady stream and when his wife told him he had better eat his breakfast he said dont hurry me i have lived too long to be hurried i ate of the applesauce and the doughnuts which i thought had sustained the least detriment from the old mans shots but my companion refused the applesauce and ate of the hot cake and green beans which had appeared to him to occupy the safest part of the hearth but on comparing notes afterward i told him that the buttermilk cake was particularly exposed and i saw how it suffered repeatedly and therefore i avoided it but he declared that however that might be he witnessed that the applesauce was seriously injured and had therefore declined that after breakfast we looked at his clock which was out of order and oiled it with some hens grease for want of sweet oil for he scarcely could believe that we were not tinkers or pedlers meanwhile he told a story about visions which had reference to a crack in the clockcase made by frost one night he was curious to know to what religious sect we belonged he said that he had been to hear thirteen kinds of preaching in one month when he was young but he did not join any of them he stuck to his bible there was nothing like any of them in his bible while i was shaving in the next room i heard him ask my companion to what sect he belonged to which he answered o i belong to the universal brotherhood whats that he asked sons o temperance finally filling our pockets with doughnuts which he was pleased to find that we called by the same name that he did and paying for our entertainment we took our departure but he followed us out of doors and made us tell him the names of the vegetables which he had raised from seeds that came out of the franklin they were cabbage broccoli and parsley as i had asked him the names of so many things he tried me in turn with all the plants which grew in his garden both wild and cultivated it was about half an acre which he cultivated wholly himself besides the common garden vegetables there were yellowdock lemon balm hyssop gillgoovertheground mouseear chickweed roman wormwood elecampane and other plants as we stood there i saw a fishhawk stoop to pick a fish out of his pond there said i he has got a fish well said the old man who was looking all the while but could see nothing he didnt dive he just wet his claws and sure enough he did not this time though it is said that they often do but he merely stooped low enough to pick him out with his talons but as he bore his shining prey over the bushes it fell to the ground and we did not see that he recovered it that is not their practice thus having had another crack with the old man he standing bareheaded under the eaves he directed us athwart the fields and we took to the beach again for another day it being now late in the morning it was but a day or two after this that the safe of the provincetown bank was broken open and robbed by two men from the interior and we learned that our hospitable entertainers did at least transiently harbor the suspicion that we were the men vi the beach again our way to the high sandbank which i have described as extending all along the coast led as usual through patches of bayberry bushes which straggled into the sand this next to the shruboak was perhaps the most common shrub thereabouts i was much attracted by its odoriferous leaves and small gray berries which are clustered about the short twigs just below the last years growth i know of but two bushes in concord and they being staminate plants do not bear fruit the berries gave it a venerable appearance and they smelled quite spicy like small confectionery robert beverley in his history of virginia published in states that at the mouth of their rivers and all along upon the sea and bay and near many of their creeks and swamps grows the myrtle bearing a berry of which they make a hard brittle wax of a curious green color which by refining becomes almost transparent of this they make candles which are never greasy to the touch nor melt with lying in the hottest weather neither does the snuff of these ever offend the smell like that of a tallow candle but instead of being disagreeable if an accident puts a candle out it yields a pleasant fragrancy to all that are in the room insomuch that nice people often put them out on purpose to have the incense of the expiring snuff the melting of these berries is said to have been first found out by a surgeon in new england who performed wonderful things with a salve made of them from the abundance of berries still hanging on the bushes we judged that the inhabitants did not generally collect them for tallow though we had seen a piece in the house we had just left i have since made some tallow myself holding a basket beneath the bare twigs in april i rubbed them together between my hands and thus gathered about a quart in twenty minutes to which were added enough to make three pints and i might have gathered them much faster with a suitable rake and a large shallow basket they have little prominences like those of an orange all creased in tallow which also fills the interstices down to the stone the oily part rose to the top making it look like a savory black broth which smelled much like balm or other herb tea you let it cool then skim off the tallow from the surface melt this again and strain it i got about a quarter of a pound weight from my three pints and more yet remained within the berries a small portion cooled in the form of small flattish hemispheres like crystallizations the size of a kernel of corn nuggets i called them as i picked them out from amid the berries loudon says that cultivated trees are said to yield more wax than those that are found wild see duplessy vegetaux resineux vol ii p if you get any pitch on your hands in the pinewoods you have only to rub some of these berries between your hands to start it off but the ocean was the grand fact there which made us forget both bay berries and men today the air was beautifully clear and the sea no longer dark and stormy though the waves still broke with foam along the beach but sparkling and full of life already that morning i had seen the day break over the sea as if it came out of its bosom the saffronrobed dawn rose in haste from the streams of ocean that she might bring light to immortals and to mortals the sun rose visibly at such a distance over the sea that the cloudbank in the horizon which at first concealed him was not perceptible until he had risen high behind it and plainly broke and dispersed it like an arrow but as yet i looked at him as rising over land and could not without an effort realize that he was rising over the sea already i saw some vessels on the horizon which had rounded the cape in the night and were now well on their watery way to other lands we struck the beach again in the south part of truro in the early part of the day while it was flood tide and the beach was narrow and soft we walked on the bank which was very high here but not so level as the day before being more interrupted by slight hollows the author of the description of the eastern coast says of this part that the bank is very high and steep from the edge of it west there is a strip of sand a hundred yards in breadth then succeeds low brushwood a quarter of a mile wide and almost impassable after which comes a thick perplexing forest in which not a house is to be discovered seamen therefore though the distance between these two hollows newcombs and brush hollows is great must not attempt to enter the wood as in a snowstorm they must undoubtedly perish this is still a true description of the country except that there is not much high wood left illustration truro starting on a voyage there were many vessels like gulls skimming over the surface of the sea now half concealed in its troughs their dolphinstrikers ploughing the water now tossed on the top of the billows one a bark standing down parallel with the coast suddenly furled her sails came to anchor and swung round in the wind near us only half a mile from the shore at first we thought that her captain wished to communicate with us and perhaps we did not regard the signal of distress which a mariner would have understood and he cursed us for coldhearted wreckers who turned our backs on him for hours we could still see her anchored there behind us and we wondered how she could afford to loiter so long in her course or was she a smuggler who had chosen that wild beach to land her cargo on or did they wish to catch fish or paint their vessel erelong other barks and brigs and schooners which had in the mean while doubled the cape sailed by her in the smacking breeze and our consciences were relieved some of these vessels lagged behind while others steadily went ahead we narrowly watched their rig and the cut of their jibs and how they walked the water for there was all the difference between them that there is between living creatures but we wondered that they should be remembering boston and new york and liverpool steering for them out there as if the sailor might forget his peddling business on such a grand highway they had perchance brought oranges from the western isles and were they carrying back the peel we might as well transport our old traps across the ocean of eternity is that but another tradingflood with its blessed isles is heaven such a harbor as the liverpool docks still held on without a break the inland barrens and shrubbery the desert and the high sand bank with its even slope the broad white beach the breakers the green water on the bar and the atlantic ocean and we traversed with delight new reaches of the shore we took another lesson in seahorses manes and seacows tails in seajellies and seaclams with our newgained experience the sea ran hardly less than the day before it seemed with every wave to be subsiding because such was our expectation and yet when hours had elapsed we could see no difference but there it was balancing itself the restless ocean by our side lurching in its gait each wave left the sand all braided or woven as it were with a coarse woof and warp and a distinct raised edge to its rapid work we made no haste since we wished to see the ocean at our leisure and indeed that soft sand was no place in which to be in a hurry for one mile there was as good as two elsewhere besides we were obliged frequently to empty our shoes of the sand which one took in in climbing or descending the bank as we were walking close to the waters edge this morning we turned round by chance and saw a large black object which the waves had just cast up on the beach behind us yet too far off for us to distinguish what it was and when we were about to return to it two men came running from the bank where no human beings had appeared before as if they had come out of the sand in order to save it before another wave took it as we approached it took successively the form of a huge fish a drowned man a sail or a net and finally of a mass of towcloth part of the cargo of the franklin which the men loaded into a cart objects on the beach whether men or inanimate things look not only exceedingly grotesque but much larger and more wonderful than they actually are lately when approaching the seashore several degrees south of this i saw before me seemingly half a mile distant what appeared like bold and rugged cliffs on the beach fifteen feet high and whitened by the sun and waves but after a few steps it proved to be low heaps of rags part of the cargo of a wrecked vessel scarcely more than a foot in height once also it was my business to go in search of the relics of a human body mangled by sharks which had just been cast up a week after a wreck having got the direction from a lighthouse i should find it a mile or two distant over the sand a dozen rods from the water covered with a cloth by a stick stuck up i expected that i must look very narrowly to find so small an object but the sandy beach half a mile wide and stretching farther than the eye could reach was so perfectly smooth and bare and the mirage toward the sea so magnifying that when i was half a mile distant the insignificant sliver which marked the spot looked like a bleached spar and the relics were as conspicuous as if they lay in state on that sandy plain or a generation had labored to pile up their cairn there close at hand they were simply some bones with a little flesh adhering to them in fact only a slight inequality in the sweep of the shore there was nothing at all remarkable about them and they were singularly inoffensive both to the senses and the imagination but as i stood there they grew more and more imposing they were alone with the beach and the sea whose hollow roar seemed addressed to them and i was impressed as if there was an understanding between them and the ocean which necessarily left me out with my snivelling sympathies that dead body had taken possession of the shore and reigned over it as no living one could in the name of a certain majesty which belonged to it we afterward saw many small pieces of towcloth washed up and i learn that it continued to be found in good condition even as late as november in that year half a dozen bolts at a time we eagerly filled our pockets with the smooth round pebbles which in some places even here were thinly sprinkled over the sand together with flat circular shells scutelloe but as we had read when they were dry they had lost their beauty and at each sitting we emptied our pockets again of the least remarkable until our collection was well culled every material was rolled into the pebble form by the waves not only stones of various kinds but the hard coal which some vessel had dropped bits of glass and in one instance a mass of peat three feet long where there was nothing like it to be seen for many miles all the great rivers of the globe are annually if not constantly discharging great quantities of lumber which drifts to distant shores i have also seen very perfect pebbles of brick and bars of castile soap from a wreck rolled into perfect cylinders and still spirally streaked with red like a barbers pole when a cargo of rags is washed ashore every old pocket and baglike recess will be filled to bursting with sand by being rolled on the beach and on one occasion the pockets in the clothing of the wrecked being thus puffed up even after they had been ripped open by wreckers deluded me into the hope of identifying them by the contents a pair of gloves looked exactly as if filled by a hand the water in such clothing is soon wrung out and evaporated but the sand which works itself into every seam is not so easily got rid of sponges which are picked up on the shore as is well known retain some of the sand of the beach to the latest day in spite of every effort to extract it i found one stone on the top of the bank of a dark gray color shaped exactly like a giant clam mactra solidissima and of the same size and what was more remarkable onehalf of the outside had shelled off and lay near it of the same form and depth with one of the valves of this clam while the other half was loose leaving a solid core of a darker color within it i afterward saw a stone resembling a razor clam but it was a solid one it appeared as if the stone in the process of formation had filled the mould which a clamshell furnished or the same law that shaped the clam had made a clam of stone dead clams with shells full of sand are called sand clams there were many of the large clamshells filled with sand and sometimes one valve was separately filled exactly even as if it had been heaped and then scraped even among the many small stones on the top of the bank i found one arrowhead beside the giant clam and barnacles we found on the shore a small clam mesodesma arctata which i dug with my hands in numbers on the bars and which is sometimes eaten by the inhabitants in the absence of the mya arenaria on this side most of their empty shells had been perforated by some foe also the astarte castanea the edible mussel mytilus edulis on the few rocks and washed up in curious bunches of forty or fifty held together by its ropelike byssus the scollop shell pecten concentricus used for cardracks and pincushions cockles or cuckoos natica heros and their remarkable nidus called sandcircle looking like the top of a stone jug without the stopple and broken on one side or like a flaring dickey made of sandpaper also cancellaria couthouyi and periwinkles fusus decemcostatus we afterward saw some other kinds on the bayside gould states that this cape has hitler proved a barrier to the migrations of many species of mollusca of the one hundred and ninetyseven species which he described in as belonging to massachusetts eightythree do not pass to the south shore and fifty are not found on the north shore of the cape among crustacea there were the shells of crabs and lobsters often bleached quite white high up the beach sea or beach fleas amphipoda and the cases of the horseshoe crab or saucepan fish limulus polyphoemus of which we saw many alive on the bay side where they feed pigs on them their tails were used as arrowheads by the indians of radiata there were the sea chestnut or egg echinus granulatus commonly divested of its spines flat circular shells scutella parma covered with chocolatecolored spines but becoming smooth and white with five petallike figures a few starfishes or fivefingers asterias rubens and sunfishes or seajellies aurelioe there was also at least one species of sponge the plants which i noticed here and there on the pure sandy shelf between the ordinary highwater mark and the foot of the bank were sea rocket cakile americana saltwort salsola kali sea sandwort honkenya peploides sea burdock xanthium echinatum seaside spurge euphorbia poylgonifolia also beach grass arundo psamma or calamagrostis arenaria seaside goldenrod solidago sempervirens and the beach pea lathyrus maritimus sometimes we helped a wrecker turn over a larger log than usual or we amused ourselves with rolling stones down the bank but we rarely could make one reach the water the beach was so soft and wide or we bathed in some shallow within a bar where the sea covered us with sand at every flux though it was quite cold and windy the ocean there is commonly but a tantalizing prospect in hot weather for with all that water before you there is as we were afterward told no bathing on the atlantic side on account of the undertow and the rumor of sharks at the lighthouse both in eastham and truro the only houses quite on the shore they declared the next year that they would not bathe there for any sum for they sometimes saw the sharks tossed up and quiver for a moment on the sand others laughed at these stories but perhaps they could afford to because they never bathed anywhere one old wrecker told us that he killed a regular maneating shark fourteen feet long and hauled him out with his oxen where we had bathed and another that his father caught a smaller one of the same kind that was stranded there by standing him up on his snout so that the waves could not take him they will tell you tough stories of sharks all over the cape which i do not presume to doubt utterly how they will sometimes upset a boat or tear it in pieces to get at the man in it i can easily believe in the undertow but i have no doubt that one shark in a dozen years is enough to keep up the reputation of a beach a hundred miles long i should add however that in july we walked on the bank here a quarter of a mile parallel with a fish about six feet in length possibly a shark which was prowling slowly along within two rods of the shore it was of a pale brown color singularly filmlike and indistinct in the water as if all nature abetted this child of ocean and showed many darker transverse bars or rings whenever it came to the surface it is well known that different fishes even of the same species are colored by the water they inhabit we saw it go into a little cove or bathingtub where we had just been bathing where the water was only four or five feet deep at that time and after exploring it go slowly out again but we continued to bathe there only observing first from the bank if the cove was preoccupied we thought that the water was fuller of life more aerated perhaps than that of the bay like sodawater for we were as particular as young salmon and the expectation of encountering a shark did not subtract anything from its lifegiving qualities sometimes we sat on the wet beach and watched the beach birds sandpipers and others trotting along close to each wave and waiting for the sea to cast up their breakfast the former charadrius melodus ran with great rapidity and then stood stock still remarkably erect and hardly to be distinguished from the beach the wet sand was covered with small skipping sea fleas which apparently make a part of their food these last are the little scavengers of the beach and are so numerous that they will devour large fishes which have been cast up in a very short time one little bird not larger than a sparrow it may have been a phalarope would alight on the turbulent surface where the breakers were five or six feet high and float buoyantly there like a duck cunningly taking to its wings and lifting itself a few feet through the air over the foaming crest of each breaker but sometimes outriding safely a considerable billow which hid it some seconds when its instinct told it that it would not break it was a little creature thus to sport with the ocean but it was as perfect a success in its way as the breakers in theirs there was also an almost uninterrupted line of coots rising and falling with the waves a few rods from the shore the whole length of the cape they made as constant a part of the oceans border as the pads or pickerelweed do of that of a pond we read the following as to the storm petrel thalassidroma wilsonii which is seen in the bay as well as on the outside the feathers on the breast of the storm petrel are like those of all swimming birds waterproof but substances not susceptible of being wetted with water are for that very reason the best fitted for collecting oil from its surface that function is performed by the feathers on the breast of the storm petrels as they touch on the surface and though that may not be the only way in which they procure their food it is certainly that in which they obtain great part of it they dash along till they have loaded their feathers and then they pause upon the wave and remove the oil with their bills thus we kept on along the gently curving shore seeing two or three miles ahead at once along this ocean sidewalk where there was none to turn out for with the middle of the road the highway of nations on our right and the sand cliffs of the cape on our left we saw this forenoon a part of the wreck of a vessel probably the franklin a large piece fifteen feet square and still freshly painted with a grapple and a line we could have saved it for the waves repeatedly washed it within cast but they as often took it back it would have been a lucky haul for some poor wrecker for i have been told that one man who paid three or four dollars for a part of the wreck of that vessel sold fifty or sixty dollars worth of iron out of it another the same who picked up the captains valise with the memorable letter in it showed me growing in his garden many pear and plum trees which washed ashore from her all nicely tied up and labelled and he said that he might have got five hundred dollars worth for a mr bell was importing the nucleus of a nursery to be established near boston his turnipseed came from the same source also valuable spars from the same vessel and from the cactus lay in his yard in short the inhabitants visit the beach to see what they have caught as regularly as a fisherman his weir or a lumberer his boom the cape is their boom i heard of one who had recently picked up twenty barrels of apples in good condition probably a part of a deck load thrown over in a storm though there are wreckmasters appointed to look after valuable property which must be advertised yet undoubtedly a great deal of value is secretly carried off but are we not all wreckers contriving that some treasure may be washed up on our beach that we may secure it and do we not infer the habits of these nauset and barnegat wreckers from the common modes of getting a living the sea vast and wild as it is bears thus the waste and wrecks of human art to its remotest shore there is no telling what it may not vomit up it lets nothing lie not even the giant clams which cling to its bottom it is still heaving up the towcloth of the franklin and perhaps a piece of some old pirates ship wrecked more than a hundred years ago comes ashore today some years since when a vessel was wrecked here which had nutmegs in her cargo they were strewn all along the beach and for a considerable time were not spoiled by the salt water soon afterward a fisherman caught a cod which was full of them why then might not the spiceislanders shake their nutmeg trees into the ocean and let all nations who stand in need of them pick them up however after a year i found that the nutmegs from the franklin had become soft you might make a curious list of articles which fishes have swallowed sailors open claspknives and bright tin snuffboxes not knowing what was in them and jugs and jewels and jonah the other day i came across the following scrap in a newspaper a religious fish a short time ago mine host stewart of the denton hotel purchased a rockfish weighing about sixty pounds on opening it he found in it a certificate of membership of the m e church which we read as follows member methodist e church founded a d quarterly ticket minister for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory cor iv o what are all my sufferings here if lord thou count me meet with that enraptured host t appear and worship at thy feet the paper was of course in a crumpled and wet condition but on exposing it to the sun and ironing the kinks out of it it became quite legible denton md journal from time to time we saved a wreck ourselves a box or barrel and set it on its end and appropriated it with crossed sticks and it will lie there perhaps respected by brother wreckers until some more violent storm shall take it really lost to man until wrecked again we also saved at the cost of wet feet only a valuable cord and buoy part of a seine with which the sea was playing for it seemed ungracious to refuse the least gift which so great a personage offered you we brought this home and still use it for a garden line i picked up a bottle half buried in the wet sand covered with barnacles but stoppled tight and half full of red ale which still smacked of juniper all that remained i fancied from the wreck of a rowdy world that great salt sea on the one hand and this little sea of ale on the other preserving their separate characters what if it could tell us its adventures over countless ocean waves man would not be man through such ordeals as it had passed but as i poured it slowly out on to the sand it seemed to me that man himself was like a halfemptied bottle of pale ale which time had drunk so far yet stoppled tight for a while and drifting about in the ocean of circumstances but destined erelong to mingle with the surrounding waves or be spilled amid the sands of a distant shore in the summer i saw two men fishing for bass hereabouts their bait was a bullfrog or several small frogs in a bunch for want of squid they followed a retiring wave and whirling their lines round and round their heads with increasing rapidity threw them as far as they could into the sea then retreating sat down flat on the sand and waited for a bite it was literally or littorally walking down to the shore and throwing your line into the atlantic i should not have known what might take hold of the other end whether proteus or another at any rate if you could not pull him in why you might let him go without being pulled in yourself and they knew by experience that it would be a striped bass or perhaps a cod for these fishes play along near the shore from time to time we sat under the lee of a sandhill on the bank thinly covered with coarse beachgrass and steadily gazed on the sea or watched the vessels going south all blessings of the bay of course we could see a little more than half a circle of ocean besides the glimpses of the bay which we got behind us the sea there was not wild and dreary in all respects for there were frequently a hundred sail in sight at once on the atlantic you can commonly count about eighty in a favorable summer day and pilots sometimes land and ascend the bank to look out for these which require their services these had been waiting for fair weather and had come out of boston harbor together the same is the case when they have been assembled in the vineyard sound so that you may see but few one day and a large fleet the next schooners with many jibs and staysails crowded all the sea road squarerigged vessels with their great height and breadth of canvas were ever and anon appearing out of the far horizon or disappearing and sinking into it here and there a pilotboat was towing its little boat astern toward some distant foreigner who had just fired a gun the echo of which along the shore sounded like the caving of the bank we could see the pilot looking through his glass toward the distant ship which was putting back to speak with him he sails many a mile to meet her and now she puts her sails aback and communicates with him alongside sends some important message to the owners and then bids farewell to these shores for good and all or perchance a propeller passed and made fast to some disabled craft or one that had been becalmed whose cargo of fruit might spoil though silently and for the most part incommunicatively going about their business they were no doubt a source of cheerfulness and a kind of society to one another illustration unloading the days catch today it was the purple sea an epithet which i should not before have accepted there were distinct patches of the color of a purple grape with the bloom rubbed off but first and last the sea is of all colors well writes gilpin concerning the brilliant hues which are continually playing on the surface of a quiet ocean and this was not too turbulent at a distance from the shore beautiful says he no doubt in a high degree are those glimmering tints which often invest the tops of mountains but they are mere coruscations compared with these marine colors which are continually varying and shifting into each other in all the vivid splendor of the rainbow through the space often of several leagues commonly in calm weather for half a mile from the shore where the bottom tinges it the sea is green or greenish as are some ponds then blue for many miles often with purple tinges bounded in the distance by a light almost silvery stripe beyond which there is generally a darkblue rim like a mountainridge in the horizon as if like that it owed its color to the intervening atmosphere on another day it will be marked with long streaks alternately smooth and rippled lightcolored and dark even like our inland meadows in a freshet and showing which way the wind sets thus we sat on the foaming shore looking on the winecolored ocean greek thin eph alos pliкs oroфn epi oinopa ponton here and there was a darker spot on its surface the shadow of a cloud though the sky was so clear that no cloud would have been noticed otherwise and no shadow would have been seen on the land where a much smaller surface is visible at once so distant clouds and showers may be seen on all sides by a sailor in the course of a day which do not necessarily portend rain where he is in july we saw similar darkblue patches where schools of menhaden rippled the surface scarcely to be distinguished from the shadows of clouds sometimes the sea was spotted with them far and wide such is its inexhaustible fertility close at hand you see their back fin which is very long and sharp projecting two or three inches above water from time to time also we saw the white bellies of the bass playing along the shore it was a poetic recreation to watch those distant sails steering for halffabulous ports whose very names are a mysterious music to our ears fayal and babelmandel ay and chagres and panama bound to the famous bay of san francisco and the golden streams of sacramento and san joaquin to feather river and the american fork where sutters fort presides and inland stands the city de los angeles it is remarkable that men do not sail the sea with more expectation nothing remarkable was ever accomplished in a prosaic mood the heroes and discoverers have found true more than was previously believed only when they were expecting and dreaming of something more than their contemporaries dreamed of or even themselves discovered that is when they were in a frame of mind fitted to behold the truth referred to the worlds standard they are always insane even savages have indirectly surmised as much humboldt speaking of columbus approaching the new world says the grateful coolness of the evening air the ethereal purity of the starry firmament the balmy fragrance of flowers wafted to him by the land breeze all led him to suppose as we are told by herrara in the decades that he was approaching the garden of eden the sacred abode of our first parents the orinoco seemed to him one of the four rivers which according to the venerable tradition of the ancient world flowed from paradise to water and divide the surface of the earth newly adorned with plants so even the expeditions for the discovery of el dorado and of the fountain of youth led to real if not compensatory discoveries we discerned vessels so far off when once we began to look that only the tops of their masts in the horizon were visible and it took a strong intention of the eye and its most favorable side to see them at all and sometimes we doubted if we were not counting our eyelashes charles darwin states that he saw from the base of the andes the masts of the vessels at anchor in the bay of valparaiso although not less than twentysix geographical miles distant and that anson had been surprised at the distance at which his vessels were discovered from the coast without knowing the reason namely the great height of the land and the transparency of the air steamers may be detected much farther than sailing vessels for as one says when their hulls and masts of wood and iron are down their smoky masts and streamers still betray them and the same writer speaking of the comparative advantages of bituminous and anthracite coal for warsteamers states that from the ascent of the columns of smoke above the horizon the motions of the steamers in calais harbor on the coast of france are at all times observable at ramsgate on the english coast from the first lighting of the fires to the putting out at sea and that in america the steamers burning the fat bituminous coal can be tracked at sea at least seventy miles before the hulls become visible by the dense columns of black smoke pouring out of their chimneys and trailing along the horizon though there were numerous vessels at this great distance in the horizon on every side yet the vast spaces between them like the spaces between the stars far as they were distant from us so were they from one another nay some were twice as far from each other as from us impressed us with a sense of the immensity of the ocean the unfruitful ocean as it has been called and we could see what proportion man and his works bear to the globe as we looked off and saw the water growing darker and darker and deeper and deeper the farther we looked till it was awful to consider and it appeared to have no relation to the friendly land either as shore or bottom of what use is a bottom if it is out of sight if it is two or three miles from the surface and you are to be drowned so long before you get to it though it were made of the same stuff with your native soil over that ocean where as the veda says there is nothing to give support nothing to rest upon nothing to cling to i felt that i was a land animal the man in a balloon even may commonly alight on the earth in a few moments but the sailors only hope is that he may reach the distant shore i could then appreciate the heroism of the old navigator sir humphrey gilbert of whom it is related that being overtaken by a storm when on his return from america in the year far northeastward from where we were sitting abaft with a book in his hand just before he was swallowed up in the deep he cried out to his comrades in the hind as they came within hearing we are as near to heaven by sea as by land i saw that it would not be easy to realize on cape cod the next most eastern land you hear of is st georges bank the fishermen tell of georges cashus and other sunken lands which they frequent every cape man has a theory about georges bank having been an island once and in their accounts they gradually reduce the shallowness from six five four two fathoms to somebodys confident assertion that he has seen a mackerelgull sitting on a piece of dry land there it reminded me when i thought of the shipwrecks which had taken place there of the isle of demons laid down off this coast in old charts of the new world there must be something monstrous methinks in a vision of the sea bottom from over some bank a thousand miles from the shore more awful than its imagined bottomlessness a drowned continent all livid and frothing at the nostrils like the body of a drowned man which is better sunk deep than near the surface i have been surprised to discover from a steamer the shallowness of massachusetts bay itself off billingsgate point i could have touched the bottom with a pole and i plainly saw it variously shaded with seaweed at five or six miles from the shore this is the shoalground of the cape it is true but elsewhere the bay is not much deeper than a country pond we are told that the deepest water in the english channel between shakespeares cliff and cape grinйz in france is one hundred and eighty feet and guyot says that the baltic sea has a depth of only one hundred and twenty feet between the coasts of germany and those of sweden and the adriatic between venice and trieste has a depth of only one hundred and thirty feet a pond in my native town only half a mile long is more than one hundred feet deep the ocean is but a larger lake at midsummer you may sometimes see a strip of glassy smoothness on it a few rods in width and many miles long as if the surface there were covered with a thin pellicle of oil just as on a country pond a sort of standstill you would say at the meeting or parting of two currents of air if it does not rather mark the unrippled steadiness of a current of water beneath for sailors tell of the ocean and land breeze meeting between the fore and aft sails of a vessel while the latter are full the former being suddenly taken aback daniel webster in one of his letters describing bluefishing off marthas vineyard referring to those smooth places which fishermen and sailors call slicks says we met with them yesterday and our boatman made for them whenever discovered he said they were caused by the bluefish chopping up their prey that is to say those voracious fellows get into a school of menhaden which are too large to swallow whole and they bite them into pieces to suit their tastes and the oil from this butchery rising to the surface makes the slick yet this same placid ocean as civil now as a citys harbor a place for ships and commerce will erelong be lashed into sudden fury and all its caves and cliffs will resound with tumult it will ruthlessly heave these vessels to and fro break them in pieces in its sandy or stony jaws and deliver their crews to seamonsters it will play with them like seaweed distend them like dead frogs and carry them about now high now low to show to the fishes giving them a nibble this gentle ocean will toss and tear the rag of a mans body like the father of mad bulls and his relatives may be seen seeking the remnants for weeks along the strand from some quiet inland hamlet they have rushed weeping to the unheardof shore and now stand uncertain where a sailor has recently been buried amid the sandhills it is generally supposed that they who have long been conversant with the ocean can foretell by certain indications such as its roar and the notes of seafowl when it will change from calm to storm but probably no such ancient mariner as we dream of exists they know no more at least than the older sailors do about this voyage of life on which we are all embarked nevertheless we love to hear the sayings of old sailors and their accounts of natural phenomena which totally ignore and are ignored by science and possibly they have not always looked over the gunwale so long in vain kalm repeats a story which was told him in philadelphia by a mr cock who was one day sailing to the west indies in a small yacht with an old man on board who was well acquainted with those seas the old man sounding the depth called to the mate to tell mr cock to launch the boats immediately and to put a sufficient number of men into them in order to tow the yacht during the calm that they might reach the island before them as soon as possible as within twentyfour hours there would be a strong hurricane mr cock asked him what reasons he had to think so the old man replied that on sounding he saw the lead in the water at a distance of many fathoms more than he had seen it before that therefore the water was become clear all of a sudden which he looked upon as a certain sign of an impending hurricane in the sea the sequel of the story is that by good fortune and by dint of rowing they managed to gain a safe harbor before the hurricane had reached its height but it finally raged with so much violence that not only many ships were lost and houses unroofed but even their own vessel in harbor was washed so far on shore that several weeks elapsed before it could be got off the greeks would not have called the ocean greek atrnletos or unfruitful though it does not produce wheat if they had viewed it by the light of modern science for naturalists now assert that the sea and not the land is the principal seat of life though not of vegetable life darwin affirms that our most thickly inhabited forests appear almost as deserts when we come to compare them with the corresponding regions of the ocean agassiz and gould tell us that the sea teems with animals of all classes far beyond the extreme point of flowering plants but they add that experiments of dredging in very deep water have also taught us that the abyss of the ocean is nearly a desert so that modern investigations to quote the words of desor merely go to confirm the great idea which was vaguely anticipated by the ancient poets and philosophers that the ocean is the origin of all things yet marine animals and plants hold a lower rank in the scale of being than land animals and plants there is no instance known says desor of an animal becoming aquatic in its perfect state after having lived in its lower stage on dry land but as in the case of the tadpole the progress invariably points towards the dry land in short the dry land itself came through and out of the water in its way to the heavens for in going back through the geological ages we come to an epoch when according to all appearances the dry land did not exist and when the surface of our globe was entirely covered with water we looked on the sea then once more not as greek atrnletos or unfruitful but as it has been more truly called the laboratory of continents though we have indulged in some placid reflections of late the reader must not forget that the dash and roar of the waves were incessant indeed it would be well if he were to read with a large conchshell at his ear but notwithstanding that it was very cold and windy today it was such a cold as we thought would not cause one to take cold who was exposed to it owing to the saltness of the air and the dryness of the soil yet the author of the old description of wellfleet says the atmosphere is very much impregnated with saline particles which perhaps with the great use of fish and the neglect of cider and sprucebeer may be a reason why the people are more subject to sore mouths and throats than in other places vii across the cape when we have returned from the seaside we sometimes ask ourselves why we did not spend more time in gazing at the sea but very soon the traveller does not look as the sea more than at the heavens as for the interior if the elevated sandbar in the midst of the ocean can be said to have any interior it was an exceedingly desolate landscape with rarely a cultivated or cultivable field in sight we saw no villages and seldom a house for these are generally on the bay side it was a succession of shrubby hills and valleys now wearing an autumnal tint you would frequently think from the character of the surface the dwarfish trees and the bearberries around that you were on the top of a mountain the only wood in eastham was on the edge of wellfleet the pitchpines were not commonly more than fifteen or eighteen feet high the larger ones covered with lichens often hung with the long gray usnea there is scarcely a whitepine on the forearm of the cape yet in the northwest part of eastham near the camp ground we saw the next summer some quite rural and even sylvan retreats for the cape where small rustling groves of oaks and locusts and whispering pines on perfectly level ground made a little paradise the locusts both transplanted and growing naturally about the houses there appeared to flourish better than any other tree there were thin belts of wood in wellfleet and truro a mile or more from the atlantic but for the most part we could see the horizon through them or if extensive the trees were not large both oaks and pines had often the same flat look with the appletrees commonly the oak woods twentyfive years old were a mere scraggy shrubbery nine or ten feet high and we could frequently reach to their topmost leaf much that is called woods was about half as high as this only patches of shruboak bayberry beachplum and wild roses overrun with woodbine when the roses were in bloom these patches in the midst of the sand displayed such a profusion of blossoms mingled with the aroma of the bayberry that no italian or other artificial rosegarden could equal them they were perfectly elysian and realized my idea of an oasis in the desert huckleberrybushes were very abundant and the next summer they bore a remarkable quantity of that kind of gall called huckleberryapple forming quite handsome though monstrous blossoms but it must be added that this shrubbery swarmed with woodticks sometimes very troublesome parasites and which it takes very horny fingers to crack illustration a truro footpath the inhabitants of these towns have a great regard for a tree though their standard for one is necessarily neither large nor high and when they tell you of the large trees that once grew here you must think of them not as absolutely large but large compared with the present generation their brave old oaks of which they speak with so much respect and which they will point out to you as relics of the primitive forest one hundred or one hundred and fifty ay for aught they know two hundred years old have a ridiculously dwarfish appearance which excites a smile in the beholder the largest and most venerable which they will show you in such a case are perhaps not more than twenty or twentyfive feet high i was especially amused by the liliputian old oaks in the south part of truro to the inexperienced eye which appreciated their proportions only they might appear vast as the tree which saved his royal majesty but measured they were dwarfed at once almost into lichens which a deer might eat up in a morning yet they will tell you that large schooners were once built of timber which grew in wellfleet the old houses also are built of the timber of the cape but instead of the forests in the midst of which they originally stood barren heaths with povertygrass for heather now stretch away on every side the modern houses are built of what is called dimension timber imported from maine all ready to be set up so that commonly they do not touch it again with an axe almost all the wood used for fuel is imported by vessels or currents and of course all the coal i was told that probably a quarter of the fuel and a considerable part of the lumber used in north truro was driftwood many get all their fuel from the beach of birds not found in the interior of the state at least in my neighborhood i heard in the summer the blackthroated bunting fringilla americana amid the shrubbery and in the open land the upland plover totanus bartramius whose quivering notes were ever and anon prolonged into a clear somewhat plaintive yet hawklike scream which sounded at a very indefinite distance the bird may have been in the next field though it sounded a mile off today we were walking through truro a town of about eighteen hundred inhabitants we had already come to pamet river which empties into the bay this was the limit of the pilgrims journey up the cape from provincetown when seeking a place for settlement it rises in a hollow within a few rods of the atlantic and one who lives near its source told us that in high tides the sea leaked through yet the wind and waves preserve intact the barrier between them and thus the whole river is steadily driven westward buttend foremost fountainhead channel and lighthouse at the mouth all together early in the afternoon we reached the highland light whose white tower we had seen rising out of the bank in front of us for the last mile or two it is fourteen miles from the nauset lights on what is called the clay pounds an immense bed of clay abutting on the atlantic and as the keeper told us stretching quite across the cape which is here only about two miles wide we perceived at once a difference in the soil for there was an interruption of the desert and a slight appearance of a sod under our feet such as we had not seen for the last two days after arranging to lodge at the lighthouse we rambled across the cape to the bay over a singularly bleak and barrenlooking country consisting of rounded hills and hollows called by geologists diluvial elevations and depressions a kind of scenery which has been compared to a chopped sea though this suggests too sudden a transition there is a delineation of this very landscape in hitchcocks report on the geology of massachusetts a work which by its size at least reminds one of a diluvial elevation itself looking southward from the lighthouse the cape appeared like an elevated plateau sloping very regularly though slightly downward from the edge of the bank on the atlantic side about one hundred and fifty feet above the ocean to that on the bay side on traversing this we found it to be interrupted by broad valleys or gullies which become the hollows in the bank when the sea has worn up to them they are commonly at right angles with the shore and often extend quite across the cape some of the valleys however are circular a hundred feet deep without any outlet as if the cape had sunk in those places or its sands had run out the few scattered houses which we passed being placed at the bottom of the hollows for shelter and fertility were for the most part concealed entirely as much as if they had been swallowed up in the earth even a village with its meetinghouse which we had left little more than a stones throw behind had sunk into the earth spire and all and we saw only the surface of the upland and the sea on either hand when approaching it we had mistaken the belfry for a summerhouse on the plain we began to think that we might tumble into a village before we were aware of it as into an antlions hole and be drawn into the sand irrecoverably the most conspicuous objects on the land were a distant windmill or a meetinghouse standing alone for only they could afford to occupy an exposed place a great part of the township however is a barren heathlike plain and perhaps one third of it lies in common though the property of individuals the author of the old description of truro speaking of the soil says the snow which would be of essential service to it provided it lay level and covered the ground is blown into drifts and into the sea this peculiar open country with here and there a patch of shrubbery extends as much as seven miles or from pamet river on the south to high head on the north and from ocean to bay to walk over it makes on a stranger such an impression as being at sea and he finds it impossible to estimate distances in any weather a windmill or a herd of cows may seem to be far away in the horizon yet after going a few rods he will be close upon them he is also deluded by other kinds of mirage when in the summer i saw a family ablueberrying a mile off walking about amid the dwarfish bushes which did not come up higher than their ankles they seemed to me to be a race of giants twenty feet high at least the highest and sandiest portion next the atlantic was thinly covered with beachgrass and indigoweed next to this the surface of the upland generally consisted of white sand and gravel like coarse salt through which a scanty vegetation found its way up it will give an ornithologist some idea of its barrenness if i mention that the next june the month of grass i found a nighthawks eggs there and that almost any square rod thereabouts taken at random would be an eligible site for such a deposit the kildeerplover which loves a similar locality also drops its eggs there and fills the air above with its din this upland also produced cladonia lichens povertygrass savoryleaved aster diplopappus linariifolius mouseear bearberry c on a few hillsides the savoryleaved aster and mouseear alone made quite a dense sward said to be very pretty when the aster is in bloom in some parts the two species of povertygrass hudsonia tomentosa and ericoides which deserve a better name reign for miles in little hemispherical tufts or islets like moss scattered over the waste they linger in bloom there till the middle of july occasionally near the beach these rounded beds as also those of the seasandwort honkenya peploides were filled with sand within an inch of their tops and were hard like large anthills while the surrounding sand was soft in summer if the povertygrass grows at the head of a hollow looking toward the sea in a bleak position where the wind rushes up the northern or exposed half of the tuft is sometimes all black and dead like an ovenbroom while the opposite half is yellow with blossoms the whole hillside thus presenting a remarkable contrast when seen from the povertystricken and the flourishing side this plant which in many places would be esteemed an ornament is here despised by many on account of its being associated with barrenness it might well be adopted for the barnstable coatofarms in a field sableux i should be proud of it here and there were tracts of beachgrass mingled with the seaside goldenrod and beachpea which reminded us still more forcibly of the ocean illustration truro meetinghouse on the hill we read that there was not a brook in truro yet there were deer here once which must often have panted in vain but i am pretty sure that i afterward saw a small freshwater brook emptying into the south side of pamet river though i was so heedless as not to taste it at any rate a little boy near by told me that he drank at it there was not a tree as far as we could see and that was many miles each way the general level of the upland being about the same everywhere even from the atlantic side we overlooked the bay and saw to manomet point in plymouth and better from that side because it was the highest the almost universal bareness and smoothness of the landscape were as agreeable as novel making it so much the more like the deck of a vessel we saw vessels sailing south into the bay on the one hand and north along the atlantic shore on the other all with an aft wind the single road which runs lengthwise the cape now winding over the plain now through the shrubbery which scrapes the wheels of the stage was a mere carttrack in the sand commonly without any fences to confine it and continually changing from this side to that to harder ground or sometimes to avoid the tide but the inhabitants travel the waste here and there pilgrimwise and staff in hand by narrow footpaths through which the sand flows out and reveals the nakedness of the land we shuddered at the thought of living there and taking our afternoon walks over those barren swells where we could overlook every step of our walk before taking it and would have to pray for a fog or a snowstorm to conceal our destiny the walker there must soon eat his heart in the north part of the town there is no house from shore to shore for several miles and it is as wild and solitary as the western prairies used to be indeed one who has seen every house in truro will be surprised to hear of the number of the inhabitants but perhaps five hundred of the men and boys of this small town were then abroad on their fishing grounds only a few men stay at home to till the sand or watch for blackfish the farmers are fishermenfarmers and understand better ploughing the sea than the land they do not disturb their sands much though there is a plenty of seaweed in the creeks to say nothing of blackfish occasionally rotting the shore between the pond and east harbor village there was an interesting plantation of pitchpines twenty or thirty acres in extent like those which we had already seen from the stage one who lived near said that the land was purchased by two men for a shilling or twentyfive cents an acre some is not considered worth writing a deed for this soil or sand which was partially covered with poverty and beach grass sorrel c was furrowed at intervals of about four feet and the seed dropped by a machine the pines had come up admirably and grown the first year three or four inches and the second six inches and more where the seed had been lately planted the white sand was freshly exposed in an endless furrow winding round and round the sides of the deep hollows in a vertical spiral manner which produced a very singular effect as if you were looking into the reverse side of a vast banded shield this experiment so important to the cape appeared very successful and perhaps the time will come when the greater part of this kind of land in barnstable county will be thus covered with an artificial pine forest as has been done in some parts of france in that country acres of downs had been thus covered in near bayonne they are called pignadas and according to loudon constitute the principal riches of the inhabitants where there was a drifting desert before it seemed a nobler kind of grain to raise than corn even illustration a herd of cows a few years ago truro was remarkable among the cape towns for the number of sheep raised in it but i was told that at this time only two men kept sheep in the town and in a truro boy ten years old told me that he had never seen one they were formerly pastured on the unfenced lands or general fields but now the owners were more particular to assert their rights and it cost too much for fencing the rails are cedar from maine and two rails will answer for ordinary purposes but four are required for sheep this was the reason assigned by one who had formerly kept them for not keeping them any longer fencing stuff is so expensive that i saw fences made with only one rail and very often the rail when split was carefully tied with a string in one of the villages i saw the next summer a cow tethered by a rope six rods long the rope long in proportion as the feed was short and thin sixty rods ay all the cables of the cape would have been no more than fair tethered in the desert for fear that she would get into arabia felix i helped a man weigh a bundle of hay which he was selling to his neighbor holding one end of a pole from which it swung by a steelyard hook and this was just half his whole crop in short the country looked so barren that i several times refrained from asking the inhabitants for a string or a piece of wrappingpaper for fear i should rob them for they plainly were obliged to import these things as well as rails and where there were no newsboys i did not see what they would do for waste paper the objects around us the makeshifts of fishermen ashore often made us look down to see if we were standing on terra firma in the wells everywhere a block and tackle were used to raise the bucket instead of a windlass and by almost every house was laid up a spar or a plank or two full of augerholes saved from a wreck the windmills were partly built of these and they were worked into the public bridges the lighthouse keeper who was having his barn shingled told me casually that he had made three thousand good shingles for that purpose out of a mast you would sometimes see an old oar used for a rail frequently also some fairweather finery ripped off a vessel by a storm near the coast was nailed up against an outhouse i saw fastened to a shed near the lighthouse a long new sign with the words anglo saxon on it in large gilt letters as if it were a useless part which the ship could afford to lose or which the sailors had discharged at the same time with the pilot but it interested somewhat as if it had been a part of the argo clipped off in passing through the symplegades to the fisherman the cape itself is a sort of storeship laden with supplies a safer and larger craft which carries the women and children the old men and the sick and indeed seaphrases are as common on it as on board a vessel thus is it ever with a seagoing people the old northmen used to speak of the keelridge of the country that is the ridge of the doffrafield mountains as if the land were a boat turned bottom up i was frequently reminded of the northmen here the inhabitants of the cape are often at once farmers and searovers they are more than vikings or kings of the bays for their sway extends over the open sea also a farmer in wellfleet at whose house i afterward spent a night who had raised fifty bushels of potatoes the previous year which is a large crop for the cape and had extensive saltworks pointed to his schooner which lay in sight in which he and his man and boy occasionally ran down the coast atrading as far as the capes of virginia this was his marketcart and his hired man knew how to steer her thus he drove two teams afield ere the high seas appeared under the opening eyelids of the mom though probably he would not hear much of the gray fly on his way to virginia a great proportion of the inhabitants of the cape are always thus abroad about their teaming on some ocean highway or other and the history of one of their ordinary trips would cast the argonautic expedition into the shade i have just heard of a cape cod captain who was expected home in the beginning of the winter from the west indies but was long since given up for lost till his relations at length have heard with joy that after getting within forty miles of cape cod light he was driven back by nine successive gales to key west between florida and cuba and was once again shaping his course for home thus he spent his winter in ancient times the adventures of these two or three men and boys would have been made the basis of a myth but now such tales are crowded into a line of shorthand signs like an algebraic formula in the shipping news wherever over the world said palfrey in his oration at barnstable you see the stars and stripes floating you may have good hope that beneath them some one will be found who can tell you the soundings of barnstable or wellfleet or chatham harbor i passed by the home of somebodys or everybodys uncle bill one day over on the plymouth shore it was a schooner half keeledup on the mud we aroused the master out of a sound sleep at noonday by thumping on the bottom of his vessel till he presented himself at the hatchway for we wanted to borrow his clamdigger meaning to make him a call i looked out the next morning and lo he had run over to the pines the evening before fearing an easterly storm he outrode the great gale in the spring of dashing about alone in plymouth bay he goes after rockweed lighters vessels and saves wrecks i still saw him lying in the mud over at the pines in the horizon which place he could not leave if he would till flood tide but he would not then probably this waiting for the tide is a singular feature in life by the seashore a frequent answer is well you cant start for two hours yet it is something new to a landsman and at first he is not disposed to wait history says that two inhabitants of truro were the first who adventured to the falkland isles in pursuit of whales this voyage was undertaken in the year by the advice of admiral montague of the british navy and was crowned with success at the pond village we saw a pond three eighths of a mile long densely filled with cattail flags seven feet high enough for all the coopers in new england illustration pond village the western shore was nearly as sandy as the eastern but the water was much smoother and the bottom was partially covered with the slender grasslike seaweed zostera which we had not seen on the atlantic side there were also a few rude sheds for trying fish on the beach there which made it appear less wild in the few marshes on this side we afterward saw samphire rosemary and other plants new to us inlanders in the summer and fall sometimes hundreds of blackfish the social whale globicephalus melas of de kay called also black whalefish howling whale bottlehead etc fifteen feet or more in length are driven ashore in a single school here i witnessed such a scene in july a carpenter who was working at the lighthouse arriving early in the morning remarked that he did not know but he had lost fifty dollars by coming to his work for as he came along the bay side he heard them driving a school of blackfish ashore and he had debated with himself whether he should not go and join them and take his share but had concluded to come to his work after breakfast i came over to this place about two miles distant and near the beach met some of the fishermen returning from their chase looking up and down the shore i could see about a mile south some large black masses on the sand which i knew must be blackfish and a man or two about them as i walked along towards them i soon came to a huge carcass whose head was gone and whose blubber had been stripped off some weeks before the tide was just beginning to move it and the stench compelled me to go a long way round when i came to great hollow i found a fisherman and some boys on the watch and counted about thirty blackfish just killed with many lance wounds and the water was more or less bloody around they were partly on shore and partly in the water held by a rope round their tails till the tide should leave them a boat had been somewhat stove by the tail of one they were a smooth shining black like indiarubber and had remarkably simple and lumpish forms for animated creatures with a blunt round snout or head whalelike and simple stifflooking flippers the largest were about fifteen feet long but one or two were only five feet long and still without teeth the fisherman slashed one with his jackknife to show me how thick the blubber was about three inches and as i passed my finger through the cut it was covered thick with oil the blubber looked like pork and this man said that when they were trying it the boys would sometimes come round with a piece of bread in one hand and take a piece of blubber in the other to eat with it preferring it to pork scraps he also cut into the flesh beneath which was firm and red like beef and he said that for his part he preferred it when fresh to beef it is stated that in blackfish were used as food by the poor of bretagne they were waiting for the tide to leave these fishes high and dry that they might strip off the blubber and carry it to their tryworks in their boats where they try it on the beach they get commonly a barrel of oil worth fifteen or twenty dollars to a fish there were many lances and harpoons in the boats much slenderer instruments than i had expected an old man came along the beach with a horse and wagon distributing the dinners of the fishermen which their wives had put up in little pails and jugs and which he had collected in the pond village and for this service i suppose he received a share of the oil if one could not tell his own pail he took the first he came to as i stood there they raised the cry of another school and we could see their black backs and their blowing about a mile northward as they went leaping over the sea like horses some boats were already in pursuit there driving them toward the beach other fishermen and boys running up began to jump into the boats and push them off from where i stood and i might have gone too had i chosen soon there were twentyfive or thirty boats in pursuit some large ones under sail and others rowing with might and main keeping outside of the school those nearest to the fishes striking on the sides of their boats and blowing horns to drive them on to the beach it was an exciting race if they succeed in driving them ashore each boat takes one share and then each man but if they are compelled to strike them off shore each boats company take what they strike i walked rapidly along the shore toward the north while the fishermen were rowing still more swiftly to join their companions and a little boy who walked by my side was congratulating himself that his fathers boat was beating another one an old blind fisherman whom we met inquired where are they i cant see have they got them in the mean while the fishes had turned and were escaping northward toward provincetown only occasionally the back of one being seen so the nearest crews were compelled to strike them and we saw several boats soon made fast each to its fish which four or five rods ahead was drawing it like a racehorse straight toward the beach leaping half out of water blowing blood and water from its hole and leaving a streak of foam behind but they went ashore too far north for us though we could see the fishermen leap out and lance them on the sand it was just like pictures of whaling which i have seen and a fisherman told me that it was nearly as dangerous in his first trial he had been much excited and in his haste had used a lance with its scabbard on but nevertheless had thrust it quite through his fish i learned that a few days before this one hundred and eighty blackfish had been driven ashore in one school at eastham a little farther south and that the keeper of billingsgate point light went out one morning about the same time and cut his initials on the backs of a large school which had run ashore in the night and sold his right to them to provincetown for one thousand dollars and probably provincetown made as much more another fisherman told me that nineteen years ago three hundred and eighty were driven ashore in one school at great hollow in the naturalists library it is said that in the winter of one thousand one hundred and ten approached the shore of hralfiord iceland and were captured de kay says it is not known why they are stranded but one fisherman declared to me that they ran ashore in pursuit of squid and that they generally came on the coast about the last of july about a week afterward when i came to this shore it was strewn as far as i could see with a glass with the carcasses of blackfish stripped of their blubber and their heads cut off the latter lying higher up walking on the beach was out of the question on account of the stench between provincetown and truro they lay in the very path of the stage yet no steps were taken to abate the nuisance and men were catching lobsters as usual just off the shore i was told that they did sometimes tow them out and sink them yet i wondered where they got the stones to sink them with of course they might be made into guano and cape cod is not so fertile that her inhabitants can afford to do without this manure to say nothing of the diseases they may produce after my return home wishing to learn what was known about the blackfish i had recourse to the reports of the zoological surveys of the state and i found that storer had rightfully omitted it in his report on the fishes since it is not a fish so i turned to emmonss report of the mammalia but was surprised to find that the seals and whales were omitted by him because he had had no opportunity to observe them considering how this state has risen and thriven by its fisheries that the legislature which authorized the zoological survey sat under the emblem of a codfish that nantucket and new bedford are within our limits that an early riser may find a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars worth of blackfish on the shore in a morning that the pilgrims saw the indians cutting up a blackfish on the shore at eastham and called a part of that shore grampus bay from the number of blackfish they found there before they got to plymouth and that from that time to this these fishes have continued to enrich one or two counties almost annually and that their decaying carcasses were now poisoning the air of one county for more than thirty miles i thought it remarkable that neither the popular nor scientific name was to be found in a report on our mammalia a catalogue of the productions of our land and water we had here as well as all across the cape a fair view of provincetown five or six miles distant over the water toward the west under its shrubby sandhills with its harbor now full of vessels whose masts mingled with the spires of its churches and gave it the appearance of a quite large seaport town the inhabitants of all the lower cape towns enjoy thus the prospect of two seas standing on the western or larboard shore and looking across to where the distant mainland looms they can say this is massachusetts bay and then after an hours sauntering walk they may stand on the starboard side beyond which no land is seen to loom and say this is the atlantic ocean on our way back to the lighthouse by whose whitewashed tower we steered as securely as the mariner by its light at night we passed through a graveyard which apparently was saved from being blown away by its slates for they had enabled a thick bed of huckleberrybushes to root themselves amid the graves we thought it would be worth the while to read the epitaphs where so many were lost at sea however as not only their lives but commonly their bodies also were lost or not identified there were fewer epitaphs of this sort than we expected though there were not a few their graveyard is the ocean near the eastern side we started up a fox in a hollow the only kind of wild quadruped if i except a skunk in a saltmarsh that we saw in all our walk unless painted and box tortoises may be called quadrupeds he was a large plump shaggy fellow like a yellow dog with as usual a white tip to his tail and looked as if he fared well on the cape he cantered away into the shruboaks and bayberrybushes which chanced to grow there but were hardly high enough to conceal him i saw another the next summer leaping over the top of a beachplum a little farther north a small arc of his course which i trust is not yet run from which i endeavored in vain to calculate his whole orbit there were too many unknown attractions to be allowed for i also saw the exuviae of a third fast sinking into the sand and added the skull to my collection hence i concluded that they must be plenty thereabouts but a traveller may meet with more than an inhabitant since he is more likely to take an unfrequented route across the country they told me that in some years they died off in great numbers by a kind of madness under the effect of which they were seen whirling round and round as if in pursuit of their tails in crantzs account of greenland he says they the foxes live upon birds and their eggs and when they cant get them upon crowberries mussels crabs and what the sea casts out just before reaching the lighthouse we saw the sun set in the bay for standing on that narrow cape was as i have said like being on the deck of a vessel or rather at the masthead of a manofwar thirty miles at sea though we knew that at the same moment the sun was setting behind our native hills which were just below the horizon in that direction this sight drove everything else quite out of our heads and homer and the ocean came in again with a rush greek en d epes фkeanф lamron phaos кelioio the shining torch of the sun fell into the ocean viii the highland light this lighthouse known to mariners as the cape cod or highland light is one of our primary seacoast lights and is usually the first seen by those approaching the entrance of massachusetts bay from europe it is fortythree miles from cape ann light and fortyone from boston light it stands about twenty rods from the edge of the bank which is here formed of clay i borrowed the plane and square level and dividers of a carpenter who was shingling a barn near by and using one of those shingles made of a mast contrived a rude sort of quadrant with pins for sights and pivots and got the angle of elevation of the bank opposite the lighthouse and with a couple of codlines the length of its slope and so measured its height on the shingle it rises one hundred and ten feet above its immediate base or about one hundred and twentythree feet above mean low water graham who has carefully surveyed the extremity of the cape makes it one hundred and thirty feet the mixed sand and clay lay at an angle of forty degrees with the horizon where i measured it but the clay is generally much steeper no cow nor hen ever gets down it half a mile farther south the bank is fifteen or twentyfive feet higher and that appeared to be the highest land in north truro even this vast clay bank is fast wearing away small streams of water trickling down it at intervals of two or three rods have left the intermediate clay in the form of steep gothic roofs fifty feet high or more the ridges as sharp and ruggedlooking as rocks and in one place the bank is curiously eaten out in the form of a large semicircular crater illustration dragging a dory up on the beach according to the lighthouse keeper the cape is wasting here on both sides though most on the eastern in some places it had lost many rods within the last year and erelong the lighthouse must be moved we calculated from his data how soon the cape would be quite worn away at this point for said he i can remember sixty years back we were even more surprised at this last announcement that is at the slow waste of life and energy in our informant for we had taken him to be not more than forty than at the rapid wasting of the cape and we thought that he stood a fair chance to outlive the former between this october and june of the next year i found that the bank had lost about forty feet in one place opposite the lighthouse and it was cracked more than forty feet farther from the edge at the last date the shore being strewn with the recent rubbish but i judged that generally it was not wearing away here at the rate of more than six feet annually any conclusions drawn from the observations of a few years or one generation only are likely to prove false and the cape may balk expectation by its durability in some places even a wreckers footpath down the bank lasts several years one old inhabitant told us that when the lighthouse was built in it was calculated that it would stand fortyfive years allowing the bank to waste one length of fence each year but said he there it is or rather another near the same site about twenty rods from the edge of the bank the sea is not gaining on the cape everywhere for one man told me of a vessel wrecked long ago on the north of provincetown whose bones this was his word are still visible many rods within the present line of the beach half buried in sand perchance they lie alongside the timbers of a whale the general statement of the inhabitants is that the cape is wasting on both sides but extending itself on particular points on the south and west as at chatham and monomoy beaches and at billingsgate long and race points james freeman stated in his day that above three miles had been added to monomoy beach during the previous fifty years and it is said to be still extending as fast as ever a writer in the massachusetts magazine in the last century tells us that when the english first settled upon the cape there was an island off chatham at three leagues distance called webbs island containing twenty acres covered with redcedar or savin the inhabitants of nantucket used to carry wood from it but he adds that in his day a large rock alone marked the spot and the water was six fathoms deep there the entrance to nauset harbor which was once in eastham has now travelled south into orleans the islands in wellfleet harbor once formed a continuous beach though now small vessels pass between them and so of many other parts of this coast perhaps what the ocean takes from one part of the cape it gives to another robs peter to pay paul on the eastern side the sea appears to be everywhere encroaching on the land not only the land is undermined and its ruins carried off by currents but the sand is blown from the beach directly up the steep bank where it is one hundred and fifty feet high and covers the original surface there many feet deep if you sit on the edge you will have ocular demonstration of this by soon getting your eyes full thus the bank preserves its height as fast as it is worn away this sand is steadily travelling westward at a rapid rate more than a hundred yards says one writer within the memory of inhabitants now living so that in some places peatmeadows are buried deep under the sand and the peat is cut through it and in one place a large peatmeadow has made its appearance on the shore in the bank covered many feet deep and peat has been cut there this accounts for that great pebble of peat which we saw in the surf the old oysterman had told us that many years ago he lost a crittur by her being mired in a swamp near the atlantic side east of his house and twenty years ago he lost the swamp itself entirely but has since seen signs of it appearing on the beach he also said that he had seen cedar stumps as big as cartwheels on the bottom of the bay three miles off billingsate point when leaning over the side of his boat in pleasant weather and that that was dry land not long ago another told us that a log canoe known to have been buried many years before on the bay side at east harbor in truro where the cape is extremely narrow appeared at length on the atlantic side the cape having rolled over it and an old woman said now you see it is true what i told you that the cape is moving the bars along the coast shift with every storm and in many places there is occasionally none at all we ourselves observed the effect of a single storm with a high tide in the night in july it moved the sand on the beach opposite the lighthouse to the depth of six feet and three rods in width as far as we could see north and south and carried it bodily off no one knows exactly where laying bare in one place a large rock five feet high which was invisible before and narrowing the beach to that extent there is usually as i have said no bathing on the backside of the cape on account of the undertow but when we were there last the sea had three months before cast up a bar near this lighthouse two miles long and ten rods wide over which the tide did not flow leaving a narrow cove then a quarter of a mile long between it and the shore which afforded excellent bathing this cove had from time to time been closed up as the bar travelled northward in one instance imprisoning four or five hundred whiting and cod which died there and the water as often turned fresh and finally gave place to sand this bar the inhabitants assured us might be wholly removed and the water six feet deep there in two or three days the lighthouse keeper said that when the wind blowed strong on to the shore the waves ate fast into the bank but when it blowed off they took no sand away for in the former case the wind heaped up the surface of the water next to the beach and to preserve its equilibrium a strong undertow immediately set back again into the sea which carried with it the sand and whatever else was in the way and left the beach hard to walk on but in the latter case the undertow set on and carried the sand with it so that it was particularly difficult for shipwrecked men to get to land when the wind blowed on to the shore but easier when it blowed off this undertow meeting the next surface wave on the bar which itself has made forms part of the dam over which the latter breaks as over an upright wall the sea thus plays with the land holding a sandbar in its mouth awhile before it swallows it as a cat plays with a mouse but the fatal gripe is sure to come at last the sea sends its rapacious east wind to rob the land but before the former has got far with its prey the land sends its honest west wind to recover some of its own but according to lieutenant davis the forms extent and distribution of sandbars and banks are principally determined not by winds and waves but by tides our host said that you would be surprised if you were on the beach when the wind blew a hurricane directly on to it to see that none of the driftwood came ashore but all was carried directly northward and parallel with the shore as fast as a man can walk by the inshore current which sets strongly in that direction at flood tide the strongest swimmers also are carried along with it and never gain an inch toward the beach even a large rock has been moved half a mile northward alongthe beach he assured us that the sea was never still on the backside of the cape but ran commonly as high as your head so that a great part of the time you could not launch a boat there and even in the calmest weather the waves run six or eight feet up the beach though then you could get off on a plank champlain and pourtrincourt could not land here in on account of the swell la houlle yet the savages came off to them in a canoe in the sieur de la bordes relation des caraibes my edition of which was published at amsterdam in at page he says couroumon a caraibe also a star ie a god makes the great lames б la mer and overturns canoes lames б la mer are the long vagues which are not broken entrecoupйes and such as one sees come to land all in one piece from one end of a beach to another so that however little wind there may be a shallop or a canoe could hardly land aborder terre without turning over or being filled with water but on the bay side the water even at its edge is often as smooth and still as in a pond commonly there are no boats used along this beach there was a boat belonging to the highland light which the next keeper after he had been there a year had not launched though he said that there was good fishing just off the shore generally the life boats cannot be used when needed when the waves run very high it is impossible to get a boat off however skilfully you steer it for it will often be completely covered by the curving edge of the approaching breaker as by an arch and so filled with water or it will be lifted up by its bows turned directly over backwards and all the contents spilled out a spar thirty feet long is served in the same way i heard of a party who went off fishing back of wellfleet some years ago in two boats in calm weather who when they had laden their boats with fish and approached the land again found such a swell breaking on it though there was no wind that they were afraid to enter it at first they thought to pull for provincetown but night was coming on and that was many miles distant their case seemed a desperate one as often as they approached the shore and saw the terrible breakers that intervened they were deterred in short they were thoroughly frightened finally having thrown their fish overboard those in one boat chose a favorable opportunity and succeeded by skill and good luck in reaching the land but they were unwilling to take the responsibility of telling the others when to come in and as the other helmsman was inexperienced their boat was swamped at once yet all managed to save themselves much smaller waves soon make a boat nailsick as the phrase is the keeper said that after a long and strong blow there would be three large waves each successively larger than the last and then no large ones for some time and that when they wished to land in a boat they came in on the last and largest wave sir thomas browne as quoted in brands popular antiquities p on the subject of the tenth wave being greater or more dangerous than any other after quoting ovid qui venit hic fluctus fluctus supereminet omnes posterior nono est undecimo que prior says which notwithstanding is evidently false nor can it be made out either by observation either upon the shore or the ocean as we have with diligence explored in both and surely in vain we expect regularity in the waves of the sea or in the particular motions thereof as we may in its general reciprocations whose causes are constant and effects therefore correspondent whereas its fluctuations are but motions subservient which winds storms shores shelves and every interjacency irregulates we read that the clay pounds were so called because vessels have had the misfortune to be pounded against it in gales of wind which we regard as a doubtful derivation there are small ponds here upheld by the clay which were formerly called the clay pits perhaps this or clay ponds is the origin of the name water is found in the clay quite near the surface but we heard of one man who had sunk a well in the sand close by till he could see stars at noonday without finding any over this bare highland the wind has full sweep even in july it blows the wings over the heads of the young turkeys which do not know enough to head against it and in gales the doors and windows are blown in and you must hold on to the lighthouse to prevent being blown into the atlantic they who merely keep out on the beach in a storm in the winter are sometimes rewarded by the humane society if you would feel the full force of a tempest take up your residence on the top of mount washington or at the highland light in truro it was said in that more vessels were cast away on the east shore of truro than anywhere in barnstable county notwithstanding that this lighthouse has since been erected after almost every storm we read of one or more vessels wrecked here and sometimes more than a dozen wrecks are visible from this point at one time the inhabitants hear the crash of vessels going to pieces as they sit round their hearths and they commonly date from some memorable shipwreck if the history of this beach could be written from beginning to end it would be a thrilling page in the history of commerce truro was settled in the year as dangerfield this was a very appropriate name for i afterward read on a monument in the graveyard near pamet river the following inscription sacred to the memory of citizens of truro who were lost in seven vessels which foundered at sea in the memorable gale of oct d their names and ages by families were recorded on different sides of the stone they are said to have been lost on georges bank and i was told that only one vessel drifted ashore on the backside of the cape with the boys locked into the cabin and drowned it is said that the homes of all were within a circuit of two miles twentyeight inhabitants of dennis were lost in the same gale and i read that in one day immediately after this storm nearly or quite one hundred bodies were taken up and buried on cape cod the truro insurance company failed for want of skippers to take charge of its vessels but the surviving inhabitants went afishing again the next year as usual i found that it would not do to speak of shipwrecks there for almost every family has lost some of its members at sea who lives in that house i inquired three widows was the reply the stranger and the inhabitant view the shore with very different eyes the former may have come to see and admire the ocean in a storm but the latter looks on it as the scene where his nearest relatives were wrecked when i remarked to an old wrecker partially blind who was sitting on the edge of the bank smoking a pipe which he had just lit with a match of dried beachgrass that i supposed he liked to hear the sound of the surf he answered no i do not like to hear the sound of the surf he had lost at least one son in the memorable gale and could tell many a tale of the shipwrecks which he had witnessed there in the year a noted pirate named bellamy was led on to the bar off wellfleet by the captain of a snow which he had taken to whom he had offered his vessel again if he would pilot him into provincetown harbor tradition says that the latter threw over a burning tarbarrel in the night which drifted ashore and the pirates followed it a storm coming on their whole fleet was wrecked and more than a hundred dead bodies lay along the shore six who escaped shipwreck were executed at times to this day says the historian of wellfleet there are king william and queen marys coppers picked up and pieces of silver called cobmoney the violence of the seas moves the sands on the outer bar so that at times the iron caboose of the ship that is bellamys at low ebbs has been seen another tells us that for many years after this shipwreck a man of a very singular and frightful aspect used every spring and autumn to be seen travelling on the cape who was supposed to have been one of bellamys crew the presumption is that he went to some place where money had been secreted by the pirates to get such a supply as his exigencies required when he died many pieces of gold were found in a girdle which he constantly wore illustration an old wrecker at home as i was walking on the beach here in my last visit looking for shells and pebbles just after that storm which i have mentioned as moving the sand to a great depth not knowing but i might find some cobmoney i did actually pick up a french crown piece worth about a dollar and six cents near highwater mark on the still moist sand just under the abrupt caving base of the bank it was of a dark slate color and looked like a flat pebble but still bore a very distinct and handsome head of louis xv and the usual legend on the reverse sit nomen domini benedictum blessed be the name of the lord a pleasing sentiment to read in the sands of the seashore whatever it might be stamped on and i also made out the date of course i thought at first that it was that same old button which i have found so many times but my knife soon showed the silver afterward rambling on the bars at low tide i cheated my companion by holding up round shells scutelloe between my fingers whereupon he quickly stripped and came off to me in the revolution a british ship of war called the somerset was wrecked near the clay pounds and all on board some hundreds in number were taken prisoners my informant said that he had never seen any mention of this in the histories but that at any rate he knew of a silver watch which one of those prisoners by accident left there which was still going to tell the story but this event is noticed by some writers the next summer i saw a sloop from chatham dragging for anchors and chains just oft this shore she had her boats out at the work while she shuffled about on various tacks and when anything was found drew up to hoist it on board it is a singular employment at which men are regularly hired and paid for their industry to hunt today in pleasant weather for anchors which have been lost the sunken faith and hope of mariners to which they trusted in vain now perchance it is the rusty one of some old pirates ship or norman fisherman whose cable parted here two hundred years ago and now the best bower anchor of a canton or a california ship which has gone about her business if the roadsteads of the spiritual ocean could be thus dragged what rusty flukes of hope deceived and parted chaincables of faith might again be windlassed aboard enough to sink the finders craft or stock new navies to the end of time the bottom of the sea is strewn with anchors some deeper and some shallower and alternately covered and uncovered by the sand perchance with a small length of iron cable still attached to which where is the other end so many unconcluded tales to be continued another time so if we had divingbells adapted to the spiritual deeps we should see anchors with their cables attached as thick as eels in vinegar all wriggling vainly toward their holdingground but that is not treasure for us which another man has lost rather it is for us to seek what no other man has found or can find not be chatham men dragging for anchors the annals of this voracious beach who could write them unless it were a shipwrecked sailor how many who have seen it have seen it only in the midst of danger and distress the last strip of earth which their mortal eyes beheld think of the amount of suffering which a single strand has witnessed the ancients would have represented it as a seamonster with open jaws more terrible than scylla and charybdis an inhabitant of truro told me that about a fortnight after the st john was wrecked at cohasset he found two bodies on the shore at the clay pounds they were those of a man and a corpulent woman the man had thick boots on though his head was off but it was alongside it took the finder some weeks to get over the sight perhaps they were man and wife and whom god had joined the ocean currents had not put asunder yet by what slight accidents at first may they have been associated in their drifting some of the bodies of those passengers were picked up far out at sea boxed up and sunk some brought ashore and buried there are more consequences to a shipwreck than the underwriters notice the gulf stream may return some to their native shores or drop them in some outoftheway cave of ocean where time and the elements will write new riddles with their bones but to return to land again in this bank above the clay i counted in the summer two hundred holes of the bank swallow within a space six rods long and there were at least one thousand old birds within three times that distance twittering over the surf i had never associated them in my thoughts with the beach before one little boy who had been abirdsnesting had got eighty swallows eggs for his share tell it not to the humane society there were many young birds on the clay beneath which had tumbled out and died also there were many crowblackbirds hopping about in the dry fields and the upland plover were breeding close by the lighthouse the keeper had once cut off ones wing while mowing as she sat on her eggs there this is also a favorite resort for gunners in the fall to shoot the golden plover as around the shores of a pond are seen devilsneedles butterflies etc so here to my surprise i saw at the same season great devilsneedles of a size proportionably larger or nearly as big as my finger incessantly coasting up and down the edge of the bank and butterflies also were hovering over it and i never saw so many dorrbugs and beetles of various kinds as strewed the beach they had apparently flown over the bank in the night and could not get up again and some had perhaps fallen into the sea and were washed ashore they may have been in part attracted by the lighthouse lamps the clay pounds are a more fertile tract than usual we saw some fine patches of roots and corn here as generally on the cape the plants had little stalk or leaf but ran remarkably to seed the corn was hardly more than half as high as in the interior yet the ears were large and full and one farmer told us that he could raise forty bushels on an acre without manure and sixty with it the heads of the rye also were remarkably large the shadbush amelanchier beach plums and blueberries vaccinium pennsylvanicum like the appletrees and oaks were very dwarfish spreading over the sand but at the same time very fruitful the blueberry was but an inch or two high and its fruit often rested on the ground so that you did not suspect the presence of the bushes even on those bare hills until you were treading on them i thought that this fertility must be owing mainly to the abundance of moisture in the atmosphere for i observed that what little grass there was was remarkably laden with dew in the morning and in summer dense imprisoning fogs frequently last till midday turning ones beard into a wet napkin about his throat and the oldest inhabitant may lose his way within a stones throw of his house or be obliged to follow the beach for a guide the brick house attached to the lighthouse was exceedingly damp at that season and writingpaper lost all its stiffness in it it was impossible to dry your towel after bathing or to press flowers without their mildewing the air was so moist that we rarely wished to drink though we could at all times taste the salt on our lips salt was rarely used at table and our host told us that his cattle invariably refused it when it was offered them they got so much with their grass and at every breath but he said that a sick horse or one just from the country would sometimes take a hearty draught of salt water and seemed to like it and be the better for it it was surprising to see how much water was contained in the terminal bud of the seaside goldenrod standing in the sand early in july and also how turnips beets carrots etc flourished even in pure sand a man travelling by the shore near there not long before us noticed something green growing in the pure sand of the beach just at highwater mark and on approaching found it to be a bed of beets flourishing vigorously probably from seed washed out of the franklin also beets and turnips came up in the seaweed used for manure in many parts of the cape this suggests how various plants may have been dispersed over the world to distant islands and continents vessels with seeds in their cargoes destined for particular ports where perhaps they were not needed have been cast away on desolate islands and though their crews perished some of their seeds have been preserved out of many kinds a few would find a soil and climate adapted to them become naturalized and perhaps drive out the native plants at last and so fit the land for the habitation of man it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good and for the time lamentable shipwrecks may thus contribute a new vegetable to a continents stock and prove on the whole a lasting blessing to its inhabitants or winds and currents might effect the same without the intervention of man what indeed are the various succulent plants which grow on the beach but such beds of beets and turnips sprung originally from seeds which perhaps were cast on the waters for this end though we do not know the franklin which they came out of in ancient times some mr bell was sailing this way in his ark with seeds of rocket saltwort sandwort beachgrass samphire bayberry povertygrass etc all nicely labelled with directions intending to establish a nursery somewhere and did not a nursery get established though he thought that he had failed about the lighthouse i observed in the summer the pretty polygala polygama spreading raywise flat on the ground white pasture thistles cirsium pumilum and amid the shrubbery the smilax glauca which is commonly said not to grow so far north near the edge of the banks about half a mile southward the broom crowberry empetrum conradii for which plymouth is the only locality in massachusetts usually named forms pretty green mounds four or five feet in diameter by one foot high soft springy beds for the wayfarer i saw it afterward in provincetown but prettiest of all the scarlet pimpernel or poormans weatherglass anagallisarvensis greets you in fair weather on almost every square yard of sand from yarmouth i have received the chrysopsis falcata golden aster and vaccinium stamineum deerberry or squaw huckleberry with fruit not edible sometimes as large as a cranberry sept illustration the highland light the highland lighthouse where we were staying is a substantiallooking building of brick painted white and surmounted by an iron cap attached to it is the dwelling of the keeper one story high also of brick and built by government as we were going to spend the night in a lighthouse we wished to make the most of so novel an experience and therefore told our host that we would like to accompany him when he went to light up at rather early candlelight he lighted a small japan lamp allowing it to smoke rather more than we like on ordinary occasions and told us to follow him he led the way first through his bedroom which was placed nearest to the lighthouse and then through a long narrow covered passageway between whitewashed walls like a prison entry into the lower part of the lighthouse where many great butts of oil were arranged around thence we ascended by a winding and open iron stairway with a steadily increasing scent of oil and lampsmoke to a trapdoor in an iron floor and through this into the lantern it was a neat building with everything in applepie order and no danger of anything rusting there for want of oil the light consisted of fifteen argand lamps placed within smooth concave reflectors twentyone inches in diameter and arranged in two horizontal circles one above the other facing every way excepting directly down the cape these were surrounded at a distance of two or three feet by large plateglass windows which defied the storms with iron sashes on which rested the iron cap all the iron work except the floor was painted white and thus the lighthouse was completed we walked slowly round in that narrow space as the keeper lighted each lamp in succession conversing with him at the same moment that many a sailor on the deep witnessed the lighting of the highland light his duty was to fill and trim and light his lamps and keep bright the reflectors he filled them every morning and trimmed them commonly once in the course of the night he complained of the quality of the oil which was furnished this house consumes about eight hundred gallons in a year which cost not far from one dollar a gallon but perhaps a few lives would be saved if better oil were provided another lighthouse keeper said that the same proportion of winterstrained oil was sent to the southernmost lighthouse in the union as to the most northern formerly when this lighthouse had windows with small and thin panes a severe storm would sometimes break the glass and then they were obliged to put up a wooden shutter in haste to save their lights and reflectors and sometimes in tempests when the mariner stood most in need of their guidance they had thus nearly converted the lighthouse into a dark lantern which emitted only a few feeble rays and those commonly on the land or lee side he spoke of the anxiety and sense of responsibility which he felt in cold and stormy nights in the winter when he knew that many a poor fellow was depending on him and his lamps burned dimly the oil being chilled sometimes he was obliged to warm the oil in a kettle in his house at midnight and fill his lamps over again for he could not have a fire in the lighthouse it produced such a sweat on the windows his successor told me that he could not keep too hot a fire in such a case all this because the oil was poor the government lighting the mariners on its wintry coast with summerstrained oil to save expense that were surely a summerstrained mercy this keepers successor who kindly entertained me the next year stated that one extremely cold night when this and all the neighboring lights were burning summer oil but he had been provident enough to reserve a little winter oil against emergencies he was waked up with anxiety and found that his oil was congealed and his lights almost extinguished and when after many hours exertion he had succeeded in replenishing his reservoirs with winter oil at the wick end and with difficulty had made them burn he looked out and found that the other lights in the neighborhood which were usually visible to him had gone out and he heard afterward that the pamet river and billingsgate lights also had been extinguished our host said that the frost too on the windows caused him much trouble and in sultry summer nights the moths covered them and dimmed his lights sometimes even small birds flew against the thick plate glass and were found on the ground beneath in the morning with their necks broken in the spring of he found nineteen small yellowbirds perhaps goldfinches or myrtlebirds thus lying dead around the lighthouse and sometimes in the fall he had seen where a golden plover had struck the glass in the night and left the down and the fatty part of its breast on it thus he struggled by every method to keep his light shining before men surely the lighthouse keeper has a responsible if an easy office when his lamp goes out he goes out or at most only one such accident is pardoned i thought it a pity that some poor student did not live there to profit by all that light since he would not rob the mariner well he said i do sometimes come up here and read the newspaper when they are noisy down below think of fifteen argand lamps to read the newspaper by government oil light enough perchance to read the constitution by i thought that he should read nothing less than his bible by that light i had a classmate who fitted for college by the lamps of a lighthouse which was more light we think than the university afforded when we had come down and walked a dozen rods from the lighthouse we found that we could not get the full strength of its light on the narrow strip of land between it and the shore being too low for the focus and we saw only so many feeble and rayless stars but at forty rods inland we could see to read though we were still indebted to only one lamp each reflector sent forth a separate fan of light one shone on the windmill and one in the hollow while the intervening spaces were in shadow this light is said to be visible twenty nautical miles and more from an observer fifteen feet above the level of the sea we could see the revolving light at race point the end of the cape about nine miles distant and also the light on long point at the entrance of provincetown harbor and one of the distant plymouth harbor lights across the bay nearly in a range with the last like a star in the horizon the keeper thought that the other plymouth light was concealed by being exactly in a range with the long point light he told us that the mariner was sometimes led astray by a mackerel fishers lantern who was afraid of being run down in the night or even by a cottagers light mistaking them for some wellknown light on the coast and when he discovered his mistake was wont to curse the prudent fisher or the wakeful cottager without reason though it was once declared that providence placed this mass of clay here on purpose to erect a lighthouse on the keeper said that the lighthouse should have been erected half a mile farther south where the coast begins to bend and where the light could be seen at the same time with the nauset lights and distinguished from them they now talk of building one there it happens that the present one is the more useless now so near the extremity of the cape because other lighthouses have since been erected there among the many regulations of the lighthouse board hanging against the wall here many of them excellent perhaps if there were a regiment stationed here to attend to them there is one requiring the keeper to keep an account of the number of vessels which pass his light during the day but there are a hundred vessels in sight at once steering in all directions many on the very verge of the horizon and he must have more eyes than argus and be a good deal farthersighted to tell which are passing his light it is an employment in some respects best suited to the habits of the gulls which coast up and down here and circle over the sea i was told by the next keeper that on the th of june following a particularly clear and beautiful morning he rose about half an hour before sunrise and having a little time to spare for his custom was to extinguish his lights at sunrise walked down toward the shore to see what he might find when he got to the edge of the bank he looked up and to his astonishment saw the sun rising and already part way above the horizon thinking that his clock was wrong he made haste back and though it was still too early by the clock extinguished his lamps and when he had got through and come down he looked out the window and to his still greater astonishment saw the sun just where it was before twothirds above the horizon he showed me where its rays fell on the wall across the room he proceeded to make a fire and when he had done there was the sun still at the same height whereupon not trusting to his own eyes any longer he called up his wife to look at it and she saw it also there were vessels in sight on the ocean and their crews too he said must have seen it for its rays fell on them it remained at that height for about fifteen minutes by the clock and then rose as usual and nothing else extraordinary happened during that day though accustomed to the coast he had never witnessed nor heard of such a phenomenon before i suggested that there might have been a cloud in the horizon invisible to him which rose with the sun and his clock was only as accurate as the average or perhaps as he denied the possibility of this it was such a looming of the sun as is said to occur at lake superior and elsewhere sir john franklin for instance says in his narrative that when he was on the shore of the polar sea the horizontal refraction varied so much one morning that the upper limb of the sun twice appeared at the horizon before it finally rose he certainly must be a son of aurora to whom the sun looms when there are so many millions to whom it glooms rather or who never see it till an hour after it has risen but it behooves us old stagers to keep our lamps trimmed and burning to the last and not trust to the suns looming this keeper remarked that the centre of the flame should be exactly opposite the centre of the reflectors and that accordingly if he was not careful to turn down his wicks in the morning the sun falling on the reflectors on the south side of the building would set fire to them like a burningglass in the coldest day and he would look up at noon and see them all lighted when your light is ready to give light it is readiest to receive it and the sun will light it his successor said that he had never known them to blaze in such a case but merely to smoke i saw that this was a place of wonders in a sea turn or shallow fog while i was there the next summer it being clear overhead the edge of the bank twenty rods distant appeared like a mountain pasture in the horizon i was completely deceived by it and i could then understand why mariners sometimes ran ashore in such cases especially in the night supposing it to be far away though they could see the land once since this being in a large oyster boat two or three hundred miles from here in a dark night when there was a thin veil of mist on land and water we came so near to running on to the land before our skipper was aware of it that the first warning was my hearing the sound of the surf under my elbow i could almost have jumped ashore and we were obliged to go about very suddenly to prevent striking the distant light for which we were steering supposing it a lighthouse five or six miles off came through the cracks of a fishermans bunk not more than six rods distant the keeper entertained us handsomely in his solitary little ocean house he was a man of singular patience and intelligence who when our queries struck him rung as clear as a bell in response the lighthouse lamps a few feet distant shone full into my chamber and made it as bright as day so i knew exactly how the highland light bore all that night and i was in no danger of being wrecked unlike the last this was as still as a summer night i thought as i lay there half awake and half asleep looking upward through the window at the lights above my head how many sleepless eyes from far out on the ocean stream mariners of all nations spinning their yarns through the various watches of the night were directed toward my couch the lighthouse has since been rebuilt and shows a fresnel light ix the sea and the desert the lighthouse lamps were still burning though now with a silvery lustre when i rose to see the sun come out of the ocean for he still rose eastward of us but i was convinced that he must have come out of a dry bed beyond that stream though he seemed to come out of the water the sun once more touched the fields mounting to heaven from the fair flowing deeprunning ocean now we saw countless sails of mackerel fishers abroad on the deep one fleet in the north just pouring round the cape another standing down toward chatham and our hosts son went off to join some lagging member of the first which had not yet left the bay before we left the lighthouse we were obliged to anoint our shoes faithfully with tallow for walking on the beach in the salt water and the sand had turned them red and crisp to counterbalance this i have remarked that the seashore even where muddy as it is not here is singularly clean for notwithstanding the spattering of the water and mud and squirting of the clams while walking to and from the boat your best black pants retain no stain nor dirt such as they would acquire from walking in the country we have heard that a few days after this when the provincetown bank was robbed speedy emissaries from provincetown made particular inquiries concerning us at this lighthouse indeed they traced us all the way down the cape and concluded that we came by this unusual route down the backside and on foot in order that we might discover a way to get off with our booty when we had committed the robbery the cape is so long and narrow and so bare withal that it is wellnigh impossible for a stranger to visit it without the knowledge of its inhabitants generally unless he is wrecked on to it in the night so when this robbery occurred all their suspicions seem to have at once centred on us two travellers who had just passed down it if we had not chanced to leave the cape so soon we should probably have been arrested the real robbers were two young men from worcester county who travelled with a centrebit and are said to have done their work very neatly but the only bank that we pried into was the great cape cod sandbank and we robbed it only of an old french crown piece some shells and pebbles and the materials of this story again we took to the beach for another day october walking along the shore of the resounding sea determined to get it into us we wished to associate with the ocean until it lost the pondlike look which it wears to a countryman we still thought that we could see the other side its surface was still more sparkling than the day before and we beheld the countless smilings of the ocean waves though some of them were pretty broad grins for still the wind blew and the billows broke in foam along the beach the nearest beach to us on the other side whither we looked due east was on the coast of galicia in spain whose capital is santiago though by old poets reckoning it should have been atlantis or the hesperides but heaven is found to be farther west now at first we were abreast of that part of portugal entre douro e mino and then galicia and the port of pontevedra opened to us as we walked along but we did not enter the breakers ran so high the bold headland of cape finisterre a little north of east jutted toward us next with its vain brag for we flung back here is cape cod cape landsbeginning a little indentation toward the north for the land loomed to our imaginations by a common mirage we knew was the bay of biscay and we sang there we lay till next day in the bay of biscay o a little south of east was palos where columbus weighed anchor and farther yet the pillars which hercules set up concerning which when we inquired at the top of our voices what was written on them for we had the morning sun in our faces and could not see distinctly the inhabitants shouted ne plus ultra no more beyond but the wind bore to us the truth only plus ultra more beyond and over the bay westward was echoed ultra beyond we spoke to them through the surf about the far west the true hesperia greek eф peras or end of the day the this side sundown where the sun was extinguished in the pacific and we advised them to pull up stakes and plant those pillars of theirs on the shore of california whither all our folks were gone the only ne plus ultra now whereat they looked crestfallen on their cliffs for we had taken the wind out of all their sails we could not perceive that any of their leavings washed up here though we picked up a childs toy a small dismantled boat which may have been lost at pontevedra the cape became narrower and narrower as we approached its wrist between truro and provincetown and the shore inclined more decidedly to the west at the head of east harbor creek the atlantic is separated but by half a dozen rods of sand from the tidewaters of the bay from the clay pounds the bank flatted off for the last ten miles to the extremity at race point though the highest parts which are called islands from their appearance at a distance on the sea were still seventy or eighty feet above the atlantic and afforded a good view of the latter as well as a constant view of the bay there being no trees nor a hill sufficient to interrupt it also the sands began to invade the land more and more until finally they had entire possession from sea to sea at the narrowest part for three or four miles between truro and provincetown there were no inhabitants from shore to shore and there were but three or four houses for twice that distance as we plodded along either by the edge of the ocean where the sand was rapidly drinking up the last wave that wet it or over the sandhills of the bank the mackerel fleet continued to pour round the cape north of us ten or fifteen miles distant in countless numbers schooner after schooner till they made a city on the water they were so thick that many appeared to be afoul of one another now all standing on this tack now on that we saw how well the newenglanders had followed up captain john smiths suggestions with regard to the fisheries made in to what a pitch they had carried this contemptible trade of fish as he significantly styles it and were now equal to the hollanders whose example he holds up for the english to emulate notwithstanding that in this faculty as he says the former are so naturalized and of their vents so certainly acquainted as there is no likelihood they will ever be paralleled having two or three thousand busses flatbottoms swordpinks todes and such like that breeds them sailors mariners soldiers and merchants never to be wrought out of that trade and fit for any other we thought that it would take all these names and more to describe the numerous craft which we saw even then some years before our renowned sires with their peerless dames stepped on plymouth rock he wrote newfoundland doth yearly freight neir eight hundred sail of ships with a silly lean skinny poorjohn and cor fish though all their supplies must be annually transported from europe why not plant a colony here then and raise those supplies on the spot of all the four parts of the world says he that i have yet seen not inhabited could i have but means to transport a colony i would rather live here than anywhere and if it did not maintain itself were we but once indifferently well fitted let us starve then fishing before your doors you may every night sleep quietly ashore with good cheer and what fires you will or when you please with your wives and family already he anticipates the new towns in new england in memory of their old and who knows what may be discovered in the heart and entrails of the land seeing even the very edges etc etc illustration towing along shore all this has been accomplished and more and where is holland now verily the dutch have taken it there was no long interval between the suggestion of smith and the eulogy of burke still one after another the mackerel schooners hove in sight round the head of the cape whitening all the sea road and we watched each one for a moment with an undivided interest it seemed a pretty sport here in the country it is only a few idle boys or loafers that go afishing on a rainy day but there it appeared as if every ablebodied man and helpful boy in the bay had gone out on a pleasure excursion in their yachts and all would at last land and have a chowder on the cape the gazetteer tells you gravely how many of the men and boys of these towns are engaged in the whale cod and mackerel fishery how many go to the banks of newfoundland or the coast of labrador the straits of belle isle or the bay of chaleurs shalore the sailors call it as if i were to reckon up the number of boys in concord who are engaged during the summer in the perch pickerel bream hornpout and shiner fishery of which no one keeps the statistics though i think that it is pursued with as much profit to the moral and intellectual man or boy and certainly with less danger to the physical one one of my playmates who was apprenticed to a printer and was somewhat of a wag asked his master one afternoon if he might go afishing and his master consented he was gone three months when he came back he said that he had been to the grand banks and went to setting type again as if only an afternoon had intervened i confess i was surprised to find that so many men spent their whole day ay their whole lives almost afishing it is remarkable what a serious business men make of getting their dinners and how universally shiftlessness and a grovelling taste take refuge in a merely antlike industry better go without your dinner i thought than be thus everlastingly fishing for it like a cormorant of course viewed from the shore our pursuits in the country appear not a whit less frivolous i once sailed three miles on a mackerel cruise myself it was a sunday evening after a very warm day in which there had been frequent thundershowers and i had walked along the shore from cohasset to duxbury i wished to get over from the last place to clarks island but no boat could stir they said at that stage of the tide they being left high on the mud at length i learned that the tavernkeeper winsor was going out mackerelling with seven men that evening and would take me when there had been due delay we one after another straggled down to the shore in a leisurely manner as if waiting for the tide still and in indiarubber boots or carrying our shoes in our hands waded to the boats each of the crew bearing an armful of wood and one a bucket of new potatoes besides then they resolved that each should bring one more armful of wood and that would be enough they had already got a barrel of water and had some more in the schooner we shoved the boats a dozen rods over the mud and water till they floated then rowing half a mile to the vessel climbed aboard and there we were in a mackerel schooner a fine stout vessel of fortythree tons whose name i forget the baits were not dry on the hooks there was the mill in which they ground the mackerel and the trough to hold it and the longhandled dipper to cast it overboard with and already in the harbor we saw the surface rippled with schools of small mackerel the real scomber vernalis the crew proceeded leisurely to weigh anchor and raise their two sails there being a fair but very slight wind and the sun now setting clear and shining on the vessel after the thundershowers i thought that i could not have commenced the voyage under more favorable auspices they had four dories and commonly fished in them else they fished on the starboard side aft where their fines hung ready two to a man the boom swung round once or twice and winsor cast overboard the foul juice of mackerel mixed with rainwater which remained in his trough and then we gathered about the helmsman and told stories i remember that the compass was affected by iron in its neighborhood and varied a few degrees there was one among us just returned from california who was now going as passenger for his health and amusement they expected to be gone about a week to begin fishing the next morning and to carry their fish fresh to boston they landed me at clarks island where the pilgrims landed for my companions wished to get some milk for the voyage but i had seen the whole of it the rest was only going to sea and catching the mackerel moreover it was as well that i did not remain with them considering the small quantity of supplies they had taken now i saw the mackerel fleet on its fishingground though i was not at first aware of it so my experience was complete it was even more cold and windy today than before and we were frequently glad to take shelter behind a sandhill none of the elements were resting on the beach there is a ceaseless activity always something going on in storm and in calm winter and summer night and day even the sedentary man here enjoys a breadth of view which is almost equivalent to motion in clear weather the laziest may look across the bay as far as plymouth at a glance or over the atlantic as far as human vision reaches merely raising his eyelids or if he is too lazy to look after all he can hardly help hearing the ceaseless dash and roar of the breakers the restless ocean may at any moment cast up a whale or a wrecked vessel at your feet all the reporters in the world the most rapid stenographers could not report the news it brings no creature could move slowly where there was so much life around the few wreckers were either going or coming and the ships and the sandpipers and the screaming gulls overhead nothing stood still but the shore the little beachbirds trotted past close to the waters edge or paused but an instant to swallow their food keeping time with the elements i wondered how they ever got used to the sea that they ventured so near the waves such tiny inhabitants the land brought forth except one fox and what could a fox do looking on the atlantic from that high bank what is the sea to a fox sometimes we met a wrecker with his cart and dog and his dogs faint bark at us wayfarers heard through the roaring of the surf sounded ridiculously faint to see a little trembling daintyfooted cur stand on the margin of the ocean and ineffectually bark at a beachbird amid the roar of the atlantic come with design to bark at a whale perchance that sound will do for farmyards all the dogs looked out of place there naked and as if shuddering at the vastness and i thought that they would not have been there had it not been for the countenance of their masters still less could you think of a cat bending her steps that way and shaking her wet foot over the atlantic yet even this happens sometimes they tell me in summer i saw the tender young of the piping plover like chickens just hatched mere pinches of down on two legs running in troops with a faint peep along the edge of the waves i used to see packs of halfwild dogs haunting the lonely beach on the south shore of staten island in new york bay for the sake of the carrion there cast up and i remember that once when for a long time i had heard a furious barking in the tall grass of the marsh a pack of half a dozen large dogs burst forth on to the beach pursuing a little one which ran straight to me for protection and i afforded it with some stones though at some risk to myself but the next day the little one was the first to bark at me under these circumstances i could not but remember the words of the poet blow blow thou winter wind thou art not so unkind as his ingratitude thy tooth is not so keen because thou art not seen although thy breath be rude freeze freeze thou bitter sky thou dost not bite so nigh as benefits forgot though thou the waters warp thy sting is not so sharp as friend remembered not sometimes when i was approaching the carcass of a horse or ox which lay on the beach there where there was no living creature in sight a dog would unexpectedly emerge from it and slink away with a mouthful of offal the seashore is a sort of neutral ground a most advantageous point from which to contemplate this world it is even a trivial place the waves forever rolling to the land are too fartravelled and untamable to be familiar creeping along the endless beach amid the sunsquall and the foam it occurs to us that we too are the product of seaslime it is a wild rank place and there is no flattery in it strewn with crabs horseshoes and razorclams and whatever the sea casts up a vast morgue where famished dogs may range in packs and crows come daily to glean the pittance which the tide leaves them the carcasses of men and beasts together lie stately up upon its shelf rotting and bleaching in the sun and waves and each tide turns them in their beds and tucks fresh sand under them there is naked nature inhumanly sincere wasting no thought on man nibbling at the cliffy shore where gulls wheel amid the spray we saw this forenoon what at a distance looked like a bleached log with a branch still left on it it proved to be one of the principal bones of a whale whose carcass having been stripped of blubber at sea and cut adrift had been washed up some months before it chanced that this was the most conclusive evidence which we met with to prove what the copenhagen antiquaries assert that these shores were the furdustrandas which thorhall the companion of thorfinn during his expedition to vinland in sailed past in disgust it appears that after they had left the cape and explored the country about straumfiordr buzzards bay thorhall who was disappointed at not getting any wine to drink there determined to sail north again in search of vinland though the antiquaries have given us the original icelandic i prefer to quote their translation since theirs is the only latin which i know to have been aimed at cape cod cum parati erant sublato velo cecinit thorhallus eт redeamus ubi conterranei sunt nostri faciamus aliter expansi arenosi peritum lata navis explorare curricula dum procellam incitantes gladii morж impatientes qui terram collaudant furdustrandas inhabitant et coquunt balжnas in other words when they were ready and their sail hoisted thorhall sang let us return thither where our fellowcountrymen are let us make a bird skilful to fly through the heaven of sand to explore the broad track of ships while warriors who impel to the tempest of swords who praise the land inhabit wonderstrands and cook whales and so he sailed north past cape cod as the antiquaries say and was shipwrecked on to ireland though once there were more whales cast up here i think that it was never more wild than now we do not associate the idea of antiquity with the ocean nor wonder how it looked a thousand years ago as we do of the land for it was equally wild and unfathomable always the indians have left no traces on its surface but it is the same to the civilized man and the savage the aspect of the shore only has changed the ocean is a wilderness reaching round the globe wilder than a bengal jungle and fuller of monsters washing the very wharves of our cities and the gardens of our seaside residences serpents bears hyenas tigers rapidly vanish as civilization advances but the most populous and civilized city cannot scare a shark far from its wharves it is no further advanced than singapore with its tigers in this respect the boston papers had never told me that there were seals in the harbor i had always associated these with the esquimaux and other outlandish people yet from the parlor windows all along the coast you may see families of them sporting on the flats they were as strange to me as the merman would be ladies who never walk in the woods sail over the sea to go to sea why it is to have the experience of noah to realize the deluge every vessel is an ark we saw no fences as we walked the beach no birchen riders highest of rails projecting into the sea to keep the cows from wading round nothing to remind us that man was proprietor of the shore yet a truro man did tell us that owners of land on the east side of that town were regarded as owning the beach in order that they might have the control of it so far as to defend themselves against the encroachments of the sand and the beachgrass for even this friend is sometimes regarded as a foe but he said that this was not the case on the bay side also i have seen in sheltered parts of the bay temporary fences running to lowwater mark the posts being set in sills or sleepers placed transversely after we had been walking many hours the mackerel fleet still hovered in the northern horizon nearly in the same direction but farther off hull down though their sails were set they never sailed away nor yet came to anchor but stood on various tacks as close together as vessels in a haven and we in our ignorance thought that they were contending patiently with adverse winds beating eastward but we learned afterward that they were even then on their fishingground and that they caught mackerel without taking in their mainsails or coming to anchor a smart breeze thence called a mackerel breeze being as one says considered most favorable for this purpose we counted about two hundred sail of mackerel fishers within one small arc of the horizon and a nearly equal number had disappeared southward thus they hovered about the extremity of the cape like moths round a candle the lights at race point and long point being bright candles for them at night and at this distance they looked fair and white as if they had not yet flown into the light but nearer at hand afterward we saw how some had formerly singed their wings and bodies a village seems thus where its ablebodied men are all ploughing the ocean together as a common field in north truro the women and girls may sit at their doors and see where their husbands and brothers are harvesting their mackerel fifteen or twenty miles off on the sea with hundreds of white harvest wagons just as in the country the farmers wives sometimes see their husbands working in a distant hillside field but the sound of no dinnerhorn can reach the fishers ear having passed the narrowest part of the waist of the cape though still in truro for this township is about twelve miles long on the shore we crossed over to the bay side not half a mile distant in order to spend the noon on the nearest shrubby sandhill in provincetown called mount ararat which rises one hundred feet above the ocean on our way thither we had occasion to admire the various beautiful forms and colors of the sand and we noticed an interesting mirage which i have since found that hitchcock also observed on the sands of the cape we were crossing a shallow valley in the desert where the smooth and spotless sand sloped upward by a small angle to the horizon on every side and at the lowest part was a long chain of clear but shallow pools as we were approaching these for a drink in a diagonal direction across the valley they appeared inclined at a slight but decided angle to the horizon though they were plainly and broadly connected with one another and there was not the least ripple to suggest a current so that by the time we had reached a convenient part of one we seemed to have ascended several feet they appeared to lie by magic on the side of the vale like a mirror left in a slanting position it was a very pretty mirage for a provincetown desert but not amounting to what in sanscrit is called the thirst of the gazelle as there was real water here for a base and we were able to quench our thirst after all professor rafn of copenhagen thinks that the mirage which i noticed but which an old inhabitant of provincetown to whom i mentioned it had never seen nor heard of had something to do with the name furdustrandas ie wonderstrands given as i have said in the old icelandic account of thorfinns expedition to vinland in the year to a part of the coast on which he landed but these sands are more remarkable for their length than for their mirage which is common to all deserts and the reason for the name which the northmen themselves give because it took a long time to sail by them is sufficient and more applicable to these shores however if you should sail all the way from greenland to buzzards bay along the coast you would get sight of a good many sandy beaches but whether thorfinn saw the mirage here or not thoreau one of the same family did and perchance it was because lief the lucky had in a previous voyage taken thorer and his people off the rock in the middle of the sea that thoreau was born to see it this was not the only mirage which i saw on the cape that half of the beach next the bank is commonly level or nearly so while the other slopes downward to the water as i was walking upon the edge of the bank in wellfleet at sundown it seemed to me that the inside half of the beach sloped upward toward the water to meet the other forming a ridge ten or twelve feet high the whole length of the shore but higher always opposite to where i stood and i was not convinced of the contrary till i descended the bank though the shaded outlines left by the waves of a previous tide but halfway down the apparent declivity might have taught me better a stranger may easily detect what is strange to the oldest inhabitant for the strange is his province the old oysterman speaking of gullshooting had said that you must aim under when firing down the bank a neighbor tells me that one august looking through a glass from naushon to some vessels which were sailing along near marthas vineyard the water about them appeared perfectly smooth so that they were reflected in it and yet their full sails proved that it must be rippled and they who were with him thought that it was mirage ie a reflection from a haze from the abovementioned sandhill we overlooked provincetown and its harbor now emptied of vessels and also a wide expanse of ocean as we did not wish to enter provincetown before night though it was cold and windy we returned across the deserts to the atlantic side and walked along the beach again nearly to race point being still greedy of the sea influence all the while it was not so calm as the reader may suppose but it was blow blow blow roar roar roar tramp tramp tramp without interruption the shore now trended nearly east and west before sunset having already seen the mackerel fleet returning into the bay we left the seashore on the north of provincetown and made our way across the desert to the eastern extremity of the town from the first high sandhill covered with beachgrass and bushes to its top on the edge of the desert we overlooked the shrubby hill and swamp country which surrounds provincetown on the north and protects it in some measure from the invading sand notwithstanding the universal barrenness and the contiguity of the desert i never saw an autumnal landscape so beautifully painted as this was it was like the richest rug imaginable spread over an uneven surface no damask nor velvet nor tyrian dye or stuffs nor the work of any loom could ever match it there was the incredibly bright red of the huckleberry and the reddish brown of the bayberry mingled with the bright and living green of small pitchpines and also the duller green of the bayberry boxberry and plum the yellowish green of the shruboaks and the various golden and yellow and fawncolored tints of the birch and maple and aspen each making its own figure and in the midst the few yellow sandslides on the sides of the hills looked like the white floor seen through rents in the rug coming from the country as i did and many autumnal woods as i had seen this was perhaps the most novel and remarkable sight that i saw on the cape probably the brightness of the tints was enhanced by contrast with the sand which surrounded this tract this was a part of the furniture of cape cod we had for days walked up the long and bleak piazza which runs along her atlantic side then over the sanded floor of her halls and now we were being introduced into her boudoir the hundred white sails crowding round long point into provincetown harbor seen over the painted hills in front looked like toy ships upon a mantelpiece the peculiarity of this autumnal landscape consisted in the lowness and thickness of the shrubbery no less than in the brightness of the tints it was like a thick stuff of worsted or a fleece and looked as if a giant could take it up by the hem or rather the tasselled fringe which trailed out on the sand and shake it though it needed not to be shaken but no doubt the dust would fly in that case for not a little has accumulated underneath it was it not such an autumnal landscape as this which suggested our highcolored rugs and carpets hereafter when i look on a richer rug than usual and study its figures i shall think there are the huckleberry hills and there the denser swamps of boxberry and blueberry there the shruboak patches and the bayberries there the maples and the birches and the pines what other dyes are to be compared to these they were warmer colors than i had associated with the new england coast after threading a swamp full of boxberry and climbing several hills covered with shruboaks without a path where shipwrecked men would be in danger of perishing in the night we came down upon the eastern extremity of the four planks which run the whole length of provincetown street this which is the last town on the cape lies mainly in one street along the curving beach fronting the southeast the sandhills covered with shrubbery and interposed with swamps and ponds rose immediately behind it in the form of a crescent which is from half a mile to a mile or more wide in the middle and beyond these is the desert which is the greater part of its territory stretching to the sea on the east and west and north the town is compactly built in the narrow space from ten to fifty rods deep between the harbor and the sandhills and contained at that time about twentysix hundred inhabitants the houses in which a more modern and pretending style has at length prevailed over the fishermans hut stand on the inner or plank side of the street and the fish and store houses with the picturesquelooking windmills of the saltworks on the water side the narrow portion of the beach between forming the street about eighteen feet wide the only one where one carriage could pass another if there was more than one carriage in the town looked much heavier than any portion of the beach or the desert which we had walked on it being above the reach of the highest tide and the sand being kept loose by the occasional passage of a traveller we learned that the four planks on which we were walking had been bought by the towns share of the surplus revenue the disposition of which was a bone of contention between the inhabitants till they wisely resolved thus to put it under foot yet some it was said were so provoked because they did not receive their particular share in money that they persisted in walking in the sand a long time after the sidewalk was built this is the only instance which i happen to know in which the surplus revenue proved a blessing to any town a surplus revenue of dollars from the treasury to stem the greater evil of a surplus revenue of sand from the ocean they expected to make a hard road by the time these planks were worn out indeed they have already done so since we were there and have almost forgotten their sandy baptism as we passed along we observed the inhabitants engaged in curing either fish or the coarse salt hay which they had brought home and spread on the beach before their doors looking as yellow as if they had raked it out of the sea the frontyard plots appeared like what indeed they were portions of the beach fenced in with beachgrass growing in them as if they were sometimes covered by the tide you might still pick up shells and pebbles there there were a few trees among the houses especially silver abeles willows and balmofgileads and one man showed me a young oak which he had transplanted from behind the town thinking it an appletree but every man to his trade though he had little woodcraft he was not the less weatherwise and gave us one piece of information viz he had observed that when a thundercloud came up with a floodtide it did not rain this was the most completely maritime town that we were ever in it was merely a good harbor surrounded by land dry if not firm an inhabited beach whereon fishermen cured and stored their fish without any back country when ashore the inhabitants still walk on planks a few small patches have been reclaimed from the swamps containing commonly half a dozen square rods only each we saw one which was fenced with four lengths of rail also a fence made wholly of hogsheadstaves stuck in the ground these and such as these were all the cultivated and cultivable land in provincetown we were told that there were thirty or forty acres in all but we did not discover a quarter part so much and that was well dusted with sand and looked as if the desert was claiming it they are now turning some of their swamps into cranberry meadows on quite an extensive scale illustration a cranberry meadow yet far from being out of the way provincetown is directly in the way of the navigator and he is lucky who does not run afoul of it in the dark it is situated on one of the highways of commerce and men from all parts of the globe touch there in the course of a year the mackerel fleet had nearly all got in before us it being saturday night excepting that division which had stood down towards chatham in the morning and from a hill where we went to see the sun set in the bay we counted two hundred goodly looking schooners at anchor in the harbor at various distances from the shore and more were yet coming round the cape as each came to anchor it took in sail and swung round in the wind and lowered its boat they belonged chiefly to wellfleet truro and cape ann this was that city of canvas which we had seen hull down in the horizon near at hand and under bare poles they were unexpectedly blacklooking vessels greek melaiuai nкes a fisherman told us that there were fifteen hundred vessels in the mackerel fleet and that he had counted three hundred and fifty in provincetown harbor at one time being obliged to anchor at a considerable distance from the shore on account of the shallowness of the water they made the impression of a larger fleet than the vessels at the wharves of a large city as they had been manoeuvring out there all day seemingly for our entertainment while we were walking northwestward along the atlantic so now we found them flocking into provincetown harbor at night just as we arrived as if to meet us and exhibit themselves close at hand standing by race point and long point with various speed they reminded me of fowls coming home to roost these were genuine new england vessels it is stated in the journal of moses prince a brother of the annalist under date of at which time he visited gloucester that the first vessel of the class called schooner was built at gloucester about eight years before by andrew robinson and late in the same century one cotton tufts gives us the tradition with some particulars which he learned on a visit to the same place according to the latter robinson having constructed a vessel which he masted and rigged in a peculiar manner on her going off the stocks a bystander cried out o how she scoons whereat robinson replied a schooner let her be from which time says tufts vessels thus masted and rigged have gone by the name of schooners before which vessels of this description were not known in europe see mass hist coll vol ix st series and vol i th series yet i can hardly believe this for a schooner has always seemed to me the typical vessel according to c e potter of manchester new hampshire the very word schooner is of new england origin being from the indian schoon or scoot meaning to rush as schoodic from scoot and anke a place where water rushes n b somebody of gloucester was to read a paper on this matter before a genealogical society in boston march according to the boston journal q v nearly all who come out must walk on the four planks which i have mentioned so that you are pretty sure to meet all the inhabitants of provincetown who come out in the course of a day provided you keep out yourself this evening the planks were crowded with mackerel fishers to whom we gave and from whom we took the wall as we returned to our hotel this hotel was kept by a tailor his shop on the one side of the door his hotel on the other and his day seemed to be divided between carving meat and carving broadcloth the next morning though it was still more cold and blustering than the day before we took to the deserts again for we spent our days wholly out of doors in the sun when there was any and in the wind which never failed after threading the shrubby hill country at the southwest end of the town west of the shankpainter swamp whose expressive name for we understood it at first as a landsman naturally would gave it importance in our eyes we crossed the sands to the shore south of race point and three miles distant and thence roamed round eastward through the desert to where we had left the sea the evening before we travelled five or six miles after we got out there on a curving line and might have gone nine or ten over vast platters of pure sand from the midst of which we could not see a particle of vegetation excepting the distant thin fields of beachgrass which crowned and made the ridges toward which the sand sloped upward on each side all the while in the face of a cutting wind as cold as january indeed we experienced no weather so cold as this for nearly two months afterward this desert extends from the extremity of the cape through provincetown into truro and many a time as we were traversing it we were reminded of rileys narrative of his captivity in the sands of arabia notwithstanding the cold our eyes magnified the patches of beachgrass into cornfields in the horizon and we probably exaggerated the height of the ridges on account of the mirage i was pleased to learn afterward from kalms travels in north america that the inhabitants of the lower st lawrence call this grass calamagrostis arenaria and also sealyme grass elymus arenarius seigle de mer and he adds i have been assured that these plants grow in great plenty in newfoundland and on other north american shores the places covered with them looking at a distance like cornfields which might explain the passage in our northern accounts he wrote in of the excellent wine land vinland det goda translator which mentions that they had found whole fields of wheat growing wild the beachgrass is two to four feet high of a seagreen color and it is said to be widely diffused over the world in the hebrides it is used for mats packsaddles bags hats etc paper has been made of it at dorchester in this state and cattle eat it when tender it has heads somewhat like rye from six inches to a foot in length and it is propagated both by roots and seeds to express its love for sand some botanists have called it psamma arenaria which is the greek for sand qualified by the latin for sandy or sandy sand as it is blown about by the wind while it is held fast by its roots it describes myriad circles in the sand as accurately as if they were made by compasses it was the dreariest scenery imaginable the only animals which we saw on the sand at that time were spiders which are to be found almost everywhere whether on snow or icewater or sand and a venomouslooking long narrow worm one of the myriapods or thousandlegs we were surprised to see spiderholes in that flowing sand with an edge as firm as that of a stoned well in june this sand was scored with the tracks of turtles both large and small which had been out in the night leading to and from the swamps i was told by a terroe filius who has a farm on the edge of the desert and is familiar with the fame of provincetown that one man had caught twentyfive snappingturtles there the previous spring his own method of catching them was to put a toad on a mackerelhook and cast it into a pond tying the line to a stump or stake on shore invariably the turtle when hooked crawled up the line to the stump and was found waiting there by his captor however long afterward he also said that minks muskrats foxes coons and wild mice were found there but no squirrels we heard of seaturtle as large as a barrel being found on the beach and on east harbor marsh but whether they were native there or had been lost out of some vessel did not appear perhaps they were the saltwater terrapin or else the smooth terrapin found thus far north many toads were met with where there was nothing but sand and beachgrass in truro i had been surprised at the number of large lightcolored toads everywhere hopping over the dry and sandy fields their color corresponding to that of the sand snakes also are common on these pure sand beaches and i have never been so much troubled by mosquitoes as in such localities at the same season strawberries grew there abundantly in the little hollows on the edge of the desert standing amid the beachgrass in the sand and the fruit of the shadbush or amelanchier which the inhabitants call joshpears some think from juicy is very abundant on the hills i fell in with an obliging man who conducted me to the best locality for strawberries he said that he would not have shown me the place if he had not seen that i was a stranger and could not anticipate him another year i therefore feel bound in honor not to reveal it when we came to a pond he being the native did the honors and carried me over on his shoulders like sindbad one good turn deserves another and if he ever comes our way i will do as much for him in one place we saw numerous dead tops of trees projecting through the otherwise uninterrupted desert where as we afterward learned thirty or forty years before a flourishing forest had stood and now as the trees were laid bare from year to year the inhabitants cut off their tops for fuel we saw nobody that day outside of the town it was too wintry for such as had seen the backside before or for the greater number who never desire to see it to venture out and we saw hardly a track to show that any had ever crossed this desert yet i was told that some are always out on the backside night and day in severe weather looking for wrecks in order that they may get the job of discharging the cargo or the like and thus shipwrecked men are succored but generally speaking the inhabitants rarely visit these sands one who had lived in provincetown thirty years told me that he had not been through to the north side within that time sometimes the natives themselves come near perishing by losing their way in snowstorms behind the town the wind was not a sirocco or simoon such as we associate with the desert but a new england northeaster and we sought shelter in vain under the sandhills for it blew all about them rounding them into cones and was sure to find us out on whichever side we sat from time to time we lay down and drank at little pools in the sand filled with pure fresh water all that was left probably of a pond or swamp the air was filled with dust like snow and cutting sand which made the face tingle and we saw what it must be to face it when the weather was drier and if possible windier still to face a migrating sandbar in the air which has picked up its duds and is off to be whipped with a cat not o ninetails but of a myriad of tails and each one a sting to it a mr whitman a former minister of wellfleet used to write to his inland friends that the blowing sand scratched the windows so that he was obliged to have one new pane set every week that he might see out on the edge of the shrubby woods the sand had the appearance of an inundation which was overwhelming them terminating in an abrupt bank many feet higher than the surface on which they stood and having partially buried the outside trees the moving sandhills of england called dunes or downs to which these have been likened are either formed of sand cast up by the sea or of sand taken from the land itself in the first place by the wind and driven still farther inward it is here a tide of sand impelled by waves and wind slowly flowing from the sea toward the town the northeast winds are said to be the strongest but the northwest to move most sand because they are the driest on the shore of the bay of biscay many villages were formerly destroyed in this way some of the ridges of beachgrass which we saw were planted by government many years ago to preserve the harbor of provincetown and the extremity of the cape i talked with some who had been employed in the planting in the description of the eastern coast which i have already referred to it is said beachgrass during the spring and summer grows about two feet and a half if surrounded by naked beach the storms of autumn and winter heap up the sand on all sides and cause it to rise nearly to the top of the plant in the ensuing spring the grass mounts anew is again covered with sand in the winter and thus a hill or ridge continues to ascend as long as there is a sufficient base to support it or till the circumscribing sand being also covered with beachgrass will no longer yield to the force of the winds sandhills formed in this way are sometimes one hundred feet high and of every variety of form like snowdrifts or arab tents and are continually shifting the grass roots itself very firmly when i endeavored to pull it up it usually broke off ten inches or a foot below the surface at what had been the surface the year before as appeared by the numerous offshoots there it being a straight hard round shoot showing by its length how much the sand had accumulated the last year and sometimes the dead stubs of a previous season were pulled up with it from still deeper in the sand with their own more decayed shoot attached so that the age of a sandhill and its rate of increase for several years is pretty accurately recorded in this way illustration the sand dunes drifting in upon the trees old gerard the english herbalist says p i find mention in stowes chronicle in anno of a certain pulse or pease as they term it wherewith the poor people at that time there being a great dearth were miraculously helped he thus mentions it in the month of august saith he in suffolke at a place by the sea side all of hard stone and pibble called in those parts a shelf lying between the towns of orford and aldborough where neither grew grass nor any earth was ever seen it chanced in this barren place suddenly to spring up without any tillage or sowing great abundance of peason whereof the poor gathered as men judged above one hundred quarters yet remained some ripe and some blossoming as many as ever there were before to the which place rode the bishop of norwich and the lord willoughby with others in great number who found nothing but hard rocky stone the space of three yards under the roots of these peason which roots were great and long and very sweet he tells us also that gesner learned from dr cajus that there were enough there to supply thousands of men he goes on to say that they without doubt grew there many years before but were not observed till hunger made them take notice of them and quickened their invention which commonly in our people is very dull especially in finding out food of this nature my worshipful friend dr argent hath told me that many years ago he was in this place and caused his man to pull among the beach with his hands and follow the roots so long until he got some equal in length unto his height yet could come to no ends of them gerard never saw them and is not certain what kind they were in dwights travels in new england it is stated that the inhabitants of truro were formerly regularly warned under the authority of law in the month of april yearly to plant beachgrass as elsewhere they are warned to repair the highways they dug up the grass in bunches which were afterward divided into several smaller ones and set about three feet apart in rows so arranged as to break joints and obstruct the passage of the wind it spread itself rapidly the weight of the seeds when ripe bending the heads of the grass and so dropping directly by its side and vegetating there in this way for instance they built up again that part of the cape between truro and provincetown where the sea broke over in the last century they have now a public road near there made by laying sods which were full of roots bottom upward and close together on the sand double in the middle of the track then spreading brush evenly over the sand on each side for half a dozen feet planting beachgrass on the banks in regular rows as above described and sticking a fence of brush against the hollows the attention of the general government was first attracted to the danger which threatened cape cod harbor from the inroads of the sand about thirty years ago and commissioners were at that time appointed by massachusetts to examine the premises they reported in june that owing to the trees and brush having been cut down and the beachgrass destroyed on the seaward side of the cape opposite the harbor the original surface of the ground had been broken up and removed by the wind toward the harbor during the previous fourteen years over an extent of one half a mile in breadth and about four and a half miles in length the space where a few years since were some of the highest lands on the cape covered with trees and bushes presenting an extensive waste of undulating sand and that during the previous twelve months the sand had approached the harbor an average distance of fifty rods for an extent of four and a half miles and unless some measures were adopted to check its progress it would in a few years destroy both the harbor and the town they therefore recommended that beachgrass be set out on a curving line over a space ten rods wide and four and a half miles long and that cattle horses and sheep be prohibited from going abroad and the inhabitants from cutting the brush i was told that about thirty thousand dollars in all had been appropriated to this object though it was complained that a great part of this was spent foolishly as the public money is wont to be some say that while the government is planting beachgrass behind the town for the protection of the harbor the inhabitants are rolling the sand into the harbor in wheelbarrows in order to make houselots the patentoffice has recently imported the seed of this grass from holland and distributed it over the country but probably we have as much as the hollanders thus cape cod is anchored to the heavens as it were by a myriad little cables of beachgrass and if they should fail would become a total wreck and erelong go to the bottom formerly the cows were permitted to go at large and they ate many strands of the cable by which the cape is moored and wellnigh set it adrift as the bull did the boat which was moored with a grass rope but now they are not permitted to wander a portion of truro which has considerable taxable property on it has lately been added to provincetown and i was told by a truro man that his townsmen talked of petitioning the legislature to set off the next mile of their territory also to provincetown in order that she might have her share of the lean as well as the fat and take care of the road through it for its whole value is literally to hold the cape together and even this it has not always done but provincetown strenuously declines the gift the wind blowed so hard from the northeast that cold as it was we resolved to see the breakers on the atlantic side whose din we had heard all the morning so we kept on eastward through the desert till we struck the shore again northeast of provincetown and exposed ourselves to the full force of the piercing blast there are extensive shoals there over which the sea broke with great force for half a mile from the shore it was one mass of white breakers which with the wind made such a din that we could hardly hear ourselves speak of this part of the coast it is said a northeast storm the most violent and fatal to seamen as it is frequently accompanied with snow blows directly on the land a strong current sets along the shore add to which that ships during the operation of such a storm endeavor to work northward that they may get into the bay should they be unable to weather race point the wind drives them on the shore and a shipwreck is inevitable accordingly the strand is everywhere covered with the fragments of vessels but since the highland light was erected this part of the coast is less dangerous and it is said that more shipwrecks occur south of that light where they were scarcely known before illustration the white breakers on the atlantic side this was the stormiest sea that we witnessed more tumultuous my companion affirmed than the rapids of niagara and of course on a far greater scale it was the ocean in a gale a clear cold day with only one sail in sight which labored much as if it were anxiously seeking a harbor it was high tide when we reached the shore and in one place for a considerable distance each wave dashed up so high that it was difficult to pass between it and the bank further south where the bank was higher it would have been dangerous to attempt it a native of the cape has told me that many years ago three boys his playmates having gone to this beach in wellfleet to visit a wreck when the sea receded ran down to the wreck and when it came in ran before it to the bank but the sea following fast at their heels caused the bank to cave and bury them alive it was the roaring sea greek thalassa кchкessa amphi de t akrai кiones booфsin erenomenкs alos exф and the summits of the bank around resound the sea being vomited forth as we stood looking on this scene we were gradually convinced that fishing here and in a pond were not in all respects the same and that he who waits for fair weather and a calm sea may never see the glancing skin of a mackerel and get no nearer to a cod than the wooden emblem in the state house having lingered on the shore till we were wellnigh chilled to death by the wind and were ready to take shelter in a charityhouse we turned our weatherbeaten faces toward provincetown and the bay again having now more than doubled the cape i e a vessel the sea which is arched over its sandy bottom like a heaven battle x provincetown early the next morning i walked into a fishhouse near our hotel where three or four men were engaged in trundling out the pickled fish on barrows and spreading them to dry they told me that a vessel had lately come in from the banks with fortyfour thousand codfish timothy dwight says that just before he arrived at provincetown a schooner come in from the great bank with fiftysix thousand fish almost one thousand five hundred quintals taken in a single voyage the main deck being on her return eight inches under water in calm weather the cod in this fishhouse just out of the pickle lay packed several feet deep and three or four men stood on them in cowhide boots pitching them on to the barrows with an instrument which had a single iron point one young man who chewed tobacco spat on the fish repeatedly well sir thought i when that older man sees you he will speak to you but presently i saw the older man do the same thing it reminded me of the figs of smyrna how long does it take to cure these fish i asked two good drying days sir was the answer i walked across the street again into the hotel to breakfast and mine host inquired if i would take hashed fish or beans i took beans though they never were a favorite dish of mine i found next summer that this was still the only alternative proposed here and the landlord was still ringing the changes on these two words in the former dish there was a remarkable proportion of fish as you travel inland the potato predominates it chanced that i did not taste fresh fish of any kind on the cape and i was assured that they were not so much used there as in the country that is where they are cured and where sometimes travellers are cured of eating them no fresh meat was slaughtered in provincetown but the little that was used at the public houses was brought from boston by the steamer illustration in provincetown harbor a great many of the houses here were surrounded by fishflakes close up to the sills on all sides with only a narrow passage two or three feet wide to the front door so that instead of looking out into a flower or grass plot you looked on to so many square rods of cod turned wrong side outwards these parterres were said to be least like a flowergarden in a good drying day in midsummer there were flakes of every age and pattern and some so rusty and overgrown with lichens that they looked as if they might have served the founders of the fishery here some had broken down under the weight of successive harvests the principal employment of the inhabitants at this time seemed to be to trundle out their fish and spread them in the morning and bring them in at night i saw how many a loafer who chanced to be out early enough got a job at wheeling out the fish of his neighbor who was anxious to improve the whole of a fair day now then i knew where salt fish were caught they were everywhere lying on their backs their collarbones standing out like the lapels of a manowarmans jacket and inviting all things to come and rest in their bosoms and all things with a few exceptions accepted the invitation i think by the way that if you should wrap a large salt fish round a small boy he would have a coat of such a fashion as i have seen many a one wear to muster salt fish were stacked up on the wharves looking like corded wood maple and yellow birch with the bark left on i mistook them for this at first and such in one sense they were fuel to maintain our vital fires an eastern wood which grew on the grand banks some were stacked in the form of huge flowerpots being laid in small circles with the tails outwards each circle successively larger than the preceding until the pile was three or four feet high when the circles rapidly diminished so as to form a conical roof on the shores of new brunswick this is covered with birchbark and stones are placed upon it and being thus rendered impervious to the rain it is left to season before being packed for exportation it is rumored that in the fall the cows here are sometimes fed on codsheads the godlike part of the cod which like the human head is curiously and wonderfully made forsooth has but little less brain in it coming to such an end i to be craunched by cows i i felt my own skull crack from sympathy what if the heads of men were to be cut off to feed the cows of a superior order of beings who inhabit the islands in the ether away goes your fine brain the house of thought and instinct to swell the cud of a ruminant animal however an inhabitant assured me that they did not make a practice of feeding cows on codsheads the cows merely would eat them sometimes but i might live there all my days and never see it done a cow wanting salt would also sometimes lick out all the soft part of a cod on the flakes this he would have me believe was the foundation of this fishstory it has been a constant travellers tale and perhaps slander now for thousands of years the latins and greeks have repeated it that this or that nation feeds its cattle or horses or sheep on fish as may be seen in oelian and pliny but in the journal of nearchus who was alexanders admiral and made a voyage from the indus to the euphrates three hundred and twentysix years before christ it is said that the inhabitants of a portion of the intermediate coast whom he called ichthyophagi or fisheaters not only ate fishes raw and also dried and pounded in a whales vertebra for a mortar and made into a paste but gave them to their cattle there being no grass on the coast and several modern travellers braybosa niebuhr and others make the same report therefore in balancing the evidence i am still in doubt about the provincetown cows as for other domestic animals captain king in his continuation of captain cooks journal in says of the dogs of kamtschatka their food in the winter consists entirely of the heads entrail and backbones of salmon which are put aside and dried for that purpose and with this diet they are fed but sparingly cooks journal vol vii p as we are treating of fishy matters let me insert what pliny says that the commanders of the fleets of alexander the great have related that the gedrosi who dwell on the banks of the river arabis are in the habit of making the doors of their houses with the jawbones of fishes and raftering the roofs with their bones strabo tells the same of the ichthyophagi hardouin remarks that the basques of his day were in the habit of fencing their gardens with the ribs of the whale which sometimes exceeded twenty feet in length and cuvier says that at the present time the jawbone of the whale is used in norway for the purpose of making beams or posts for buildings bohns ed trans of pliny vol ii p herodotus says the inhabitants on lake prasias in thrace living on piles give fish for fodder to their horses and beasts of burden provincetown was apparently what is called a flourishing town some of the inhabitants asked me if i did not think that they appeared to be well off generally i said that i did and asked how many there were in the almshouse o only one or two infirm or idiotic answered they the outward aspect of the houses and shops frequently suggested a poverty which their interior comfort and even richness disproved you might meet a lady daintily dressed in the sabbath morning wading in among the sandhills from church where there appeared no house fit to receive her yet no doubt the interior of the house answered to the exterior of the lady as for the interior of the inhabitants i am still in the dark about it i had a little intercourse with some whom i met in the street and was often agreeably disappointed by discovering the intelligence of rough and what would be considered unpromising specimens nay i ventured to call on one citizen the next summer by special invitation i found him sitting in his front doorway that sabbath evening prepared for me to come in unto him but unfortunately for his reputation for keeping open house there was stretched across his gateway a circular cobweb of the largest kind and quite entire this looked so ominous that i actually turned aside and went in the back way this monday morning was beautifully mild and calm both on land and water promising us a smooth passage across the bay and the fishermen feared that it would not be so good a drying day as the cold and windy one which preceded it there could hardly have been a greater contrast this was the first of the indian summer days though at a late hour in the morning we found the wells in the sand behind the town still covered with ice which had formed in the night what with wind and sun my most prominent feature fairly cast its slough but i assure you it will take more than two good drying days to cure me of rambling after making an excursion among the hills in the neighborhood of the shankpainter swamp and getting a little work done in its line we took our seat upon the highest sandhill overlooking the town in midair on a long plank stretched across between two hillocks of sand where some boys were endeavoring in vain to fly their kite and there we remained the rest of that forenoon looking out over the placid harbor and watching for the first appearance of the steamer from wellfleet that we might be in readiness to go on board when we heard the whistle off long point we got what we could out of the boys in the meanwhile provincetown boys are of course all sailors and have sailors eyes when we were at the highland light the last summer seven or eight miles from provincetown harbor and wished to know one sunday morning if the olata a wellknown yacht had got in from boston so that we could return in her a provincetown boy about ten years old who chanced to be at the table remarked that she had i asked him how he knew i just saw her come in said he when i expressed surprise that he could distinguish her from other vessels so far he said that there were not so many of those twotopsail schooners about but that he could tell her palfrey said in his oration at barnstable the duck does not take to the water with a surer instinct than the barnstable boy he might have said the cape cod boy as well he leaps from his leadingstrings into the shrouds it is but a bound from the mothers lap to the masthead he boxes the compass in his infant soliloquies he can hand reef and steer by the time he flies a kite this was the very day one would have chosen to sit upon a hill overlooking sea and land and muse there the mackerel fleet was rapidly taking its departure one schooner after another and standing round the cape like fowls leaving their roosts in the morning to disperse themselves in distant fields the turtlelike sheds of the saltworks were crowded into every nook in the hills immediately behind the town and their now idle windmills lined the shore it was worth the while to see by what coarse and simple chemistry this almost necessary of life is obtained with the sun for journeyman and a single apprentice to do the chores for a large establishment it is a sort of tropical labor pursued too in the sunniest season more interesting than gold or diamondwashing which i fancy it somewhat resembles at a distance in the production of the necessaries of life nature is ready enough to assist man so at the potash works which i have seen at hull where they burn the stems of the kelp and boil the ashes verily chemistry is not a splitting of hairs when you have got half a dozen raw irishmen in the laboratory it is said that owing to the reflection of the sun from the sandhills and there being absolutely no fresh water emptying into the harbor the same number of superficial feet yields more salt here than in any other part of the county a little rain is considered necessary to clear the air and make salt fast and good for as paint does not dry so water does not evaporate in dogday weather but they were now as elsewhere on the cape breaking up their saltworks and selling them for lumber from that elevation we could overlook the operations of the inhabitants almost as completely as if the roofs had been taken off they were busily covering the wickerworked flakes about their houses with salted fish and we now saw that the back yards were improved for this purpose as much as the front where one mans fish ended anothers began in almost every yard we detected some little building from which these treasures were being trundled forth and systematically spread and we saw that there was an art as well as a knack even in spreading fish and that a division of labor was profitably practised one man was withdrawing his fishes a few inches beyond the nose of his neighbors cow which had stretched her neck over a paling to get at them it seemed a quite domestic employment like drying clothes and indeed in some parts of the county the women take part in it i noticed in several places on the cape a sort of clothesflakes they spread brush on the ground and fence it round and then lay their clothes on it to keep them from the sand this is a cape cod clothesyard the sand is the great enemy here the tops of some of the hills were enclosed and a board put up forbidding all persons entering the enclosure lest their feet should disturb the sand and set it ablowing or asliding the inhabitants are obliged to get leave from the authorities to cut wood behind the town for fishflakes beanpoles peabrush and the like though as we were told they may transplant trees from one part of the township to another without leave the sand drifts like snow and sometimes the lower story of a house is concealed by it though it is kept off by a wall the houses were formerly built on piles in order that the driving sand might pass under them we saw a few old ones here still standing on their piles but they were boarded up now being protected by their younger neighbors there was a schoolhouse just under the hill on which we sat filled with sand up to the tops of the desks and of course the master and scholars had fled perhaps they had imprudently left the windows open one day or neglected to mend a broken pane yet in one place was advertised fine sand for sale here i could hardly believe my eyes probably some of the street sifted a good instance of the fact that a man confers a value on the most worthless thing by mixing himself with it according to which rule we must have conferred a value on the whole backside of cape cod but i thought that if they could have advertised fat soil or perhaps fine sand got rid of ay and shoes emptied here it would have been more alluring as we looked down on the town i thought that i saw one man who probably lived beyond the extremity of the planking steering and tacking for it in a sort of snowshoes but i may have been mistaken in some pictures of provincetown the persons of the inhabitants are not drawn below the ankles so much being supposed to be buried in the sand nevertheless natives of provincetown assured me that they could walk in the middle of the road without trouble even in slippers for they had learned how to put their feet down and lift them up without taking in any sand one man said that he should be surprised if he found half a dozen grains of sand in his pumps at night and stated moreover that the young ladies had a dexterous way of emptying their shoes at each step which it would take a stranger a long time to learn the tires of the stagewheels were about five inches wide and the wagontires generally on the cape are an inch or two wider as the sand is an inch or two deeper than elsewhere i saw a babys wagon with tires six inches wide to keep it near the surface the more tired the wheels the less tired the horses yet all the time that we were in provincetown which was two days and nights we saw only one horse and cart and they were conveying a coffin they did not try such experiments there on common occasions the next summer i saw only the twowheeled horsecart which conveyed me thirty rods into the harbor on my way to the steamer yet we read that there were two horses and two yoke of oxen here in and we were told that there were several more when we were there beside the stage team in barbers historical collections it is said so rarely are wheelcarriages seen in the place that they are a matter of some curiosity to the younger part of the community a lad who understood navigating the ocean much better than land travel on seeing a man driving a wagon in the street expressed his surprise at his being able to drive so straight without the assistance of a rudder there was no rattle of carts and there would have been no rattle if there had been any carts some saddlehorses that passed the hotel in the evening merely made the sand fly with a rustling sound like a writer sanding his paper copiously but there was no sound of their tread no doubt there are more horses and carts there at present a sleigh is never seen or at least is a great novelty on the cape the snow being either absorbed by the sand or blown into drifts nevertheless the inhabitants of the cape generally do not complain of their soil but will tell you that it is good enough for them to dry their fish on notwithstanding all this sand we counted three meetinghouses and four schoolhouses nearly as large on this street though some had a tight board fence about them to preserve the plot within level and hard similar fences even within a foot of many of the houses gave the town a less cheerful and hospitable appearance than it would otherwise have had they told us that on the whole the sand had made no progress for the last ten years the cows being no longer permitted to go at large and every means being taken to stop the sandy tide in provincetown was invested with peculiar privileges for its encouragement once or twice it was nearly abandoned but now lots on the street fetch a high price though titles to them were first obtained by possession and improvement and they are still transferred by quitclaim deeds merely the township being the property of the state but though lots were so valuable on the street you might in many places throw a stone over them to where a man could still obtain land or sand by squatting on or improving it illustration provincetown a bit of the village from the wharf stones are very rare on the cape i saw a very few small stones used for pavements and for bank walls in one or two places in my walk but they are so scarce that as i was informed vessels have been forbidden to take them from the beach for ballast and therefore their crews used to land at night and steal them i did not hear of a rod of regular stone wall below orleans yet i saw one man underpinning a new house in eastham with some rocks as he called them which he said a neighbor had collected with great pains in the course of years and finally made over to him this i thought was a gift worthy of being recorded equal to a transfer of california rocks almost another man who was assisting him and who seemed to be a close observer of nature hinted to me the locality of a rock in that neighborhood which was fortytwo paces in circumference and fifteen feet high for he saw that i was a stranger and probably would not carry it off yet i suspect that the locality of the few large rocks on the forearm of the cape is well known to the inhabitants generally i even met with one man who had got a smattering of mineralogy but where he picked it up i could not guess i thought that he would meet with some interesting geological nuts for him to crack if he should ever visit the mainland cohasset or marblehead for instance the well stones at the highland light were brought from hingham but the wells and cellars of the cape are generally built of brick which also are imported the cellars as well as the wells are made in a circular form to prevent the sand from pressing in the wall the former are only from nine to twelve feet in diameter and are said to be very cheap since a single tier of brick will suffice for a cellar of even larger dimensions of course if you live in the sand you will not require a large cellar to hold your roots in provincetown when formerly they suffered the sand to drive under their houses obliterating all rudiments of a cellar they did not raise a vegetable to put into one one farmer in wellfleet who raised fifty bushels of potatoes showed me his cellar under a corner of his house not more than nine feet in diameter looking like a cistern but he had another of the same size under his barn you need dig only a few feet almost anywhere near the shore of the cape to find fresh water but that which we tasted was invariably poor though the inhabitants called it good as if they were comparing it with salt water in the account of truro it is said wells dug near the shore are dry at low water or rather at what is called young flood but are replenished with the flowing of the tide the salt water which is lowest in the sand apparently forcing the fresh up when you express your surprise at the greenness of a provincetown garden on the beach in a dry season they will sometimes tell you that the tide forces the moisture up to them it is an interesting fact that low sandbars in the midst of the ocean perhaps even those which are laid bare only at low tide are reservoirs of fresh water at which the thirsty mariner can supply himself they appear like huge sponges to hold the rain and dew which fall on them and which by capillary attraction are prevented from mingling with the surrounding brine the harbor of provincetown which as well as the greater part of the bay and a wide expanse of ocean we overlooked from our perch is deservedly famous it opens to the south is free from rocks and is never frozen over it is said that the only ice seen in it drifts in sometimes from barnstable or plymouth dwight remarks that the storms which prevail on the american coast generally come from the east and there is no other harbor on a windward shore within two hundred miles j d graham who has made a very minute and thorough survey of this harbor and the adjacent waters states that its capacity depth of water excellent anchorage and the complete shelter it affords from all winds combine to render it one of the most valuable ship harbors on our coast it is the harbor of the cape and of the fishermen of massachusetts generally it was known to navigators several years at least before the settlement of plymouth in captain john smiths map of new england dated it bears the name of milford haven and massachusetts bay that of stuards bay his highness prince charles changed the name of cape cod to cape james but even princes have not always power to change a name for the worse and as cotton mather said cape cod is a name which i suppose it will never lose till shoals of codfish be seen swimming on its highest hills many an early voyager was unexpectedly caught by this hook and found himself embayed on successive maps cape cod appears sprinkled over with french dutch and english names as it made part of new france new holland and new england on one map provincetown harbor is called fuic bownet bay barnstable bay staten bay and the sea north of it mare del noort or the north sea on another the extremity of the cape is called staten hoeck or the states hook on another by young this has noord zee staten hoeck or hit hoeck but the copy at cambridge has no date the whole cape is called niew hollant after hudson and on another still the shore between race point and wood end appears to be called bevechier in champlains admirable map of new france including the oldest recognizable map of what is now the new england coast with which i am acquainted cape cod is called c blan ie cape white from the color of its sands and massachusetts bay is baye blanche it was visited by de monts and champlain in and the next year was further explored by poitrincourt and champlain the latter has given a particular account of these explorations in his voyages together with separate charts and soundings of two of its harbors malle barre the bad bar nauset harbor a name now applied to what the french called cap baturier and port fortune apparently chatham harbor both these names are copied on the map of novi belgii in ogilvys america he also describes minutely the manners and customs of the savages and represents by a plate the savages surprising the french and killing five or six of them the french afterward killed some of the natives and wished by way of revenge to carry off some and make them grind in their handmill at port royal it is remarkable that there is not in english any adequate or correct account of the french exploration of what is now the coast of new england between and though it is conceded that they then made the first permanent european settlement on the continent of north america north of st augustine if the lions had been the painters it would have been otherwise this omission is probably to be accounted for partly by the fact that the early edition of champlains voyages had not been consulted for this purpose this contains by far the most particular and i think the most interesting chapter of what we may call the antepilgrim history of new england extending to one hundred and sixty pages quarto but appears to be unknown equally to the historian and the orator on plymouth rock bancroft does not mention champlain at all among the authorities for de montss expedition nor does he say that he ever visited the coast of new england though he bore the title of pilot to de monts he was in another sense the leading spirit as well as the historian of the expedition holmes hildreth and barry and apparently all our historians who mention champlain refer to the edition of in which all the separate charts of our harbors etc and about onehalf the narrative are omitted for the author explored so many lands afterward that he could afford to forget a part of what he had done hildreth speaking of de montss expedition says that he looked into the penobscot in which pring had discovered two years before saying nothing about champlains extensive exploration of it for de monts in holmes says and refers to purchas also that he followed in the track of pring along the coast to cape cod which he called malabarre haliburton had made the same statement before him in he called it cap blanc and malle barre the bad bar was the name given to a harbor on the east side of the cape pring says nothing about a river there belknap says that weymouth discovered it in sir f gorges says in his narration maine hist coll vol ii p that pring in made a perfect discovery of all the rivers and harbors this is the most i can find bancroft makes champlain to have discovered more western rivers in maine not naming the penobscot he however must have been the discoverer of distances on this river see belknap p pring was absent from england only about six months and sailed by this part of cape cod malabarre because it yielded no sassafras while the french who probably had not heard of pring were patiently for years exploring the coast in search of a place of settlement sounding and surveying its harbors john smiths map published in from observations in is by many regarded as the oldest map of new england it is the first that was made after this country was called new england for he so called it but in champlains voyages edition and lescarbot in quotes a still earlier account of his voyage there is a map of it made when it was known to christendom as new france called carte gйographique de la nouvelle franse faictte par le sieur de champlain saint tongois cappitaine ordinaire pour le roi en la marine faict len from his observations between and a map extending from labrador to cape cod and westward to the great lakes and crowded with information geographical ethnographical zoцlogical and botanical he even gives the variation of the compass as observed by himself at that date on many parts of the coast this taken together with the many separate charts of harbors and their soundings on a large scale which this volume contains among the rest qui ni be quy kennebec chouacoit r saco r le beau port port st louis near cape ann and others on our coast but which are not in the edition of makes this a completer map of the new england and adjacent northern coast than was made for half a century afterward almost we might be allowed to say till another frenchman des barres made another for us which only our late coast survey has superseded most of the maps of this coast made for a long time after betray their indebtedness to champlain he was a skilful navigator a man of science and geographer to the king of france he crossed the atlantic about twenty times and made nothing of it often in a small vessel in which few would dare to go to sea today and on one occasion making the voyage from tadoussac to st malo in eighteen days he was in this neighborhood that is between annapolis nova scotia and cape cod observing the land and its inhabitants and making a map of the coast from may to september or about three and a half years and he has described minutely his method of surveying harbors by his own account a part of his map was engraved in when pontgrave and others returned to france in he remained at port royal with poitrincourt in order says he by the aid of god to finish the chart of the coasts which i had begun and again in his volume printed before john smith visited this part of america he says it seems to me that i have done my duty as far as i could if i have not forgotten to put in my said chart whatever i saw and give a particular knowledge to the public of what had never been described nor discovered so particularly as i have done it although some other may have heretofore written of it but it was a very small affair in comparison with what we have discovered within the last ten years it is not generally remembered if known by the descendants of the pilgrims that when their forefathers were spending their first memorable winter in the new world they had for neighbors a colony of french no further off than port royal annapolis nova scotia three hundred miles distant prince seems to make it about five hundred miles where in spite of many vicissitudes they had been for fifteen years they built a gristmill there as early as also made bricks and turpentine on a stream williamson says in de monts who was a protestant brought his minister with him who came to blows with the catholic priest on the subject of religion though these founders of acadie endured no less than the pilgrims and about the same proportion of them thirtyfive out of seventynine williamsons maine says thirtysix out of seventy died the first winter at st croix sixteen years earlier no orator to my knowledge has ever celebrated their enterprise williamsons history of maine does considerably while the trials which their successors and descendants endured at the hands of the english have furnished a theme for both the historian and poet see bancrofts history and longfellows evangeline the remains at their fort at st croix were discovered at the end of the last century and helped decide where the true st croix our boundary was the very gravestones of those frenchmen are probably older than the oldest english monument in new england north of the elizabeth islands or perhaps anywhere in new england for if there are any traces of gosnolds storehouse left his strong works are gone bancroft says advisedly in it requires a believing eye to discern the ruins of the fort and that there were no ruins of a fort in dr charles t jackson tells me that in the course of a geological survey in he discovered a gravestone a slab of trap rock on goat island opposite annapolis port royal in nova scotia bearing a masonic coatofarms and the date which is fourteen years earlier than the landing of the pilgrims this was left in the possession of judge haliburton of nova scotia there were jesuit priests in what has since been called new england converting the savages at mount desert then st savior in having come over to port royal in though they were almost immediately interrupted by the english years before the pilgrims came hither to enjoy their own religion this according to champlain charlevoix says the same and after coming from france in went west from port royal along the coast as far as the kennebec in and was often carried from port royal to mount desert indeed the englishmans history of new england commences only when it ceases to be new france though cabot was the first to discover the continent of north america champlain in the edition of his voyages printed in after the english had for a season got possession of quebec and port royal complains with no little justice the common consent of all europe is to represent new france as extending at least to the thirtyfifth and thirtysixth degrees of latitude as appears by the maps of the world printed in spain italy holland flanders germany and england until they possessed themselves of the coasts of new france where are acadie the etchemins maine and new brunswick the almouchicois massachusetts and the great river st lawrence where they have imposed according to their fancy such names as new england scotland and others but it is not easy to efface the memory of a thing which is known to all christendom that cabot merely landed on the uninhabitable shore of labrador gave the english no just title to new england or to the united states generally any more than to patagonia his careful biographer biddle is not certain in what voyage he ran down the coast of the united states as is reported and no one tells us what he saw miller in the new york hist coll vol i p says he does not appear to have landed anywhere contrast with this verrazzanis tarrying fifteen days at one place on the new england coast and making frequent excursions into the interior thence it chances that the latters letter to francis i in contains the earliest original account extant of the atlantic coast of the united states and even from that time the northern part of it began to be called la terra francese or french land a part of it was called new holland before it was called new england the english were very backward to explore and settle the continent which they had stumbled upon the french preceded them both in their attempts to colonize the continent of north america carolina and florida and in their first permanent settlement port royal and the right of possession naturally enough was the one which england mainly respected and recognized in the case of spain of portugal and also of france from the time of henry vii the explorations of the french gave to the world the first valuable maps of these coasts denys of honfleur made a map of the gulf of st lawrence in no sooner had cartier explored the st lawrence in than there began to be published by his countrymen remarkably accurate charts of that river as far up as montreal it is almost all of the continent north of florida that you recognize on charts for more than a generation afterward though verrazzanis rude plot made under french auspices was regarded by hackluyt more than fifty years after his voyage in as the most accurate representation of our coast the french trail is distinct they went measuring and sounding and when they got home had something to show for their voyages and explorations there was no danger of their charts being lost as cabots have been the most distinguished navigators of that day were italians or of italian descent and portuguese the french and spaniards though less advanced in the science of navigation than the former possessed more imagination and spirit of adventure than the english and were better fitted to be the explorers of a new continent even as late as this spirit it was which so early carried the french to the great lakes and the mississippi on the north and the spaniard to the same river on the south it was long before our frontiers reached their settlements in the west and a voyageur or coureur de bois is still our conductor there prairie is a french word as sierra is a spanish one augustine in florida and santa fe in new mexico both built by the spaniards are considered the oldest towns in the united states within the memory of the oldest man the angloamericans were confined between the appalachian mountains and the sea a space not two hundred miles broad while the mississippi was by treaty the eastern boundary of new france see the pamphlet on settling the ohio london bound up with the travels of sir john bartram so far as inland discovery was concerned the adventurous spirit of the english was that of sailors who land but for a day and their enterprise the enterprise of traders cabot spoke like an englishman as he was if he said as one reports in reference to the discovery of the american continent when he found it running toward the north that it was a great disappointment to him being in his way to india but we would rather add to than detract from the fame of so great a discoverer samuel penhallow in his history boston p speaking of port royal and nova scotia says of the last that its first seizure was by sir sebastian cobbet for the crown of great britain in the reign of king henry vii but lay dormant till the year when sir william alexander got a patent of it and possessed it some years and afterward sir david kirk was proprietor of it but erelong to the surprise of all thinking men it was given up unto the french even as late as we find winthrop the first governor of the massachusetts colony who was not the most likely to be misinformed who moreover has the fame at least of having discovered wachusett mountain discerned it forty miles inland talking about the great lake and the hideous swamps about it near which the connecticut and the potomack took their rise and among the memorable events of the year he chronicles darby field an irishmans expedition to the white hill from whose top he saw eastward what he judged to be the gulf of canada and westward what he judged to be the great lake which canada river comes out of and where he found much muscovy glass and could rive out pieces of forty feet long and seven or eight broad while the very inhabitants of new england were thus fabling about the country a hundred miles inland which was a terra incognita to them or rather many years before the earliest date referred to champlain the first governor of canada not to mention the inland discoveries of cartier roberval and others of the preceding century and his own earlier voyage had already gone to war against the iroquois in their forest forts and penetrated to the great lakes and wintered there before a pilgrim had heard of new england in champlains voyages printed in there is a plate representing a fight in which he aided the canada indians against the iroquois near the south end of lake champlain in july eleven years before the settlement of plymouth bancroft says he joined the algonquins in an expedition against the iroquois or five nations in the northwest of new york this is that great lake which the english hearing some rumor of from the french long after locate in an imaginary province called laconia and spent several years about in the vain attempt to discover sir ferdinand gorges in maine hist coll vol ii p thomas morton has a chapter on this great lake in the edition of champlains map dated the falls of niagara appear and in a great lake northwest of mer douce lake huron there is an island represented over which is written isle ou il y a une mine de cuivre island where there is a mine of copper this will do for an offset to our governors muscovy glass of all these adventures and discoveries we have a minute and faithful account giving facts and dates as well as charts and soundings all scientific and frenchmanlike with scarcely one fable or travellers story probably cape cod was visited by europeans long before the seventeenth century it may be that cabot himself beheld it verrazzani in according to his own account spent fifteen days on our coast in latitude degrees minutes some suppose in the harbor of newport and often went five or six leagues into the interior there and he says that he sailed thence at once one hundred and fifty leagues northeasterly always in sight of the coast there is a chart in hackluyts divers voyages made according to verrazzanis plot which last is praised for its accuracy by hackluyt but i cannot distinguish cape cod on it unless it is the c arenas which is in the right latitude though ten degrees west of claudia which is thought to be block island the biographic universelle informs us that an ancient manuscript chart drawn in by diego ribeiro a spanish cosmographer has preserved the memory of the voyage of gomez a portuguese sent out by charles the fifth one reads in it under au dessous the place occupied by the states of new york connecticut and rhode island terre detienne gomez quil dйcouvrit en land of etienne gomez which he discovered in this chart with a memoir was published at weimar in the last century jean alphonse robervals pilot in canada in one of the most skilful navigators of his time and who has given remarkably minute and accurate direction for sailing up the st lawrence showing that he knows what he is talking about says in his routier it is in hackluyt i have been at a bay as far as the fortysecond degree between norimbegue the penobscot and florida but i have not explored the bottom of it and i do not know whether it passes from one land to the other ie to asia jai йtй а une baye jusques par les degres entre la norimbegue et la floride mais je nen ai pas cherchй le fond et ne sзais pas si elle passe dune terre а iautre this may refer to massachusetts bay if not possibly to the western inclination of the coast a little farther south when he says i have no doubt that the norimbegue enters into the river of canada he is perhaps so interpreting some account which the indians had given respecting the route from the st lawrence to the atlantic by the st john or penobscot or possibly even the hudson river we hear rumors of this country of norumbega and its great city from many quarters in a discourse by a great french seacaptain in ramusios third volume this is said to be the name given to the land by its inhabitants and verrazzani is called the discoverer of it another in makes the natives call it or the river aguncia it is represented as an island on an accompanying chart it is frequently spoken of by old writers as a country of indefinite extent between canada and florida and it appears as a large island with cape breton at its eastern extremity on the map made according to verrazzanis plot in hackluyts divers voyages these maps and rumors may have been the origin of the notion common among the early settlers that new england was an island the country and city of norumbega appear about where maine now is on a map in ortelius theatrum orbis terrarum antwerp and the r grande is drawn where the penobscot or st john might be in champlain being sent by the sieur de monts to explore the coast of norumbegue sailed up the penobscot twentytwo or twentythree leagues from isle haute or till he was stopped by the falls he says i think that this river is that which many pilots and historians call norumbegue and which the greater part have described as great and spacious with numerous islands and its entrance in the fortythird or fortythird and one half or according to others the fortyfourth degree of latitude more or less he is convinced that the greater part of those who speak of a great city there have never seen it but repeat a mere rumor but he thinks that some have seen the mouth of the river since it answers to their description under date of champlain writes three or four leagues north of the cap de poitrincourt near the head of the bay of fundy in nova scotia we found a cross which was very old covered with moss and almost all decayed which was an evident sign that there had formerly been christians there also the following passage from lescarbot will show how much the neighboring coasts were frequented by europeans in the sixteenth century speaking of his return from port royal to france in he says at last within four leagues of campseau the gut of canso we arrived at a harbor in nova scotia where a worthy old gentleman from st john de lus named captain savale was fishing who received us with the utmost courtesy and as this harbor which is small but very good has no name i have given it on my geographical chart the name of savalet it is on champlains map also this worthy man told us that this voyage was the fortysecond which he had made to those parts and yet the newfoundlanders terre neuviers make only one a year he was wonderfully content with his fishery and informed us that he made daily fifty crowns worth of cod and that his voyage would be worth ten thousand francs he had sixteen men in his employ and his vessel was of eighty tons which could carry a hundred thousand dry cod histoire de la nouvelle france they dried their fish on the rocks on shore the isola della rena sable island appears on the chart of nuova francia and norumbega accompanying the discourse above referred to in ramusios third volume edition champlain speaks of there being at the isle of sable in grass pastured by oxen boeufs and cows which the portuguese carried there more than sixty years ago ie sixty years before in a later edition he says which came out of a spanish vessel which was lost in endeavoring to settle on the isle of sable and he states that de la roches men who were left on this island seven years from lived on the flesh of these cattle which they found en quantie and built houses out of the wrecks of vessels which came to the island perhaps gilberts there being no wood or stone lescarbot says that they lived on fish and the milk of cows left there about eighty years before by baron de leri and saint just charlevoix says they ate up the cattle and then lived on fish haliburton speaks of cattle left there as a rumor de leri and saint just had suggested plans of colonization on the isle of sable as early as according to bancroft referring to charlevoix these are but a few of the instances which i might quote cape cod is commonly said to have been discovered in we will consider at length under what circumstances and with what observation and expectations the first englishmen whom history clearly discerns approached the coast of new england according to the accounts of archer and brereton both of whom accompanied gosnold on the th of march old style captain bartholomew gosnold set sail from falmouth england for the north part of virginia in a small bark called the concord they being in all says one account thirtytwo persons whereof eight mariners and sailors twelve purposing upon the discovery to return with the ship for england the rest remain there for population this is regarded as the first attempt of the english to make a settlement within the limits of new england pursuing a new and a shorter course than the usual one by the canaries the th of april following they had sight of saint marys an island of the azores as their sailors were few and none of the best i use their own phrases and they were going upon an unknown coast they were not overbold to stand in with the shore but in open weather so they made their first discovery of land with the lead the d of april the ocean appeared yellow but on taking up some of the water in a bucket it altered not either in color or taste from the sea azure the th of may they saw divers birds whose names they knew and many others in their english tongue of no name the th of may the water changed to a yellowish green where at seventy fathoms they had ground the th they had upon their lead many glittering stones which might promise some mineral matter in the bottom the th they were over a bank which they thought to be near the western end of st johns island and saw schools of fish the th they say continually passed fleeting by us seaoare which seemed to have their movable course towards the northeast on the th they observed great beds of weeds much wood and divers things else floating by and had smelling of the shore much as from the southern cape and andalusia in spain on friday the th early in the morning they descried land on the north in the latitude of fortythree degrees apparently some part of the coast of maine williamson history of maine says it certainly could not have been south of the central isle of shoals belknap inclines to think it the south side of cape ann standing fair along by the shore about twelve oclock the same day they came to anchor and were visited by eight savages who came off to them in a biscay shallop with sail and oars an iron grapple and a kettle of copper these they at first mistook for christians distressed one of them was apparelled with a waistcoat and breeches of black serge made after our seafashion hoes and shoes on his feet all the rest saving one that had a pair of breeches of blue cloth were naked they appeared to have had dealings with some basques of st john de luz and to understand much more than we say the english for want of language could comprehend but they soon set sail westward leaving them and their coast this was a remarkable discovery for discoverers the th day writes gabriel archer we had again sight of the land which made ahead being as we thought an island by reason of a large sound that appeared westward between it and the main for coming to the west end thereof we did perceive a large opening we called it shoal hope near this cape we came to anchor in fifteen fathoms where we took great store of codfish for which we altered the name and called it cape cod here we saw skulls of herring mackerel and other small fish in great abundance this is a low sandy shoal but without danger also we came to anchor again in sixteen fathoms fair by the land in the latitude of fortytwo degrees this cape is well near a mile broad and lieth northeast by east the captain went here ashore and found the ground to be full of peas strawberries whortleberries etc as then unripe the sand also by the shore somewhat deep the firewood there by us taken in was of cypress birch witchhazel and beach a young indian came here to the captain armed with his bow and arrows and had certain plates of copper hanging at his ears he showed a willingness to help us in our occasions the th we trended the coast southerly which was all champaign and full of grass but the islands somenning to fade like an evening sky it might be that he had been chasing a willothewisp after all could this really be possible could it be one would have thought that this terrific blow would have given eugene pause in a way and it did it frightened him mrs dale had gone to colfax in order to persuade him to use his influence to make eugene behave himself and having done so much she was actually prepared to go further she was considering some scheme whereby she could blacken eugene have his true character become known without in any way involving suzanne having been relentlessly pursued and harried by eugene she was now as relentless in her own attitude she wanted him to let go now entirely if she could not to see suzanne any more and she went first to winfield and then back to lenox with the hope of preventing any further communication or at least action on suzannes part or eugenes possible presence there in so far as her visit to winfield was concerned it did not amount to so much morally or emotionally in that quarter for winfield did not feel that he was called upon to act in the matter he was not eugenes guardian nor yet a public censor of morals he waived the whole question grandly to one side though in a way he was glad to know of it for it gave him an advantage over eugene he was sorry for him a little what man would not be nevertheless in his thoughts of reorganizing the blue sea corporation he did not feel so bad over what might become of eugenes interests when the latter approached him as he did some time afterward with the idea that he might be able to dispose of his holdings he saw no way to do it the company was really not in good shape more money would have to be put in all the treasury stock would have to be quickly disposed of or a reorganization would have to be effected the best that could be promised under these circumstances was that eugenes holdings might be exchanged for a fraction of their value in a new issue by a new group of directors so eugene saw the end of his dreams in that direction looming up quite clearly when he saw what mrs dale had done he saw also that it was necessary to communicate the situation clearly to suzanne the whole thing pulled him up short and he began to wonder what was to become of him with his twentyfive thousand a year in salary cut off his prospect of an independent fortune in blue sea annihilated the old life closed to him for want of cash for who can go about in society without money he saw that he was in danger of complete social and commercial extinction if by any chance a discussion of the moral relation between him and suzanne arose his unconscionable attitude toward angela if white heard of it for instance what would become of him the latter would spread the fact far and wide it would be the talk of the town in the publishing world at least it would close every publishing house in the city to him he did not believe colfax would talk he fancied that mrs dale had not after all spoken to winfield but if she had how much further would it go would white hear of it through colfax would he keep it a secret if he knew never the folly of what he had been doing began to dawn upon him dimly what was it that he had been doing he felt like a man who had been cast into a deep sleep by a powerful opiate and was now slowly waking to a dim wondering sense of where he was he was in new york he had no position he had little ready money perhaps five or six thousand all told he had the love of suzanne but her mother was still fighting him and he had angela on his hands undivorced how was he to arrange things now how could he think of going back to her never he sat down and composed the following letter to suzanne which he thought would make clear to her just how things stood and give her an opportunity to retract if she wished for he thought he owed that much to her now flower face i had a talk with mr colfax this morning and what i feared might happen has happened your mother instead of going to boston as you thought came to new york and saw him and i fancy my friend winfield too she cannot do me any harm in that direction for my relationship with that company does not depend on a salary or a fixed income of any kind but she has done me infinite harm here frankly i have lost my position i do not believe that would have come about except for other pressure with which she had nothing to do but her charges and complaints coming on top of opposition here on the part of someone else has done what she couldnt have done alone flower face do you know what that means i told you once that i had tied up all my spare cash in blue sea which i hoped would come to so much it may but the cutting off my salary here means great changes for me there unless i can make some other business engagement immediately i shall probably have to give up my apartment in riverside drive and my automobile and in other ways trim my sails to meet the bad weather it means that if you come to me we should have to live on what i can earn as an artist unless i should decide and be able to find something else when i came to canada for you i had some such idea in mind but since this thing has actually happened you may think differently if nothing happens to my blue sea investment there may be an independent fortune some day in that i cant tell but that is a long way off and meanwhile there is only this and i dont know what else your mother may do to my reputation she appears to be in a very savage frame of mind you heard what she said at whileaway she has evidently gone back on that completely flower face i lay this all before you so that you may see how things are if you come to me it may be in the face of a faded reputation you must realize that there is a great difference between eugene witla managing publisher of the united magazines corporation and eugene witla artist i have been very reckless and defiant in my love for you because you are so lovely the most perfect thing that i have ever known i have laid all on the altar of my affection i would do it again gladly a thousand times before you came my life was a gloomy thing i thought i was living but i knew in my heart that it was all a dusty shell a lie then you came and oh how i have lived the nights the days of beautiful fancy shall i ever forget white wood or blue sea or briarcliff or that wonderful first day at south beach little girl our ways have been the ways of perfectness and peace this has been an intensely desperate thing to do but for my sake i am not sorry i have been dreaming a wonderfully sweet and perfect dream it may be when you know all and see how things stand and stop and think as i now ask you to do you may be sorry and want to change your mind dont hesitate to do so if you feel that way you know i told you to think calmly long ago before you told your mother this is a bold original thing we have been planning it is not to be expected that the world would see it as we have it is quite to be expected that trouble would follow in the wake of it but it seemed possible to me and still seems so if you want to come to me say so if you want me to come to you speak the word we will go to england or italy and i will try my hand at painting again i can do that i am sure or we can stay here and i can see if some engagement cannot be had you want to remember though that your mother may not have finished fighting she may go to much greater lengths than she has gone you thought you might control her but it seems not i thought we had won in canada but it appears not if she attempts to restrain you from using your share of your fathers estate she may be able to cause you trouble there if she attempts to incarcerate you she might be successful i wish i could talk to you cant i see you at lenox are you coming home next week we ought to think and plan and act now if at all dont let any consideration for me stand in your way though if you are doubtful remember that conditions are different now your whole future hangs on your decision i should have talked this way long ago perhaps but i did not think your mother could do what she has succeeded in doing i did not think my financial standing would play any part in it flower face this is the day of real trial for me i am unhappy but only at the possible prospect of losing you nothing of all these other things really matters with you everything would be perfect whatever my condition might be without you it will be as dark as night the decision is in your hands and you must act whatever you decide that i will do dont as i say let consideration for me stand in the way you are young you have a social career before you after all i am twice your age i talk thus sanely because if you come to me now i want you to understand clearly how you come oh i wonder sometimes if you really understand i wonder if i have been dreaming a dream you are so beautiful you have been such an inspiration to me has this been a lure a willothe wisp i wonder i wonder and yet i love you love you love you a thousand kisses divine fire and i wait for your word eugene suzanne read this letter at lenox and for the first time in her life she began to think and ponder seriously what had she been doing what was eugene doing this denouement frightened her her mother was more purposeful than she imagined to think of her going to colfax of her lying and turning so in her moods she had not thought this possible of her mother had not thought it possible that eugene could lose his position he had always seemed so powerful to her so much a law unto himself once when they were out in an automobile together he had asked her why she loved him and she said because you are a genius and can do anything you please oh no he answered nothing like that i cant really do very much of anything you just have an exaggerated notion of me oh no i havent she replied you can paint and you can write she was judging by some of the booklets about blue sea and verses about herself and clippings of articles done in his old chicago newspaper days which he showed her once in a scrapbook in his apartment and you can run that office and you were an advertising manager and an art director she lifted up her face and looked into his eyes admiringly my what a list of accomplishments he replied well whom the gods would destroy they first make mad he kissed her and you love so beautifully she added by way of climax since then she had thought of this often but now somehow it received a severe setback he was not quite so powerful he could not prevent her mother from doing this and could she really conquer her mother whatever suzanne might think of her deceit she was moving heaven and earth to prevent this was she wholly wrong after that climacteric night at st jacques when somehow the expected did not happen suzanne had been thinking did she really want to leave home and go with eugene did she want to fight her mother in regard to her estate she might have to do that her original idea had been that she and eugene would meet in some lovely studio and that she would keep her own home and he would have his it was something very different this talk of poverty and not having an automobile and being far away from home still she loved him maybe she could force her mother to terms yet there were more struggles in the two or three succeeding days in which the guardian of the estate mr herbert pitcairn of the marquardt trust company and once more dr woolley were called in to argue with her suzanne unable to make up her mind listened to her mothers insidious plea that if she would wait a year and then say she really wanted him she could have him listened to mr pitcairn tell her mother that he believed any court would on application adjudge her incompetent and tie up her estate heard dr woolley say in her presence to her mother that he did not deem a commission in lunacy advisable but if her mother insisted no doubt a judge would adjudge her insane if no more than to prevent this unhallowed consummation suzanne became frightened her iron nerve after eugenes letter was weakening she was terribly incensed against her mother but she began now for the first time to think what her friends would think supposing her mother did lock her up where would they think she was all these days and weeks of strain which had worn her mother threadbare had told something on her own strength or rather nerve it was too intense and she began to wonder whether they had not better do as eugene suggested and wait a little while he had agreed up at st jacques to wait if she were willing only the provision was that they were to see each other now her mother had changed front again pleading danger undue influence that she ought to have at least a year of her old kind of life undisturbed to see whether she really cared how can you tell she insisted to suzanne in spite of the girls desire not to talk you have been swept into this and you havent given yourself time to think a year wont hurt what harm will it do you or him but mama asked suzanne over and over at different times and in different places why did you go and tell mr colfax what a mean cruel thing that was to do because i think he needs something like that to make him pause and think he isnt going to starve he is a man of talent he needs something like that to bring him to his senses mr colfax hasnt discharged him he told me he wouldnt he said he would make him take a year off and think about it and thats just what he has done it wont hurt him i dont care if it does look at the way he has made me suffer she felt exceedingly bitter toward eugene and was rejoicing that at last she was beginning to have her innings mama said suzanne i am never going to forgive you for this you are acting horribly i will wait but it will come to the same thing in the end i am going to have him i dont care what you do after a year said mrs dale cheerfully and subtly if you will just wait that long and give yourself time to think and still want to marry him you can do so he can probably get a divorce in that time anyhow she did not mean what she was saying but any argument was good for the situation if it delayed matters but i dont know that i want to marry him insisted suzanne doggedly harking back to her original idea that isnt my theory of it oh well replied mrs dale complaisantly you will know better what to think of that after a year i dont want to coerce you but im not going to have our home and happiness broken up in this way without turning a hand and without your stopping to think about it you owe it to me to all these years i have cared for you to show me some consideration a year wont hurt you it wont hurt him you will find out then whether he really loves you or not this may just be a passing fancy he has had other women before you he may have others after you he may go back to mrs witla it doesnt make any difference what he tells you you ought to test him before you break up his home and mine if he really loves you he will agree readily enough do this for me suzanne and i will never cross your path any more if you will wait a year you can do anything you choose i can only hope you wont go to him without going as his wife but if you insist i will hush the matter up as best i can write to him and tell him that you have decided that you both ought to wait a year you dont need to see him any more it will just stir things all up afresh if you dont see him but just write it will be better for him too he wont feel so badly as he will if you see him again and go all over the ground once more mrs dale was terribly afraid of eugenes influence but she could not accomplish this i wont do that said suzanne i wont do it im going back to new york thats all there is about it mrs dale finally yielded that much she had to there was a letter from suzanne after three days saying that she couldnt answer his letter in full but that she was coming back to new york and would see him and subsequently a meeting between suzanne and eugene at daleview in her mothers presence dr woolley and mr pitcairn were in another part of the house at the time in which the proposals were gone over anew eugene had motored down after mrs dales demands had been put before him in the gloomiest and yet more feverish frame of mind in which he had ever been gloomy because of heavy forebodings of evil and his own dark financial condition while inspirited at other moments by thoughts of some splendid eager revolt on the part of suzanne of her rushing to him defying all declaring herself violently and convincingly and so coming off a victor with him his faith in her love was still so great the night was one of those cold october ones with a steely sky and a sickle moon harbinger of frost newly seen in the west and pointed stars thickening overhead as he sat in his car on the staten island ferry boat he could see a long line of southward bound ducks homing to those reedy marshes which bryant had in mind when he wrote to a waterfowl they were honking as they went their faint quacks coming back on the thin air and making him feel desperately lonely and bereft when he reached daleview speeding past october trees and entered the great drawingroom where a fire was blazing and where once in spring he had danced with suzanne his heart leaped up for he was to see her and the mere sight of her was as a tonic to his fevered body a cool drink to a thirsting man mrs dale stared at eugene defiantly when he came but suzanne welcomed him to her embrace oh she exclaimed holding him close for a few moments and breathing feverishly there was complete silence for a time mama insists eugene she said after a time that we ought to wait a year and i think since there is such a fuss about it that perhaps it might be just as well we may have been just a little hasty dont you think i have told mama what i think about her action in going to mr colfax but she doesnt seem to care she is threatening now to have me adjudged insane a year wont make any real difference since i am coming to you anyhow will it but i thought i ought to tell you this in person to ask you about it she paused looking into his eyes i thought we settled all this up in st jacques said eugene turning to mrs dale but experiencing a sinking sensation of fear we did all except the matter of not seeing her i think it is highly inadvisable that you two should be together it isnt possible the way things stand people will talk your wifes condition has to be adjusted you cant be running around with her and a child coming to you i want suzanne to go away for a year where she can be calm and think it all out and i want you to let her if she still insists that she wants you after that and will not listen to the logic of the situation in regard to marriage then i propose to wash my hands of the whole thing she may have her inheritance she may have you if she wants you if you have come to your senses by that time as i hope you will have you will get a divorce or go back to mrs witla or do whatever you do in a sensible way she did not want to incense eugene here but she was very bitter eugene merely frowned is this your decision suzanne too he asked wearily i think mama is terrible eugene replied suzanne evasively or perhaps as a reply to her mother you and i have planned our lives and we will work them out we have been a little selfish now that i think of it i think a year wont do any harm perhaps if it will stop all this fussing i can wait if you can an inexpressible sense of despair fell upon eugene at the sound of this a sadness so deep that he could scarcely speak he could not believe that it was really suzanne who was saying that to him willing to wait a year she who had declared so defiantly that she would not it would do no harm to think that life fate her mother were triumphing over him in this fashion after all what then was the significance of the blackbearded men he had seen so often of late why had he been finding horseshoes was fate such a liar did life in its dark subtle chambers lay lures and traps for men his position gone his blue sea venture involved in an indefinite delay out of which might come nothing suzanne going for a whole year perhaps for ever most likely so for what could not her mother do with her in a whole year having her alone angela alienated a child approaching what a climax is this really your decision suzanne he asked sadly a mist of woe clouding his whole being i think it ought to be perhaps eugene she replied still evasively its very trying i will be faithful to you though i promise you that i will not change dont you think we can wait a year we can cant we a whole year without seeing you suzanne yes it will pass eugene a whole year yes eugene i have nothing more to say mrs dale he said turning to her mother solemnly a sombre gloomy light in his eye his heart hardening towards suzanne for the moment to think she should treat him so throw him down as he phrased it well such was life you win he added it has been a terrible experience for me a terrible passion i love this girl i love her with my whole heart sometimes i have vaguely suspected that she might not know he turned to suzanne and for the first time he thought that he did not see there that true understanding which he had fancied had been there all the time could fate have been lying to him also in this was he mistaken in this and had he been following a phantom lure of beauty was suzanne but another trap to drag him down to his old nothingness god the prediction of the astrologer of a second period of defeat after seven or eight years came back oh suzanne he said simply and unconsciously dramatic do you really love me yes eugene she replied really yes he held out his arms and she came but for the life of him he could not dispel this terrible doubt it took the joy out of his kiss as if he had been dreaming a dream of something perfect in his arms and had awaked to find it nothing as if life had sent him a judas in the shape of a girl to betray him do let us end this mr witla said mrs dale coldly there is nothing to be gained by delaying let us end it for a year and then talk oh suzanne he continued as mournful as a passing bell come to the door with me no the servants are there put in mrs dale please make your farewells here mama said suzanne angrily and defiantly moved by the pity of it i wont have you talk this way leave the room or i shall go to the door with him and further leave us please mrs dale went out oh flower face said eugene pathetically i cant believe it i cant i cant this has been managed wrong i should have taken you long ago so it is to end this way a year a whole year and how much longer only a year she insisted only a year believe me cant you i wont change i wont he shook his head and suzanne as before took his face in her hands she kissed his cheeks his lips his hair believe me eugene i seem cold you dont know what i have gone through it is nothing but trouble everywhere let us wait a year i promise you i will come to you i swear one year cant we wait one year a year he said a year i cant believe it where will we all be in a year oh flower face myrtle bloom divine fire i cant stand this i cant its too much im the one who is paying now yes i pay he took her face and looked at it all its soft enticing features her eyes her lips her cheeks her hair i thought i thought he murmured suzanne only stroked the back of his head with her hands well if i must i must he said he turned away turned back to embrace her turned again and then without looking back walked out into the hall mrs dale was there waiting good night mrs dale he said gloomily good night mr witla she replied frigidly but with a sense of something tragic in her victory at that he took his hat and walked out outside the bright october stars were in evidence by millions the bay and harbor of new york were as wonderfully lit as on that night when suzanne came to him after the evening at fort wadsworth on her own porch he recalled the spring odours the wonderful feel of youth and love the hope that was springing then now it was five or six months later and all that romance was gone suzanne sweet voice accomplished shape light whisper delicate touch gone all gone faded the flower and all its budded charms faded the sight of beauty from my eyes faded the shape of beauty from my arms faded the voice warmth whiteness paradise gone were those bright days in which they had ridden together dined together walked in sylvan places beside their car a little way from here he first played tennis with her a little way from here he had come so often to meet her clandestinely now she was gone gone he had come in his car but he really did not want it life was accursed his own was a failure to think that all his fine dreams should crumble this way shortly he would have no car no home on riverside drive no position no anything god i cant stand this he exclaimed and a little later by god i cant i cant he dismissed his car at the battery telling his chauffeur to take it to the garage and walking gloomily through all the tall dark streets of lower new york here was broadway where he had often been with colfax and winfield here was this great world of finance around wall street in which he had vaguely hoped to shine now these buildings were high and silent receding from him in a way overhead were the clear bright stars cool and refreshing but without meaning to him now how was he to settle it how adjust it a year she would never come back never it was all gone a bright cloud faded a mirage dissolved into its native nothingness position distinction love home where were they yet a little while and all these things would be as though they had never been hell damn curse the brooding fates that could thus plot to destroy him back in her room in daleview suzanne had locked herself in she was not without a growing sense of the tragedy of it she stared at the floor recalled his face oh oh she said and for the first time in her life felt as though she could cry from a great heartache but she could not and in riverside drive was another woman brooding lonely despondently desperately over the nature of the tragedy that was upon her how were things to be adjusted how was she to be saved oh oh her life her child if eugene could be made to understand if he could only be made to see pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfs cf chapter xxiii pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfsfsmilli cf during the weeks which followed colfaxs talk with him and suzannes decision which amounted practically to a dismissal eugene tried to wind up his affairs at the united magazines corporation as well as straighten out his relationship with angela it was no easy task colfax helped him considerably by suggesting that he should say he was going abroad for the company for the time being and should make it appear imperative that he go at once eugene called in his department heads and told them what colfax suggested but added that his own interests elsewhere of which they knew or suspected were now so involved that he might possibly not return or only for a little while at best he put forward an air of great sufficiency and selfsatisfaction considering the difficulties he was encountering and the thing passed off as a great wonder but with no suspicion of any immediate misfortune attaching to him as a matter of fact it was assumed that he was destined to a much higher estate the control of his private interests in his talk with angela he made it perfectly plain that he was going to leave her he would not make any pretence about this she ought to know he had lost his position he was not going to suzanne soon he wanted her to leave him or he would leave her she should go to wisconsin or europe or anywhere for the time being and leave him to fight this thing out alone he was not indispensable to her in her condition there were nurses she could hire maternity hospitals where she could stay he would be willing to pay for that he would never live with her any more if he could help it he did not want to the sight of her in the face of his longing for suzanne would be a wretched commentary a reproach and a sore shame no he would leave her and perhaps possibly sometime when she obtained more real fighting courage suzanne might come to him she ought to angela might die yes brutal as it may seem he thought this she might die and then and then no thought of the child that might possibly live even if she died held him he could not understand that could not grasp it as yet it was a mere abstraction eugene took a room in an apartment house in kingsbridge where he was not known for the time being and where he was not likely to be seen then there was witnessed that dreary spectacle of a man whose life has apparently come down in a heap whose notions emotions tendencies and feelings are confused and disappointed by some untoward result if eugene had been ten or fifteen years older the result might have been suicide a shade of difference in temperament might have resulted in death murder anything as it was he sat blankly at times among the ruins of his dreams speculating on what suzanne was doing on what angela was doing on what people were saying and thinking on how he could gather up the broken pieces of his life and make anything out of them at all the one saving element in it all was his natural desire to work which although it did not manifest itself at first by degrees later on began to come back he must do something if it was not anything more than to try to paint again he could not be running around looking for a position there was nothing for him in connection with blue sea he had to work to support angela of whom he was now free if he did not want to be mean and as he viewed it all in the light of what had happened he realized that he had been bad enough she had not been temperamentally suited to him but she had tried to be fundamentally it was not her fault how was he to work and live and be anything at all from now on there were long arguments over this situation between him and angela pleas tears a crashing downward of everything which was worth while in life to angela and then in spite of her pathetic situation separation because it was november and the landlord had heard of eugenes financial straits or rather reverse of fortune it was possible to relinquish the lease which had several years to run and the apartment was given up angela distraught scarcely knew which way to turn it was one of those pitiless scandalous situations in life which sicken us of humanity she ran helplessly to eugenes sister myrtle who first tried to conceal the scandal and tragedy from her husband but afterward confessed and deliberated as to what should be done frank bangs who was a practical man as well as firm believer in christian science because of his wifes to him miraculous healing from a tumor several years before endeavored to apply his understanding of the divine science the omnipresence of good to this situation there is no use worrying about it myrtle he said to his wife who in spite of her faith was temporarily shaken and frightened by the calamities which seemingly had overtaken her brother its another evidence of the workings of mortal mind it is real enough in its idea of itself but nothing in gods grace it will come out all right if we think right angela can go to a maternity hospital for the time being or whenever shes ready we may be able to persuade eugene to do the right thing angela was persuaded to consult a christian science practitioner and myrtle went to the woman who had cured her and begged her to use her influence or rather her knowledge of science to effect a rehabilitation for her brother she was told that this could not be done without his wish but that she would pray for him if he could be persuaded to come of his own accord seeking spiritual guidance or divine aid it would be a different matter in spite of his errors and to her they seemed palpable and terrible enough at present her faith would not allow her to reproach him and besides she loved him he was a strong man she said always strange he and angela might not have been well mated but all could be righted in fi science fi there was a dreary period of packing and storing for angela in which she stood about amid the ruins of her previous comfort and distinction and cried over the things that had seemed so lovely to her here were all eugenes things his paintings his canes his pipes his clothes she cried over a handsome silk dressing gown in which he had been wont to lounge about it smacked so much curiously of older and happier days there were hard cold and determined conferences also in which some of angelas old fighting ruling spirit would come back but not for long she was beaten now and she knew it wrecked the roar of a cold and threatening sea was in her ears it should be said here that at one time suzanne truly imagined she loved eugene it must be remembered however that she was moved to affection for him by the wonder of a personality that was hypnotic to her there was something about the personality of eugene that was subversive of conventionality he approached apparently a lamb of conventional feelings and appearances whereas inwardly he was a ravening wolf of indifference to convention all the organized modes and methods of life were a joke to him he saw through to something that was not material life at all but spiritual or say immaterial of which all material things were a shadow what did the great forces of life care whether this system which was maintained here with so much show and fuss was really maintained at all or not how could they care he once stood in a morgue and saw human bodies apparently dissolving into a kind of chemical mush and he had said to himself then how ridiculous it was to assume that life meant anything much to the forces which were doing these things great chemical and physical forces were at work which permitted accidentally perhaps some little shadowplay which would soon pass but oh its presence how sweet it was naturally suzanne was cast down for the time being for she was capable of suffering just as eugene was but having given her word to wait she decided to stick to that although she had not stuck to her other she was between nineteen and twenty now eugene was nearing forty life could still soothe her in spite of herself in eugenes case it could only hurt the more mrs dale went abroad with suzanne and the other children visiting with people who could not possibly have heard or ever would except in a vague uncertain way for that matter if it became evident as she thought it might that there was to be a scandal mrs dale proposed to say that eugene had attempted to establish an insidious hold on her child in defiance of reason and honor and that she had promptly broken it up shielding suzanne almost without the latters knowledge it was plausible enough what was he to do now how live was his constant thought go into a wee small apartment in some back street with angela where he and she if he decided to stay with her could find a pretty outlook for a little money and live never admit that he had lost suzanne for a year at least if not permanently in this suddenly brusque way impossible go and confess that he had made a mistake which he still did not feel to be true or that he was sorry and would like to patch things up as before never he was not sorry he did not propose to live with angela in the old way any more he was sick of her or rather of that atmosphere of repression and convention in which he had spent so many years he was sick of the idea of having a child thrust on him against his will he would not do it she had no business to put herself in this position he would die first his insurance was paid up to date he had carried during the last five years a policy for something over eighteen thousand in her favor and if he died she would get that he wished he might it would be some atonement for the hard knocks which fate had recently given her but he did not wish to live with her any more never never child or no child go back to the apartment after this night how could he if he did he must pretend that nothing had happened at least nothing untoward between him and suzanne she might come back might might ah the mockery of it to leave him in this way when she really could have come to him should have oh the bitterness of this thrust of fate there was a day when the furniture was sent away and angela went to live with myrtle for the time being there was another tearful hour when she left new york to visit her sister marietta at racine where they now were intending to tell her before she came away as a profound secret the terrible tragedy which had overtaken her eugene went to the train with her but with no desire to be there angelas one thought in all this was that somehow time would effect a reconciliation if she could just wait long enough if she could keep her peace and live and not die and not give him a divorce he might eventually recover his sanity and come to think of her as at least worth living with the child might do it its coming would be something that would affect him surely he was bound to see her through it she told herself she was willing and delighted to go through this ordeal if only it brought him back to her this child what a reception it was to receive unwanted dishonored before its arrival ignored if by any chance she should die what would he do about it surely he would not desert it already in her nervous melancholy way she was yearning toward it tell me she said to eugene one day when they were alternately quarreling and planning if the baby comes and i and i die you wont absolutely desert it youll take it wont you ill take it he replied dont worry im not an absolute dog i didnt want it its a trick on your part but ill take it i dont want you to die you know that angela thought if she lived that she would be willing to go through a period of poverty and depression with him again if only she could live to see him sane and moral and even semisuccessful the baby might do it he had never had a child and much as he disliked the idea now still when it was here he might change his mind if only she could get through that ordeal she was so old her muscles so set meanwhile she consulted a lawyer a doctor a fortune teller an astrologer and the christian science practitioner to whom myrtle had recommended her it was an aimless ridiculous combination but she was badly torn up and any port seemed worth while in this storm the doctor told her that her muscles were rather set but with the regimen he prescribed he was satisfied she would be all right the astrologer told her that she and eugene were fated for this storm by the stars eugene particularly and that he might recover in which case he would be successful again in a measure as for herself he shook his head yes she would be all right he was lying the fortune teller laid the cards to see if eugene would ever marry suzanne and angela was momentarily gratified to learn that she would never enter his life this from a semicadaverous but richly dressed and bejeweled lady whose anteroom was filled with women whose troubles were of the heart the loss of money the enmity of rivals or the dangers of childbirth the christian science practitioner declared all to be divine mind omnipotent omnipresent omniscient good and that evil could not exist in it only the illusion of it it is real enough to those who give it their faith and believe said the counselor but without substance or meaning to those who know themselves to be a perfect indestructible reflection of an idea in god god is a principle when the nature of that principle is realized and yourself as a part of it evil falls away as the troublesome dream that it is it has no reality she assured her that no evil could befall her in the true understanding of science god is love the lawyer told her after listening to a heated story of eugenes misconduct that under the laws of the state of new york in which these misdeeds were committed she was not entitled to anything more than a very small fraction of her husbands estate if he had any two years was the shortest time in which a divorce could be secured he would advise her to sue if she could establish a suitable condition of affluence on eugenes part not otherwise then he charged her twentyfive dollars for this advice pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfs cf chapter xxiv pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfsfsmilli cf to those who have followed a routine or system of living in this world who have by slow degrees and persistent effort built up a series of habits tastes refinements emotions and methods of conduct and have in addition achieved a certain distinction and position so that they have said to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes who have enjoyed without stint or reserve let or hindrance those joys of perfect freedom of action and that ease and deliberation which comes with the presence of comparative wealth social position and comforts the narrowing that comes with the lack of means the fear of public opinion or the shame of public disclosure is one of the most pathetic discouraging and terrifying things that can be imagined these are the hours that try mens souls the man who sits in a seat of the mighty and observes a world that is ruled by a superior power a superior force of which he by some miraculous generosity of fate has been chosen apparently as a glittering instrument has no conception of the feelings of the man who cast out of his dignities and emoluments sits in the dark places of the world among the ashes of his splendor and meditates upon the glory of his bygone days there is a pathos here which passes the conception of the average man the prophets of the old testament discerned it clearly enough for they were forever pronouncing the fate of those whose follies were in opposition to the course of righteousness and who were made examples of by a beneficent and yet awful power thus saith the lord because thou hast lifted thyself up against the god of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy lords thy wives and concubines have drank wine in them and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone god hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and the persians eugene was in a minor way an exemplification of this seeming course of righteousness his kingdom small as it was was truly at an end our social life is so organized so closely knit upon a warp of instinct that we almost always instinctively flee that which does not accord with custom usage preconceived notions and tendencies those various things which we in our littleness of vision conceive to be dominant who does not run from the man who may because of his deeds be condemned of that portion of the public which we chance to respect walk he ever so proudly carry himself with what circumspectness he may at the first breath of suspicion all are off friends relations business acquaintances the whole social fabric in toto unclean is the cry unclean unclean and it does not matter how inwardly shabby we may be what whited sepulchres shining to the sun we run quickly it seems a tribute to that providence which shapes our ends which continues perfect in tendency however vilely we may overlay its brightness with the rust of our mortal corruption however imitative we may be angela had gone home by now to see her father who was now quite old and feeble and also down to alexandria to see eugenes mother who was also badly deteriorated in health i keep hoping against hope that your attitude will change toward me wrote angela let me hear from you if you will from time to time it cant make any difference in your course a word wont hurt and i am so lonely oh eugene if i could only die if i only could no word as to the true state of things was given at either place angela pretended that eugene had long been sick of his commercial career and was owing to untoward conditions in the colfax company glad to return to his art for a period he might come home but he was very busy so she lied but she wrote myrtle fully of her hopes and more particularly her fears there were a number of conferences between eugene and myrtle for the latter because of their early companionship was very fond of him his traits the innocent ones were as sweet to her as when they were boy and girl together she sought him out in his lovely room at kingsbridge why dont you come and stay with us eugene she pleaded we have a comfortable apartment you can have that big room next to ours it has a nice view frank likes you we have listened to angela and i think you are wrong but you are my brother and i want you to come everything is coming out right god will straighten it out frank and i are praying for you there is no evil you know according to the way we think now and she smiled her oldtime girlish smile dont stay up here alone wouldnt you rather be with me oh id like to be there well enough myrtle but i cant do it now i dont want to i have to think i want to be alone i havent settled what i want to do i think i will try my hand at some pictures i have a little money and all the time i want now i see there are some nice houses over there on the hill that might have a room with a north window that would serve as a studio i want to think this thing out first i dont know what ill do he had now that new pain in his groin which had come to him first when her mother first carried suzanne off to canada and he was afraid that he should never see her any more it was a real pain sharp physical like a cut with a knife he wondered how it was that it could be physical and down there his eyes hurt him and his finger tips wasnt that queer too why dont you go and see a christian science practitioner asked myrtle it wont do you any harm you dont need to believe let me get you the book and you can read it see if you dont think there is something in it there you go smiling sarcastically but eugene i cant tell you what it hasnt done for us its done everything thats just all im a different person from what i was five years ago and so is frank you know how sick i was yes i know why dont you go and see mrs johns you neednt tell her anything unless you want to she has performed some perfectly wonderful cures what can mrs johns do for me asked eugene bitterly his lip set in an ironic mould cure me of gloom make my heart cease to ache whats the use of talking i ought to quit the whole thing he stared at the floor she cant but god can oh eugene i know how you feel please go it cant do you any harm ill bring you the book tomorrow will you read it if i bring it to you no oh eugene please for my sake what good will it do i dont believe in it i cant im too intelligent to take any stock in that rot eugene how you talk youll change your mind some time i know how you think but read it anyhow will you please promise me you will i shouldnt ask it isnt the way but i want you to look into it go and see mrs johns eugene refused of asinine things this seemed the silliest christian science christian rot he knew what to do his conscience was dictating that he give up suzanne and return to angela in her hour of need to his coming child for the time being anyhow but this awful lure of beauty of personality of love how it tugged at his soul oh those days with suzanne in the pretty watering and dining places about new york those hours of bliss when she looked so beautiful how could he get over that how give up the memory she was so sweet her beauty so rare every thought of her hurt it hurt so badly that most of the time he dared not think must perforce walk or work or stir restlessly about agonized for fear he should think too much oh life oh hell the intrusion of christian science into his purview just now was due of course to the belief in and enthusiasm for that religious idea on the part of myrtle and her husband as at lourdes and st anne de beau pre and other miracleworking centres where hope and desire and religious enthusiasm for the efficacious intervention of a superior and nonmalicious force intervenes there had occurred in her case an actual cure from a very difficult and complicated physical ailment she had been suffering from a tumor nervous insomnia indigestion constipation and a host of allied ills which had apparently refused to yield to ordinary medical treatment she was in a very bad way mentally and physically at the time the christian science textbook science and health with key to the scriptures by mrs eddy was put into her hands while attempting to read it in a hopeless helpless spirit she was instantly cured that is the idea that she was well took possession of her and not long after she really was so she threw all her medicines of which there was quite a store into the garbage pail eschewed doctors began to read the christian science literature and attend the christian science church nearest her apartment and was soon involved in its subtle metaphysical interpretation of mortal life into this faith her husband who loved her very much had followed for what was good enough for her and would cure her was good enough for him he soon seized on its spiritual significance with great vigor and became if anything a better exponent and interpreter of the significant thought than was she herself those who know anything of christian science know that its main tenet is that god is a principle not a personality understandable or conceivable from the mortal or sensory side of life which latter is an illusion and that man spiritually speaking in his image and likeness man is not god or any part of him he is an idea in god and as such as perfect and indestructible and undisturbably harmonious as an idea in god or principle must be to those not metaphysically inclined this is usually dark and without significance but to those spiritually or metaphysically minded it comes as a great light matter becomes a builtup set or combination of illusions which may have evolved or not as one chooses but which unquestionably have been built up from nothing or an invisible intangible idea and have no significance beyond the faith or credence which those who are at base spiritual give them deny them know them to be what they are and they are gone to eugene who at this time was in a great state of mental doldrums blue dispirited disheartened inclined to see only evil and destructive forces this might well come with peculiar significance if it came at all he was one of those men who from their birth are metaphysically inclined all his life he had been speculating on the subtleties of mortal existence reading spencer kant spinoza at odd moments and particularly such men as darwin huxley tyndall lord avebury alfred russel wallace and latterly sir oliver lodge and sir william crookes trying to find out by the inductive naturalistic method just what life was he had secured inklings at times he thought by reading such things as emersons oversoul the meditations of marcus aurelius and plato god was a spirit he thought as christ had said to the woman at the well in samaria but whether this spirit concerned itself with mortal affairs where was so much suffering and contention was another matter personally he had never believed so or been at all sure he had always been moved by the sermon on the mount the beauty of christs attitude toward the troubles of the world the wonder of the faith of the old prophets in insisting that god is god that there are no other gods before him and that he would repay iniquity with disfavor whether he did or not was an open question with him this question of sin had always puzzled him original sin were there laws which antedated human experience which were in god the word before it was made flesh if so what were these laws did they concern matrimony some spiritual union which was older than life itself did they concern stealing what was stealing outside of life where was it before man began or did it only begin with man ridiculous it must relate to something in chemistry and physics which had worked out in life a sociologist a great professor in one of the colleges had once told him that he did not believe in success or failure sin or a sense of selfrighteousness except as they were related to builtup instincts in the race instincts related solely to the selfpreservation and the evolution of the race beyond that was nothing spiritual morality bah he knew nothing about it such rank agnosticism could not but have had its weight with eugene he was a doubter ever all life as i have said before went to pieces under his scalpel and he could not put it together again logically once he had it cut up people talked about the sanctity of marriage but heavens marriage was an evolution he knew that someone had written a twovolume treatise on it the history of human marriage or something like that and in it animals were shown to have mated only for so long as it took to rear the young to get them to the point at which they could take care of themselves and wasnt this really what was at the basis of modern marriage he had read in this history if he recalled aright that the only reason marriage had come to be looked upon as sacred and for life was the length of time it took to rear the human young it took so long that the parents were old safely so before the children were launched into the world then why separate but it was the duty of everybody to raise children ah there had been the trouble he had been bothered by that the home centered around that children race reproduction pulling this wagon of evolution was every man who did not inevitably damned was the race spirit against him look at the men and women who didnt who couldnt thousands and thousands and those who did always thought those who didnt were wrong the whole american spirit he had always felt to be intensely set in this direction the idea of having children and rearing them a conservative workaday spirit look at his father and yet other men were so shrewd that they preyed on this spirit moving factories to where this race spirit was the most active so that they could hire the children cheaply and nothing happened to them or did something happen however myrtle continued to plead with him to look into this new interpretation of the scriptures claiming that it was true that it would bring him into an understanding of spirit which would drive away all these mortal ills that it was above all mortal conception spiritual over all and so he thought about that she told him that if it was right that he shboth the project gutenberg literary archive
