 the grand wheel chapter one there was a concave stripper in the game cheyne scame as he shuffled the deck preparatory to dealing covertly sized up the player sitting opposite him across the green baize table the stripper was not much over twentyfive years of age with his pale face and thin nose he had an icy sort of selfassurance about him earlier he had introduced himself as skode loder from offplanet a newcomer to lo one of the new breed of players who never stayed long in one spot scame had already gauged loder to be a card mechanic but he hadnt been sure just what his particular gimmick was now that he held the deck in his own hands he knew even that several of the trump cards had been finely shaved on their short edges so that the stripperor now that he knew the secret scame himselfcould on his deal drop them out of the pack and distribute them whichever way he wanted the job had been artfully performed the slight concavities made no perceptible dent but scame had found the right touch the slight difference in pressure that made the trick work loder he noted wore a slim gold ring on the third finger of his left hand that was it of course there was a blade vibrator in the ring it was too obvious in fact almost blatant as if the sharp were advertising his trade scarne had known of stripper blades that were totally invisible being embedded in the flesh of the finger and anchored to the bone loder was gazing back at him a sardonic smile playing on his lips scame was in a dilemma in the past hour he had been nearly cleaned out by this mechanic he could now expose him and get his money back but he hesitated in too many ways it didnt add up the sharp had walked into a game between professionals for his victim he had chosen cheyne scame who as well as being an experienced gambler was also a professor of randomaticsin other words he was one of the hardest men in the solar system to take for a ride everything else was wrong for this situation too the place not some unfranchised shack but a wheel house where to be caught cheating could mean being banned from every wheel establishment in a hundred lightyear radius the game opus a game for professionals one of the only two card games to utilize all seventyeight cards of the ancient tarot pack who would try to pull off such a stunt nobody but a fool skode loder was too expert to be a fool another of the players spoke goodnaturedly eh dont give us any rifflestack cheyne come on deal us a fair hand scame had automatically been shuffling and reshuffling while he thought the matter over he glanced again at loder he could almost imagine that the man knewand was laughing at him he came to a decision squaring up the deck he laid it in the center of the table then pushed his remaining chips into the stakes circle he took out his bank card and threw that in too time for me to leave he said but first lets cut for whats left loder loder bent his head to read the amount printed on the bank card he sat stockstill for a moment then he shrugged why not the others looked on with interest making no comment as loder covered scames stake he cut the deck glancing at the card he drew before laying it face down scame in turn cut showing the card to loder it was the queen of wands loder smiled and revealed his card it was the card known as the universe a trump one of the major arcana the elaborate picture symbolism that had been devised in antiquity to depict cosmic mysteries it showed a naked female dancing within an oval wreath a flaming wand in each hand the card was probably stripped scame thought that just about summed up everything a stripped universe there was a timehonored losers prerogative scarne reached out and picked up one small chip okay loder nodded scame stood up another time perhaps the blackjacketed seneschal bowed to him as he emerged from the card room scame had a reason for knuckling under to loders depradations there was one thrilling explanation that did make sense for some tune he had been trying to find his way to the inside of that vast circumspect organization known as the grand wheel controllers of chance and probability in the gaming sense over the whole of maninhabited space he knew that in a less sophisticated phase of its history the wheel had practiced a roughshod method of recruitment it would engineer the ruin of the prospect leaving him bankrupt threatened with imprisonment or violence thus he would be made to feel the wheels power even while forced to accept its protection caught in a closed system from which there was no escape these days the wheel had no need to take such measures but it had a wellknown love of tradition scame believed loder was a wheel operative going through ancient motions if scame had behaved like a hick denouncing loder and showing that he understood events only in a simplistic sense then his opportunity would be gone he would be deemed too inflexible only if he gave some sign that he recognized the hidden level in the game might there be a further contact it was conceivable of course that loder had somehow learned of scames longterm object and was perpetrating a doublebluff he could only wait and see a walk along a blue and gold corridor brought him to a balustraded balcony which overlooked the main gaming area the tables and fermat machines were busy bringing in the wheel its eternal percentages on one wall a huge numbers display flashed out sequences of multicolored digits over the exit the grand wheels emblem a spoked gold wheel revolving slowly glittered the background music mingled with the calling of bets and made a meaningless din in his ears he descended the stairway and wandered among the gaming machines idly he stopped at a table with a surface of colored squares he put loders chip on the pale green the tabletop flickered and surged the chip went down hello cheyne anything upstairs worth getting into scame turned on hearing the voice of gay millman an acquaintance no nothing he said and walked on centuries ago he reflected an establishment like this one would have been filled with simpler mechanical devices of which the roulette wheel he supposed was the archetype but that was before the advent of randomatics the modem science of chance and number had rendered all such devices obsolete they were now regarded as primitive almost prehistoric scame could have walked into any oldstyle casino or gambling arcade and armed with the randomatic equations would have been guaranteed to win moderately but consistently over the space of an hour or two randomatics rested on certain unexpected discoveries that had been made in the essential mystery of number it had been discovered that below a certain very high number permutating a set of independent elements did not produce a sequence that was strictly random preferred substructures appeared in any chance run and these could be predicted only when the number of independent elements entered the billionsthe socalled billion bracketdid predictability vanish this was the realm of secondorder chance distinguished from firstorder chance in that it was chance in the old sense pure probability unadulterated by calculable runs and groupings the mythical system once sought by cranks and eccentrics became therefore a scientific fact to meet this challenge the fermat a new class of machine able to operate beyond the billion bracket arose early versions had been comparatively crude affairs following perhaps the path of a single molecule in a heated gas or counting out exploding atoms as the randomatic equations refined and extended pushed back the billion bracket still further these too became obsolete these days all formats worked on the subatomic level by manipulating the weak nuclear interaction intercepting neutrinos processing exotic artificial particles or even tapping the source of true randomness below the quantum level the innards of some of them were wheel secrets making for the exit scame paused in the foyer where there stood a row of a small type of fermat called the mugger muggers held a special fascination for scame perhaps because of their ubiquity wherever one turned there was a mugger they existed in their billions all treated by wheel mathematicians as a single stochastic organism with terminals spread over a hundred star systems not bad scame thought for something that had evolved from the ancient fruit machine or onearmed bandit he fumbled in his pocket for a coin and pressed it into the mugger he touched the go bar a cloud of colored dots twinkled silently on the gridded screen it was like watching a structureless protogalaxy speeded up number he thought number was what it was all about what everything was all about number plucked out of some unfathomable subuniversal source the sparks settled scame scanned the grid slots gold gold gold and gold all along the line stupefied he stared at the golden points as he did so a soft conspiratorial voice issued from the base of the mugger jackpot you have won the jackpot scame glanced around him the legitimacy government had long outlawed wheel jackpots though rumors persisted that they were still operated illegally rumors which given the nature of the odds were hard to confirm some said the jackpot was an enormous sum of money others that it granted a secret wish the soft voice spoke again directing him take hold of the silver handles below the payoff groove the jackpot will then be delivered scame broke out in a sweat as he looked for the handles which to the uninitiated were merely part of the muggers florid decoration nervously he closed his fingers round them his head reeling to think of the odds against this happening one jackpot perhaps per billions trillions of throws it seemed impossible impossible no he reminded himself nothing was impossible in a world of random numbers only improbable and then the jackpot hit him and it was nothing he could have guessed at or expected the wheel house dwindled from his consciousness he was standing on the edge of a precipice below him was a raucous roaring boiling sea then the ground vanished from under his feet he was falling down down down he was sinking drifting swimming through a vast shifting foamlike sea out of which abstract entities formed and dissolved without rhyme or order he came to understand that he had dropped out of the realm of solid reality he was in the awful other reality the one he had been contemplating dimly and theoretically instants earlier the gulf of pure randomness that underlay all of existence the great profundity a sea of noncausation on which the universe of causeandeffect of structure order space and materiality floated like scum on turbulent water number the universe was made of number the ancient greeks had been the first to guess at that fact modem science aided and abetted by randomatics had confirmed it and here it was the source from which number flowed in an endless utterly irrational stream before there was the atom before there was the elementary particle before there was h the quantum of action there was number scame understood the randomatic equations now in a way he never had before but even those equations were dissolving breaking up everything dissolved in this foam sea it was a universal solvent beyond the wildest alchemical dreams breaking down substance idea being itself even scames own consciousness was dissolving in ecstacy and terror into the endless flux then it all vanished and substance returned the silver handles were cool in scames sweating hands the formats glittered and flashed ranked silver and red vastoess his experience had fouled up his sense of orientation the impression of vastness in particular lingered attaching itself to everyday objects the blue wall to his left was at a guess the distance from the earth to the moon the fermat before him was a ti tanic construction soaring thousands of miles into the air above the roof he glanced up and quickly looked away again seeing a titanic moving assemblage of folds and color alongside one of the fermats it was a woman in a tan robe thumbing in a coin touching the go bar thumbing in a coin touching the go bar on and on the vast perspective was not all everything around him seemed to have been translated from the concrete to the abstract as though every vestige of meaning had been sucked out of the world his consciousness had become oversensitized sounds were hard to recognize floating in the air around him without any identifiable source even the formerly pleasant music coming from the softspeakers had lost its tunefulness it skirled on atonal surrealist arbitrary a voice boomed to him across great cavities you all riiight cheyneeee he made an effort at recognition it was gay millman his face so huge as to make his expression unreadable you look paaaale scame spoke yes im all riiiight each vibration of his voice was like the beat of a drum he turned away from millman and headed for the street forcing himself to overcome his fear that he would fall over and topple thousands of miles to the floor walking to the exit was like crossing space to another planet each step was a stride that crossed a continent but eventually he stood outside where he tried to normalize his sense of size and distance it had been raining and the street was wet he tried to tone down the sound of the traffic in his mind and looked up at the black sky of lo the towers of the town were outlined sharply against the big soft globe of jupiter it was too much he closed his eyes painfully a moment if you please friend scame opened his eyes again a thousandmileacross face ballooned into view thin nose pale skin jaunty eyebrows all smeared from horizon to horizon like a telescope suddenly refocusing his vision became normal the face was human size skode loder scame muttered you want me his twin as a matter of fact skode is still upstairs the other flicked his fingers and conjured a card into his hand giving it to scame it was an introduction card of the type used to make formal contact a spoked gold wheel revolved slowly given perpetual motion by electrolytic molecular printing will you be at home at ten tomorrow i suppose so be there the tone of his voice the ritualized summons from the grand wheel all implied a certainty that scame would be on call loder turned abruptly and mounted the steps into the gaming house scarne set off down the street still too bewildered to form any definite feelings the illusion of giantism might have disappearedif it could be called an illusion size being relativebut the jackpot the vision of ultimate probabilities was still vivid in his mind he was trenchantly aware that behind the glistening street behind the moving cars and the glittering signs fronting the buildings lay the almost mystic gulf of noncausation invisible to the senses invisible to the unaided mind on which the world floated without apparent support pacing the sidewalk like a stricken man he came to a comer where there was a newsvendor stand a flashsign glowed above the delivery slot big defeat in hopula cluster legitimacy forces reel before hadranic hammerblows but even this horrifying war news failed to catch his attention and he passed by walking through a ghost world chapter two when scame awoke six hours later it was dawn atop the highest tower of the town the artificial sun was kindling casting daylight into the streets and through the windows of his living room blearily he rose still feeling slightly disorientated more than that his nerves were beginning to twitch in a way he knew would be indicative of much worse things to come unless he gave himself a needed fix he unlocked a cabinet and took out what appeared to be an ordinary deodorant spray the atomizer hissed as he sprayinjected a dose of the drug it contained into his jugular vein rapidly his nerves steadied on one occasion he had tried to defy the addiction letting the withdrawal symptoms continue it had been an experience he did not intend to go through again he decided he had better get in touch with magdan his contact he opened a wall closet and swished aside the clothes hanging there then placed a small stool in the space he made he climbed in sat down and closed the door behind him reaching as he did so for the switch that activated his secret holbooth the darkness of the cupboard vanished he was sitting on an ordinary chair in a small windowless room the walls were decorated with blue and gold fretwork it was a standard holbooth room the chair facing him was however empty he waited until magdan his legitimacy controller appeared suddenly in the chair about a minute later he wore a satin dressing gown and was rubbing his eyes evidently scame had got him out of bed this is a hell of a time to be calling scame the hologram image of magdan said with a scowl thered better be a good reason for it there is briefly scarne recounted the events of the previous night the game with skode loder and the subsequent approach this kind of thing is traditional he explained so there you are i think ive got my foot in magdan showed none of the expected delight about time i was beginning to write you off how much did this mechanic take off you everything about two hundred thousand at that magdan became angry hell that was government money he exploded i have to account for everything you throw down the drain it was fun scame admitted i cant honestly see that i owe you anything besides i thought i just explained the wheel wouldnt have made contact until i was destitute they have a high regard for tradition he paused by the way did you know the wheel does still run mugger jackpots so whats new magdan grunted sulking into his thoughts for a moment i hit one last night after the game magdan showed interest well that wasnt exactly coincidence was it i dont know scame said doubtfully the wheel doesnt fix its muggers im sure of that oh certainly like your tarot cards werent stripped that was different scame told him the house didnt do the sharping a player from outside did it a hired freelance or a wheel employee from another level somebody the house doesnt know anything about there was something unusual about this jackpot too he ruminated trying to find words to describe his experience i had a vision a vision of randomnesspure randomness below every level maths can reach he stopped there was little point in trying to convey abstract ideas to this beefy secret serviceman what are you trying to suggest magdan asked slowly maybe the wheel are using their new equations the luck equations and they steered you a jackpot by sheer luck yes then they wouldnt have to fix it its quite a thought magdan conceded he became thoughtful when this is all over well have you debriefed over that jackpot they can be psychologically damagingthats one reason why theyre outlawed he frowned sinking his chin into his chest thinking hard im still inclined to think the mugger was rigged though i dont have your belief in the wheels fastidiousness when did you say theyre calling at ten meantime im closing this connection down we dont want it traced when you have something for us call one of the numbers youve already memorized the antidote scarne said huh magdan looked up at him sharply if youre leaving me without a personal controller i want the antidote im as good as inside ive done enough to deserve it magdan pulled an ugly face expressing derision forget it youll get the antidote when you deliver the luck equations and not a minute before he rose from his seat scame began to get desperate dont leave me without a linkman he pleaded the wheel could take me literally anywhere what if i need to renew my supply call one of the numbers i might not be able to call a number or perhaps your agent wont be able to reach me scames tone became wheedling give me the antidote you neednt worry about my reneging im on your side magdan cast his eyes upwards oh sure look you know the score scame or at least you ought to by now youre not our only hook in the water you know come through with the goods and youll be all right after all people like you never do anything without an incentive do they as magdan turned to go scame surged to his feet in a sudden fury you goddamned bastard he choked he threw himself at magdan their two forms tussled the scanners integrating their hologram images and causing them to respond to one another like physical objects the holbooth system was nothing if not pure communication abruptly magdan vanished quickly followed by the holbooth room itself scarne found himself back in the darkened clothes closet threatening empty air nothing happened when he tried the activating switch again magdan had dissolved the secret holbooth connection as he had said he would scame stepped from the closet shaking with reaction one day hed get even with magdan he promised himself savagely but futilely in fact he was aware that he would not have the courage physically to attack the controller in the flesh when it came to method he thought as he padded to the bathroom there was little to choose between the legitimacy and the grand wheel magdan had chosen a hell of a way to ensure his loyalty the drug his men had forcibly addicted him to was a specific drug one synthesized exclusively for use on him the antidote was equally specific neither it nor the drug itself could be obtained from anyone but bis masters the legitimacys secret intelligence service in the bathroom mirror he examined his face carefully its lines were continuing to deepen his incipient middle age being accelerated by the ravages of the drug wearily he washed dressed and then breakfasted on coffee and synthetic fluffed eggs there was time to wait before his appointment with the wheel callers he tried to relax attempting to soothe himself by playing with a favorite curio a pair of cubical white dice the faces bearing black dots from one to six they were centuries old quite valuable as an antique loaded with tiny movable internal weights with a little expertiseit was all in the wrist actionthey could be made to come up with any number to order or again by means of the right shake they could be converted into evenweighted dice safe for inspection he shook the dice in his hand and threw a seven he threw four more sevens then switched to eleven in a gamesconscious civilization the weighted dice were but one item in a long colorful history of cheating devices cheating at cards for instance was a science all of its own it had a tradition of ingenuity that made it almost honorable in some eyes locaters shiners marked cards of inexhaustible variety strippers both concave and convex changecards whose surfaces mutated and could assume the value of any card in the deckthe mechanics of it was endless not to speak of sleight of hand which in some practitioners had reached almost superhuman levels the ultimate in cheating devices was probably the holdout robot given its name from the ancient holdout machine a device strapped to the arm which delivered either a set of cards or a cold deck into the hand the holdout robot was a proxie player a nearly undetectable manlike robot who entered play but remained in touch with its owner who looked through its eyes and partly controlled it more than a mere waldo the holdout proxie had its own brain and such a sublime sense of touch that it never needed to use trick shuffles or any other gimmick it could take a deck in its fingers and count the cards down by touch alone cutting to obtain any card it wanted it could keep track of every individual card through shuffles and deals and so always knew what everybody was holding holdout robots had gone out of fashion recently though it was becoming easier to detect them the last one scame had heard about had been smashed to pieces right there in the card room at ten the annunciator toned scame who had become increasingly more nervous during the past half hour checked the door monitor two men stood outside both snappily dressed one was big with an air of restrained violence the heavy the other was smaller more like a functionary he let them in the heavy looked around the apartment in a cool professional manner is this place bonded he asked yes right we dont have to worry about it the other spoke ildly but firmly were here to take you to see some people professor scame dont expect to be back in a hurry unless you have any substantial objections i suggest we leave now scame coughed found his voice where are we going earth the planliner leaves in half an hour could you tell me exactly what im wanted for scame asked stumbling over the words the wheel man made no direct answer but merely stared at him do you not understand your good fortune his eyes seemed to say youre being taken into the employment of the grand wheel youll be a wheel man like me a member of the most powerful brotherhood in the human world scame picked up theholdall he had already preprepared im ready he said a car was waiting in the street below scame sat in the back sandwiched between his two escorts while they rode through the town what are your names he asked boldly the smaller man gestured to his companion then to himself caiman hervold were going to earth you say at least you can tell me where on earth just earth hervold smiled wryly we just do our job thats all of course scame peered out of the car window watching the buildings speeding past the shuttle wooshed skywards leaving los miniature landscape laid neatly out below the towers of maintown jutted up like a crop of metal whiskers the atmosphere plant on the outskirts looked like an earthtype stadium exhaling the gases of life in less than a minute they were above the shallow atmosphere and in darkness the shuttle pushed its passenger tube into the hull of the planliner there were clinking sounds and sudden small movements then smoothly and imperceptibly the inertial engines took hold hurling the planliner on a brief geodesic to earth the planliner was about half full scame shared a seat with hervold and caiman in the large comfortable lounge и he remembered correctly the journey would take around an hour at this time of the year he pulled a sealed deck of cards from his pocket care to play no thanks hervold said a servit entered the lounge and began wheeling between the zigzag rows of seats offering drinks and smokes hervold beckoned the machine over as he did so scame noticed a piece of jewelery dangling from his wrist a little wheel of gridded gold ill bet you feel good to wear that scame ventured hervold glanced at the trinket and scowled sure scame realized he had been personal wheel people were touchy about the emblem of their order the others gaze focused on his throat i see youre not travelling alone either he said you believe in lady thats interesting scame fingered the image of lady goddess of luck that hung from his neck its not that im religious he explained i dont believe in lady as an actual being more as an impersonal force or principle dont we all hervold replied sardonically tum ing to the servit he brought greentinted jamboks for the three of them the wheel men were unwilling to talk further scame drank his jambok then he fell into a reverie in a half doze he seemed to see the wheel symbol spinning dizzily throwing off probability in all directions the wheel most ancient of mans symbols sigil of chance image of eternity the wheel of fortune the tarot pack called it elsewhere it was known as the wheel of life the randomatic equations also had a cyclic form as had the equations used in most formats the grand wheel had probably chosen the symbol fortuitously to begin with back in the days when it had been no more than a semicriminal gambling syndicate before it had developed into a political and ideological power well able to withstand the onslaughts of its archenemy the legitimacy government it might once have signified no more than a roulette wheel or some such device but now it had come to mean much more it was curious scame thought how the grand wheel had swallowed itself in its own symbolism as if hypnotized by its own mystique delving for instance into the arcana of the tarot pack and generally indulging in the mysticosymbolism that it was so easy to associate with the laws of chance had the world always been like this be wondered hustlers and holdout robots instantly addictive drugs administered by government agencies a perpetual struggle between law and hazard had civilization always been dichotomic or would one side the legitimacy or the grand wheel eventually vanquish the other probably not scame thought the wheel was scornful of rather than antagonistic to the legitimacys obsession for predictability and control for eradicating chance hazard it did not seek to replace the government merely to tap mankinds gambling instinct which the legitimacy abhorred and the legitimacy would never rid society of the grand wheel either its tentacles were too deep indeed the legitimacy itself could scarcely do without the grand wheel anymore by now the proliferous gaming houses the interstellar numbers service the randomatic sweepstakes were only froth on the wheels activities the wheel alone for instance had the ability to keep the huge interstellar economy running smoothly applying to the stock and commodity exchanges the same randomatic principles that governed the fermat networks scarne awoke with a start realizing that he must have dozed off they had reached parking orbit and the passengers were splitting up some going to luna and some to earth a trifle blearily he followed hervold and caiman into the earth shuttle for the short hop as he took his seat he saw that the shuttle was accepting passengers from another planliner too they were mostly military officers they seemed like him in low spirits and short of sleep he sat back while the shuttle steadily filled up with uniformed men caiman stirred he looked at the officers with an expression that showed increasing disgust finally he spoke for the first time since lo just look at those punks he said loudly did you ever see such a pack of deadbeats he took something from his breast pocket and handed it to scame here just take a look at this doesnt it make you sick scame shook loose the tiny infinitely foldable newssheet into readable size and scanned the headlines the sheet had been printed on lo it told in detail of the hopula disaster of legitimacy forces falling back across hundreds of light years of man being forced out of territories he had believed were his the goddamned hadranics are coming closer every day the wheel heavy said in a hardedged voice its time those legit generals started putting some guts into it because in a few years they could be right here in sol chapter three the desert was boneyellow in the south a sun of a much brighter yellow the color of sulphur hovered a third of the way between the horizon and the meridian looking down on the temporary installations like a baleful eye a thinfaced youth aged fifteen or sixteen stared at the sun with sullen fear suddenly he shivered and tore his gaze away im cold he yelped in a cracked voice get me a cloak you the burly crewman he had addressed looked at him disdainfully tell me sonny have you ever shaved the youth flushed and rounded on hakandra my price is doubled he croaked i wont take insults hakandra moved his hand placatingly forget it shane it was just a silly remark nevertheless it has doubled my price or do you think you can do without my services all right then do without them i renounce my obligations as of now perhaps the sun is due to explode tomorrow in the next hour the next minute perhaps it has already begun to explodei wont tell you are you gonna let yourself bum up too the crewman grunted and walked away hakandra scowled after his retreating back making a mental note to put in a disciplinary memo he slipped off his own cloak and draped it round the shoulders of the shivering boy in fact the air was not at all cold the lad was suffering from nerves as usual lets get back to the ship he said no use our hanging around here they set off up the slope towards the starship which rested on the crest of the hill do you get any murmurs hakandra asked quietly no its quiet the youth walked in silence for a while and then started whining cant we leave this godforsaken hole i dont like it here how much longer no shane were not leaving weve a great deal of work to do yet and please dont let me hear any more talk about increasing your fee that was all agreed back in sol you want my power to dry up dont you youre all of you going the right way about it to make my power dry up its not absolutely reliable you know where would you be then probably quite safe hakandra replied in a level voice but youre not going to dry up shaneyoure not stupid you know how important all this is he stopped looking around him at the ochre sun and purple sky this is where the outcome of the war will be decided victory or defeat they entered the big starship riding an elevator up through its many decks hakandra sent shane to rest in his quarters then he made bis way to the corn room every day at about this time he spent a few minutes talking to other workteams scattered about the cave as he entered the room the techs were accepting narrowbeams from here and there holding them online hakandra sat down before a holo screen and had one put through to him on the screen a lean face emerged wearing a peaked uniform hat bearing legitimacy markings it was the leader of team dl the team leaders face was bleak wavering slight ly the narrowbeam vacillating over the vast distance theres been a nova on the outward side he told hakandra team k was therewithout a coldsen ser no survivors then hakandra responded after a moment bis heart sinking no time to do anything its so sudden the team leader sounded desperate its terrifying how fast these things can blow a star bums steadily for billions of years and then in the space of minutes he broke off sighing perhaps they didnt die in vain the automatic stations carried on transmitting data right up to the instant they were vaporized perhaps well lear something hakandra nodded knowledge of what made the stars in the cave go nova at such a rate could be important in the impending struggle as he had said to shane this was where the next stage of the war would be fought any news from the front he asked weve been routing whole streams of messages between there and high command theres a big quarrel building up the military people in the field are doing a good job of covering the evacuation but sol seems more concerned with getting out as many intact battleships as possible and to hell with civilians its a difficult decision hakandra said aware that reserves were dangerously low after a few further desultory comments he left dl and talked to some of the other teams working in the cave so far their surveys had uncovered several hundred usable planets and soon the legitimacy was going to have to decide which to invest and which to destroy finally he killed the holo screen and sat brooding the destruction of team k had shaken him despite himself what a hell of a place to have to make a stand he thought in the cave which to anyone brought up in legitimacy philosophy was a region of horror a bastion of the enemies chance and randomness the cave of caspar was so called not because it was empty but because its thin scattering of stars made it comparatively empty it had the form of a curved oblong bounded on its long sides by neighbor ing spiral arms and on the shorter ends by straggling limbs of stars that connected the spiral arms it was now very nearly all that remained between the main bulk of human civilization and the advancing hadranics nearly all territory on the further side of the cave had fallen including the muchprized hopula cluster and the thin margin of stars remaining were being hastily evacuated behind an improvised defensive screen to attack the central regions of maninhabited space the hadranics would have to cross this immensity with its lack of cover and its dearth of worlds a defensive strategy was slowly being worked out and soon fresh forces would move in to take up their positions but there was a peculiar difficulty involved in any kind of activity in the cave all the stars there were unstable liable to go nova at any time without warning the reason for it was not understoodprobably it had something to do with the unusual nucleonic resonance levels to be found in stellar material within the cave the problem was precisely identical to that of radioactive decay one could calculate how many atoms would explode out of a given number in a given time but it was impossible to say which particular atoms they would be yet it had been estimated that all stars in the cave would have exploded in another hundred thousand years or less grand wheel operatives might feel more at home here hakandra thought sourly but the legitimacy had found an answerand that answer lay in people like shane a coldsenser the term was a piece of jargon thought up by psychologists mainly hakandra suspected to cover up their own ignorance but it meant that he was capable of perceptions that did not always have to be processed through the physical senses more specifically he had the ability to predict chance occurrences how a pair of dice would fall what number was due out of a sequence even on a single throw he was an extreme example of what had once been known as a callidetic for some years the legitimacy had been nurturing people like him as part of its eternal struggle against the grand wheel all coldsensers were now however employed in the cave in some manner they were able to predict when a star was about to blow even though normal scientific observation would detect no difference in its activity they could give just enough warning for a getaway coldsensers were not completely reliable and the protection they gave was not absolutely dependable moreover they were hopelessly neuroticoverstimulation of the thyroid gland was part of the treatment that heightened their talentsbut it gave hakandra a warm feeling to have one on his team after a while he left the corn room and worked on some reports then he went up into the observation room where he ate a sparse meal afterwards sitting and watching the desert landscape through the glassite dome the sun went down its run flickering and bubbling on the horizon in a way that made hakandra nervous every night even though it was only a trick of the atmosphere then the dark purple sky took over filled with the misty swathe of the milky way and the great patches of darkness a sound came from behind him shane entered the room picking his way through the semidarkness to lean against the glassite and peer into the sky there was a nova over on the other side hakandra told him after a long silence shane nodded calmly im not surprised i had a premonition i thought there might be one going off somewhere hakandra glanced at the youth all his former neurosis seemed to have vanished hakandra had seen this transformation before when shane lost the almost psychopathic aspects of his personality and became collected almost angelically graceful but now he seemed at the same time depressed and fatalistic the cave is a terrible place the boy murmured its cursed hakandra snorted dont be superstitious i tell you its cursed lady has cursed it how would you know you have no sense for such things but i can tell its an accursed hole that the goddess has deserted the very stars explode everything decays hakandra was disturbed to hear shane talk in this religious way smacking as it did of the mystique adopted by the grand wheel there is no goddess he said curtly put that nonsense out of your head as the sky darkened there was a faint glow in the south it came from some ruins hakandra had visited they were made of a lightretentive stone and glowed at night like phosphorescent bones the race that had built them had died ages ago when the planet dried up it was the same story all over the cave which was littered with the ruins of dead civilizations as though the force that generated life was insufficient to enable that life to survive the hazards of existence there was not one example as far as was known of a living intelligence still surviving in the cave it almost persuaded hakandra to believe in shanes pessimistic mysticism but he shook off the mood it was unfitting in an officer of the legitimacy chapter four overhead the sun beat down brilliantly on the extended wings ofthe shuttle below visible through the vehicles windows once they were within the atmosphere were spread out chessboard squares of cloud land and sea the pattern of earths controlled weather areas as they descended the chessboard effect was reinforced by the fact that pieces stood on some of the squares the pieces were vertical tower cities complete with coronas and lumpy proturberances creating the impression of chess kings and queens knights and castles the shuttle planed down to the big dispersal center here there was no automatic immigration count as there would have been on say mars a legitimacydominated world they walked straight off the shuttle and onto the force network platforms soon scarnes escorts had procured a vehicle and they were hurtling through the air towards their destination propelled by the invisible inertial guidelines the landscape was mostly forest and empty plain dotted here and there with vacation lodges the population was all in the teeming colorful cities it said much for the dichotomic nature of human civilization that earth the capital planet was a wheel worldone where the grand wheels influence was strong unchecked by the legitimacys repressive efforts on earth the game was the thing it was the site of the original corruption the birthplace of the wheel here people spent their lives testing fortune moving from one ingenious game of chance to another a vast pile loomed up and became a blur as the inertial vehicle slammed towards it at ten thousandmiles per hour slowing to a mere sixty in the few seconds before entering the tower city briefly they sped through lighted tunnels changing direction every now and then when the inertial beam brought the vehicle to a stop they were in what seemed to be a largish office or study an untidy desk was littered with papers tapes and box files one or two paintings mediocre to moderately good hung on the walls chairs a couch a service cabinet hervold folded down the front of the small vehicle they clambered out looking around them wheres soma caiman asked disgruntled he aint here hervold crossed to the desk glanced at a notepad there well we delivered anyway he spoke to scarne hell be along shortly make yourself comfortable he nodded to caiman the two of them climbed back into the inertial cab it withdrew into the tunnel a facing panel came down leaving the wall smooth and unbroken in a few hours they would probably be back on lo suddenly alone scame put down his holdall he went to the desk nothing there gave him any clue a door opened behind him scame turned to see a paleeyed woman aged about thirtyfive standing in sudden surprise in the doorway she recovered herself quickly who are you she asked the man from lo she searched her mind professor scame yes cheyne scame he offered his hand she shook it limply she was still attractive scame thought but with the faded slightly worn look of a woman who has lived perhaps a little too fast her face had something appealing almost touching about it welcome to the makeout club she said im cadence mellors wed better get to know one another i guess how long have you been synched synched a frown crossed her face how long have you been entitled to wear one of these she held up her wrist to show him the dangling gridded wheel similar to hervolds he caught her meaning there was probably a lot of jargon inside the wheel organization only since today as a matter of fact oh the new realization clouded her features as if it disappointed her whos this man soma scame asked jerry soma hell be your boss this is his office he runs the makeout she crossed to the service unit and came back with two glasses handing one to scame have some refreshment she clinked her glass against his before they drank good health she said while scarne merely sipped the malt whisky she knocked hers straight back id never get through the afternoon without a pickmeup she explained cheerfully the door opened again admitting a tall lean man who walked with a slight slouch head down he ignored cheyne and cadence as he strode to the desk where he sat down and quickly tapped something out on an integrator jerry this is professor scame cadence said breathlessly soma didnt look up until he had finished what he was doing his eyes went from scame to cadence and back again calculatingly as though suspicious of then being together scame you got here then his hand went to a piece of desk equipment depressing a key he read out loud from the showplate lessee born in minnesota earth a ground town not everybody likes to live in a tower scame interrupted him soma didnt seem to hear your parents were cybclerks looks like they tried to give their son a start in life you attended the university of oceania majored with honors in randomatics then you got drawn back to source like a lot of randomaticians are you became a fulltime gambler your legittype parents didnt like that did they still its a professional hazard the science of probability originally grew out of games of chance didnt it i dont see what my parents have got to do with anything scame said stiffly he hadnt seen them for over a decade ask any psychiatrist parents are the first cards youre dealt its in the tarot isnt it the emperor he empress anyway you havent made very good use of your talent drifting around solsystem no concerted plan of action caught between two stools science and gambling several times youve been in trouble for bad debts ive always come out clean scarne said he felt uncomfortable being described in precis in front of the girl but thats all youve done soma made a sudden angry gesture hell if youd used your abilities you could have had everything money whatever you wanted entry into the wheel the wheel really leaves it wide open for people like youdont you know that but only if you can find your own way all these years youve stayed right there below the fiftyfifty line you never got into even one weighted game scame didnt know what he was talking about im surprised you want to use me now if im such a loser soma smiled sourly contemptuously youre a failure but youre not a loser losers we cant use dont be too hard on him jerry cadence said tentatively youll make him lose confidence hed better not be that delicate all right scame youre working for us now for the time being youre assigned to the makeout while we check your performance this is a special club not the usual kind we have special games games you probably never heard of new games special clienteleprivate list only some of them highranking legit officials whove got the bug even youll be learning to play against them he paused one question im told to ask can you play kabala scame hesitated i think i probably could ive studied the game but ive never had an opportunity to play it the report on you says the same soma made a note on his pad will i be playing kabala not here who knows maybe dom will want to try you out scarnes mind thrilled at mention of the name marguerite domchairman of the grand wheel it excited him to think he might actually be that close to what he wanted he coughed and spoke in an innocent tone is this all you want me for as a player i had hoped to be introduced to the planning side of things after all i am a highly qualified randomatician is this all we want you for soma mimicked unpleasantly he leaned forward his vulpine face glaring at scame we moved on past the three card trick a long time ago here on earth there are people whose whole lives are games of chance organized by the wheel there are people playing games just to win a chance to get into bigger games its a study of life itself there are people who dont even know that they are playing there are people who have a lifegame set up for them before they are even born he leaned back dont tell me its belittling to be a wheel player i wont soma was a typical wheel operative scame thought he had that odd combination that made the grand wheel so frightening intelligence ability even a certain amount of scientific knowledge but along with it all the whiff of the hoodlum the sinister influence of past wheel history maybe the members of the mathematical cadre academic randomaticians like himself would be of a different sort he told himself he decided to ask a question of his own last night on lo i hit a jackpot on the muggers im curious to know how it was done are you implying the muggers are fixed soma asked sharply if so forget it all our formats are inviolably random its not that scame said skirting clear of the dangerous subject it was the vision itself id like to know how it was achieved what vision the vision of probabilities soma looked puzzled for a moment then he glanced at cadence waving his hand at her peremptorily ill speak to the professor alone for a moment the girl left soma settled himself in his chair again tilting his face to look scarne directly in the eye tell me about this vision haltingly as best he could scame described what had happened to him when he took hold of the mugger handles soma listened attentively asking a question now and then when scarnes account became vague when scame had finished he became silent for a moment well i dont know he said you were supposed to get a brain charge a few moments of pure pleasure thats all this ive never heard of pure pleasure is that standard for a jackpot sometimes its a lot of money sometimes its some type of brain charge it may not sound like much actually pure unadulterated happiness is something the average person never experiences normally he remembers it all his life this other thing though thats something else again ill check it out soma rose to his feet cadence will show you to your quarters do you need any sleep no im all right rest a couple of hours anyway well run through a session tonight somas hand on his shoulder was proprietorial almost comradely as he guided scame through the doorway cadence sat in an adjoining office she rose to her feet smiling nervously as soma handed scarne over to her then she led him to a travel cubicle the cubicle was the standard means of transport in the tower cities zipping through a ubiquitous network of squaresectioned tunnels up down sideways and in ranging curves it could deliver one to almost any dwelling in the pile this one did not take them far however staying within the precincts of the makeout club for only a few seconds scame shared the cubicle with the silent presence of the girl then she slid open the door panel and they entered a tidy comfortable room with a bathroom just off it well this is it hope youll be okay here she moved around the room turning on sidelights theres just about everything you need no holbooth scame said looking around she waved to an occasional table with an instrument on it theres a vidphone but it only serves the club im afraid she looked apologetic jerry doesnt want you calling anybody outside your attention has to be on the job he threw his holdall on the bed and sat down beside it i couldnt follow everything soma was saying what did he mean by weighted games her eyes widened you dont know much do you maybe not he said irritably thats why im asking these days the wheel is like one of those ancient secret societies she told him only bigger grander they dont just make moneythats centuries in the past the wheel opens up all kinds of routes to people but you can only get it by winning by combining chance and skill some people never even guess the possibilities are there you for instance all right scame was exasperated not liking to be told what a numbskull he was but whats a weighted game one where the wheel takes less than a fifty per cent chance of winning its just a way of showing that youre making progress that the wheel sees you as an individual not merely as one of a statistical mass the wheel likes to gamble too but its not just money thats involved not always there are other things besides money there are life experiencesthe wheel can provide those some people want to change their lives alto gether to become somebody else somebody completely different the wheel can arrange that there are techniques for changing peoples personalities giving them new abilities and opening new doors for them if you can put up the stake play and win you can choose what kind of person youll be what kind of life youll live have you ever known someone to disappear without trace it could be thats what happened to them what would the stake be in such a case scame asked tartly she shrugged or theres power its possible to win power inside the wheel a highranking position you can win influence in the wheel hierarchy in a game of chance scame was amazed its like an esoteric society she repeated on the higher circuits there are grades and degrees you gain them by winning games of greater and greater difficulty thats how rank is decided hell you could have got a long way if you really can play kabala not now though i think they want you for something special do you have to be in the wheel hierarchy already to play these games or can you come in direct from outside she smiled theoretically its possible for an outsider to become a member of the inner council just by playing one game i cant imagine that happening but people do try to gamble their way into the lower circuits we gain control of quite a few legit officials that way you have to be able to put up the stake you see you must already have power on the outside if you lose you owe that power to the wheel but if people win they invariably come over to usso we cant really lose whatever happens and the grand wheel grows bigger and bigger and bigger scame said he deliberated somberly suppose the wheel had a chance to gamble everything it has gained do you reckon theyd do it i dont know how could it happen i dont know he admitted the idea had just come to him out of the blue but the question was not meaningless centuries ago a gambling organization would not itself have been composed of gamblers it would have preyed on them today he intuited the case was different they had made a religion of the thrills of hazard and chance youve been in the wheel a long time havent you he said suddenly looking up at her all your life since i was seventeen she took a cigarro from a box on the dresser and sat on the bed with scame while she lit it blowing out a streamer of aromatic smoke i was living with a man who was an operative he brought me in as a club girl afterwards i just hung around do you think you did the right thing he looked at her curiously sure she glanced at him life can be hard outside i dont think id have what it takes to weather the knocks i wouldnt understand what i understand now the wheel teaches you that everything happens by chance its all random good or bad so nothing is really your own faultyou couldnt have done anything about it realizing that makes life easier you make it sound as if it hasnt been all that easy he said cautiously i like to think of the story of two people meeting on a bridge suppose there are two people whose lives would be transformed if they were to meet one another one day they both cross the same bridge in opposite directions its possible that they will both cross at the same moment and that something will happen to bring them together then people say they were destined for one another but thats all rubbish they could miss one another by hours by minutes or seconds or they could simply pass by without really noticing one another out of millions of potentially miraculous meetings one or two are bound to come off its the law of averages she shrugged again a trifle sourly the rest of us miss our chance some people seem to get more than their fair share of coincidences scarne pointed out theyre always meeting on bridges he paused do you believe in luck luck no it doesnt exist theres just chance people who believe in luck dont understand the laws of probability chance doesnt mean everybody gets the same everybody gets something different thats what makes games possiblethats why life is a game isnt it she gazed at him coolly probability alone ensures that there are a few who always have fortunate accidents and a few who always have unfortunate accidents then theres the great mass of us in the mediocre middle whereabouts are you scame laughed thats whats known as the bellshaped curve so jerry keeps telling me but all gamblers believe in luck he fingered his dangling necklace lady anyone can tell you it comes in runs you have to know when youre on a winning streak and when on a losing streak people still touch someone they think has luck to try to get some of it but thats probability again isnt it they learn how to predict probability she nudged him in the ribs come on professor i dont have to tell you this youre the randomatician thats just it he sighed randomaticians have never decided whether luck exists or not she had put her finger on the point of difficulty luckif it really was a separate universal entity didnt contradict probability it worked through probability mathematically no one had ever succeeded in separating themas far as he knew rumors apart it was hard too to find empirical evidence of the existence of luck he thought of thereally great players the ones who seemed to know what the cards were to intuit it to feel it without working it out was that evidence no he decided it had to be some sort of psychic perception a rudimentary new faculty luck didnt come from within it struck from outside the dazzling glances of lady lighting on only a few what fantastic power it would mean to be able to manipulate luck he thought to be able to achieve anything practically by wishing for it no wonder the legitimacy wanted it but if cadence knew anything about the new discovery she was keeping that knowledge well hidden scame believed her scornful disclaimers belief hi lady was not deeply ingrained in wheel people on the whole oddly enough legitimacy people were more inclined to believe in her she offered the hope of certainty a quality they craved it was depressing to realize how little he knew about the wheel in whose shadow he had lived for so long much of what cadence had said was new to him the wheel never took much interest in me before he said i guess im not really their type more a randomatician than a pure gambler perhaps but why do they suddenly want me now it isnt just you theyre pulling in a lot of people like you people with your kind of talent she spoke in a low guarded tone i think its something to do with the war the war what does the wheel want with the war he recalled caimans bitterness and contempt when they had seen the military officers on the earth shuttle but cadence said nothing further and scame sat brooding perhaps things werent going his way after all chapter five the cards in scarnes hand each carried two symbols a number and a geometrical figure either a triangle a square a pentagon or a sixpointed star it was the combination of the two that gave the card its valuein fact each card had three values according to the situation it found itself in there were no such things as suits neither numbers nor figures could be grouped together they had to be set off one against the other by a process of rapid mental arithmetic scarne had come across a deck similar to this one before but the game he was playing was entirely new and superbly difficult it was a game within a game a game whose rules were themselves subject to the game any player could if he held the right cards change the rules of the game his own cards his opponents cards the other players nothing could be known with certainty the rules were hierarchical each subject to others in an ascending series producing dizzying problems of strategy scarne was sweating his powers of calculation stretched to the limit the cards he was holding had just had their relative values suddenly inverted by a switch in the method of counting the past hours hard playing had been for nothing and now worse disasters were piling up the cards were mutating in his hand taking on even lower values he reached out to pick up another card from the pile but as he did so he saw that the faces of the other players were changing too becoming different personalities they placed down their cards face up left their chairs and walked away then scame noticed that bis own hand frozen over the deck was unfamiliar dark brown in color without realizing it he too had become someone else at that moment the small room faded scarne was sitting in a bucket seat in the makeout gripping two silvery rods in his hands cadence was lifting the inductor cap from his skull she rolled away the games machine i lost scame gasped hoarsely sitting behind him in the comer soma granted dont worry you wont win them all who the hell was i playing nobody you were playing a computer you did pretty well for a first game scame took out a handkerchief and wiped his brow is that game actually played here in the club played that well were being hard on you to begin with jerry soma stood up and stretched his lank form stepping across the room we have to get your measure cheyne we have to see how far you can stretch your mind he gestured to cadence she opened a wall panel and wheeled out another identity machine the machines were something new to scame soma had told him they were used for playing games whose elements transcended physical reality like the one scame had just played in other words they blotted out the physical perception of the world and replaced it with fictional constructed environments induced into the brain electrically the principle was similar to that used in dispensing mugger jackpots but soma had been circumspect when scame had asked to what extent the machines were used in the club this machine is probably the nearest we can get to that experience of yours with the jackpot soma told him the nearest i know about anyway he frowned youll lose your identity entirely so keep a cool head who will i become scarne asked apprehensively not who what before scarne could open his mouth to speak again cadence had jammed a second skullcap on his head and guided his hands to the silver bars completing the circuit for an instant scame lost consciousness when he awoke it was with only a vague recollection of his previous existence he was a number he was number as a number he was like an amoeba able to arrange himself in any pattern of which that number was capable all its factors arrays and subsets when these were arranged in columns they were like his limbs which he could put out and withdraw at will consciousness of being was really all the consciousness he had he knew that he even had a degree of rarity he was one of the few numbers to be both a square and a triangular number but he could sense in a kind of void or nullity all around him countless other numbers many of them more powerful than he with all kinds of extraordinary properties the numbers were jostling for position the game was about to begin but as number waited to discover the nature of this game he became aware of a massive presence which circled them all like a cosmic snake and he shrank back the presence was a creature of secondorder chance as such it was infinitely superior to the merely rational numbers gathering to begin play it was capable of swallowing them all and there was no escape from it this great serpent this incalculable dragon was pi a transcendental number yielding when expressed in decimal notation an infinite table of random numbers as awareness of this transcendental entity overwhelmed his own awareness experienced terror he began to disintegrate to decay like an unstable particle babbling and shaking scame felt the skullcap snatched from his head his hands were unable to let go the silver bars and gripped them compulsively as if in electric shock cadence prised them loose scame swung round in his bucket seat soma wearing the monitor cap looked stunned tearing the cap from his head the wheel man stood up and towered over scame his voice was harsh what did you think you were doing scame what happened to you in there for ladys sake i dont know i got scared scared scared of what soma seemed angry and impatient pi i got swallowed up by pi scame tried to stop shaking i was a number just an ordinary little rational number and then i met up with pi soma canned down and became thoughtful he paced the training room have you ever experienced anything like this before like being a number yes scame hesitated well as a mathematician im used to contemplating mathematical concepts like numbers trying to get inside the essence of some particular number for instance i suppose thats what the numbers identity machine does for you soma nodded it identifies your attention with a particular numberany numberbut at the same time it removes your own identity youre just left with the number he paused pi fermats use it dont they as a basis for randomness most of them in fact many fermats spend they time calculating pi indefinitely scame was alarmed by the puzzlement on somas face whats wrong wasnt i supposed to meet pi no does the machine use that number itself i believe pi plays some role in the mechanism but not in games arenathe part your mind had access to maybe theres a fault in the machine more likely your imaginations overworked soma shrugged ill have it checked over meantime well call it a day you look overwrought he glanced back as he strode from the room see he gets some rest cadence scarne rose shakily from his chair and followed cadence to a cubicle which took them back to his apartment she looked at him sympathetically as she switched on lights for him you do look bushed at that its been a harder day than i realized scame admitted i didnt sleep much last night either youd better bit the sack and dont worry you did all right thanks you did marvelously in fact she smiled glancing up and down at him and left exhausted he undressed and dropped into bed falling instantly asleep he was awakened hours later by the sound of someone moving near him the coverlet was lifted a girls naked body slipped in beside him how you feeling now cadences voice said softly better he said sleepily what are you doing here my rooms right next to yours didnt i tell you im supposed to keep you happy all part of the service i thought you were somas girl jerry no she chuckled a trifle bitterly he has other girls not like me at all her hand stroked his chest look scame said half turning to her you dont have to if you dont want suppose i do want she said impishly her hand straying lower never let it be said my hearts not in my job he reached out and ran his hand over her body she was not bad quite cute a little bit flabby not too much they pressed themselves into one anothers arms during the next few days scame continued bis training at the makeout club soma kept him off the numbers machine but he practised on the other identity machines gradually improving bis performance he was not always sure if he was engaged in pure practice runs or actual games without outside players sometimes though soma used him on club business holding the bank in intheflesh games or entering as an additional player scarne slowly learned how the grand wheel operated from the inside none of the clubs real business however seemed to warrant the process soma was putting him through it was as if scame was being tested against some other more advanced standard somas own remarks came seldom but as far as they went he seemed satisfied with scarnes progress youre more of a technician than a pure gambler he said to him once is that bad scame asked not at all it means maybe we can use you there are two kinds of players the technician and the instinctive player the guy that takes all the risks who has flair take a partnership game like bridge a technician wont give away anything but he wont bring in much either hes the main defence but he has to be complemented by an offensive player a real gambler who takes the initiative they need each other why does that mean you can use me use me for what soma makes it sound as if theyre trying to get into something he thought but the wheel already is everything the nearest soma came to giving an answer was two days later when he called scarne to his office i put in a report about what you told me happened on the jackpot he said also about the incident on the numbers machine youre to go to luna there are people there want to talk to you the mathematical cadre i guess so soma paused then looked at scame with burning black eyes all i know is im to send you to the demesne of marguerite dom youre going right to the top chapter six luna was an old quaint wellworn environment favored by the wealthy and successful everything there seemed to be hundreds of years old the sunburnished towns and cities were luxuriously ancient built in a rococo style fashionable half a millennium ago and the planets dry dead surface was crisscrossed with an antiquated tracked transport system as before scame travelled with a twoman escort the conservationistminded local government had steadfastly refused to install a modem atmosphere plant and the shuttle descended through vacuum until entering the landing bay at tycho the oldest and largest of lunas cities tycho was not their destination however they left the shuttle and walked through concourses until coming to the track station adjoining the landing bay scame found time to revel in the magnificence of the stations baroque cavernous interior which glowed in the unique lunar light falling through the high vaulted roof visiting luna always made him feel good his escort guided him through the bustling main area to where a private carriage waited on a small siding tucked away under the lower edge of the cascading roof within the carriage was plush and luxurious upholstered with purple velvet immediately they had seated themselves it surged into motion shooting through the big track tunnel cut through the wall of tycho crater and emerging onto the arid landscape beyond rapidly the terrain sped by half an hour later as the track carriage came over the lip of a range of low hills and began a descent to the plain below he caught his first glimpse of what he was assured was the private manse of marguerite dom chairman of the grand wheel most of what he saw of the manse was pure indulgence totally nonfunctional a wandering maze of gables domes and belvederes the track carriage slowed as it approached the looming manse shuffling into the shadow of an overhanging roof it coasted through an air lock and came to a stop in what appeared to be a reception foyer the carriage doors clicked back they stepped out the two wheel men with scame seemed nervous and tense this is probably their mecca scame thought an automatic glass door opened a tall negro entered the foyer his teeth flashed in a polite smile mr scame here he is said one of the wheel men delivered as per schedule the negro spoke to them pointing to a door at the further end go through there and take some refreshment you will be informed he turned to scame this way if you please scame followed him through the glass door they paused while the floor sank beneath their feet when it steadied they were standing on a circular mosaic which resembled the center of a threedimensional spiders web passages trellised arbors crooked stairways both ascending and descending radiated from it in all directions it was an architectural fancy a folly the negro tamed to him again we are ready to see you now but perhaps the journey has fatigued you would you prefer to rest to refresh yourself scarne steeled his nerve no now will be fine they walked down a corridor into the deepening silence of the rambling house finally the negro opened a timber door and entered a woodpanelled room glancing at scame to follow five men of all races and agesone of them was scarcely more than a boysat around a horseshoeshaped table a sixth place was empty while yet another chair evidently intended for scame stood in the gap of the horseshoe here he was facing the grand wheels mathematical cadre at lastand he felt like an amateur these people were all special he realized some of them prodigies probably gathered from all over maninhabited space wordlessly he lowered himself into the solitary chair aware that the interrogators were subjecting him to a chilling scrutiny the tall negro lank and selfcontrolled walked around the table and took up the vacant sixth place somehow it took scame by surprise to learn that he too was a cadre member now the negro said speaking in a deep wellmodulated voice tell us about this jackpot selfconsciously scame began slowly to repeat the account he had given to jerry soma they stopped him before he got beyond the third sentence his new listeners were of different mettle from the club manager merely verbal descriptions did not satisfy them at all they wanted mathematics the language of pure thought the inquisition became arcane almost bizarre as they forced scame to sharpen and redefine every item of bis experiences probing and testing every concept he put forward as he plunged in memory back into what had happened while he held the handles of the mugger and later while he was under the identity machine when the account was finally finished they put him to yet another examination they fired prodigious equations at him from all directions giving him but scant seconds to solve them in his head they were testing out the limits of his ability after an hour of the hardest work scarne had ever known it was over he was asked to wait in an adjoining room he left and found himself in a long narrow mustysmelling annex lined with shelves it was given a vaultlike appearance by the deep alcoves which punctuated the walls at intervals and which also contained nothing but shelves all loaded with files and papers he was apparently in some sort of illordered data library bending his ear to the door he had just closed he heard the murmur of voices he crossed to one of the shelves pulled out a file opened it and scanned its contents with frantic speed it contained a dissertation on some particularly abstruse point in randomatics replacing it he looked at another and then another this was a storeroom of papers in randomatics a kind of cellar probably of past and discarded work emanating from the cadre which was now discussing him in the next room his heart beat rapidly he dashed up and down the annex looking wildly at the shelves but there was no ordering system evident nothing to tell him where he might look to find a clue to the rumored luck equations he calmed down it was highly unlikely that any reference to the equationspresuming they existed at allwould be found here he reasoned glancing through the files he finally settled on one whose meaning at a cursory inspection baffled even him it was a prime example of rarefied speculative thought containing no explanatory text at all it might he decided keep an average mathematician guessing for a while taking a pen from his breast pocket he photographed several pages with its hidden vid recorder he was still handling the file when the door opened and the tall negro walked in calmly scarne replaced it on the shelf and turned to meet him the cadre randomatician gave no sign that he saw anything improper in scarnes behavior weve discussed your story mr scarne he said we found it quite interesting but what does it mean your experience can only have been subjective of course we think you have a type of mind which has a particularly intuitive grasp of mathematical relations the jackpot shot must have impinged on this faculty in some way inducing an hallucination its possible the incident with the identity machine would be a hangover from that in many ways you have a fortunate combination of qualities you will make a good gamesman the negro hesitated became reflective you have what we pure theoreticians lack in fact really ive always considered myself too much of a mathematician not enough of a player scarne said dubiously a faint smile came to the others lips jerry somas assessment shows you to be quite talented you may be just the type of person we are looking forbut thats by the way for now he straightened selfconsciously formal again the chairman would be pleased if you would join him at breakfast which he is about to take the invitation was so sudden that it sent a shock of anticipation through scarne yes of course i would be honored he murmured the sound of a string quartet weaving a melancholy pattern of melody was the first impression scarne received as his guide opened the door to marguerite doms breakfast room the cadre member did not follow him in scame heard the door close softly behind him he was alone with one of the most powerful menin some eyes the most powerful man in humanheld space the wheel leader rose from a wroughtiron chair one of two facing one another across a low table to greet him he wore a long soft jacket of green velvet a footlong cigarette holder dangled from one hand so pleased to meet you mr scame did you have a good journey i do hope my couriers were courteous he waved his hand causing the music to stop and pointed negligently to the table shall we be seated obediently scarne took the chair opposite the grand master doms frame was spare his height medium his sparse black hair slicked and combed back failed to cover a balding pate he had been born at a time when there had been a brief fashion for naming ones children after members of the opposite sexthough usually with ancientsounding names consequently sol was replete with middleaged male marguerites pamelas and elkas and with female arthurs yuris and dwights it so happened that dom suited his first name perfectly he was that ripe combination the thoroughly masculine camp decadent male his movements were almost feminine when he spoke an ingratiating and deceptively defensive smile was apt to come to his features and the modulations of his voice were more exaggerated than those of the average man giving the impression of a neurotic factor in his makeup although he seemed a far cry from the tough solid types who had built up the wheel centuries ago scarne needed to contemplate his face for scant moments to realize that there was only one vital difference between him and those legendary creators of the syndicate as a rule those men had not been addicted to the practices which brought them their wealth but doms face with its creases and strain lines its deep intensive eyes told scame that he belonged to a highly specific human type the compulsive gambler it was a strong face his was not a weakness or a compulsion to lose as it was with many it was a need to win a butler appeared and began serving coffee steak and eggs i hear you have some unusual tendencies dom said lightly glimpses into ultimate reality and so forth his mouth creased into a tight smile as though with nervousness or sarcasm your cadre people assure me it was hallucinatory scarne said oh they always put everything down to delusion but we know its not that simple dont we after all everything you saw is known scientifically we know that matter is constructed of waves and that these waves are waves of probability we also know that below this quantum level there is another level a level of pure randomness where no physical laws obtain the material world floats on that so to speak but then its all in the tarot isnt it dom flicked his hand a card appeared in it and he passed it to scarne scame bent his head to study the card it was number ten the wheel of fortune the card was of traditional design the upright wheel was held in a frame which was supported by boats or pontoons floating on water somewhat cursory symbolism but apt dom was saying in substance that represents the content of your first vision does it not scame felt slightly dizzy dom was right the picture on the card seemed bland and ordinaryuntil one put ones mind to work on it the wheel stood for chance as it was manifested in the physical universe in human life for instance but it floated on the waters of a greater randomness the one he had perceived in his blackout in the gaming house water symbolizes the foundation of the universe in several ancient mythologies dom continued because it is fluid and formless the ancients thought it a perfect symbol of randomness in hindu mythology the world is supported by a series of animals standing on one anothers backs all ultimately carried by a turtle swimming in an infinite sea sometimes the turtle is a fish but again swimming in the sea of chaos charming dont you think but not very scientific scame laid down the card and attempted to tackle the food he had been given feeling not at all hungry dom chuckled but what is science studying after all dont be put off by the mathematical cadre the gods are greater than sciencebut purely scientific types can never understand that all they can do is calculate you believe in the gods then not as persons of course not as actual entities it was the standard reply an educated person gave often covering up for a more primitive acceptance of the gamblers pantheon im glad youre not superstitious scarne said dom flicked his hand again producing the card numbered zero the fool do i look like one of these no scame felt awkward he was aware that dom was watching him that behind all his charm and camaraderie a cold shrewdness was at work ive gained the impression that гт being groomed for a special project he said boldly a game dom said a veiled look coming over his face were setting up a new very important game whos playing dom laughed having eaten all he could scame pushed aside his plate chairman perhaps you can clear up a conundrum for me the very same night i was introduced into the wheel i hit a mugger jackpot now ive made a simple calculation about that the odds against hitting a jackpot are high enough but the odds of its coinciding with another equally significant event do you follow me they are unbelievable the gods may as you say be greater than science but why should the gods be interested in me гm forced to the conclusion that your people rigged the mugger out of the question whatever you got you got by chance but it just doesnt make sense dom laughed again then perhaps we have learned to propitiate lady you certainly were very lucky and we do employ the very best mathematicians dom continued to chuckle and scarne made no reply he had gone as far as he dared in sounding the chairman out doms replies were meant to be cryptic of coursehe had no idea that scame had ever heard of the luck equations but his answer was a final confirmation that luck was an authentic scientific principle a universal quantityand that the wheel had derived equations that brought it within reach scarne wondered who was responsible for this awesome feat the people who had just questioned him and how was it done imagine a hightension charge of luck steered onto one individual so as to make him bit a billionstoone shot it was incredible as the butler cleared away the breakfast things dom produced a fresh tarot pack well how about a game i believe you have never played kabala kabala it was said if played properly brought about a change of consciousness in the players scame already brainweary from his interrogation found the contest with dom equally an ordeal the game required a unique combination of calculation and intuition and he was forced to think so fast to extend his mind so far that at tunes he did feel almost as though he were on some druginduced high but it was only the kind of mental exhilaration that came from prolonged effort perhaps the reward of changed consciousness came only to the winner because dom of course won two hours later the wheel master sat back silently eyes glazed drawing meditatively on his cigarette holder and blowing out puffs of smoke you play well scarne he said at length one day perhaps you will be able to beat me scame felt that he had passed the final test whatever the scheme was that was afoot he was hi it how did you like it dom murmured your first game it was taxingbut satisfying very satisfying to tell you the truth ive never been sure if i was equal to it scame in fact felt drained dom inclined his head inan abbreviated nod it sorts out the men from the boys all right if you can play kabala you can play anythingand thats an established fact thats why we need men like you dom rose pushing away his chair and stretching so that he seemed to loom over scame i want to show you something he said come with me full of anticipation scame followed dom led him to even deeper levels of the manse they went down in an elevator and then down a winding staircase to a concrete cellar the denouement was not what he had expected at one end of the cellar fed by dozens of pipes and cables and surrounded by humming machinery stood a glass tank filled either with a liquid or a dense gas it was hard to tell which it provided a murky brownishpurple environment which was inhabited by a flapping aquaticlooking shape dom stepped before the tank and gazed into it with an ironic expression the sequence of events that have led to your coming here began with the arrival in sol of this creature he told scame we call him pendragonjust a name no particular significance as for his origin it hardly matters hes been everywhere he really is travelledlike all hustlers dom was chuckling as though at some joke known to himself scame peered closer the creature resembling no it or perhaps its to represent the wheel of the galaxy as yet were not sure whether they are restricted to this galaxy only or if they actually originate from outside thats why weve tried to get pendragon to tell us something about andromeda but his knowledge of that quarter is sketchy then your game scarne said quietly is with them yes doms eyes became lustrous a game with the galactic wheelthats what this is all about with the help of pendragon we eventually made contact now were on the verge of setting something up are the hadranics anything to do with this i heard this training programme was something to do with the war dom shook his head were not interested in them were thinking on a bigger scale we arent the sort of people to stay huddled in our own little comer collecting pennies now we know whats going on out there in the wider world if this galactic wheel exists we want a piece of it i think weve got what it takes to get it how do you know you can play your way inside this galactic thing scarne asked you might just stay punters how intelligent are they how much experience have they got do you even know any of this dom moved his shoulders in a sinuous motion they could be millions of years old for all we know he admitted but weve a thousand years of experience ourselves i think were out of the kindergarten stage after all pendragon made the mistake of underestimating us he leaned closer i taught him to play kabala you know offered him his freedom if he could beat me but hes quite hopeless at it can barely play at all there was a sudden surge of movement at the back of the tank the fluid roiled and became congested a bunch of plastic plaques oblong in shape were flung towards them to splatter against the near wall of the tank spinning and tumbling in the murk displaying the colored tarot figures etched on them pendragons special pack and if this game comes off scame said what will the stakes be doms expression became veiled the hint of a smile played at the corners of his mouth that he said is the big question after scame had left for luna marguerite dom received a briefer rarer visitor historically the interview was unique though since it was held in secret it would remain unrecorded never before had a meeting taken place between the chairman of the grand wheel and the premier of the legitimacy and even now it would have seemed unthinkable to the public mind that the premier should have been the one to make the move to request the meeting and to travel to the demesne of marguerite dom dom reposed himself in his main lounge to await the premiers arrival permitting himself feelings neither of triumph nor of curiosity when premier mheert entered he found him to be a fair copy of the personality profile he had already studied a whitehaired man of about doms age with flinty blue eyes a strong prominent nose and a face that displayed an obdurate committed character they wasted no time in dispensing pleasantries mheert his subdued tone expressing how burdensome he found the necessity for his visit told dom that the war situation was grave every effort would be needed to beat back the hadranics war production would have to be expanded for this industry would have to be redirected otherwise there was a possibility of total military collapse the legitimacy regrettably did not have enough practical power to achieve the necessary rationalization too much commercial influencethe huge stock and commodity exchanges the banks the commercial houseswas under the aegis of the grand wheel to avert catastrophe therefore the legitimacy had need of an unprecedented cooperation from the wheel dom listened to this argument coolly and when the premier had finished he fitted another purple cigarette into his long holder blowing out fragrant streamers the grand wheel was not a government he pointed out and had none of the responsibilities of a government the conduct of the war was entirely and absolutely a matter for the legitimacy mheert was shocked and indignant at his refusal do you not understand the consequences we have our backs to the wall we are all in this together dom made a proposal of his own youre asking us to bail you out because you cant handle this thing on your own he said youre asking me in effect to save humanity for you all right well cooperate on the industrial sideif you can meet the price something reciprocal and condign and what is that asked mheert suspiciously the legitimacy becomes our property mheert snorted aghast you want to own mankind yes doms eyes blazed if we pull it out of the fire it belongs to us we are not for hire premier im putting you the same deal you just put to me к you want to hold off the hadranics move over it is impossible you cannot simply take over the government there would be chaos doms expression mellowed we dont want to be the government we want the legitimacy to stay on in that role the only difference will be that youll be in thrall to us youll make a secret covenant with us nobody will know about it for the present maybe not ever i dont even say well necessarily ever invoke that covenant but it will be there if we want to to destroy everything we have tried to achieve to plunge humanity into disorder superstition random activity mheert spoke with passionthe passion of a man who had spent his life trying to construct a civilization that was durable in control of itself and not subject to the contingencies of nature always the fight had been against natures tendency to disorder to chance and hazard mheert saw mankind as fighting a perpetual war against these destructive natural forcesand he saw the grand wheel as merely an extension of the same forces capitulating to them by reason of its evil philosophy and threatening any hope for the future it wont be so bad dom said boldly the basic ideology of you people is that you can build a civilization so solid that it will always be able to resist the shocks of chance thats a rigid concept and anyway it cant be done in the long run you cant go against nature any more than king canute could stop the tides we all come under the law of accident the gambler learns to live with it but the legitimacy thinks it can build a kind of seige civilization a rigidly controlled shell isolated from accident he shook his head sadly in a way he admired the legitimacy for its obstinacy but he was sure that come what may the grand wheel would outlive itjust as it had preceded it the law of accident mheert muttered ill tell you what the law of accident means it means that every plan every effort is endangered years of preparation go into some vital endeavor and then something unforeseen happens to wreck everything only if chance eventualities can be eradicated can mankind be assured of a continued existence otherwise something like this he slipped his jacket over one shoulder and pulled aside the shirt beneath displaying the surgery scars at the shoulder where the arm was grafted on you know well what these scars mean chairman dom a medicinal drug added to the water supply harmless as it was thought yet it caused an entire generation to give birth to limbless children it was years before the source of the deformities was isolated dom was indeed familiar with the scars he had them himself at shoulders and hips everyone of their age group had in that case science triumphed mheert continued thanks to legitimacy planning we were able to grow culture limbs from each victims body cells and graft them on chance was overcome but another time dom laughed sourly planning had nothing to do with it it was luck what if it had happened centuries earlier when it wasnt known how to switch off repressor genes in individual body cells then no limbs could have been grown we would have had a generation with neither arms nor legs we could still have managed with prosthetics but granted the disaster could have been worse by the law of averages some such worse disaster awaits mankind at an unspecified date in the futureunless we learn how to eliminate these accidents the war with the hadranics is itself an accident an interruption of our plans lets see you try to gamble your way out of that one doms sour smile had not left his face lets see you plan your way out of it he said the meeting proceeded little further men of diametrically opposed minds cannot discourse for long dom sat musing for a while after premier mheert departed in one sense he reflected both of them worshipped the same thing power unfettered broad and absolute power not for one moment had he expected mheert to accede to his demand even though the covenant by its nature would be virtually unenforceable but it had been worth a try a few days later dom was obliged to travel several thousand miles to the partly abandoned town of voridnov where he entered a large building so decrepit it was hard to believe it was still airtight within he paused at the head of a flight of iron stairs recovering his breath it was a long climb but tradition had to be respected all who entered the room to which the staircase gave access had to get there on their own two feethence there could be no elevator the armed vigils standing guard outside the steel door snapped to attention he put them at ease with a wave of his hand are all present yes chairman all are here he stepped forward the door responding to secret factors about his person moved ponderously aside he walked through a bare anteroom and then into the dusty sacrosanct council chamber the eyes of the eleven men seated at the large circular table turned to meet him he dom made the twelfth he took his place his eyebrows lifted in private amusement twelve men of disparate character he was thinking to himself bound together in close brotherhood hadnt that been so of another crucial time in history but no that would have to be thirteen if he dom was to regard himself as the leader and somehow he couldnt think of himself as a christ the chair grimed his clothes as he sat down everything in the council chamber was filthy it was never cleaned nobody was allowed in except for council members and that was the way it had been for centuries here in this gutted building on the nether unfashionable side of the moon to call a full meeting a consensus of four voices was necessary in this case the number had been six which meant that doms policy was being challenged he was however sure of his five assenters his eyes glittered as they roved over his comembers well gentlemen you have called this meeting as is your rightor some of you have now put your business the first to speak was the tall smooth engaging holt the business of the meeting is already known to you chairman some of us are doubtful about the coming project so and why think what we stand to lose what has the wheel come to dom said suavely as though he found it difficult to take the matter seriously are you afraid now of a little gamble in my view the odds are favorable pawarce a thickset man with hard brutal eyes took up the argument theres another angle to this caper supposing this pendragon animal is smarter than he seems it could be that we are still being hustledrailroaded into playing a game where were out of our depth this point had not escaped dom essentially he could only answer it in a pragmatic sense that is something we have to assess for ourselves as we proceed he said if we feel suspicious we can always withdraw so far i see nothing to indicate that we are being tricked safeguards can be arrangedare being arranged i believe our opponents are as interested in testing our performance as we are in testing theirs then why dont we play for smaller stakes to begin with pawarce demanded harshly they are not interested in playing for pennies dom said mildly come gentlemen life was a gamble since the first amoeba crawled up out of the slime besides if you want a better reason for abandoning your caution consider this the stakes we are putting into the game may shortly be valueless i have recently received information from the legitimacy which makes it clear that total defeat at the hands of the hadranics is an imminent possibility think of that when you tremble to risk what we have but when the argument was over minds remained unchanged attitudes had already been finned up before the meeting took place they took a vote it was six to six dom felt a sudden impatience with the dissenters go and join the legitimacy you creeping tortoises he thought build a shell round yourselves like them he rose from his place and stepped to the other side of the chamber laying his hand on the dustencrusted casing of a machine standing there the matter must move forward he said stonily everyone gazed at the machine in fascination velikosks roulette pawarce rasped in a hushed tone but that thing hasnt been used for fifty years what matter it is still in good order and there is precedence unless someone wishes to change his vote they all sat as if paralyzed with a nervous smile dom lifted a flap of metal and slapped a switch when he returned to his wroughtiron chair to which the machine was connected as it was to all the others he was calm gracefully he sat down the velikosk roulette machine hummed as it went into action a flicker of light ran round the edge of the table momentarily pausing at each man in turn hands gripped the table in unbearable nervous tension dom however was relaxed facing whatever the future might bring with practiced imperturbability faster and faster ran the ghostly nimbus then abruptly it ceased to be and the chair over which it had last flickered was empty its occupant had disappeared sucked into the gulf of pure randomness that underpinned the universe this was the fifth time dom believed that the velikosk machine had been put to the purpose of resolving differences of opinion among the council of the grand wheel until recently no one had even remotely understood how it workedvelikosk had never been able to explain it to anybody even now it was doubtful if it could be repaired should it break down in which case a tradition would die the empty chair had been pawarces i believe the vote will now prove to be six to five gentlemen dom intoned calmly shall we formalize it or would you prefer to leave it at that chapter seven at the end of its descent from the orbiting team ship the planetary lander a long gondola with a lifter engine at each end settled onto the crumbling terraces amid a skirl of dust when the air had settled the door opened hakandra followed by his constant companion shane the coldsenser stepped out this planet was not unlike the one he had recently left he thought as he looked about him dry and bleachedlooking the sky was a very pale blue as though all the real color had been seared out of it interesting how most of the planets that boreor had bornelife in the cave followed the same dehydrated pattern in this case some life still remained tough fibrous tendrils a yard thick looking like great white worms snaked out across the desert interspersed with occasional cactuslike growths intelligent life was gone but the terraces characterizing this part of the desert were regular enough to betray their artificial origin with a soft rumbling sound caermans digging machines were biting into the terraces vacuuming away the rubble to be sorted in a vibrating sieve system piles of skeletons and artifacts the output of the sieves littered the landscape team e was archeologizing the site not gently perhaps but well caerman himself a bigboned man who moved easily and energetically stepped forward to meet them he had abandoned the cloak usually worn by team leaders and wore a onepiece track suit glad you decided to drop in he welcomed cheerfully care for some refreshment hakandra replied curtly no thank you id rather get down to work okay over here he led the way to a nearby pavilion as they walked he turned to shane how do you read this place shane glanced at the yellow sun and shrugged its all right well be okay here for a while everything feels calm thats good to know ill pass the word aroundit makes me nervous seeing my men watch the sun all the tune how long since this civilization fell hakandra asked not long i estimate this city had inhabitants not more than fifty thousand years ago maybe much less and the cause caerman spread his hands looked glum theres nothing specific i can only put it down to one thing premature ecological aging a peculiar concept its one ive learned to accept since working in the cave here as in other places the whole biota went though there are still a few bits and pieces hanging on mostly cactuses the intelligent species lasted longer than any other animal life which is unusual we have reason to believe they planned to survive and were aware of the nova situation here in the cave he ushered them into the pavilion well here it is the interior of the pavilion looked like a museum or display depicting the dead civilization painted reconstructions of the natives adorned the walls they were sadlooking creatures with lizardlike skulls and bony scaly limbs but team e was less interested in their appearance than in their technology caerman led hakandra to the find that had caused him to break off his itinerary and come here the alien machine still showed signs of its long internment in the earth the metal casing though rustproof was much corroded it was shaped like a huge drum the top surface of which consisted of a flat crystalline lens which sparkled vividly but was totally opaque you say its functional all we know is that it responds to a power input until we can work out what power level and waveform it uses we wont really be in a position to say what sort of shape its in but what about its purpose caerman pointed to a thin nervouslooking man who entered the pavilion at that moment and went to speak to the technicians working on a transformer wishom here can tell you more about that hes in charge of the technical study wishom joined them nodding a greeting to hakandra and listening carefully to his questions we know these people were interested in random phenomena he said in a reedy voice it seems they were working on the problem of why stars in the cave are apt to go nova in my belief they had hoped to control the process so as to ensure their own survival they planned to stop stars going nova thats what i think shane cackled wildly they neednt have bothered they died anyway they never stood a chancenobody does in caspar caerman frowned in the sudden silence quite right he agreed quietly they neednt have bothered but they did bother right up until they realized that novae apart they were going to become extinct biologically wishom tapped the casing of the alien machine this was found in a sealed preservation chamberobviously they set considerable store by it its core is a globe of black solid material thats opaque to everything weve beamed at it we are fairly sure its a randomness machine of some sort but were reluctant to take it apart in case we cant put it back together again instead were giving it the black box treatmentgiving it inputs and seeing what comes out perhaps its only a fermat hakandra conjectured in some ways it reminds one of a fermat but theres clearly more to it than that hakandra pondered briefly im here to decide whether tills investigation should continue he told wishom in a brusque voice i can only do so if there is a significant possibility that it will be militarily useful wishom blinked by controlling the nova process exactly its a tall order wishom said doubtfully as yet i dont know of anything that would suggest the natives were close to their goal or even that they knew something we dont the scientists gaze became vague how soon do you need to decide immediately wishom snorted just then the technicians at the transformer signalled to him better stand back he advised were about to begin an experiment the transformer hummed as it fed into the alien drum a power waveform wishom had calculated the machine might use the flat crystal tabletop suddenly sparkled and blazed throwing off spears of light wishom and his technicians scarcely seemed to notice the display wishom had returned to the transformer and was busy studying the recording instruments interesting he murmured pointing out something to his helpers suddenly a yell of fear came from shane he cringed away from the glowing machine his mouth sagging open and his face white stop it he keened stop it hakandra leaped to the boy what is it shane he barked uncontrollable shane whimpered he began to drool at a gesture from caerman the transformer was switched off its hum died into a strained silence hakandra seized sbane by the shoulders peering at him anxiously is it all right now he demanded shane nodded weakly tension he muttered tension in the air in the starsbut uncontrollable uncontrollable his voice faded hakandra straightened looking first at shane and then at the machine weighing the youths words gentlemen he announced the project goes on chapter eight looking around the crowded force network platform cheyne scame decided the time had come to make a break for it he turned to one of his two escorts i have to go to the mens room he said okay well wait here the escorts seemed relaxed scame was not on probation any more the washroom was at the end of the platform near the main concourse once inside the door scame went to the visionless phone on the wall and tapped out the number magdan bad given him a womans voice answered yes pretending to stroke his cheek scame cupped his hand round his mouth to muffle his words this is professor scame he murmured im at sanfran force station i have what you want will you pick me up scame heard a click a buzz then a hum another voice which from its intonation he knew to be a computer voice spoke give me your exact location im in the washroom on platform sixteen do you have company scame paused before answering a citizen brushed by him and went out of the door two wheel heavies theyre waiting for me further up the platform lock yourself in cubicle number nine and wait there until you are contacted the phone fell silent scame went and did as he was told inside the cubicle he sat down on the pedestal feeling at once excited and weary after five minutes there came a sharp rap on the door as he opened it a slim conservatively dressed young man squeezed in quickly closing the door behind him the two of them so crowded the small space that scarne was obliged to sit again the legitimacy man towering close above him the agent opened the attache case he carried and spoke in a low voice remove your outer clothes scame obeyed clumsily the agent was impatient faster he murmured your friends will be wondering about you from the case he took fresh garments a brown striped suit and a small flat hat an item scame would normally never have worn when he had changed transferring his belongings to the new suit the agent stuffed his old garments into the case now for the face he said softly scame was obliged to sit once more while the other man pulled something soft and squishyfeeling over his head and over his face pressing it into his neck the stuff seemed to melt into his skin with a faint burning sensation opening bis eyes scame found he was being studied intently the agent tilted bis face thats good enough better than it need be in fact okay we leave now enter the main concourse by the other door so the wheel mugs dont see youget it ill be right behind you scame nodded he eased himself out of the closet in the washroom he paused to examine himself in a mirror his face was gone in place of it was a different face altogether with a different shape and a different texture it was totally convincing the hair was dif ferent too it was as if he had been given a new head coming out into the main concourse he came briefly in view of platform sixteen again and could not resist talcing a glance his wheel escorts thinking he had taken more than long enough were heading for the toilets keep going said a gruff voice behind him make for the travel cubicles fast but easy those goons are about to discover youve given them the slip and theyre liable to do something drastic scarne hurried on until they both entered a travel cubicle the agent tapped out a destination then turned to him with a knowing smile as the tiny room zipped on its way that wasnt too hard was it you can take that face off now here let me help you he placed his hands on scarnes neck and tugged there was a faint ripping sound as the mask came away scarne touched his cheeks with his fingers they were warm where are we going he asked dont worry its all being taken care of there was a holset in the corner of the cubicle scame pointed to it i want you to put me in touch with magdan whos magdan my controlleruntil recently thats the only name have for him magdan he spoke with flinty patience get him for me moving at speed through sanfrans conveyor system the cubicle jerked and swayed the agent stared at him are you crazy or something you ought to know theres no way i could do that scarne avoided his rescuers gaze hes probably right he thought the time to make his play he decided would be when he got to debriefing neither spoke further and shortly the cubicle slowed the agent tapped out another code on the address register taking them through a secret routing gate at which they speeded up again before sliding smoothly to a stop as he left the cubicle and emerged into a long corridor scame immediately felt that he had been here before this was where he had previously been briefed and addicted the walls were the same shade of green he was ushered down a passage and into a side room he also thought he remembered the furniture the layout everything a big cadaverouslooking man sat behind the desk he directed a bright dazzling light onto scarnes face sit down he ordered scame groped his way to the seat would you mind turning the light off he complained it stops me thinking properly the glare diminished a little in intensity enabling him to make out the debriefing officers enormous head been up on luna have you the mans voice was almost caressing got something for us i was at marguerite doms demesne i met the wheels top mathematicians there and they gave you the equations just like that the caress became menacing scornful scame licked his lips it wasnt so hard really i saw some secret papers i more or less have the run of the placethey think i have talent they trust me he raised his voice but i didnt make a record of them its all in my head before i tell what i know i want your part of the arrangement fulfilled i want the antidote a short explosive halfsnarl halflaugh came from the other side of the light what are you trying on scarne ill get a randomatician in here and you can talk to him laterwell well see no i wont talk i want the antidote you fool dont you know we can get anything we want out of you easier to give me the antidote he leaned forward unless im mistaken ive been in this building before you have a laboratory here somewhere take me there and give me the antidote then ill talk a whine came into his voice i havent had a dose for three days i didnt take my supply with me to luna a door opened at the back of the room a tall slender figure stood there hazy in scarnes dazzled vision then moved to just behind the debriefing officer these equations are so easy to memorize that sounds improbable no theyre not ill probably have lost most of it in a few hours if i dont write it down i dont have all of it at thatjust enough to make the case clear the newcomer sighed turning to the seated man how tiresome he is all right have his releaser brought up here and we need waste no more time scarne shook his head vigorously aware that he was whining not good enough you could give me anythingjust water his words came out in an eager rush i want to go down myself to the laboratory the same one where i was given that foul stuff i want to see the antidote in its bottle i want to see it put in the hypo then ill know its the right one how will you know гll know the tall man leaned down and switched off the spotlight you are a nuisance mr scame you are playing games with us well come along as scames eyes adjusted to the rooms normal light he saw that the second officer had a smooth round face and a long gawky neck his eyes were bright and staring like polished pebbles but his movements as he stepped towards the door to the corridor were smooth and selfassured meekly scame went with him the drugs laboratory was several levels further down confirming scames belief that he was in the secret intelligence services main center of earth operations he remembered it when he walked into it the long benches the racks of vials everything neat and tidy it was like walking into a recurring nightmare a moonfaced biochemist in a white smock came towards them smiling another customer he greeted looking scame up and down i dare say we can find him something to fit he chuckled with a disclaiming gesture scames companion explained that scame was to be normalized scame followed every word of their conversation avidly he poked into every moment of the transaction like someone who knew he would be cheated if the opportunity arose for but one instant when the vial arrived he grabbed at it reading the number pasted on it hjn he had memorized that number it had been on the bottle from which he had been addicted but what was the n n for normalization the biochemist said reassuringly the smile never left bis face it was fixed there somehow it was too easy too glib but they want the equations badly he told himself and гт not out of here yet i still have to convince them theyve got something and head back to the grand wheel only they can protect me now the dermal spray hissed into his arm how long will it take he asked only a few minutes the releaser is a related compound that forms a bipole with each molecule of the addictive substance the new compound so formed is more complicated it gives the same relief as the old drug but phases out the addiction preventing withdrawal symptoms youll feel weak perhaps slightly dizzy for a day or two then youll be as good as new now are you satisfied mr scame the sis interrogator said indignantly turning his pebble eyes on him if you would kindly step in here please he gestured to a side door through it was a small interview room he sat down placing a recorder box on the table though not as accomplished as yourself i imagine i also am a trained randomatidan he told scame would you please be good enough to give us what data you have youve made a mess of your situation scarne trying to fool us with thisjunk now youre going to have to make it back into the wheel as best you can youre on your own if you cant come up with something genuine soon theyre up there scame groaned i swear to the gods the equations are up there on luna the nightmarish vision collapsed into a jumble of vague impressions of disturbed mutterings and blank periods accompanied by nothing except nausea he awoke to find himself lying on a bench above him soared the vautled roof of sanfran station and for some moments he stared at it unable to move then with an effort he levered himself to a sitting position his head throbbing as he checked the time he noticed that he was wearing his own clothes again just over an hour had passed since he had entered the washroom on platform sixteen his body like lead he dragged himself to the nearest holbooth and soon after getting the number from the directory he was through to the makeout club cadence answered slipping into the chair across the table from him in the little holbooth room her eyes widened to see him what happened to you cheyne where have you got to jerrys furious i had a blackout scame interrupted her i dont know what happened i just woke up on a bench here in the station oh are you all right he nodded i think so the others called in to say youd disappeared theyre out looking for you now wed just about written you off this end well here i am ill find my own way to you shall i she frowned how come they didnt find you at the station did you go somewhere else ive no idea well youd better come right over here things are happening ill tell jerrydont be long now what things he started to say but she cut the connection the holroom dwindled he was back in the plastic booth staring at the scanning plate i played it all wrong at the sis center he told himself as he emerged from the booth i have other information i could have sold themabout the pendragon creature about doms galactic contacts but its too late now theyd never believe me the drug he thought suddenly it was the drug that was responsible for these mental experiencescoupled probably with the impetus given by the jackpots braincharge that item too he would file away for future reference wearily he trudged towards platform sixteen what are you some sort of brainrotted cripple soma accused harshly when scame reported to his office you want nurses or something scame was apologetic im sorry he said soma seemed unwilling or unable to give him more than a few seconds of bis attention he was ferociously busy glancing through piles of tapes and papers he had stacked on his desk handing some to an underling who incinerated them while others went back to file while he was doing this he barked orders at people who came into the office whatever it is it can be sorted out later he said were leaving word just came through the legitimacy is staging a raid on doms demesnethe bastards will be sorry for puffing a stunt like that by lady not that it makes much difference we have our plans too dom and his retinue are pulling out to chasm that includes you and me chasm scame repeated thoughtfully thats quite a way from here the legits wont be able to get their claws on us there soma said we were to have had a venue there shortly in any case weve brought our schedule forward a bit thats all is it just you and me that are going from here what about the others scarne coughed softly soma looked up he grinned wolfishly hungry for your little girl friend eh dont worry cadence is on the list tooif only to keep you happy you should be proud youre one of doms specials scame suddenly became concerned for his sis supply have i got time to pack a case dont be more than five minutes as he left cadence passed him on her way into the office and smiled nervously to see him he hurried to his apartment and collected what he needed minutes later he rejoined her soma and three other members of the makeout staff in a cubicle elevator which took them all the way to the summit of the tower city scame stepped out of the cubicle and gazed about him below the landscape was lost in a haze of distance the city itself was largely occluded from view by the roof platform only some of the wings and proturberances could be seen seemingly floating in the air beneath their feet cadence appeared at his elbow she pointed upwards here it comes right on cue he followed her gaze a small shuttlecraft was dropping out of the sky it came expertly to a stop only a few feet above the platform and hovered there while they boarded then it shot instantly back into the void heading out in ten minutes earth had shrunk to a disk seen through the passenger windows at the same time a mediumsized ship interstellar class and wheelowned came rising from luna to meet themand not just them but about a dozen other shuttlecraft that had simultaneously quit the mother planet as soon as the passengers had been transferred and the shuttles had receded again the wheel ship took its bearings in minutes it was on course for a destination fifty lightyears away somewhere in the ship as they departed marguerite dom watched a special transceiver on the holscreen an sis cruiser was descending towards his now deserted manse blowing up clouds of moondust dom his face expressionless watched as sis commandos poured from the cruiser and disappeared into the building then he leaned over to switch off the set sat back and sighed chapter nine chasm was a wheel world the only such world where the legitimacy had no vestige of authority not that the legitimacy minded that too much for chasm had but one cityalso called chasmwhich was what las vegas had once been a place wholly given to gambling and associated pleasures addicts and pleasureseekers flocked here from all over maninhabited space it was possible to arrive in chasms colorful caverns with a penny and leave a wealthy man conversely games were played here that could never have been staged elsewhere games in which irresistible prizes were balanced against the risk of serious life impairmentsdisease drug addiction decadeslong bondage the wheel ruled here there was no law except the law of wins and losses the name chasm was a descriptive one the city was carved into the sides of a deep natural abyss the only shelter the planet offered from the hundredmileper hour winds which swept its lifeless rocky surface and against which doms starship battled as it descended towards the mouth of the chasm below the gaping up the air was remarkably calm the starship rolled into a cavern in the first level of excavations just under the surface scarne disembarked to see the ship disgorging the rest of its passengers and cargo some dozens of top wheel operatives big crates of equipment he saw no sign of dom unless he was in the covered hoverlitter that hummed towards the elevator shafts and disappeared jerry soma joined him picking his way through scattered boxes and loadingtrolleys cadence in tow ever been to chasm before he asked scarne shook his head ive never been out of sol come on ill show you the town they emerged from the cavern onto a broad stone promenade about half a mile away reared chasms massive opposite wall overhead scarne saw what looked like a racing river crossing the gap it was windborne dust flowing in complicated streams and tendrils the promenade was bounded by a balustrade only waisthigh he walked to it and peered downand caught his breath the abyss simply went down and down crisscrossed with bridges that merged into a cobweblike tangle the walls glowed with colored lights soma laughed quite a sight huh scarne drew back how deep is it five miles but the city itself only goes down a mile and a half after that the air gets too thick lets take a dive he led the way to an elevator station they swooped down with sickening speedit was like being in a tower citycoming to a stop in a tiled tunnellike area passing through a proscenium arch they came out onto what was to all intents and purposes a crowded street on one side the gulf on the other an endless procession of gaudy entrances animated lightsigns and barkers cadence hung on scarnes arm as he gaped around him the sky was no more than a crack far above seen from here deep among chasms numerous levels the plummeting walls were less sheer not only were they carved and tunnelled into they also supported jutting piers daring walkways slender bridges all of which made up a seemingly rickety maze hanging over the abyss out into that abyss too floated noise and music drifting from the levels of the city above and below them chasm fulfilled its reputation it was fantastic and unique then scame gave a cry of horror look someone had fallen from one of the overhanging structures the figure came tumbling through the air narrowly missing an arched bridge limbs flailing scame saw the victims facea mansas it swept past them barely yards away eyes staring and the mouth drawn into the oh of a soundless scream then it was gone soma cackled oh youll soon get used to that it happens all the time every few minutes in fact scarne stared at him blankly but why just the natural accident rate dont look so shocked cheyne it isnt any greater than the rate for automobile accidents on mars or somewhere like that its just more visible thats all think about it chasm has a population at any average time of a third of a million people they slip off a bridge or something occasionally and then theres suicides the point is theres only one way for them to go down this narrow chasm where everybody can see them but why not have safety nets this is chasm soma answered his mouth firming come on we have to get to our quarters theres a lot to sort out they walked along the street scame had already noticed in point of fact that as on the top level all balustrades protecting pedestrians from the gulf were only waisthigh cadence seemed to notice his questioning stares she gave his arm a squeeze its like he says she told him just a normal accident rate you soon get used to it do you he wondered but people who came here he reflected had attuned themselves to the idea of risk they were looking to win some were looking to lose but other peoples losses were a matter of indifference they turned into the lobby of a hotel scarne took a last look up into the gulf far above falling fast were two small figures one a womans the other even smaller probably a childs still holding hands tipped upside down they went hurtling together towards the depths the straight flush restaurant was built on a platform extending out over emptiness giving an excellent overall view of the chasm city here while eating or whiling away his time over drinks or beverages the customer could gaze down into the everbusy gambling metropolis and protected from falling objects and bodies by a transparent sloping roof drink in the lurid scene that was like a visionarys painting of one of the minor departments of hades scame sat near the edge of the semicircular ledge sipping coffee laced with rum an extremely worried man though he had more than one problem the most pressing of them was that bis last deodorant can of sis drug would not last more than a few weeks now here in chasm the holo numbers he had been given were useless so he had no direct means of renewing his supply but he had hope there would be legitimacy agents in chasm he reasoned if they knew that dom had brought him here they might contact him during the starship journey he had come directly under doms tutelage the work was taxing therefore every fourth day was his own on these rest days he deserted cadence and tried to make himself available establishing a routine round of the city visiting one or two of the big casinos the displays and a leisurely hour or two always at the same time at the straight flush a shadow fell across him mind if i sit here a voice said scame made a vague gesture of course not his heart thumped as he studied the face of the man who sat down at the table he didnt recognize him the stranger pointed into the gulf weird isnt it some might say scary a lot different from earth or tycho scame agreed are you new to chasm yes the man leaned suddenly forward and rattled off one of scames holbooth numbers youre moving fast arent you he said whats going on scame shrugged glancing around him wondering for the thousandth time if the wheel had tabs on him marguerite dom brought me out here it wasnt my idea to stage that raid on luna that was a real hick move wasnt it based on information supplied by you the agents voice came to him in a metallic bittertasting tone but nothing was found of course not you ought to have known doms own intelligence service is good enough to tip him off about any developments of that kind hes got people everywhere hes probably better informed than you are the legitimacy agent took the sideswipe insult without overt reaction did dom bring the goods with him i dont know we figure he must have hes making this place his base the mathematical cadre is here i didnt know that scame said truthfully there had been a lot of people on the ship he saw only a few of them apparently youre quite a protege youre right close to the center im only a trainee nothings definite yet a trainee for what a games player of some sort he hesitated for one of their special clubs or something i think he couldnt do it he couldnt tell his legitimacy masters what the game really was not if his suspicions bis horrible but alltooprobable suspicions were true because he knew what the legitimacys reaction would be once they had confirmed his story indeed they would see very little choice desperate though the recourse would be chasm would be the first world to be delivered a planetbusting bomb other wheelpredominated worlds would also be destroyed in short order it was fairly certain too that the wheel would have some means of retaliating to all this and the hadranics would walk in to trample on what was left listen he said lowering his voice ive been waiting for you to contact me did you bring me a supply supply my supply the aerosols he became suddenly impatient irritable the agent chuckled mockingly youll be all right for a while yet you know the arrangement he bent his head forward glaring at scarne from beneath raised eyebrows now you listen to me all the wheel big shots are in chasm right now its a regular conventionwe reckon theyre making this the grand wheels capital were certain the data is here and the equipment to make it effective too if any exists find it youve got chasm crawling with agents scame retorted you find it the legitimacy man spread his hands you dont even have to procure it yourself you only have to lead us to it scame grimaced how can you be sure there are any there is the data you want you know it as well as we do theres no doubt at this stage the agent gave a monitory tap on the tabletop youre the man whos placed to get itso get it thats an order that comes from high up from way up and youre on the spot times running out for you isnt it scame youve got about two weeks so im told youd better hear thisnothing else is coming to you you either get released or you get nothing you really want this information bad dont you scame said the realization suddenly dawning on him thats outside your briefand mine the other answered sternly with a wave of his hand just do whats required of you scame nodded you really need it why i wonder its the war isnt it were going to lose the war unless the government can pull something out of the hat pretty soon the agent stiffened he stared at scarne in disgust youre talking crap he said the legitimacy doesnt lose wars ever back at the fivelevel hotel scarne found cadence talking with soma and others of the retinue in one of the lounges she eyed him closely as he flopped down next to her had a bad day you look wiped out this town depresses me scame said ill be glad when its time to leave he called across to soma hey jerry when are we leaving this dump whens the big game soma raised one upright finger before his face a recognized final signal no info thats what they always say hank marem another games player in doms selection group a heavily built deceptively slow lugubrious man answered scame well im as sure as hell not eager to leave yet hell he trailed off staring into his drink id like a million years before i feel ready he finished a door at the rear of the lounge opened a hush fell on the gathering as the charismatic figure of marguerite dom entered sauntering into the room the wheel bosss gaze seemed to flick over them all taking in every detail a waiter hurried up as dom casually seated himself at the table offering him a cocktail dom sipped it set it down then turned to scarne have a relaxing day scame ready for a few sessions tomorrow doms fruity and idiosyncratic slightly mocking voice was impossible to read fairly sir scame said uneasily feeling the others eyes on him doms presence was something he had learned to sense instinctively it was something he could almost smell a slightly rotting odor jolly good dom murmured we dont want to overstrain you you know hows your health i feel fine excellent the wheel master swallowed his cocktail see you tomorrow he rose and sauntered away making for the front of the hotel an eccentric confident allpowerful figure when he had gone scame breathed an inward sigh of relief though he was not altogether sure why lately he had been getting to know dom intimately he was one of doms favorites and was being groomed by him as a games partner in a kind of relationship that could only be compared with marriage scame was finding it harder and harder to shake off the mans clinging aura his combination of smooth charm and total cynicism both fascinated and repelled him scame was aware of how far he had come he was at the end of a long process of selection that had screened both wheel operatives and freelancers like himselfa process that was still going on scame predicted that marem would be dropped soon the ever more vigorous tests were finding his limitations scame however was almost certain of being included in the team that would face the galactic wheel he had only one black mark against him his supposed blackout en route to chasm he had been giv en a thorough medical check and pronounced fit the addictive substance in bis bloodstream apparently evading detection but dom had warned him that any recurrence and he would be out he wasnt interested in anybody who was liable to flake out on him scarne spent much of his time playing kabala and related games with dom he could beat him now about one time in three he had been unable to prevent a kind of perverse loyalty for dom developing in him but along with it as he became more sure of doms utter egotism and of his intentions for the coming game there was a festering hatred he was in a state of agitation when he went with cadence back to their suite she watched him her pale eyes wide as he paced the main room his face creased as if in pain cheyne what is it is it too much for you the games i thought a foretaste of disappointment clouded her features for a moment no its not that he snapped irritably he put his hand to bis forehead i cant do it alone he muttered you want me to call jerry or someone no his exasperation softened as he looked at her and saw her concern he was never sure how much of her growing attachment to him was professional and how much was due to her having genuinely fallen for him or whatever passed for that in her wheelenclosed life she was a wheel creature of course it wouldnt really be fair of him to try to divide her loyalties but there wasnt anyone else and besides as he gazed at her taking in her worn blameless face scame realized that the gamble would be worth the risk cadence was a born loser she would be almost sure to do the thing that went most against her own interests he crossed to where she sat and knelt down beside her taking her hand in his and looking at her im ploringly you know more about this place than i do he said did the mathematical cadre leave luna too they must be here he thought theyd be needed she nodded and all their material what do you mean i want to take a look at some confidential material cadence i want to do it secretly and i want you to help me her frown deepened what for she said at length then she raised her eyebrows ingenuously are you a spy desperately he squeezed her hand this game he said its got to be stopped she snatched her own hand away staring at him now in complete displeased puzzlement stopped what are you talking about its supposed to be the greatest thing thats happened for a million years ever since she had been let into the big secret in fact she had looked on her participation as a matter for personal pride cadence dont you know whats going on he climbed to his feet glowering down at her dont you know what dom is setting up hes a maniac an utterly ruthless lunatic all he wants is some ultimate gamble to satisfy his lust as a gamesman he plans to go for brokewith the whole of mankind in the center of the table were the stakeevery man woman and child alive has he told you this himself not in so many words scarne pulled a kerchief from his pocket and mopped his brow but thats what it will be all right hes so sure of himselfso sure he can win he wont care what he has to put up to stay in the gamehes made that abundantly clear and either you put up a stake the galactics want or you cant play she folded her hands in her lap staring at them if he says well win hes a fool scame told her curtly unbalanced hes going in blind without knowing anything about the galactics to speak of but it isnt just doms decision she said defensively it was the whole councils oh yes the council scame laughed bitterly theres been a purge in it recently i hear its pretty obvious the decision was by no means unanimous like all tyrants dom knows how to deal with councils he walked to the other side of the room and took a cigar from a box he lit it and sat down resting his head dejectedly on his hand puffing out clouds of violet smoke two hours later cadence said woodenly there are a lot of other excavations out back of this hotel a lot of different sorts of stuff is kept there ive seen cadre people go in and out sometimes could we get in there she shrugged i dont know probably ive been in there once with jerry its not guarded really nowhere is once you get past the hotel lobby i could just tell the legit people its in there and let them do their stuff he thought but what if its not there i wouldnt have any more credibility left how about you and me having a look around he said maybe nobody would question us if were together then seeing the fear on her face he said show me the way there anyway she stood up her shoulders bowed all right lets go scame felt a quiet but pleasureable sense of triumph cadence had gone through an emotional crisis and had come through as he had predicted he had to hand it to her she was prepared to commit treason for the sake of conscience there werent many people like that about these days or perhaps his revelations about doms stake had scared her as much as they scared him apart from that he had lied to her admitting he intended to pass information to the legitimacy while strenuously denying he was an agent all he wanted he had said was knowledge of where the impending game was to be held the government would then be able to prevent it from taking place even if dom himself cadence and everyone else involved were destroyed in the process if only it were that simple he thought wryly they met no one they knew on their walk through the hotels long carpeted corridors the place seemed quiet most people having retired early so as to be fresh in the morning soon they had left behind the inhabited sections and entered a posterior region of storerooms and larders gouged out of the bare rock hesitating only once or twice at intersections cadence led scarne to an ordinary metal door at the end of a short tunnel she stopped before going on gazing at him coolly i dont really know why im doing this she said in a calmer tone than before i just want you to know one thing what he asked i hope youre telling me the truth i belong to the wheel if doms mad we all have to be protected from him if not she didnt finish but fished in her pocket for a set of keys she carried pressing several in turn against the doors lock plate the door didnt budge she looked back at him its locked we cant get in after all here let me try he produced a cigarette lighter and pressed it against the plate flicking the switch a few times the tube glowed as it shouldbut at the same time the lock hummed as the circuits in the base of the lighter sorted through its combinations he tried the handle the door swung open cadence was staring in fascination where did you get that she asked suspiciously this scame smiled showing her the lighter never seen one of these before you can get them for a price there arent many electronic locks this wont open behind the door the rock corridor continued ending in a second door which bore no lock cautiously scame opened it they crept into a rectangular vault uttered with metalbonded crates with arched openings on all sides the place was dimly lit by glowglobes but it was not dark enough to warrant the use of the lamp scame had brought with him which way do you think he asked softly she pointed when i came with jerry we went that way to collect a games machine she looked around her i saw one of the cadre people go through that arch over there she held back as he stepped forward but why are you asking about that i thought you wanted to know the location of the game its in the form of a special code he told her the cadre has possession of it he knew his explanations were inadequate and that she was beginning to realize it he also knew he was out on a limb jumping off the board without seeing if there was any water in the pool but it didnt matter either he would be cured or he would be dead the arched opening gave onto another similar vault and so on it was a veritable maze of replicated units scame pressed forward past looming crates and enigmatic chests sometimes past uncrated machinery he had intended to bluff his way through if challenged but in fact there seemed to be no one about occasionally there were closed doors and deeper into the maze notices and directional arrows began to appear scame pulled himself up short before one door which bore no legend but instead an outline of an aquaticlooking meantalike shape the door was locked but his electronic skeleton key soon dealt with that he eased himself inside followed by cadence the chamber was smaller than the cellar of doms manse on luna but its contents were the same pendragon reposed in his murky tank surrounded by his lifesupport equipment at the sound of their entrance he stirred slightly undulating a few feet to the stickmike which he grasped in a flapperlike limb who is it a friend scarne said moving to stand squarely before the tank weve met before i dont have any friends here pendragon responded still youve already told me something about yourself you crawl cadence stayed close behind scame hanging on to his shoulder and staring wideeyed at the alien sorry if i was too familiar scarne said tell me pendragon what do you know about luck ah luck hissed pendragon that is what i do not have tell me about it scame said reasonably how do people use it where you come from pendragon flapped his extremities a gesture conveying impatience youre beginning to sound like marguerite dom he pesters me sick on the subject he paused adding thoughtfully there now is a being who has luck plenty of it he says he knows how to propitiate lady lady the goddess of luck pendragon paused again i dont believe in any gods or goddesses youd better get out of here something tells me youre trespassers the creature released the stickmike and retreated to the back of the tank cadence who had heard of the alien but never seen him before nudged scame urgently go on ask it she whispered hoarsely it will know scame decided he was wasting bis time he turned his back on the tank took cadence by the hand and led her away in the distance the hum of a machine started up they came to a series of signposts all of them cryptic mark ii store earmarked cytus components identification data scame lingered at the last and might have followed it if he had not noticed the last of the signs which bore a script written in randomatic symbols only it pointed in the direction from which the machine hum emanated he turned to cadence look you can go back if you like and put yourself in the clear i can take it from now on no she said palefaced well stick together okay forcing himself not to break into a run scame led the way the hum grew louder and then seemed to subside somewhat without warning scame found he believed what he was looking for they were suddenly on the threshold of a vault slightly different from those they had been passing through in the center of the vault several men were deep in conversation around a table a computation unit in front of each he recognized one of them as the tall negro who was a member of the mathematical cadre the faces of the others were indistinct the table was littered with papers the whole of the long wall behind them comprised a bank of machinery a huge instrument panel and a battery of smaller pieces of apparatus it was one of these that was giving off the hum as soon as he spotted the scene scame drew cadence into the cover of a pillar he was not sure if one of the attendants standing at the instrument panel had seen him he peeped out the negro rose and walked to the bank of instruments saying something to the attendant the latter began adjusting settings there was little doubt in scarnes mind that this was where the work on the luck equations was being done now was the time to withdraw he told himself he obviously couldnt gain any definite data himself for the moment but he could tell the legitimacy where to stage their raid or whatever the question was could he calm cadences doubts about him he was about to creep away when a bland computer voice spoke out of the air seemingly right into his ear you are in a restricted area do you have proper authorization yes scarne muttered state it scarne fumbled in his mind for something to say you answer the description of no authorized person the computer voice resumed please do not move someone stepped into scarnes line of view it was the black mathematician the two of them stared at one another for some moments scame turned to cadence stay here im going to talk to that man he went forward but before he had taken as much as a step unconsciousness came down on him like a curtain mocking laughter here he comes again what a clown scarne returned to awareness for the third time doms method of interrogation was swift relatively painless but the mind did tend to close down every few minutes or so he was strapped to a low table the helmlike cap on his skull attached by wires to a nearby apparatus reminded him of the skullcap of an identity machine whenever dom asked a question it delivered a braincharge making it impossible for scame either to lie or to withhold the sensation was as if his brain was being sucked out through a straw as well as dom and two whitegowned assistants cadence was also in the room but as far as he knew she had not been on the interrogation table she stood pressed against the wall ashenfaced see how easily gulled you are my dear dom told her he turned back to scame i confess to disappointment he said petulantly i was coming to look on you as a valuable partner now it transpires you are a spy and a cheat how could you do this to me cheyne scarne had already confessed that he was a legitimacy recruit set on the trail of the wheels reported ability to control luck the first part of his confession was nothing new his conversation in the ledge restaurant earlier in the day had been recorded as was nearly everything that went on in public in chasm he heaved in his bonds and groaned partly because of the helplessness of his position partly because of his humiliation in front of cadence i couldnt help it he said in a weak voice they planted an addiction on me im their creature dom leaned closer you said something this afternoon your aerosols scame nodded then let his sweatdampened head fall back on the table my supply the drug i have to take disguised as deodorant dom tutted nasty i had those aerosols opened but whatever was in them instantly denatured yes said scame closing ids eyes will they let me kill myself he wondered they must let me kill myself because otherwise its a special trick he said the aerosols are a special environment that keep the compound stable expel the drug or break them open and it straight away decomposesunless it can get into the one other environment where it can survive my bloodstream no one elses they werent using the brain charge on him now evidently thinking it unnecessary theyve got me every way he finished the compound is specific synthesized exclusively for myself dom drew back bis hands raised in astonishment his expression solicitous is that all that bothers you cheyne but why didnt you tell me how could i tell you i was stuck in the middle but i could have had you cured scame was surprised at doms ignorance this poi son is foolproof he said with a shake of his head it cant be analyzed faugh thats what they tell youtypical of them i have some excellent biochemists here theyve dealt with this kind of thing before i assure you theyll rustle up an antidote in less than twentyfour hours a surge of unbelieving hope rose in scarne he blinked and almost didnt notice the sternness with which dom then spoke turning to cadence all right you can get her out of here now she was hustled from the room a picture of demoralization dont take it out on her scame said weakly i led her into itshe wasnt willing he stopped as dom turned back to face him and loomed over bis supine form arrested by the hardness in the mans eyes what will happen to me now he asked happen doms eyes widened why you have been bad cheyne you will have to be punished he raised a hand a second door opened and before scame could say anything further he was borne helplessly away down a long rock corridor scarne was an object a rag doll a mass of raw feeling forced to spend long hours in delirium and fear the physicians who examined him beneath the glare of powerful lights never deigned to speak to him they drew blood samples in heated phials at intervals they came to him to subject him to medications which made him feverish sick and deathly cold by turns he knew that they were experimenting on him to find the right compound and despite his position this knowledge gave him hope gradually a feeling of calm began to pervade his body days later though still feeling weak and ill he walked again into the presence of marguerite dom in a small but exquisitely appointed room filled with valuable objets dart the wheel master lounged smoking in an armchair it might have been some tiny living room where an impecunious cognoscente of minor treasures had arranged his lifetimes collection though in fact it had probably been set up in a few hours scame entered receiving from dom a glance at once feral and tender sit down cheyne how are you feeling hmmm moving into the glowing lamplight scame hesitated before taking the only other chair available intimidated by the others powerful presence in this cunning miniature of a room the two of them fitted into the meticulously ordered space with an unnatural intimacy the prognosis is favorable im glad to say dom congratulated speaking softly how does it feel to be cured i ought to be half insane by now without my shot scame said it seems unbelievable but your boys have apparently pulled it off dom nodded murmuring and do you feel you can rely on me now bowing his head scame muttered a reply so it seems you should always tell me your problems whatever they may be dom went on now you are free of your slavery free of the legitimacy and we can take stock of your position anew the question is can i rely on you i am not a vengeful man but just the same you have committed a serious transgression scame did not answer dom drew on his cigarillo tm aware you were never an enthusiastic legitimacy agentindeed you failed to apprise your contact of the true nature of our project though for your information that knowledge would never have gone beyond chasm nevertheless i appreciate your reticence in that regard i have no allegiances scame said not to the legitimacy to the wheel to anything dom chuckled but to earth he responded to civilizationto mankind scarne stared at him all i need concern myself with dom continued is that you will play until your guts hang outand play to win that i am fairly confident you will do so youre pardoning me dom said nothing puffing at his cigarette holder looking enigmatic and selfcontained and what about cadence mellors scame asked silly young woman this project gave her the only chance shell ever get of getting into something big now shes finished im taking your little girl friend away cheyne as a small punishment for your treachery towards me what have you done to her packed her off to a workcamp club on one of the minor worlds its a pretty rough place im afraid shell spend the rest of her days there as a club tart until shes too old i dare say theyll end up using her as a cleaner dom sneered slightly suddenly derisive and supercilious scame clenched his fists his feelings were confused he felt a sudden surge of rage at dom for his treatment of cadence at the same tune he was filled with reliefand amazementthat dom was letting him off so lightly then it struck him doms total lack of normal feeling he felt no vindictiveness towards scame no resentment at the role he had played everything was a game to dom viewed with a slightly amused detachment there were no loyalties no recriminations none of it was the girls fault he said painfully i led her into ityou should be more lenient to her dom snorted this sort of thing is your whole weakness cheyne think straight for once here you are worrying about a club girl when the fate of worlds is at stakewhen you stand on the brink of something almost too big to imagine and not only that but at the moment when you finally found what you were looking for his eyes glistened yes cheyne a mathematical treatment of luck we have it together with a practical technique to put it to use then the mugger jackpot one of our practice shots scame sighed pondering i can make someone so lucky he hits a mugger jackpot first time dom went on or conversely so unlucky his arm drops off you make it sound like magic manipulated luck is magic more or less do you propose using it when we meet the galactic wheel is that what makes you so confident dom paused not at first he said the technique is still under development later well probably use it the important thing is that the galactics as far as we know dont have this technique we may have something completely original should they discover what youre doing they might well accuse you of cheating dom laughed of course its not cheating i never heard of a player yet who claimed it was cheating to be lucky there are all kinds of charms tokens and prayers aimed at attracting luck and no one objects to them this is the same thing but applied through scientific method perplexed scame frowned of course you disapprove of what were doing dont you dom said gently i think youre taking an insane risk good i like your attitudeit means youll do your utmost to win dom leaned across peering closely at scame yes i have your measure youll play and play as never before scame looked down at his clenched fists he felt trapped in this tiny golden room dom was righthe had him where he wanted him giving his talents to the wheel in spite of himself he would play to win because only in that way could he rescue humanity from the wheel leaders mad gamble chapter ten shane was whimpering his head down on a table already wet with his tears hakandra watched sadly aware that the boys faith in his ability had been badly eroded you shouldnt blame yourself he said inadequately youre in a new situation shane shook his head hakandra put a hand on his heaving shoulder patting it gently he gazed through the window of the tent they shared looking up into the sky he could see a star shining in the fading evening with a steady cool light in thirty years as viewed from here it would flare up and take on the vivid aspect of a nova in fact the event had already occurred thirty years might seem a fair stretch of time in local terms but when translated into stellar distances it was nothing a star had gone nova only thirty lightyears away and shane hadnt known anything about it that was the plain irreducible fact hadnt predicted it hadnt even felt it when the explosion came though he did claim to have received a sudden dramatic convulsion some hours laterprobably that was hysterical in origin hakandra thought since by then the news had already arrived over the narrowbeam selfinduced or not shane was reacting to his experienceand even more so to his failurewith a typical lack of resilience hakandra continued to watch while the youths highpitched sobs subsided into sleepy sniffles under the action of the sedative he had been given soon he fell into a drowse wishom entered the tent he glanced at shane is he all right for the moment help me get him to his couch shanes body was unresisting as they eased it to the bunk bed at one end of the tent the youth mumbled his way into a deeper sleep the scientist straightened and sighed well there doesnt seem much doubt of it he said his clipped voice holding a repressed excitement it was the machine hakandra paced the floor looking again out of the window before replying that machine caused the star to go nova wishom frowned it may be going too far to put it quite like that cause and effect isnt the correct law to apply where random effects are concerned we would have to describe it in synchronistic terms please spare me the sophistries hakandra waved his hand i want concepts we can use all right we can definitely say that the machine had something to do with it the nova coincided with that new jolt we fed in we believe the machine operated so as to raise the probability of a nova in this area my god hakandra sat down suddenly weak were playing with fire it could have been this sun and shane he trailed off thats what makes me certain the machine was responsible wishom said shane would have predicted it otherwise it isnt that the machines influence overrides shanes talentit doesnt but it produces synchronistic forces that are too wild for him to handle poor kid yes i know hakandras face creased showing the strain he was under his guilt feelings were beginning to get the better of him he was aware that they were abusing shane they were no longer using him as a safety device to predict novae but as a research tool shanes coldsenser ability picked up the probabilistic distortions emanat ing from the machine through him they could know when they were getting a response from it the effect on shane of the weird probabilityfield was cruel it was steadily destroying him hakandra was not sure how much more of it the boy could take and he himself was torn in an agonizing conflict of loyalties the need to see the work through flew right in the face of the sense of responsibility he felt towards shane yet in the end the requirements of the legitimacy came before everything the ability to trigger a nova isnt quite what were after he pointed out we want to be able to prevent them to make the cave safe for us to work in wishom gaped he had not expected to be criticized the controlled production of novae might itself be of military interest he said an enemy fleet might be lured into a position where the exploding sun would destroy it or a nova could be used as a safety screen behind which to withdraw hakandra smiled indulgently the scientist plainly had no grounding in military matters your suggestions are naive he told wishom no commander hadranic or otherwise concentrates his forces in space neither will hadranic ships get too close to any caspar sun if they can help it only if they were to set up planetary bases as we are doing would the capability prove useful seeing wishoms rueful expression he smiled again im sorry i didnt mean to be discouraging i realize youve already worked miracles i realize too that your discoveries have implications going far beyond our present situation here in caspar how much further do you think you can go its all a matter of time time hakandra tried hard not to show his gloom although the high command had now assigned him permanently to the project be felt he would have been better employed in doing what he had originally been doinghelping to set up the defensive pattern that was designed to prevent the hadranics from crossing the cave he knew by now that the chances of any immediate usefulness coming out of the alien machine were infinitesimal this latest result spectacular though it was merely demonstrated how little they understood the machine and the high commands insistence that they continue the work on the spot instead of moving the machine further back was a kind of reflex action that symptomized the legitimacys refusal to let anything go isolated though he was from the mainstream of activity hakandra still heard how things were going in the cave over the narrowbeam and the news was that there was very little time the attempted evacuation of the far side of the cave had failed when the thin defensive screen collapsed there were horrifying tales of massacre and the hadranic forces were now poised to invest caspar everything would be different hakandra said if we had more time on the bed shane muttered and whimpered chapter eleven here it comes jerry soma said he and cheyne scame were sitting in a small cocktail lounge aboard the wheel transport disk of hyke the big ship was moving into the cave of caspar as it did so it had briefly intercepted a narrowbeam transmission from one of the big military bases there the communications room was now putting through the decoded signals to anyone who cared to hear them soma hunched over the small speaker unit listening to the stream of disconnected messages much of it was machine talkone computer reporting to another but there were enough verbal messages many of them informal to tell the tale goddamn soma said almost gloating just hear it what a mess i wonder how people are talking this in solsystem scarne tendered closing their eyes to it thats how theyre taking it soma said going around in a dream the real truth wont hit them until they find themselves under siege he switched off the speaker i heard something interesting just there something about an alien randomness machine maybe well be investigating that you think the hadranics will really get across the cave sure they will then the war will really start scame spoke with difficulty the wheel ought to help instead of he tailed off instead of making matters worse was what he meant for civilization was being threatened on two sides if the hadranics didnt make mankind their property marguerite dom would gamble it away perhaps contact with the legitimacy had affected his attitudes scame thought everything seemed crazy to him now a civilization practically run by gamblers reckless enough to throw it onto the gaming table earlier he had talked the matter out with soma although contemptuous of scames newlyrevealed background he remained cordial and had been forthcoming where dom was concerned he was quite specific dom has a need for real hazard he had said it goes right to the core of his being its a mystical thing with him religion almost yes scarne recalled what dom himself had said not formal laws but hazard and contingency lay at the basis of existence therefore a life lived contingently was the true life to the legitimacy of course such an outlook was insane they were on the side of formal laws and yet dom was vindicated for here was the grand wheel setting out to meet others of like nature gamblers who controlled possibly civilizations larger and more powerful than anything mankind had seen soma noticed bis pensiveness youre looking glum cheyne he said he leered missing cadence eh youre going to have to show your worth before the chairman gives you another woman the medallion on scames lapel chimed informing him that dom wanted him he finished bis drink rose from his seat and left without another word crossing a spacious hallway he glanced at the murals depicting lady johnny diceman the queen of cups and other members of the illorganized gamblers pantheon how long he wondered before this mythical lore crystallized into a formal religion another century or two he was certain that already marguerite dom believed quite literally in the existence of these supernatural personages how did he really see the coming contest as an exercise in the worship of lady scame passed on heading for doms apartments savoring the particular atmosphere which the disk of hyke shared with no other wheel establishment he had ever visited the sense of special activity the peculiarity in the acoustics which lent every sound a feeling of echo and distance the transport was massive a private world of its own aboard were all the people dom wanted for the jaunt the mathematical cadre some council members certain technicians and of course his team of trained players events had moved suddenly word had come that the game was arranged and a time bracket set the venue came as a surprise not some place well outside mancontrolled space towards the heart of the galaxy perhaps the probable home of the galactic wheelbut the cave of caspar at the present time heavily invested by legitimacy forces the location made scarne feel uneasy no one knew the reason for it entering the section of the ship set aside as doms domain he fought to calm himself each time he was called to doms presence he found it harder to reconcile the various feeling he had for the man fascination even a certain degree of loyalty fighting with feelings of disgust and the belief that he alone was in a position to sabotage the potential disaster the door to the chairmans quarters closed behind him he was in the oddly illusory quality of doms apartments where nothing that one looked at directly was what it had seemed to be out of the comer of the eye he kept his eyes downcast not wanting to be distracted by the visual tricks to glimpse corridors that became blank walls to be attacked by colorful monsters that turned out to be stilllife paintings like all of doms domiciles the apartments had been constructed meticulously according to his personal tastes scame walked through an arrangement resembling a set of chinese boxes one room opened onto a smaller room which opened onto a yet smaller room and so on until the series ended in doms favorite interior a minute room in which all space was cunningly used and which could comfortably contain no more than two people in this case the tiny room was painted a brilliant yellow and was decorated in the style known as decadentbaroque dom smiled a welcome as scame entered ah cheyne please sit down i want to try out a new gambit i have been thinking over take up your cap will you as scame had anticipated it was to be a training session in the comer of the room stood an identity machine he sat opposite dom avoiding his eyes while he fitted on the skullcap and took hold of the silver rods completing the circuit scame was by now doms favorite partner it was certain they would be paired in any team games against the galactics as the identity machine went into operation the two of them disappeared into one of the mindgames wheel theoreticians believed most effective as training techniques together they faced a situation accessible only to abstract thought it was a game distilled to an essence consisting of basic symbols capable of being translated into a thousand real games dom was sure they would encounter something like it when they played the galactics eventually they came out of it dom removed his skullcap and sat deep in thought they had won but only because the random distribution of elements at the beginning of the game had favored them lets try it once more the chairman said im not sure scame emerged from the second round feeling tired for some minutes they discussed the new gambit then scame sighed did you hear the narrowbeam that was picked up from inside the cave he asked yes dom drawled all rather predictable there was one intriguing item though doesnt it mean anything to you scame said heatedly whats liable to happen if the hadranics break through dom raised his eyebrows really i thought it would all have become clear to you by now cheyne thats the very reason why we have to get into the game with the galactics without too much delay we may need somewhere to go scarne pondered these words the light suddenly breaking on bis understanding if the legitimacy lost to the hadranics it would mean the end of the wheels pitchpossibly the end of humanity as at present constituted the hardheaded wheel leaders did not care particularly about mankindonly about themselves and the continuation of the grand wheel contact with the galactics offered the promise of other pitches to move intoother races to set up business among perhaps or whatever was available in the ambience of the supragalactic syndicate the rats were looking ahead to the time when they might have to leave a sinking ship once again scarne felt the sinister coldness that surrounded dom the most basic of all loyaltiesspecies identitywas absent in him perhaps that loyalty had gone instead to the grand wheel you really think the legitimacy is going to lose dont you he said i wouldnt lay any bets on their winning scarne grunted and i thought you were being reckless hi fact youre hedging your bets backing both horses oh but we could lose and the legitimacy could win its still a gamble the legitimacy will win scame said savagely they have to winthey must he should as dom had pointed out have seen more clearly what the tactic was but his plain disbelief that the worst could happen had constrained him the legitimacy had always seemed so solid and immovable scame was familiar with all details of the yellow room he glanced to where an antique ormulu clock gave the time as three minutes to ten he knew that the clock signalled each hour with pleasant belllike chimes in his mind a plan that had formed several days previously reached a point of decision he came to his feet ignoring doms quizzical gaze and turned to a secretaire that occupied nearly the whole of one wall of the miniature room dom showed remarkable presence of mind he sat calmly while scame his movements only partly screened by his back opened a drawer and took out a case containing two handmade singleshot duelling pistols dom had shown the pistols to him himself when giving him a guided tour of the rooms treasures like the onnulu clock they were antiques three hundred years old and copied from weapons nearly a thousand years older scame took a single cartridge from the ammunition box he now had it in his power to kill dom outright but he had known all along that he would never bring himself to do that the second course however was acceptableand probably to both of them he loaded one of the pistols then replaced them both in their velvetlined box turning it over several times before returning to his chair placing the box on the table he removed the lid and spun the box several times he could not be sure now which of the pistols he had loaded what is this cheyne dom asked in an equable voice i want to play another game scarne said tersely a fiftyfifty game thats a read game isnt it one randomatics cant touch an even chance for both of us he swallowed only one of these pistols is loadedi dont know which take one when the clock chimes the hour we both fire dom chuckled lightly ah i understand yon want to stop me from reaching our appointment but you wish to do so with honor he paused there used to be a game not dissimilar from this called russian roulette i have heard of this version also a form of duel suitable for confined spaces i believe without hesitation he picked up one of the pistols by its curved and polished stock cocked it and pointed it at scarnes heart scame did likewise his movements heavy his muscles rigid they were sitting barely two feet apart after a brief glance at the clock scame fixed his eyes firmly on the chairmans chest the fingers stood at one minute to ten he reminded himself that while he had removed the element of skill from the encounter the luck factor remained still he did not think dom had experimented with luck recently dom was smiling his face creased in a manner that might have indicated strain or else simply amusementor more likely excitement for his part scarne could feel the blood draining from his face as the seconds ticked away on the ormulu clock but he kept the barrel of the gun levelled steadily at doms heart and a deepening silence enveloped them both in that silence the clock suddenly chimed the first of ten strokes instantly scame squeezed the trigger the hammer fell with a dull click and after that the silence became even deeper dom had not fired the chairman chuckled opening the chamber of his gun he removed the cartridge then he took scarnes weapon from his nerveless fingers and replaced both pistols in their case now he laughed wholeheartedly how interesting it seems that you owe me your life cheyne perhaps i shall have occasion to remind you of ita debt is a debt carelessly he tossed the pistol case onto the secretaire that was a stimulating experience he congratulated now cheyne i would like to try the gambit just one more time chapter twelve marguerite dom was sitting alone in his little yellow room when an urgent signal came from the bridge he switched on the chambers holbooth equipment and within a couple of seconds was holled into the ships control room his parallaxed image free to move about there they were nosing deeper into the cave of caspar waiting for a message that would tell them exactly where the rendezvous was to be so far their instructions were no more precise than that the bridge captain turned to him as his hoi image appeared the sensors have picked up a device approaching us fast sir we think its a weapon dom stepped forward then stopped at the markers on the floor that informed him of the boundaries of his yellow room he stepped back fumbling in the air until his hand closed on a control stick his image glided forward crossing the bridge and halting by the captains side from where he could view the bank of displays by which the ship was guided the oncoming object was expanding on the forward telescopic screen it was a long thin pipe hurtling through space like a spear that doesnt look legit he remarked the captain attended to an information terminal that at that moment flickered into life its just been identified as hadranic sir he said straightening an unmanned selfprogrammed missile this far back no doubt the hadranics have despatched them in droves just for nuisance value they watched as the disk of hyke carried out its own automatic defensive action its first volley of countering missiles were easily evaded by the hadranic pipe which then returned to the attack its memory locked on to the wheel ship the disk of hyke was then forced to take evasive manoeuvres of its own and finally destroyed the missile with a second volley dom sighed when it was all over for a brief time it had looked as if the outcome might be in doubt it augured ill if their wait in the cave was to be a long one we are much too exposed here he said hadranic missiles legitimacy battle fleetsand a major battle liable to begin at any moment he pursed his lips fretfully we might be well advised to get down on a planet somewhere out of harms way you are aware sir of the peculiarity attaching to stars in the cave the captain asked dom nodded indeed i cannot help thinking it is in some way connected with the choice of venue but it seems to me that the risk of being caught in a nova is not too great and certainly less than the dangers we face here in free space he turned to the navigator how close are we to that archeological team quite close sir they sent out another narrowbeam ten hours ago dom wanted if possible to get a look at the machine the earlier transmission had mentioned since the first interception had been of an allpackage beam sent from cave hq locating the planet where the machine lay done by picking up local narrowbeam traffic had proved difficult but dom was interested in any new scientific treatment of randomness especially if it came from an alien source an archeological site probably doesnt have much by way of defensive armament he decided lets go over there captain and take a look if we can do it quietly maybe we can take over for a while his parallaxed image flicked out as the captain acknowledged the order as the raiding party lunged over the arid ravaged terraces the halftracks that carried it sent up a wake of dust the grand wheel maintained no regular militia but it understood perfectly the use of force a spacetensor blanket had been thrown over the legitimacy camp to forestall a narrowbeam s and in effect the site was already in wheel hands from where he sat in the leading halftrack marguerite dom could see people emerging from their tents and staring at the approaching raiders in puzzle ment they would not have guessed yet what was afoot nor was ignorance all on their side behind dom the disk of hyke towered over the desert for twentythree decks looking more than anything like a scaledup th century riverboat most people aboard did not know yet that the ship had landed and probably would not even when it took off again so complete was the wheel transports internal life in the event the archeological camp was practically unarmed even when the wheel insignia was recognized there was little shooting doms men strode from tent to tent making a brief survey of each herding the team members into sullen groups where they looked on half resentful half perplexed half an hour later dom stepped into the tent containing the alien machine the first thing that caught his eye however was not the machine itself but a youth of about sixteen who lolled in an armchair his face slack and exhausted he paused looking the boy up and down who is this he was answered by haskand the wheel scientist he had assigned to examine the machine his name is shane sir he plays some part in the research project so young whats his specialty what does this boy do haskand asked a thin man in a white gown who stood nervously by wis horn did not answer but another man with stem steady eyes and wearing the cloak of a legitimacy official glided up to stand behind shanes chair placing a proprietary hand on his shoulder i am shanes guardian hakandra said no one answers for him but me whats wrong with him hakandra hesitated he is not well doms eyes strayed to the object of his visit the alien device the lent was crammed with modems transformers and similar equipment all of it wired up to the glistening drum ly to haskand and stepped past the two armed guards beckoning scarne to follow him they walked through the archeologists camp just beyond its bounds were fresh mounds of earth and heaps of oddlooking artifacts from the look of them though the digging and sifting machines had not been used for some time a thick layer of dust had blown over them everything scarne guessed had come to a stop because of the study of the randomness machine dom spoke his tone gloating theyre up to something he said they are trying to hide whatever it is has to do with the boy i have an instinct about himsee if im not right a wheelman climbed down from a parked halftrack and spoke quietly to dom pointing to a small yellow tent that lay not far off dom instantly made for it thats where they chief technician lives he told scame all the data is there now well really find out what theyve been doing with that gadget inside the tent one of doms people was huddled over a reading machine to which was attached a transliteration modem all around him were scattered tapes papers and coils he looked up as dom entered the legits certainly lay some store by this device theyve found sir he said theyve been working all out on it well what is it they think its able to affect probability in some way to increase or decrease it but they dont have it under control thats certain dom became very thoughtful what makes them think it can do that theres a new nova about thirty light years from here they think the machine triggered it dom sat down as if in sudden surprise well it seems they were hoping to learn how to control the nova process here in the cave as you can imagine sitting on top of a potential nova is something that drives the legits crazy dom uttered a short sharp laugh the scientist indicated the spread mass of tapes they dont really have a clue how or why it works though and objectively a chance result like a nova would be difficult to confirm these records only deal with uninterpreted responses the machine makes to specified inputs its what they use to register those responses thats interesting and probably more important he paused well go on dom murmured the legits have been developing something theyve managed to keep secret from us he stopped as a highpitched howl came from the direction of the research tent they looked at one another what was that scame said it sounded like that youth dom answered scame bolted and ran towards the sounds of torment behind him he heard doms feet pounding at a slower pace the howling had died down by the time he reached the tent he burst in to be greeted by a weird scene the alien drum was blazing throwing off an eerie light the youth shane was sprawled in his chair his face ashen mumbling into a microphone which hakandra held to his lips wishom also was bending over the boy directing questions at him in a clipped fussy voice it was like the last time shane said in faint resigned tones as if tragedy was about to break now in the next minute and couldnt be avoidedawful tragedy only nothing ever happens he struggled upright thats what it is he said contemptuously a tragedy machine only you havent got it to work right yet what dom interrupted is going on haskand sidled close to him the machine has some peculiar effect on the youngster he was in quite a state it shook me up i can tell you i knew there was something dom exclaimed softly he stepped to shane looking at him with concern poor boy he murmured then he straightened to confront hakandra and you have a considerable amount of explaining to do hakandra snapped shut his recorder to the grand wheel hardly it is you who will be called to account when this charade is over you mean when forces arrive to investigate what has happened here i presume i doubt that they will until after we have left we should be able to arrange for your usual reports to go out the scientist who had been studying wishoms data entered the tent he stared hard at shane then turned to dom this is what i was about to tell you sir the boy there is some sort of psychic sensitive he can sense probabilities with his mind when the machine goes into operation it creates some sort of field which registers with him hes their instrumentation he can sense probabilities dom echoed yes sir you mean hes a randomatician i think its a little more than that why were you brought into the cave dom asked shane to study the machine hakandra hushed the boy but he spoke up nevertheless i know when a star is about to blow he said usually anyway i give warning at least his mouth twisted wryly thats what i used to do but the nova process occurs at random here even randomaticians cant predict it for a specific star shane shrugged are there others like you dom asked after a pause a few want him dom thought the wheel had long suspected there was some such faculty in human beings gamblers and card players sometimes felt it the certainty that the next card would be a particular but it was a certainty that occurred so seldom that it was easily put down to delusion if the legitimacy really had developed it then they had a powerful weapon to use against the wheel equally it could form a valuable adjunct to wheel capabilitiessomething as useful perhaps as the luck equations why were you screaming shane twisted up his face it hurts it hurts so much my talent is like a delicate flower the machine bruises it crushes it it hurts a talent for poetry too dom murmured he faced hakandra again it is plain you have been mistreating this unfortunate youth i am taking him into my care for his own good no his face suddenly desperate hakandra clasped his arms around shane he belongs to meto the legitimacy you do not know how to behave to a tender boy you will do him permanent damage dom beckoned forward the two guards who stood by the door they tore shane from hakandras grasp this is blatant kidnapping the legitimacy official stormed you wont get away with it chairman this is something that simply wont be tolerated the glare from the randomness machine had died down dom cast one last glance at haskand before he left investigate the machine as best you can give me a daily report hakandra stood with clenched fists as he led shane away chapter thirteen now shane dom said gently lets see if you can tell me what these cards are slowly he laid cards face down on the table one after the other glancing at shane expectantly each time with a jerky movement shane grabbed up the glass of fruit juice dom had given him gulped it then pushed it away again i dont know he said indignantly he brightened tell you what pass them out and ill tell you when you come to the ace of wands all right silently dom began to transfer the deck a card at a time from his left hand to a growing pile on the table after a minute shane raised his hand there it is dom turned over the designated card it was indeed the ace of wands ah he breathed he gazed fondly at shane smiling young man you could make yourself rich shane grunted fat chance ive been a ward of the legitimacy since i was born but i have taken you away from all that dom said his voice seductive those legitimacy people have just used you for their own purposes shane i can teach you how to make your gift work for yourself they were back in the disk of hyke dom had spent the afternoon alone with shane scarne had joined them for an evening meal now he sat to one side watching while the wheel master spun out his spiel to the youth shane did not on the face of it seem either cooperative or impressionable scame did not know quite how to read him in one way he seemed totally submissive in another neurotic and fractious there was definitely something very odd about him his upbringing probably had a lot to do with it his was a naturally rebellious disposition that had learned to be malleable what was obvious was that dom was excited by his new find even more so than with the alien machine shane stretched and yawned im tired yes of course dom replied soothingly he rang a bell a valet appeared and opening a door to a small bedroom next to the lounge ushered shane into it and helped him prepare for bed dom himself slept in a more luxurious bedroom off the opposite side of the lounge after shane had retired he sat shuffling the tarot pack for some moments deep in thought at length he spoke to scame at least we have an indication now why the galactics chose to play us in the cave of caspar oh why scame asked shane explained it to me he claims the cave is deficient in luck everything is bad luck here for that reason races biotas and civilizations consistently collapse hereand stars keep exploding is that possible dom nodded luck is a cosmic quality there is no reason why it should not be more concentrated in some regions than in others i have asked my technicians to make some tests and i have no doubt that they will find that luck has a very low index here lady has deserted the place is how shane puts it presumably our opponents prefer that as a background to play against or perhaps they wish to forestall any mathematical manipulation of luck it wouldnt make any differenceive already up on the ground some distance away he watched for a while as sprays were directed onto the tent frameworks hardening to form nearly solid structures the lifts were also busy taking down crated items of equipment it looked like preparations were in hand for a long stay and more than the gaming team was to be present there were squads of armed men also probably to keep the legitimacy camp sewn up at length scarne found himself being nudged onto one of the lifting platforms and he descended to the ground at the camp he found that a small tent had been set up for him close to the pavilion structure that housed marguerite dom shane however slept in one of the partitions within the pavilion itself two hours later he watched the disk of hyke whisper up from the desert creating a brief dust shower and go soaring off to disappear into the sky after that anticlimax the first day was tense with expectation both dom and shane stayed in the pavilion and did not appear eventually however as nothing further came from the galactic wheel the atmosphere relaxed dom set up a table outside the pavilion and took his meals there inviting members of the team to join him sometimes he ventured into the legitimacy camp discussing the alien machine with haskand and wishom who seemed glad to discuss the problem with a scientist from a somewhat different cultural background with a pang of jealousy scame watched as dom paid every attention to shane cosseting him ordering special menus for him showering him with calculated affection shane accepted his favored status with a kind of smug pride he was probably used to being treated as something special scame thought but with the legitimacy it had meant extra strictness extra rigor dom was offering him the lush life then at the sunset of the fourth day everything happened at once scame was sitting in his tent when he was called into the pavilion all ten members of the games team were present shane however was nowhere to be seen the final message has just come through dom told them quietly a galactic vessel is on its way to pick us up a shiver ran through the assembled team how long almost immediately dom paused for a moment looked uncertain this isnt quite the way i wanted it i would have preferred for us to arrive at the gaming place under our own steam instead of having them pick us up but that after all is how we often handle it when we stage a game his words caused a slight stir yeah when theres a security problem someone pointed out does this suggest that the game is illegal in galactic terms doms eyes were withdrawn we have no information on that the feasibility of the game and the ability to pay up is what is relevant the sun was just vanishing below the horizon when they left the pavilion and followed dom through the camp the desert dusk was beginning to envelope everything somehow the camp looked forsaken and forlorn without the massive presence of the disk of hyke and scame looking at the back of marguerite dom ahead of him saw for the first time a fallible undefended individual man the majesty of the grand wheelthe whole interstellar edifice of gaming houses clubs personal vassalage and economic controlwas absent here was a small group of men with only their brains their naked ability to rely on all along scame had supposed that dom was too clever to have been conned by some devious alien means now he was not sure that dom himself was not a victim of his own obsessions they seemed to be walking into something arranged in a flimsy transparent manner without guarantees dom turned briefly to them we walk into the sunset we will be met scarnes doleful thoughts were suddenly interrupted by an outbreak of shouting and gunfire the camp seemed to be erupting scarne swung round trying to make sense of the chaos in the gloom two wheel halftracks were approaching fast out of the semidarkness from different directions as they entered the camps illumination he saw that in fact much of the gunfire came from them the men and women aboard were all wearing legitimacy garb and they were all armed and shooting wildly the halftracks ploughed into the ranked tents coming to a stop just short of the pavilion scame glimpsed the burly figure of caerman the archeological team leader picking off wheel personnel with a gamma rifle and be threw himself to the ground raising his head to watch the engagement with a dazed detachment in the same dazed manner he saw dom rushing back into the camp his face blazing he found time to realize that the legitimacy team had been biding their time hiding weapons and awaiting their opportunity to hit back they must have overpowered the guards at the archeological camp and seized the halftracks and now the real reason for the raid became clear running between burning tents came shane bis expression one of terror dom sprang to meet him the youth ran almost blindly into his arms close behind him came his ward the legitimacy official hakandra when he saw shane and dom together he slowed his pace to a walk but still he came on his face set a ray pistol in his hand hand the boy over dom hes mine not yours in his panic the youth seemed to be struggling in doms arms even while he sought to escape hakandra dom held him tight his arms clasped around his chest leave him be you monster he cried out in an uncharacteristically strong voice cant you see he hates you he ran from you he ran from the gunfire not from me hakandra replied coming to a stop a few yards from the pay let him go and you will see him return to me of his own accord his expression seemed to become desperate come to me shane come back home getting no response he holstered his pistol and rushed at them scame was amazed to see the two men tussle and fight for possession of the boy who began squalling and bawling like a child caerman and another legitimacy man appeared from nowhere between the three of them they wrested shane from dom who went staggering and almost lost his footing by the tune he had recovered shane was being taken at a run towards one of the halftracks marguerite scame suddenly shouted using the wheel charimans personal name for the first time look look doms eyes followed his outstretched arm a few hundred yards out in the desert a faintly glowing transparent dome or bubble had appeared the galactic ship scame shouted dom glanced back and forth hakandra was helping shane into the halftrack seconds later it roared out of the camp not back to the legitimacy site but off into the darkness of the desert the wheel master rejoined scame we mustnt miss the appointment he said frustration in his face well get shane back later there was still sporadic fighting behind them as they hurried out into the desert they heard the second halftrack start up and head back in the direction from which it had come the legitimacy people had shown commendable enterprise scame thought but he doubted that their rebellion would last very long only the element of surprise had enabled them to gain this much even though the disk of hyke had departed not until they were able to summon help from outside would they be able to overthrow their captors and they couldnt do that while the spacetensor blanket was in operation the transport the galactics had sent as scarne guessed it was looked like a glass ball fifty feet in diameter with about a quarter of its bulk apparently passing into the ground the wheelmen paused on coming to it staring up at its shimmering surface what happens now someone asked a teamster named muller ventured close to the sphere and touched it with his fingers his hand passed right through i guess this is what happens he said boldly he stepped through the wall of the sphere and stood looking at them from inside dom surveyed the gloomdarkened desert in all directions as if searching for signs of the vanished shane before he too stepped inside the fragilelooking globe silently they all followed suit passing through the pervious wall which swallowed them all without the slightest distortion in its perfect curvature the sensation was literally like passing through the wall of a soap bubbleexcept that the bubble didnt burst for some moments they all stood there in an apprehensive group gazing up at the sheen curving over their heads at the black sky towards the invisible horizon then though there was no sensation of motion it became evident that they were moving the bubble had disengaged from the surface of the planet taking with it that portion of the ground which it had enclosed and leaving a perfectly bowlshaped depression where it had rested the desert fell away they shot into the sky coming in view of the sun again and in scant seconds had passed out of the atmosphere shortly afterwards scame lost consciousness when he came round again he was still on his feet standing with the others on the dusty circle of ground the sphere had scooped out of the desert but he had the impression that a considerable period of time had elapsed the grand wheel i passed out dom said calmly did everyone else he was answered with a chorus of nods outside there was no nearby sun and they were passing through the abyss of interstellar space but now something glimmered out of that darkness they were approaching their destination at first scarne thought it was a planet drifting through space free of any sun but as they loomed closer he saw that it was in fact a planetoid only a few hundred miles in diameter and although it was lit by no sun it was not dark its surface was covered in a calm grey light by which certain features could be seen though it was hard to say what they were dark and light patches some structures perhaps small towns possibly it struck scame that most asteroids even largish ones were not as regularly shaped as the one down below he leaped to the conclusion that there was a significant artificial element in its makeup steadily gracefully the transparent sphere swept down towards their rendezvous the halftrack raced at top speed across the nearly pitchblack landscape the headlights were switched off hakandra was driving by gyro compass behind it the vehicle was covering up its tracks with vibrating brushes as it went the only other occupant was shane he had said little since hakandra had rescued him but had resumed his former sullen compliance sitting in the back of the open cab and feeling the wind rushing past his face you havent been using the machine much lately he said once only minor tests hakandra told him i didnt feel very much from it of course i wasnt so close to it hakandra made no reply he was too busy checking his course on the instruments and worrying about possible pursuit they had to get under cover quicky if they were to evade recapture after an hours drive he scanned the terrain anxiously until he saw a slight hump in the ground outlined against the faint almost absent starlight approaching it he at length stopped the halftrack and clambered down from it carrying a spade after stumbling about before a sudden rise in the ground a bank of earth about ten feet high he began digging away the dust finally he bent down and pulled at a metal ring a counterweighted canopy rose up revealing a cavern in the bank hakandra ran back to the halftrack and drove it through the opening only when he had again closed the door to the place did he switch on a handtorch and by its light then switch on some interior lighting they were in a chamber either cut into the rock or else constructed out of some kind of concrete at the rear were further passages the natives built this hakandra explained as shane climbed down its an archeological dig we sealed off months ago to stop the dust getting in he led the way through one of the rear openings to a smaller room cozily furnished with beds a table and chairs wall cupboards contained shelves of food well be all right here hakandra continued eagerly theyll never find us and we neednt come out again until its safe he sat shane down and inspected him wiping his dusty face with a damp cloth are you all right how did dom treat you better than you ever did shane answered with a shrug a look of pain crossed hakandras face you have been in the hands of evil people he said his tone urgent dont you understand the legitimacy is fighting to ward off chaos to make life safe and controllable for mankind on all sides there are threats and dangers the grand wheel is one of the worst of the grand wheel them his eyes burned into shanes we have to stand firm you see that dont you we have to do our duty shane looked away and sighed yes i suppose so he said i guess youre right for a while it looked as if life might be fun with the wheel thats all hakandra sat down suddenly very very tired he rubbed his hand over his eyes yes shane he said woodenly i expect it did chapter fourteen the lucid globe had clearly carried them a considerable number of light years scarne could see standing out against the starry galactic background a more brilliant point of light that was obviously a fairly recent nova and which had not been visible from their point of departure he took his eyes from the sky and studied the ground as the sphere fell towards it the view was so open that although the sphere contained a stable inertial frame all within it automatically put out their arms to steady themselves the globe touched ground and to scarnes mild surprise continued to sink into it until the patch of desert they stood upon made a seamless fit with the somewhat lighter soil outside what had happened to the earth the globe had presumably displaced he could not imagine muller was the first to risk leaving the space bubble when no harm came to him the others follow there was no sign of vegetation on the landscape but the air was fresh and invigorating and the gravity too approximated to earthnormalmore signs that the planetoid had been artificially modified the horizon was considerably less than a mile away its clean sharp line was interrupted in one direction by the outlines of buildings that jutted up from just beyond it where the asteroids illumination came from was a mystery their bodies cast no shadows it was as if the air itself was aglow not brightly but with a cool sterile light that had there been a moon could have been taken for moonlight dom gestured to the distant shapes thats it i imagine lets walk they kept silence while trudging across the cinderlike soil soon their destination revealed itself as a complete installation that could have been a town a fairground or any of a dozen other hypothetical sites scarne guessed it was some sort of commercial gaming area the entire planetoid in fact could have been an alien version of the gameships the grand wheel deployed on the fringes of mancontrolled space they walked between modestlysized nondescript buildings which bad a steely sheen further off scame saw a large concourse or midway lined with booths the installation appeared to be deserted the first indication of life was when a lighted sign began to flash on and off over the entrance to one of the larger buildings which had a domed roof please enter here our own language too dom remarked wryly he led the way through the arched opening and into a sort of foyer a second archway led to a spacious round chamber beneath the buildings dome there seated on a high chair with an expansive crescentshaped table at the level of his feet waited one of their hosts the creature was humanoid but considerably larger than a manwhen standing he might easily have stretched eight foot tall he wore what seemed to be a tailored suit of outlandish cut whose soft colors altered when he moved studying his toolarge face scame was struck by a fascinating fact it was not a human face the distribution and shape of the features being wrong yet it reminded him forcibly of the face of marguerite dom it was creased much as doms was and possessed the same overripe magnetism the same air of decadence and ancient toughness there too were the intensive eyes scame had first noticed on domand by an odd coincidence they were the same shade of brown dom was faced with a kindred soul please be seated the galactic wheelman said indicating the humansized chairs arranged around the table his voice was resonant rich with all kinds of strange overtones they complied dom taking the center chair once seated scame could see that the crescent of the table continued into a full circle a fact which had not been evident when they entered the chamber or was it only an illusion they seemed to be separated from the other half of the table by a semitransparent curtain behind it were vague seated shapestheir opposite numbers in the galactic team it was impossible to say whether the curtain was a real physical barrier or only a screen for some kind of projection when they were settled the seated giant spoke again it is our custom in a new session with a new client to preface the game with a short contest in the form of a general knowledge quiz agreed dom looked uncertainly at scame before answering what is the purpose of this custom to sound each other out dom hesitated agreed provided no bets are made on the outcome the winner deals first in the subsequent game or throws first depending on the nature of the game which is yet to be decided a study of randomatics reveals that an advantage lies with the dealing team very well well agree to that then we will begin there was a stir behind the curtain a gruff but well enunciated voice spoke three billion light years due galactic west lies a galaxy containing a star designated as catalogue number by the astronomers of a neighboring galaxy on the northern continent of the fourth planet of that star three mountains lie in a straight line each one hundred thousand feet in height what is the name given to the most northern of these mountains by the natives of that continent a long pause followed the question we cannot answer that dom snapped then it constitutes information impossible to know we know the voice rejoindered the name of the mountain is kzzozz it is now your turn to put a question the giant in the center of the table said dom thought and smiled on the island of britain planet earth is an inland territory known on old maps as shropshire county where there lies a small hill surmounted by a stone monument close to the ancient town of telford what is the name of that hill in the local language the name of the hill answered a second sharper voice from behind the curtain is lilleshall hill formerly lullas hill after a saxon chief the gruffer voice resumed what was the event that initiated the war between a water planet and a sulphur planet in the andromeda galaxy one million years ago but there is no way we can know these details dom protested we are being subjected to trickery there is no trickery interjected the alien in the center you satisfied yourself on that score before coming here then our opponents have mental faculties we dont it was agreed that neither side would preempt the other in that way very briefly the giant paused only in a technical sense are we in default one of our players is a psychic who is able to elicit distant though useless facts since in the game we are to play this ability offers no substantial advantage his presence is admissible the grand wheel it remains unfair as far as this contest goes dom persisted firmly we withdraw from the quiz the giant shrugged very well since we have answered one question and you have failed to answer any we have first deal we will pass on to the main business scarne could not avoid the impression that he was amused perhaps they had been playing a joke on dom the alien shifted his bulk drawing himself more erect games are of many varieties containing greater or lesser skill greater or lesser an element of chance there are board games and there are games consisting of arrays of independent abstract symbols these games create their own dimensions so to speak what are your preferences the latter dom said while the alien spoke scame had been receiving rapid mental impressions his mind was bombarded with vivid images of boards counters decks of cards and so on some kind of telepathic machine was at work the galactic wheelman was not relying on words alone to make sure his meaning got across one of the simplest of these the alien continued though one of the hardest to play employs only two symbols and offers equal probability on either of them appearing after a randomizing process the players calling bets on each result this can be done for instance by flipping a coin the process is repeated many thousands of times while the players pit their randomatic skills against each other in predicting the throws weve played it dom said confidently but we dont intend to play it here he pulled out a deck ripped off the wrapping and spread it on the table before the alien we play cards my game is kabala the aliens face bent to view the painted cards yes we have studied it he remarked we have a comparable game and i suggest it is a game of this type that we now play he pointed to a console that stood on one side of the domed chamber against the wall it was agreed during negotiations that the game could not be one in which one but not the other of the parties was versed which effectively rules out both your kabala and our game which we call constructions instead the designing machine will put together a special game for the occasion of the same type as both kabala and constructions and will teach it to us by means of mental induction the experience we have gained in the past with our respective games will thus find a natural application here he clapped his hands and looked expectantly at the console for about a minute nothing happened then a cool bright light issued from it and seemed to dart first to scarnes eyes and then into his brain he was dazzled by the light it was like having a spotlight trained on one he fancied he could feel it like something icy alive and intelligent and there formed in his mind complete knowledge of the new game it was a game using a hundred and fifty card deck as difficult and abstruse as kabala was if not more so and bore many resemblances to it scarne felt as if he had been playing it all his life he wondered how dom had satisfied himself that the galactics would not cheat it was obvious they had an impressive armory of tricks you are ready to play the seated alien asked the solmen all nodded a playing team may consist of up to four players which may reduce as the game proceeds their host continued we will therefore begin with four a side you may between rounds stand any member down and use substitutes there is a room nearby where the others can rest or else they may kibitz understood dom said ive already got my four picked out the alien moved his hand and suddenly there appeared on the table before dom an avalanche of little oblong objects in various colors they appeared to be made of some rubbery material we have agreed beforehand on the stock represented by these tokens the alien said the pile before you consists of one million units in various denominations dom nodded scame stared in fascination while dom sorted out his starting team thinking over what that pile meant he failed to understand how doms mind could encompass so gigantic and final a fact but there it was when the discarded members had retreated dom with scame sitting at his right looked questioningly at the alien the creature spoke again in a cordial tone we will play for twenty hours or until your stake is exhausted the bank cannot be brokenit is inexhaustible there is only one further point for me to mention to be able to read an opponents facial and bodily expression is held by some players to be part of the game since in this case the players are of differing biological species and are strangers to one another it would not normally be possible we have overcome this difficulty by arranging for visual translation your opponents will appear to you to be human beings and vice versa let us begin all at once the big alien disappeared together with the chair on which he had been sitting immediately following the table underwent a transformation it dwindled drawing in on itself the obscuring curtain disappeared the four men found themselves sitting at a smaller circular table just large enough to comfortably seat eight people facing them were the alien team aged perhaps between twenty and sixty scame looked at each of their faces in turn he could find nothing unusual in them they were not exactly average human beingsthey were averagelooking professional card players they were the sort of people he had been staring at over green baize tables all bis life the scene was delusively familiar even the setting was unremarkable for the architecture of the domed room was nondescript it could have been anywhere it was hard to imagine that so much hung on what would transpire between these eight players in the next few hours on the table was a deck of cards that the designing machine bad in the intervening minutes newly manufactured one of the aliens picked it up and inserted it into a shuffling machine when the shuffled deck was ejected he began dealing it round the table placing the residue in a shoe dispenser of the type used by the grand wheel scarne picked up the ten cards dealt him they were no ordinary cards some carried complicated picture symbolism like the major arcana of the tarot some of the number cards sported colored decals which responded to thought by concentrating he could change their values these shifting cards an elaboration of the principle of wild joker were a feature of the game even ones opponents could in certain circumstances change the cards in ones hand dom was straining at the leash the excitement already building up in him the game began depth after depth it was already apparent that dom had early anticipated what kind of game they would be called on to play mutating cards changing rules were features of one of the games scame had been taught at the makeout club under the identity machine but here were no machine aids everything was done by strength of mind the rules of the game were hierarchical it constructed itself as it went along in a dizzying spiral of strategy which made each round a consequence of what had gone before the objective of the game was to create a symbolic structure out of the cards according to certain definite laws there was a range of such structures each comprising a sufficient number of cards to pre clude any other similar system from being assembled from the same deck to win a team had finally to hold all the requisite cards and no others neither one too few nor one too manyand the team leader had to announce the fact without ever having seen what his partners held the calling of bets again the business of the team leader was a close combination of bluff and intention at the beginning of a round it was rarely possible to envisage the target system with any accuracy only later did the outlines of a possible structure take shape betting began modestly leaping prodigiously as events progressed controlled as much by random influences as by the will of the players cards were bought unseen for enormous sums subtle and pernicious double treble and quadruple bluffs were perpetrated total concentration was necessary only someone with complete control over bis mental faculties could hope to play a game with so many layers of complexity as the hours passed scame became oblivious of bis surroundings the symbols of the deck enveloped him seeming to constitute the only reality a new universe in which he and the other players were trapped and destined to live out their lives it was rumored that kabala could heighten ones consciousness with this game the promise was kept scame broke new mental ground his mind working with a speed he had never experienced before it was like being reborn then after seven hours dom called a break scame brought himself down to earth with difficulty it was like coming out of a trance he was covered with perspiration so he noticed was dom dom rose bowing stiffly to the other side of the table if its all the same to you i would like to play two a side from now on the alien players glanced at one another as they got the feel of the cards both sides had by common consent already reduced their teams to three the leader depicted by visual translation as young and suave nodded that suits us perfectly the solmen took themselves to a buffet on their side of the dome the aliens retreated to a corresponding facility in their half doms redundant players some of whom had been trying to follow the game gathered round dom however took a single shot of whisky and spoke only to his coplayers cheyne he said tensely you and i are going in together were in trouble scarne could not help but agree although they had won more rounds than the alienshad constructed more metaphysical systemsthe wagering was so complicated that the aliens were actually far ahead of them doms stock was already onehalf depleted two points dom told scame first we have to concentrate less on systemsbuilding as a target and more on winning sidebets they can be more important than the ultimate outcomethats something theyve tumbled to sooner than we have theyve latched onto the second point well ahead of us too the symbols involved in this deck are very potent much more so than those of the tarot its possible by means of this game to alter your opponents mentality and hence to gain control over itthe team that happens to loses everything i think theyve already started building their strategy on that and some of us have been falling for it even you cheyne scame reflected thinking over the mental changes he had been experiencing he nodded soberly i think you may be right weve got to win everything back and then some are you ready lets go scame downed his whisky and finished his bread roll then they rejoined the aliens at the table each pair of partners now faced one another and he looked briefly into doms eyes before beginning it was impossible to tell what the wheel chief was feeling des peration fascination or only pleasure in the game still it was scarnes turn to deal he sent the cards round the table ten to a hand then picked up his own and studied them the number cards the stable picture cards the inner and outer sets he suddenly felt the slight mental jolt like a missed heartbeat that meant someone was practising thoughtchange on a card with surprise he saw that it was one of his own cards that was mutating he fought back using his own control to keep the card from transforming what he thought was the object of the manoeuvre play had not begun his opponents had no clue as to the cards he held then he got the answer the galactics had no idea what the card was but they could feel his resistance they knew now that it was a card he wanted to keep unaltered once again they had stolen a small advantage with a trick that could only be used once dom led with a picture card of the outer set the card titled the infinite ray he pushed a hundred units into the stakes circle it was a bold move a direct challenge the player following tried to buy the card dom refused to sell another picture card fell down in answer to the challenge and scame sensing doms intention added to it a card of even higher value dom had set in train a process that could not be halted there accumulated on the table a collection that naturally formed the core of a target constructionindeed no suitable system could be assembled without it the struggle for possession of this package was now inevitable as usual scame had developed a rapport with dom that was almost telepathic he understood fully that the cards in the center of the table were doms gambit a decoy he had arranged while he attempted to win on the sidebets scames mind speeded up his thoughts flashing ahead to strategy and counterstrategy the possibilities were endless the deck was capable of a universe of interrelationships echoing and resonating ad infinitum the rapidity of his calculation took another leap like a starship slipping into overdrive then he discovered with a shock of fright that he could no longer see dom or the domed room or the cards in his hand a white haze surrounded him at first the haze seemed to be composed of nothing but frosty light gradually he became aware that actually there was an image in itan image that indefinitely reproduced made up the haze and was everywhere like certain holo images the image was an enigmatic pattern resembling a manic machine made up of rods and helices some of which sported glistening blobs and nodules it was the picture card known as the apparatus a card whose meaning was not entirely clear to scarne once his eyes grasped it the pattern began to move breaking apart and reforming in a variety of alternative configurations as he watched it suddenly broke open flinging itself out like an enormous disarrayed switchback and constructed a bizarre impossible landscape the terrain could not adequately be described in ordinary physical terms it had no dimensions of its own only those which emanated from the supporting framework of the apparatus the white haze a frosty fog hung over everything odd objects made from smaller rods spirals and oozing blobs emerged from and sank back into the interstices in the near distance scame saw the two galactic partners sitting in their straightbacked chairs watching him intently he knew he had to find his way out of here and back to the card table but how mentally he tried to retrace the route his thoughts had taken prior to his arriving in this place to banish the landscape but with no results cheyne the voice was doms though he could not say the grand wheel whether he heard it physically or only in his mind cheyne can you hear me yes listen carefully cheyne the symbols in this deck are extremely powerfuleven more so than those of the tarot the game has unlocked our minds the galactics are using it to create alternate realities is this part of the game yes a resultant level that they once again have realized ahead of us the cards as physical entities are redundant we are playing mind to mind is all this an illusion probably butperhaps not entirely it would be foolish to be dogmatic briefly scame seemed to see doms face in front of him struggling to emerge from the fog how do i get out of here he asked we cantnot directly we have to play doms voice faded then came back again they probably dont know were adept at this kind of thing too use the doorway technique cheyne play a card counter their realities with ours scame noticed that the chairs on which the galactics sat were gliding slowly nearer to him he sensed menace i dont know if i cannot with these cards then use the tarot the correspondence is close enoughit ought to work if we cant do it theyve got us beaten we wont be able to withstand their mental bombardment well be changed and theyll win there was silence and scame realized that dom was no longer in communication with him he was on his own scame had been taught the doorway technique as dom called it after his mind had been made more pliable by experience on the identity machine it was in fact a meditative practice employed by ancient kabalists by which one projected oneself into each card in turn identifying with it so completely that it came to life as if one had stepped through a door into the realm it represented by projecting into the cards of the major arcana one could explore various facets of the kabalistic system by projecting into the court cards one felt oneself to be glimpsing one of the four worlds of that systemthe archetypal world the creative world the formative world and the physical world by concentrating on the numbered cards of the minor arcana one gained access to worlds dominated by one or other of the four elements as understood by the ancientsfire water air and earth it was presumably some such method as this that the galactics were now using the difference being that others besides the practitioner were projected into the realities evoked scarne looked down at his hand and after a few moments was able to see the cards he had held at the table some were unique to the deck created for the game and had no correspondence in the tarot others however could easily be crossidentified he concentrated and these cards underwent mutation changing into their tarot counterparts he chose one the ace of wands root of the powers of fire he raised it before his eyes summoning up all his attention in the manner dom had taught him driving his full consciousness into the simple illustration of an upright baton round which were twined a pair of snakes something snapped in his mind the scene erected by the card apparatus vanished together with the galactic players who had invoked it he stood in the midst of a baking desert that stretched in all directions to a far horizon the air scorched his throat as he breathed overhead was a sun that sent wave after wave of heat pounding mercilessly down turning the sand into a blazing carpet he turned his head a small salamanderlike creature sat on a sunbleached stone regarding him with tiny glittering eyes as he moved towards it the animal skittered away and disappeared into the sand if this was a product of imagination then the illusion was wellmaintained scame wondered how long it would take the galactic player to answer his move after that it would be doms turn idly he took a few steps into the desert feeling the energy draining from him this was a world dominated by the element fire arid inexorable very nearly lifeless if something did not happen soon he would have to take steps to leave it suddenly a slab of sand rose up from the floor of the desert on invisible hinges creating minor cascades of shining grains from out of the relative dark stepped a scalyskinned mansized creature which stood on its hind legs and appraised scame with no sign of fear the natives head was lizardlike which gave it an air of tough but wearied desperation but its intelligence was unmistakeable scame recognized its species straight away he had seen drawings of it in the legitimacy archeological campsite he had gone back in time to the planet where the randomness machine had been found either the climate was to become more temperate in the intervening period or else he was nearer the equator in any case despite the inhospitable environment he was seeing the planet before intelligent life had quite become extinct the lizardcreatures unclothed hide shimmered like metal reflecting the glare of the brassy sky it beckoned to scame turning and retreating back beneath the raised slab into the cavity below after hesitation scame followed the slab swung down behind him he was in a murky tunnel of rock and iron after a few yards they emerged into a chamber only slightly larger than the tunnel itself in which stood the very same machine scame had last seen in the tent of the legitimacy scientist wishom now however the machine was in its original condition its metal casing gleamed and the crystalline surface sparkled even more vividly than when he had first seen it three lizardcreatures including scarnes guide were gathered round it scarne glanced in the dimness at the other equipment which crammed the chamber and to which the randomness machine was attached thick cables led through the walls to elsewhere in the underground warren why did the aliens seem so incurious about his presence he moved closer to the big drum gazing down into its scintillating depths it was hard to say just where its surface beganor if it had a surface he began to feel dizzy and drew away the native who had led him hither spoke in a voice which though hoarse and full of superfluous clicks was nevertheless intelligible the hopes your people place in our machine will be disappointed scame looked at him deciding there was no point in being surprised that the creature spoke sol amalgam the business language of maninhabited space that would not be developed for millennia yet it is not a randomness control only in a negative sense we had hoped to delay the nova process with it as you do but all it can achieve is an increase in destructiveness it can provoke novae but not prevent them come i will show you how it works he nudged scame forward scame smelled the raw leathery odor of the alien as they leaned together over the flashing drum then his senses were caught and trapped he was falling falling amid the brilliantly shining motes and he knew that he had already left the desert planet left the dominion of fire events he could not see were taking place forces were puffing and tugging at him this way and that he was being sped through realms he could no more than glimpse the bulbous full globe of a richly endowed planet swam past him cities shining and sparkling on its surface like immense jewels they were gambling cities entirely given over to the pleasures of the game in habited by people who had long ago left behind any interest in stability the planet fell astern of him into the darkness he hung over a stupendous plane light years in extent covered with the marks and signs of some gigantic pattern then that too vanished he heard marguerite doms voice again fighting to overcome whatever it was separated them and sounding fuzzy the outlines of the domed games room began to impinge on his vision where in ladys name have you been cheyne take a hold of yourself play or draw cheyne play or draw scame reached over to the dispenser and drew a card holding it close to his chest it was the wheel the wheel of fortune there was absolutely no doubt that the wheel symbol featured in the galactics game of constructions as well as in the tarot this version showed a realistic pictureprobably a photographof a wheelshaped galaxy a freak of nature that apparently really existed somewhere the rim of the wheel was wellformed joined by eight only slightly curved arms to a glowing central hub surrounding the galaxy were wavelike symbols to indicate the formless nature of space which in this case served the same symbolic function as water in the tarot version almost as soon as he looked at the card the room faded again by this time his propensity for entering into a card was automatic and irresistible the forces and scenes he had experienced after leaving the desert planet were the result of cards played by the other players sitting at the table he realized but now as when he had played the ace of wands he felt that he was temporarily transcending the game altogether leaving it because of some force innate to himself and yet he recognized it was not due simply to himself it was the game that had brought him to this point the point where he could no longer control either himself or his perceptions the galactic wheel was rotating sparkling flashing throwing off probabilities in all directions then it faded forming an allembracing background and at the same time scarnes mind cleared he could see it now the game in all its details it comprised a mathematical exercise of the highest order but it was one in which the players were as much tools of the overall scheme as were the cards he seemed to be hovering above the card table looking down on the four players two of them genuine men and two who seemed so by virtue of visual translation frozen in attitudes of secrecy and silence but the scene microcosmic though it was remained localized only briefly because the game was larger larger than the games room larger than the preformed asteroid larger than the grand wheel larger than its superior counterpart the galactic wheel larger than the chilling stakes that ostensibly were its reason detre scarne was still through the doorway of the card known as the wheel through the everexpanding field of his vision there floated billions of blazing suns billions of planets circling and wheeling in the dark he saw primeval planets newly condensed out of gas and dust building up into their long geological ages spewing forth turbulent atmospheres of volcanic fire sulphur methane and lightning the game was not abstract in some manner that even scame as a trained randomatician could not fathom it was bringing forth wholly practical consequences at an immense remove from here out of its strategies its moves and countermoves life was being evolved on a distant planet it became clear to scame that this was nearly always how life originated without it the universe would be very nearly biologically sterilethe randomness of nature gave the necessary chemical combinations a prohibitively low probability in almost every the grand wheel case it was a mathematical game played between groups of opposing intelligences that supplied the missing keyproviding not only the initial impetus but also influencing the type of life that eventually would develop surprising though it was this revelation quickly paled into insignificance for scame because the wheel card contained even more knowledge vaster and vaster became the vista he saw that there were games and players as far surpassing the galactic wheel as it surpassed the grand wheel the game he was engaged on could create a biota there were other bigger games there were games that could trigger the formation of whole galaxies on a fundamental level there were games that constructed matter and universes out of the gulf of pure randomness there was no end to it on level after level were found the hierarchies of power merging in an indefinable series into the sea of noncausation dom was rightthe gods were real they were the conscious forces that gamed and gambled in the deeper randomatic levels scame wondered if he was really meant to see all this if it was a legitimate part of the game he knew that by projecting into the card he had effectively played the card but he could not avoid the feeling that something had gone wrong and his perceptions had been carried too far then he felt himself falling there was roaring all around him he was there again he had dropped out of structured existence and back into the sea of chaos it roared all around him generating numbers and dissolving them again but he remained there only moments because the strain on his consciousness was by this time too great and it failed altogether when scame passed out the big alien who had set up the game reappeared he stepped round the table to look down at scame who had first slumped onto the table then slid to the floor scattering his cards as he went your friend has been interfered with he said to dom i detect foreign agencies in his blood dom rose from the table and walked round to frown down at scarne his enemies injected him with an addictive drug he said by way of a possible explanation but i got my biochemists to cure him they did not entirely succeed it seems the rigors of the game have caused a recurrence of its effects however i think they will prove to be temporary in view of his condition it was unwise of him to play so powerful a card one of the galactic players observed glancing at the wheel now lying face up on the table scame heard these latter words as he regained consciousness assisted by dom he got unsteadily to his feet his first impressions were the same as those he had experienced after receiving the mugger jackpot on lo everything seemed unnaturally vast the domed room was as big as a solar system the untranslated aliens face bent to regard him from its superior height seemed impossibly foreign and gigantic but this time the illusion wore off fairly quickly scame stumbled to his chair and sat down resting his head on his hand sorry about that he muttered this game at any rate would appear to be null and void the alien remarked the cards have been revealed he turned to dom since your friend would not be advised to continue perhaps you would care to select another partner you have the option of calling quits now of coursethough half your holdings would remain in our hands nowe play to the limit dom shot back a degree of passion in his voice but a different game he looked down at the disarrayed table then turned to the bulking alien i want to stake the whole of my remaining holdings on one more gamedouble the grand wheel or quits if i win we can continue if not he shrugged the alien paused reflecting and the game one without any skill in it dom seemed agitated he swallowed lets do some real gambling with stakes as high as theyll go any random fiftyfifty game will do it the toss of a coin scarne twisted round in his chair and regarded dom with horror no he was about to shout lets carry on playing at least we might have a chance but then he saw that dom by his own lights at any rate was once again right a fiftyfifty game was their best chance of coming out of this intact they were being outplayed by the galactics the two alien players were pokerfaced as the untranslated galactic considered are you agreed dom demanded a harsh note edging into his voice it would be unlike us to refuse a challenge the galactic murmured even though on present showing it removes our current advantage any limit on the bank dom queried none okay dom relaxed his shoulders slumping he was scame realized tired i want to break off first and return to my camp to freshen up toto freshen my luck и thats all right by you ah luck the alien said as if amused it is astonishing how many gamblers pay homage to the god of luck in our mythology shes a lady dom told him a goddess not a god that is because your species has maternal fixations we see the gods are more disinterested will you return alone id like to bring one other with me for company you are our guest the alien said courteously he turned his head surveying the scene as if checking for final details then i will bid you goodbye for the present before leaving why not visit our avenue of chance there are many small games there that might entertain you he held out his arm elegantly indicating the exit the grand wheel team made a subdued group as they left the domed building and emerged onto the dusty street walking with dom scarne paused to one side the interstellar travel globe could be seen just over the close horizon the concourse which he had noticed earlier and which presumably was the avenue referred to by the galactic lay a few yards away dom gazed towards it what do you think scame it might be interesting scame said his voice still none too steady no harm in taking a look dom agreed as they walked towards the entrance to the avenue scame found that his mind was still preoccupied with the wheel card he wondered if the glimpses he had received reflected real facts or whether they were only the work of the imagination invoked by the rare combination of an addictive drug his randomatic training and the tooevocative symbols of the cards he had been handling a tarot pack he recalled minutes before he played the mugger on lo probably he would never know the truth of it games theory he said aloud dom shot him a mystified look what cheyne its a problem biochemists have never solved how life manages to emerge from inanimate matter the odds are all against it in chemical terms yet it happens the biochemiststhey should study games theory is that what you learned while you were out cold on us yes if you had held that last card and not played it cheyne we might have come out well ahead on that round despite the fact that you were already losing control still it wasnt really your fault no the avenue of chance was at first sight a tawdry affair built of a material resembling canvas the booths had a makeshift appearance the party ventured diffidently into the midway then stopped as a peculiar animal or creature pushed through the front flap of the first booth and stepped out to accost them when squatting on its hind legs the creature was about four foot high it looked somewhat like a cross between a monkey and a hairless dog with a long tapering snout and narrow eyes which glittered good day gentlemen it began in a soft gruff voice try your luck at my game of chance the prize is of incalculable value scarne tried to peer past the folds that hid the interior of the booth but he failed to see anything in the dimness within dom gestured around him was all this set up just for us he asked by no means sir we tour three galaxies with our little show visiting all manner of outoftheway places step within any of you and dare the odds what is the prize scame asked curiously the animal licked its chops with a pink pointed tongue in this galaxy it is a principle of life that all creatures have but brief lifespans it is an escape from this law that i offer take a spin on my machine and you may win immortality and if we lose then your lifeforce becomes ours to use as we wish muller spoke up what are the odds a thousand to one against the creature said smoothly generous figures in the circumstances you have but a few decades to lose but you may win years measured in millions come on dom ordered abruptly lets get back to the sphere wait a minute muller looked distraught he was thinking hard ill take those odds he said he rounded on dom cutting off his angry remonstrances weve as good as lost chariman he protested this is the only way well get anything i reckon there isnt much left to lose a fateful look came over him as he lumbered towards the booth the alien rose held aside the fold of cloth to allow him to enter then followed before the cloth fell scarne glimpsed a low table with some sort of apparatus on it less than a minute later the creature reappeared and once more sat on its hind legs who else will dare to enter the presence of the gods and snatch life everlasting it was scarne realized a standard barker pattern to be used on small planet yokels wheres muller dom demanded blinking your friend did not win and so lost his small stake come now dont hesitate the great prize is still available dom shook bis head in wonderment and after all ive taught him still we dont need him any more maybe he was right another teamster said evidently much depressed lets see what else theyve got here no dom barked no more of thiswere going back to the camp dont you realize we are in the cave of casparthe luck index is low here he jerked his thumb they dont rely on lucktheyve fixed the odds in their favor i hope you manage to find some sir someone else said dom smiled but said nothing as he led than back to the transparent sphere chapter fifteen some order had been put back into the wheel camp by the time they returned the burnedout tents had been bulldozed out into the desert and those still serviceable regrouped control had been reestablished too over the camps twinthe legitimacy site a couple of miles away dom learned immediately however that hakandra and shane had both vanished and could not be found he put the matter out of his mind for the moment and made his way directly to one special tent whose interior was completely screened from the outside by a long vestibule he was met by haskand well are you ready dom asked the scientist sharply can it be done were as ready as we are likely to be then lets waste no more time there were others besides haskand in the tent a few members of the mathematical cadre and some very special technicians the cause of their presence was the three consoles that occupied the center of the tent machinery that dom believed was unique in the galaxy if not in the universe the luck equations bad not been obtained easily they had been derived after centuries of effort from the work of the wayward genius georgius velikosk unfortunately velikosk had committed little of his knowledge to record and even now wheel technicians did not understand how the single practical device he had built the velikosk roulette machine functioned nevertheless his original machine formed the basis of the apparatus that now faced domnone other had been devised capable of handling the luck equations dom sat in the straightbacked chair and let the techs tape leads to the palms of his hands he was now part of the circuit he nodded giving the signal to go ahead and relaxed he was aware that the procedure was not entirely safe there was even a small risk that the velikosk part of the equipment would inadvertently perform the only other use the wheel had ever found for it and dissipate his being drawing him down into the region of pure randomness in silence the apparatus went into operation a ghostly nimbus the same that had raced round the table from man to man at the last wheel council meeting on luna surrounded dom it seemed to everyone that an awesome numinous power entered the tent even the most hardened scientists among them were able to interpret it only one way it was the presence of lady the nimbus faded as the apparatus switched itself off the leads were detached from doms hands he rose he had been aware of no special sensation but he too had felt that presence he was satisfied that the goddess had entered into him haskand spoke deferentially you understand sir that no charge of this strength has ever been administered before it cannot be compared with any of our practice shots dom looked at him in supercilious amused fashion the way a favorite of the gods might look at a mere mortal all is clear he murmured scarne had never been told what lay within the specially guarded tent but after visiting his own quarters he had been watching curiously for dom to come out the wheel leader walked straight towards him i want you to accompany me back up to the asteroid cheyne he said id like you to be in on the final act but first lets take a little trip someone emerged from the tent where was kept the narrowbeam equipment that had been commandeered from the legit archeologists he hurried up to dom weve been getting news in the past hour sir the hadranics are massing at the far end of the cave it looks like their big push dom raised his eyebrows then this place may not be too safe shortly he remarked casually but no matter we should be away from here before anything drastic happens he pointed to the edge of the camp ushering scame in that direction and beyond the pattern of tents climbed into one of the ground cars parked there as scarne joined him he took the controls and raising the car a few yards above ground level sent it shooting out into the desert soon the camp was out of sight dom crisscrossed the terrain in wide sweeps half an hour later he settled the car down on the desert and brought it to a stop for a while the two men sat staring in silence out over the wilderness then dom twisted round in his seat to look directly at scarne why dont you do it now cheyne huh scame looked back at him with an expression half blank half of fright come come cheyne i know or at least i am almost sure that you have once again decided to kill me this time without giving me an honorable chance before i am able to play the last game is it not true that you have a weapon of some sort secreted about your person there was a long pause before scame could bring himself to reply yes he said then thickly at least wed be left with half well go ahead dom invited try to kill me why not thought cheyne wonderingly he brought forth the handgun he had picked up earlier it was a smallaperture borges beamer an ideal gun for close quarters and more commonly a womans weapon its obvious you had a reason for returning here before continuing the game he said holding the borges uncertainly what were you doing in that tent dom did not answer but continued smiling while scarne raised the beamer and pressed the stud nothing happened scame turned the gun over and opened the inspection plate the charge failed he announced peering in its burned out what are you going to do now cheyne you could try strangling me i suppose youd probably fall over and break your neck now scarnes suspicions were confirmed luck he said youve given yourself artificial luck you asked me why we came back here you knew already unless youre a fool i thought you said the technique hadnt been developed enough to be reliable weve taken it to the point where we can risk using it in an emergency it would have been better he added affably if matters had gone otherwise of course i reckon youve already badly miscalculated once over the galactics gamesmanship now youre using the luck equations when you had already decided not to use them what if it goes wrong somehow one must estimate the likely outcomes it raises an interesting conundrum can one be invested with luck and be unlucky enough to lose it scame sighed youve certainly got nerve ill say that did you bring me out here just for this little demonstration no doms eyes scanned the horizon im looking for shane hes got to be out here somewhere that legitimacy fellow hakandra is hiding him somewhere probably underground and you can find him where others couldnt im lucky he put the car in motion again and drove it on its wheels for about a mile apparently in a direction the grand wheel chosen at random then he stopped and pointed to a rise in the ground some distance away see that banka sort of hillock that could hide something its far from being a unique feature just the same i think ill get somebody to fly over that hillock and take a heat reading dom said thoughtfully he seemed satisfied he turned the car round and took it off the ground again they went skimming over the terrain back towards the camp i think ill soon have him back again he exclaimed gladly the dear boy what for scame asked in a sudden passion to make him as corrupt and evil as yourself why dont you leave him alone and give him a chance to live decently whats this my dear fellow said dom affecting surprise jealousy jealousy no no its real hatred real disgust i can see that and all based on a misconception too all because you think ive been gambling away sol civilization putting up humankind as a stake in the game well havent you scame asked puzzled why no of course not dom in high spirits was laughing at him allow me to destroy your delusions cheyne i admit i did nothing to discourage them but after all i wanted you to have an incentive to play but did i ever actually say i was putting civilization at risk the real truth is i would have done it without a qualmthe higher the stakes the more we stood to win but the galactics wouldnt accept anything we didnt actually own we would have had to be in possession of the legitimacy and that was something we couldnt obtain so it would have been like passing a dud check the galactics dont let you get away with that then what are the stakes we put up scame wanted to know the grand wheel all our tangible assets and all our influence the galactics regard it as a pitch which we operate should we lose it will become theirs they will run the grand wheel yes or do whatever it is they aim to do with it there was silence for a while except for the rush of air past the speeding car youre just as bad as i said scarne said eventually you would have done it if you could face facts we are going to win i have luck cheyne the goddess rays are blazing down on me instead of heaping recriminations on me you should be feeling relief that your fears were groundless but scarne felt himself too confused to feel such relief he no longer knew whether he could trust anything dom said the chairman did not drive back to the camp but instead put the car down near to the glassy travelglobe which was still waiting for them scame held back when dom left the car and made for it why are you taking me along in comradely fashion dom put a hand on his shoulder you are my favorite cheyne youve gone through the whole thing with me i want your moral support then he took his hand away and sighed but you may stay behind if thats what you want no scame decided ill come fearfully he walked towards the majestically shimmering sphere has it occurred to you that this planetoid is a bit tatty scarne asked dom as the sphere descended towards the coldly glowing surface it seems to mе were not too important a customer theyre handling deals like this all the time dom agreed theyre big very big doesnt that make you feel insignificant no its our way in thats all the first rung of the ladder once inside well have immortality power knowledgebut you know something about gaining knowledge already dont you eh cheyne he shot scame an enquiring glance maybe ill try a shot of that drug of yours myself with the odd disconcerting effect that caused them to brace themselves needlessly the sphere embedded itself in the earth this time they had not come down near the games village the small landscape was empty except for what appeared to be a hut just short of the horizon dom and scame trudged towards it over the cinderlike ground reaching it in five minutes or so the hut had a crode makeshift appearance it was constructed of planks of a fibrous material resembling wood and was windowless after looking it over dom knocked on the door immediately the door swung open within the hut looked more comfortable but by no means luxurious there was a table and two chairs one of them large and peculiarlooking built for something other than human that something beckoned them in from the opposite side of the table only by a considerable stretching of definitions could it have been described as humanoid it stood on two legs but these were hinged partway up a sloping body which balanced its weight by means of a thick tail as in some dinosaurs the head however lacked any kind of snout it was skulllike covered with homy grey skin and looking upon them with staring deepset eyes they entered scame closing the door behind them the air of the hut was close and stuffy with a doglike odor which scarne found unpleasant the alien took the larger chair seating himself in it with a flick of his tail which rested on a curved groove and with a surprisingly long and slender arm motioned dom to do likewise there apparently being nowhere for scame to sit he remained standing to one side the aliens head turned to regard him i am sorry he said in wellmodulated civilizedsounding tones which scarne guessed came from an artificial voicebox you will wish to sit he made a motion with a long multijointed hand some mechanism apparently responded to the signal for a part of the wall came adrift and folded itself into a serviceable straightbacked chair which crept across the floor to scarne thank you scarne sat down the galactic player turned his attention to dom he placed a deck of cards on the table our proposal is this this deck is of the same type that was used in the earlier games no two cards have the same value as you are aware we will cut for a card and play three times two winning cards out of three wins all highest takes it correct i need hardly add that these cards are specially treated against any kind of legerdemain which is superfluous in any case since they will be machineshuffled if there are to be subsequent games we can proceed by gentlemens agreement what about changecards for this game all cards are immutable the alien answered in a slightly surprised tone as though the point was obvious dom nodded slowly scarne found himself wondering not for the first time why dom seemed to trust the galactics when they were in a position to perpetrate all kinds of trickery on him but suddenly the answer came to him for decades dom had managed the grand wheel and he knew the ethics and habits by which such organizations operated the galactic wheel would not cheat himor so he believed it could scame told himself be another case of occupational delusion ever since the incident with the failed gun scarne had been feeling unwell now his head began to ache he felt as if he was stifling in the hot atmosphere of the hut hot it had not seemed hot when he entered a few minutes ago he put his hand to his brow he was feverish the grand wheel the skullheaded galactic took the deck from the shuffling machine laid it on the table and invited dom to cut as dom reached for the cards a choking pain seized scame in the chest he fell off his chair clutching the region of his heart and then passed out he must have been unconscious for only moments because when he came round dom and the alien were both helping him back onto his chair he realized he had suffered a minor heart attack he sat breathing in gasps the pain subsiding the two players returned to their places dom had already drawn a trump card the wheel one of the most powerful in the pack now the galactic cut the six of planets blearily gazing at marguerite dom in the first moments of his triumph scame was reminded of the wheel chairman as he had first met him there was the same insouciance the charm the overpowering presence the fastidiousness as to dress but within it all hidden from the casual eye there was the reptilian coldness dom was a predator on a large scale a suave intellectual giant empty of shame or any sense of guilt deftly the galactic inserted the deck in the shuffling machine again scame became aware of tingling pains in various parts of his body he put his hand to his neck the site of one of these pains a large nodule had suddenly formed there he was sprouting instant cancers the air of the hut was suffocating him he sensed that he was dying rapidly and inexplicably he forced himself to his feet excuse me he mumbled i need some fresh air dom glanced up to him i wouldnt go outside if i were you theres a lot of interstellar debris in the cave what do you mean by that dom shrugged scarne staggered to the door pushed it open and stepped outside he walked a few steps away from the hut feeling giddy and looked towards the horizon which was so close this might have been a toy planet then he looked up at the sky and if he had not done so at that moment he might never have seen it in fact he was never quite sure afterwards that he had it was no more than a glimmer a faint flash as the meteor whizzed through the planetoids shallow atmosphere the odds against it must have been billions to one the meteor fell down from space and sheared off scarnes left arm he stood staring stupidly at the bloodspouting stump then as he felt his knees buckling he turned to the door and fell back into the hut the alien rose calmly and came over to him reaching out to him with his long arms and lifting him into his chair he inspected the stump scarne felt him tie something on the flesh the bleeding has stopped the galactic announced in a thoughtful tone he added you are very unlucky yes said a dazed scame in his shock his thoughts were calm piecing it all together he could see clearly now exactly howand whydom was using him luck was not probability but it acted through probability it was so to speak quantities of probability a quantitative average throughout the universe and like any other fixed quantity it could only be concentrated or increased at the cost of a diminution elsewhere for someone to be made lucky someone else had to be made unlucky dom was using him as the negative pole of the process of attracting luck so i end up as a dupe scame thought dismally and dom charming ambitious dom wins it was the second round the galactic cut first the star blaze a reasonably good card a member of the minor superior set dom cut the neutron ring a lower card in the same set dom frowned clearly taken aback and scame suddenly began to feel physically better he looked at his severed stump the blood was coagulating with unusual rapidity sealing off the stump soon he would be able if he wished to remove the aliens tourniquet we cut once more the galactic said to the nonplussed dom he shuffled the cards in the machine scame noticed that his cancers had undergone spontaneous remission the lumps had disappeared a sense of wellbeing was flowing through him he looked at dom and saw that he had become unnaturally pale doms gaze flickered around the hut resting ferally for a moment on scame hastily he cut but did not show or look at his card motioning instead for the alien to cut for his card the galactic cut and with no outward reaction displayed his card it was the dissolver a card whose surface was made up of a closegrained tracery or hatchwork in which images formed according to how it was held and it was the highest card in the entire deck doms face became rigid as he saw the card he bent to look at his own then let it drop to the table from limp fingers it was a card called the trivia showing a single drooping flower it belonged to no set suit or grouping and was the lowest card of the deck being assigned no positive value something bad was happening to dom he tried to rise from his chair but could not as if his abdomen had congested and seized up his flesh was almost bubbling as the rogue cells of cancer attacked his body at ferocious speed his skin began to rot he was falling apart before their eyes rising scame stared down at him feeling pity but also indignation you tricked me he accused the dying man tried to sacrifice my life for your own ends from his doubledup position dom peered up at him but your life is mine cheyne he groaned you owe it to me dont you remember a debt is a debt i told you i would remind you of it remembering the duel scarne stepped back debating within himself whether dom was merely trying cynically to cover up for his treachery or whether he really did believe in such a system of morality the debate was cut off short dom gave a great groan of agony and fell from his chair neither scame nor the alien went to his assistance and while they watched his body began to disintegrate to dissolve in a few seconds not a trace of it remained he has been drawn into pure randomness the galactic told scame it is sometimes a consequence of the process he was using you knew about it the alien rose put away the cards and moved the table to one side it quickly became evident were we generous we might have warned him of the dangers of trying to force luck if it is manipulated then it is no longer luck in the proper sense it becomes a physical force involving like all physical forces action and reaction the swing of the pendulum can come swiftly his good luck turned to bad in like proportion scame observed that is why we never use any luckmanipulating process while he spoke the alien seemed to be tidying up the hut as if were preparing to leave luck is perhaps the most powerful force that exists and for that reason the most dangerous it is in fact the basic force or glue that forms entities out of the preternatural randomness probability came later what happens now scame asked your master lost therefore all holdings known as the grand wheel become ours all your gaming operations and what accrues therefrom we shall use them naturally for our own benefit will people be aware of it the grand wheel i cant say the galactic opened the door and went outside scame followed him his arm should be hurting more he thought he was scarcely aware of the ache turning to him the galactic spoke again you seem to have come out of all this rather well he said all the good luck which marguerite dom had concentrated on himself now passes to you luck is magic practically anything can be achieved with it simply by wishing scame gestured back to the hut is that going to happen to me too i would think not you didnt initiate the sequence the charge will simply seep from you gradually goodbye then use your good fortune well with a loping gait the galactic left him and set off towards the horizon scame closed his eyes simply by wishing chapter sixteen there had been changes made at the campsite when the travel globe set him down on the desert again the disk of hyke had returned accompanied by a legitimacy battlecruiser legitimacy troops patrolled both camps all wheel personnel were under armed guard as soon as he made his appearance scame was picked up he found himself facing hakandra shanes stemfaced guardian what happened to your arm the official asked glancing at the stump which now had solidified as effi ciently as if it had been cauterized scarne still felt no more than a dull ache from it i had an accident ill get a new one grafted on as soon as theres time hakandra nodded ill get someone to attend to it wheres dom hes dead probably probably what do you mean by that hes dead scame said with finality i see well well take a full statement from you later we already know something of why the wheel came to the cave illicit contacts with an alien race were you a party to that not really dom kept it to himself its over now anyway scame wanted if possible to extricate himself from the whole question of galactic involvement otherwise he would never be free of the legitimacy the sis would want a report out of him too he would have to try to convince them that the luck equations didnt work doms demise was probably a chilling enough lesson hakandra was speaking again youve heard the latest news were going to have to leave here there have been major losses in the big battle at the far end of the cave the positions weve set up wont hold the hadranics back now theyll sweep through the cave and into our star arm he looked grave and distraught pityingly he looked at shane who sat in the comer of the tent the two were hardly ever separated all our work here has been for nothing what about the randomness machine well take it with us but it cant be of any use to us now it can help you make another test run with it the legitimacy official looked at him closely what do you know about it i know something you havent discovered the right settings for it thats all how to control it he hesitated i met the people who built it when i was up onwhere we went the grand wheel youre talking nonsense scame shrugged hakandra turned to shane what are they doing with the machine now i dont know on a sudden decision hakandra marched over to the laboratory tent within there was the desultory air of a project that has failed but is still officially operational scame saw haskand the wheel scientist talking to wishom his legitimacy counterpart what are these settings wishom asked him when hakandra had made representations for him but scarne didnt know in a technical sense he understood nothing of the machine and the equipment the research team was using on it he walked up to the control rig and beckoned shane to him put the power through he told the technicians ill make the adjustments its not safe hakandra snapped wishom waved his hand why not weve been working in the dark he cant do anything more risky than we did if he does something silly ill simply cut off the power he nodded to scame i expect youre a lunatic but what do you think haskand where is the chairman haskand demanded sharply of scame scame gave him a hard look i have what you gave him he said quietly it took a moment for haskand to absorb that then he nodded thoughtfully its bis field in a sense lets see what happens scame drew shane close to him i want you to help me he said softly tell me when it feels right you know what i mean no i dont why are you so vague you have to use hard data scame ignored the legitimacy jargon as the generator began to hum he held his intended image clearly in mind and manipulated the controls at random powerlevel waveform a web of energy flowed into the alien machine shane neither moaned screamed or doubled up as was his wont during these experiments that feels different from before he informed wonderingly sort of smooth its flowing flowing where shane flowing outout there shane waved his hands over his head unsure of what he meant scarne sent his fingers over the switches again shane frowned then gave a grimace of pain no thats all wrong that wont work he complained well lets see scarne once more amended the controls with a glimmering of an idea what to aim for this time and then it struck home to him too he knew he had hit it and lady was hovering over him smiling down on him her hand on his shoulder he closed his eyes thank you lady he whispered its there shane murmured his eyes were withdrawn concentrating on the feeling inside him thats it its beautiful it works it works wishom queried in a cracked voice rushing up to them what works whats happening youll find out in a few hours scame said he saw no point in explaining it it sounded too fantastic even he would eagerly await the reports to make sure he hadnt simply imagined the picture that had blazed in his mind when the machine hit its resonant level suns exploding thousands of suns every single sun at the far end of the cave had gone nova with luck a good part of the assembled hadranic forces would be caught in the holocaust at any rate the hadranics would now regard the cave as too dangerous to operate in and therefore it was effectively impassable eventually they would overcome their caution or else find another attack route but the legitimacy now had a valuable breathing space later perhaps he the grand wheel would explode more suns perhaps all the suns in the cave if that was he had not already used up all his luck in such a titanic act he exulted it was like being a god oneself then he checked himself remembering the hubris that had brought about the downfall of marguerite dom chairman of the grand wheel which was now under new management lady had dealt mankind a new hand he reflected he wondered what difference it was going to make to civilization now that the galactic wheel held all its gambling concessions and it came into his mind that the people who really knew about the luck deity did not see it as a smiling woman but as a male figure stem and retributive that could make a difference too he turned to hakandra theres another kind of machine in one of the wheel tents he said i dont suppose youll take any notice but if i were you id have it destroyed oh why is that scame smiled theres too much luck attached to it chapter seventeen marguerite doms sojourn in the gulf of randomness was not an eternity of chaos as it turned out like everything else he kept bubbling to the surface of it reforming melting and dissolving again finding himself in little regions of stability finding himself to be a wandering ghost in the foglike limbo a mote in the foaming sea of nullity or something incomprehensible in some other of its aspects he never felt as if he had been there long not even when someone plucked at his sleeve and he turned to come face to face with an old colleague were not really here you know pawarce told him looking round himself shiftily nobody exists hereexcept ghosts like us how long have you been here dom asked there isnt any time here a million years maybe his face was ugly as he looked at dom im glad you ended up here too it serves you damned well right dom moved away but pawarce followed him hanging onto his arm and leaning close he pointed see that marguerite over there dom followed his finger in the mist so faint he wasnt sure if he saw it or not was an arch like a faded rainbow what is it up there where real things exist people play games well not people exactly beings cleverer than us sometimes when they play new worlds and universes are formed sometimes you can walk into them ive been waiting a long time to see if that one would form now its ready but we have to go now or it will separate do you see it marguerite a new world a chance to start over somewhere else to exist again dom hung back what will it be like pawarce pulled a face who knows till we get there thats right who knows together they walked towards the dimly shining arch chapter eighteen it was only a small mugger in a cheap bar cheyne scarne was thumbing in coins and winning winning winning his luck was draining away by weeks days hours but still it was fun he smiled wryly as the sparks came up and the tokens came tinkling out of the pay slot a small dapper man came up to him say how do you do that luck he turned away from the machine unwilling to get into conversation and sat down at a table near the bar curiously he never won jackpots jackpots werent really good luck they changed the recipients life not always for the better it amused him too to think that his winnings were paid out by the galactic wheel now were the subject probably of accounts at the center of the galaxy so far though there had been no outward sign of the galactics takeover and he had been unable to prise anything out of the wheel men he knew what would happen he asked himself if the hadranics should break through the legitimacys newly constituted defence line would the galactic wheel move to prevent the invasion so as to protect its pitch he suspected not they were more subtle more practical they would simply make sure that their property remained profitable in the new setup they might even encourage an invasion if it meant more business contemplating the possibility brought scarne a sense of unreality sometimes he had the feeling that the whole sequence of events he had suffered beginning with his first being picked up by the sis was the result of a game being played elsewhere in the universe it was better not to think about it every so often scarne glanced at the door in expectation of yet one more piece of luck why not it should happen he told himself at first he had been expecting and now he was only hoping that his luck would rub off enough so that cadence mellors would somehow find her way out of that work camp and back to him according to his luck he should see her walking through a door somewhere someday that was why he spent so much of his time in bars he took a swallow of his drink and then looked up again a girl had just entered the bar and for a moment he thought it was cadence at a glance the resemblance was remarkable and it was not just a matter of physiognomy like cadence she was no longer very young a little faded more than a little jaded by life but it was not cadence he continued staring at her feeling familiar pangs she smiled he smiled his luck was running out but it was still working for him within limits she was not cadence but she would do
