inform you that i am well and hope these few lines will find you enjoying the same gods blessing the book is out and is handsome it is full of damnable errors of grammar and deadly inconsistencies of

children with i am to lecture in cooper institute next monday night pray for me we sail for the holy land june try to write me to this hotel and it will be forwarded to paris where we remain or days regards and best wishes to mrs bret and the family truly yr friend mark to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis westminster hotel may dear folks dont expect me to write for a while my hands are full of business on account of my lecture for the th inst and everything looks shady at least if not dark i have got a good agent but now after we have hired cooper institute and gone to an expense in one way or another of it comes out that i have got to play against speaker colfax at irving hall ristori and also the double troupe of japanese jugglers the latter opening at the great academy of music and with all this against me i have taken the largest house in new york and cannot back water let her slide if nobody else cares i dont ill send the book soon i am awfully hurried now but not worried yrs sam the cooper union lecture proved a failure and a success when it became evident to fuller that the venture was not going to pay he sent out a flood of complimentaries to the schoolteachers of new york city and the surrounding districts no one seems to have declined them clemens lectured to a jammed house and acquired much reputation lecture proposals came from several directions but he could not accept them now he wrote home that he was eighteen alta letters behind and had refused everything thos nast the cartoonist then in his first fame propped a joint tour clemens to lecture while he nast would illustrate with lightning sketches but even this could not be considered now in a little while he would sail and the days were overfull a letter written a week before he sailed is full of the hurry and strain of these last days to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis westminster hotel new york june dear folks i know i ought to write oftener just got your last and more fully but i cannot overcome my repugnance to telling what i am doing or what i expect to do or propose to do then what have i left to write about manifestly nothing it isnt any use for me to talk about the voyage because i can have no faith in that voyage till the ship is under way how do i know she will ever sail my passage is paid and if the ship sails i sail in her but i make no calculations have bought no cigars no seagoing clothing have made no preparation whatever shall not pack my trunk till the morning we sail yet my hands are full of what i am going to do the day before we sail and what isnt done that day will go undone all i do know or feel is that i am wild with impatience to move move move half a dozen times i have wished i had sailed long ago in some ship that wasnt going to keep me chained here to chafe for lagging ages while she got ready to go curse the endless delays they always kill me they make me neglect every duty and then i have a conscience that tears me like a wild beast i wish i never had to stop anywhere a month i do more mean things the moment i get a chance to fold my hands and sit down than ever i can get forgiveness for yes we are to meet at mr beachs next thursday night and i suppose we shall have to be gotten up regardless of expense in swallowtails white kids and everything en regle i am resigned to rev mr hutchinsons or anybody elses supervision i dont mind it i am fixed i have got a splendid immoral tobaccosmoking winedrinking godless roommate who is as good and true and rightminded a man as ever lived a man whose blameless conduct and example will always be an eloquent sermon to all who shall come within their influence but send on the professional preachers there are none i like better to converse with if theyre not narrow minded and bigoted they make good companions i asked them to send the n y weekly to you no charge i am not going to write for it like all other papers that pay one splendidly it circulates among stupid people and the canaille i have made no arrangement with any new york paper i will see about that monday or tuesday love to all good bye yrs affy sam the immoral roommate whose conduct was to be an eloquent example was dan slote immortalized in the innocents as dan a favorite on the ship and later beloved by countless readers there is one more letter written the night before the quaker city saileda letter which in a sense marks the close of the first great period of his life the period of aimless wandering adventure youth perhaps a paragraph of explanation should precede this letter political changes had eliminated orion in nevada and he was now undertaking the practice of law bill stewart was senator stewart of nevada of whom we shall hear again the sandwich island book as may be imagined was made up of his letters to the sacramento union nothing came of the venture except some chapters in roughing it rewritten from the material zeb and john leavenworth were pilots whom he had known on the river to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis new york june th dear folks i suppose we shall be many a league at sea tomorrow night and goodness knows i shall be unspeakably glad of it i havent got anything to write else i would write it i have just written myself clear out in letters to the alta and i think they are the stupidest letters that were ever written from new york corresponding has been a perfect drag ever since i got to the states if it continues abroad i dont know what the tribune and alta folks will think i have withdrawn the sandwich island book it would be useless to publish it in these dull publishing times as for the frog book i dont believe that will ever pay anything worth a cent i published it simply to advertise myself not with the hope of making anything out of it well i havent anything to write except that i am tired of staying in one place that i am in a fever to get away read my alta letters they contain everything i could possibly write to you tell zeb and john leavenworth to write me they can get plenty of gossip from the pilots an importing house sent two cases of exquisite champagne aboard the ship for me today veuve clicquot and lac dor i and my roommate have set apart every saturday as a solemn fast day wherein we will entertain no light matters of frivolous conversation but only get drunk that is a joke his mother and sisters are the best and most homelike people i have yet found in a brown stone front there is no style about them except in house and furniture i wish orion were going on this voyage for i believe he could not help but be cheerful and jolly i often wonder if his law business is going satisfactorily to him but knowing that the dull season is setting in now it looked like it had already set in before i have felt as if i could almost answer the question myself which is to say in plain words i was afraid to ask i wish i had gone to washington in the winter instead of going west i could have gouged an office out of bill stewart for him and that would atone for the loss of my home visit but i am so worthless that it seems to me i never do anything or accomplish anything that lingers in my mind as a pleasant memory my mind is stored full of unworthy conduct toward orion and towards you all and an accusing conscience gives me peace only in excitement and restless moving from place to place if i could say i had done one thing for any of you that entitled me to your good opinion i say nothing of your love for i am sure of that no matter how unworthy of it i may make myself from orion down you have always given me that all the days of my life when god almighty knows i seldom deserve it i believe i could go home and stay there and i know i would care little for the worlds praise or blame there is no satisfaction in the worlds praise anyhow and it has no worth to me save in the way of business i tried to gather up its compliments to send to you but the work was distasteful and i dropped it you observe that under a cheerful exterior i have got a spirit that is angry with me and gives me freely its contempt i can get away from that at sea and be tranquil and satisfiedand so with my parting love and benediction for orion and all of you i say goodbye and god bless you all and welcome the wind that wafts a weary soul to the sunny lands of the mediterranean yrs forever sam vii letters the traveler the voyage of the quaker city mark twain now at sea was writing many letters not personal letters but those unique descriptive relations of travel which would make him his first great fame those fresh first impressions preserved to us now as chapters of the innocents abroad yet here and there in the midst of sightseeing and reporting he found time to send a brief line to those at home merely that they might have a word from his own hand for he had ordered the papers to which he was to contribute the alta and the new york tribune sent to them and these would give the story of his travels the home letters read like notebook entries letters to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis fayal azores june th dear folks we are having a lively time here after a stormy trip we meant to go to san miguel but were driven here by stress of weather beautiful climate yrs affect sam gibraltar june th dear folks arrived here this morning and am clear worn out with riding and climbing in and over and around this monstrous rock and its fortifications summer climate and very pleasant yrs sam tangier morocco africa july dear folks half a dozen of us came here yesterday from gibraltar and some of the company took the other direction went up through spain to paris by rail we decided that gibraltar and san roque were all of spain that we wanted to see at present and are glad we came here among the africans moors arabs and bedouins of the desert i would not give this experience for all the balance of the trip combined this is the infernalest hive of infernally costumed barbarians i have ever come across yet yrs sam at sea july dr folks we are far up the intensely blue and ravishingly beautiful mediterranean and now we are just passing the island of minorca the climate is perfectly lovely and it is hard to drive anybody to bed day or night we remain up the whole night through occasionally and by this means enjoy the rare sensation of seeing the sun rise but the sunsets are soft rich warm and superb we had a ball last night under the awnings of the quarter deck and the share of it of three of us was masquerade we had full flowing picturesque moorish costumes which we purchased in the bazaars of tangier yrs sam marseilles france july we are here start for paris tomorrow all well had gorgeous th of july jollification yesterday at sea yrs sam the reader may expand these sketchy outlines to his hearts content by following the chapters in the innocents abroad which is very good history less elaborated than might be supposed but on the other hand the next letter adds something of interest to the bookcircumstances which a modest author would necessarily omit to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis yalta russia aug dear folks we have been representing the united states all we knew how today we went to sebastopol after we got tired of constantinople got your letter there and one at naples and there the commandant and the whole town came aboard and were as jolly and sociable as old friends they said the emperor of russia was at yalta miles or away and urged us to go there with the ship and visit him promised us a cordial welcome they insisted on sending a telegram to the emperor and also a courier overland to announce our coming but we knew that a great english excursion party and also the viceroy of egypt in his splendid yacht had been refused an audience within the last fortnight so we thought it not safe to try it they said no difference the emperor would hardly visit our ship because that would be a most extraordinary favor and one which he uniformly refuses to accord under any circumstances but he would certainly receive us at his palace we still declined but we had to go to odessa miles away and there the governor general urged us and sent a telegram to the emperor which we hardly expected to be answered but it was and promptly so we sailed back to yalta we all went to the palace at noon today miles in carriages and on horses sent by the emperor and we had a jolly time instead of the usual formal audience of minutes we staid hours and were made a good deal more at home than we could have been in a new york drawingroom the whole tribe turned out to receive our partyemperor empress the oldest daughter grandduchess marie a pretty girl of a little grand duke her brother and a platoon of admirals princes peers of the empire etc and in a little while an aiddecamp arrived with a request from the grand duke michael the emperors brother that we would visit his palace and breakfast with him the emperor also invited us on behalf of his absent eldest son and heir aged to visit his palace and consider it a visit to him they all talk english and they were all very neatly but very plainly dressed you all dress a good deal finer than they were dressed the emperor and his family threw off all reserve and showed us all over the palace themselves it is very rich and very elegant but in no way gaudy i had been appointed chairman of a committee to draught an address to the emperor in behalf of the passengers and as i fully expected and as they fully intended i had to write the address myself i didnt mind it because i have no modesty and would as soon write to an emperor as to anybody else but considering that there were on the committee i thought they might have contributed one paragraph among them anyway they wanted me to read it to him too but i declined that honor not because i hadnt cheek enough and some to spare but because our consul at odessa was along and also the secretary of our legation at st petersburgh and of course one of those ought to read it the emperor accepted the address it was his business to do it and so many others have praised it warmly that i begin to imagine it must be a wonderful sort of document and herewith send you the original draught of it to be put into alcohol and preserved forever like a curious reptile they live right well at the grand duke michaels their breakfasts are not gorgeous but very excellent and if mike were to say the word i would go there and breakfast with him tomorrow yrs aff sam p s written across the face of the last page they had told us it would be polite to invite the emperor to visit the ship though he would not be likely to do it but he didnt give us a chance he has requested permission to come on board with his family and all his relations tomorrow and take a sail in case it is calm weather i can entertain them my hand is in now and if you want any more emperors feted in style trot them out the next letter is of interest in that it gives us the program and volume of his work with all the sight seeing he was averaging a full four letters a week long letters requiring careful observation and inquiry how fresh and impressionable and full of vigor he was even in that fierce southern heat no one makes the mediterranean trip in summer today and the thought of adding constant letterwriting to steady travel through southern france italy greece and turkey in blazing midsummer is stupefying and syria and egypt in september to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis constantinople sept dear folks all well do the altas come regularly i wish i knew whether my letters reach them or not look over the back papers and see i wrote them as follows letter from fayal in the azores islands from gibraltar in spain from tangier in africa from paris and marseilles in france from genoa in italy from milan from lake como from some little place in switzerland have forgotten the name concerning lecce bergamo padua verona battlefield of marengo pestachio and some other cities in northern italy from venice about bologna from florence from pisa from leghorn from rome and civita vecchia from naples about pazzuoli where st paul landed the baths of nero and the ruins of baia virgils tomb the elysian fields the sunken cities and the spot where ulysses landed from herculaneum and vesuvius from pompeii from the island of ischia concerning the volcano of stromboli the city and straits of messina the land of sicily scylla and charybdis etc about the grecian archipelago about a midnight visit to athens the piraeus and the ruins of the acropolis about the hellespont the site of ancient troy the sea of marmara etc about constantinople the golden horn and the beauties of the bosphorus from odessa and sebastopol in russia the black sea etc from yalta russia concerning a visit to the czar and yesterday i wrote another letter from constantinople and today about its neighbor in asia scatter i am not done with turkey yet shall write or more i have written to the new york herald letters from naples no name signed and from constantinople to the new york tribune i have written from fayal from civita vecchia in the roman states from yalta russia and from constantinople i have never seen any of these letters in print except the one to the tribune from fayal and that was not worth printing we sail hence tomorrow perhaps and my next letters will be mailed at smyrna in syria i hope to write from the sea of tiberius damascus jerusalem joppa and possibly other points in the holy land the letters from egypt the nile and algiers i will look out for myself i will bring them in my pocket they take the finest photographs in the world here i have ordered some they will be sent to alexandria egypt you cannot conceive of anything so beautiful as constantinople viewed from the golden horn or the bosphorus i think it must be the handsomest city in the world i will go on deck and look at it for you directly i am staying in the ship tonight i generally stay on shore when we are in port but yesterday i just ran myself down dan slote my roommate is on shore he remained here while we went up the black sea but it seems he has not got enough of it yet i thought dan had got the stateroom pretty full of rubbish at last but a while ago his dragoman arrived with a bran new ghastly tombstone of the oriental pattern with his name handsomely carved and gilded on it in turkish characters that fellow will buy a circassian slave next i am tired we are going on a trip tomorrow i must to bed love to all yrs sam u s consuls office beirut syria sept dear folks we are here eight of us making a contract with a dragoman to take us to baalbek then to damascus nazareth c then to lake genassareth sea of tiberias then south through all the celebrated scriptural localities to jerusalem then to the dead sea the cave of macpelah and up to joppa where the ship will be we shall be in the saddle three weeks we have horses tents provisions arms a dragoman and two other servants and we pay five dollars a day apiece in gold love to all yrs sam we leave tonight at two oclock in the morning there appear to be no further home letters written from syria and none from egypt perhaps with the desert and the delta the heat at last became too fearful for anything beyond the actual requirements of the day when he began his next it was october and the fiercer travel was behind him to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis caghari sardinia oct dear folks we have just dropped anchor before this handsome city and algiers africa oct they would not let us land at caghari on account of cholera nothing to write malaga spain oct the captain and i are ashore here under guard waiting to know whether they will let the ship anchor or not quarantine regulations are very strict here on all vessels coming from egypt i am a little anxious because i want to go inland to granada and see the alhambra i can go on down by seville and cordova and be picked up at cadiz later we cannot anchor must go on we shall be at gibraltar before midnight and i think i will go horseback a long days and thence by rail and diligence to cadiz i will not mail this till i see the gibraltar lights i begin to think they wont let us in anywhere p m gibraltar at anchor and all right but they wont let us land till morning it is a waste of valuable time we shall reach new york middle of november yours sam cadiz oct dear folks we left gibraltar at noon and rode to algeciras hours thus dodging the quarantine took dinner and then rode horseback all night in a swinging trot and at daylight took a caleche a wheeled vehicle and rode hours then took cars and traveled till twelve at night that landed us at seville and we were over the hard part of our trip and somewhat tired since then we have taken things comparatively easy drifting around from one town to another and attracting a good deal of attention for i guess strangers do not wander through andalusia and the other southern provinces of spain often the country is precisely as it was when don quixote and sancho panza were possible characters but i see now what the glory of spain must have been when it was under moorish domination no i will not say that but then when one is carried away infatuated entranced with the wonders of the alhambra and the supernatural beauty of the alcazar he is apt to overflow with admiration for the splendid intellects that created them i cannot write now i am only dropping a line to let you know i am well the ship will call for us here tomorrow we may stop at lisbon and shall at the bermudas and will arrive in new york ten days after this letter gets there sam this is the last personal letter written during that famous first seagipsying and reading it our regret grows that he did not put something of his spanish excursion into his book he never returned to spain and he never wrote of it only the barest mention of seven beautiful days is found in the innocents abroad viii letters washington and san francisco the proposed book of travel a new lecture from mark twains home letters we get several important sidelights on this first famous book we learn for in stance that it was he who drafted the ship address to the emperor the opening lines of which became so wearisome when repeated by the sailors furthermore we learn something of the scope and extent of his newspaper correspondence which must have kept him furiously busy done as it was in the midst of superheated and continuous sightseeing he wrote fifty three letters to the altacalifornia six to the new york tribune and at least two to the new york herald more than sixty all told of an average length of three to four thousand words each mark twain always claimed to be a lazy man and certainly he was likely to avoid an undertaking not suited to his gifts but he had energy in abundance for work in his chosen field to have piled up a correspondence of that size in the time and under the circumstances already noted quality considered may be counted a record in the history of travel letters they made him famous arriving in new york november mark twain found himself no longer unknown to the metropolis or to any portion of america papers east and west had copied his alta and tribune letters and carried his name into every corner of the states and territories he had preached a new gospel in travel literature the gospel of frankness and sincerity that americans could understand also his literary powers had awakened at last his work was no longer trivial crude and showy it was full of dignity beauty and power his humor was finer worthier the difference in quality between the quaker city letters and those written from the sandwich islands only a year before can scarcely be measured he did not remain in new york but went down to washington where he had arranged for a private secretaryship with senator william m stewart the bill stewart mentioned in the preceding chapter whom he had known in nevada such a position he believed would make but little demand upon his time and would afford him an insight into washington life which he could make valuable in the shape of newspaper correspondence but fate had other plans for him he presently received the following letter from elisha bliss jr in hartford office of the american publishing company hartford conn nov samuel l clemens esq tribune office new york dr sir we take the liberty to address you this in place of a letter which we had recently written and was about to forward to you not knowing your arrival home was expected so soon we are desirous of obtaining from you a work of some kind perhaps compiled from your letters from the east c with such interesting additions as may be proper we are the publishers of a d richardsons works and flatter ourselves that we can give an author as favorable terms and do as full justice to his productions as any other house in the country we are perhaps the oldest subscription house in the country and have never failed to give a book an immense circulation we sold about copies of richardsons f d e field dungeon and escape and are now printing of beyond the mississippi and large orders ahead if you have any thought of writing a book or could be induced to do so we should be pleased to see you and will do so will you do us the favor to reply at once at your earliest convenience very truly c e bliss jr secty clemens had already the idea of a book in mind and welcomed this proposition to elisha bliss jr in hartford washington dec e bliss jr esq secy american publishing co dear sir i only received your favor of nov st last night at the rooms of the tribune bureau here it was forwarded from the tribune office new york where it had lain eight or ten days this will be a sufficient apology for the seeming discourtesy of my silence i wrote fiftytwo three letters for the san francisco alta california during the quaker city excursion about half of which number have been printed thus far the alta has few exchanges in the east and i suppose scarcely any of these letters have been copied on this side of the rocky mountains i could weed them of their chief faults of construction and inelegancies of expression and make a volume that would be more acceptable in many respects than any i could now write when those letters were written my impressions were fresh but now they have lost that freshness they were warm then they are cold now i could strike out certain letters and write new ones wherewith to supply their places if you think such a book would suit your purpose please drop me a line specifying the size and general style of the volume when the matter ought to be ready whether it should have pictures in it or not and particularly what your terms with me would be and what amount of money i might possibly make out of it the latter clause has a degree of importance for me which is almost beyond my own comprehension but you understand that of course i have other propositions for a book but have doubted the propriety of interfering with good newspaper engagements except my way as an author could be demonstrated to be plain before me but i know richardson and learned from him some months ago something of an idea of the subscription plan of publishing if that is your plan invariably it looks safe i am on the n y tribune staff here as an occasional among other things and a note from you addressed to very truly c sam l clemens new york tribune bureau washington will find me without fail the exchange of these two letters marked the beginning of one of the most notable publishing connections in american literary history the book however was not begun immediately bliss was in poor health and final arrangements were delayed it was not until late in january that clemens went to hartford and concluded the arrangement meantime fate had disclosed another matter of even greater importance we get the first hint of it in the following letter though to him its beginning had been earlier on a day in the blue harbor of smyrna when young charles langdon a fellowpassenger on the quaker city had shown to mark twain a miniature of young langdons sister at home to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis f street wash jan my dear mother and sister and so the old major has been there has he i would like mighty well to see him i was a sort of benefactor to him once i helped to snatch him out when he was about to ride into a mohammedan mosque in that queer old moorish town of tangier in africa if he had got in the moors would have knocked his venerable old head off for his temerity i have just arrived from new yorkbeen there ever since christmas staying at the house of dan slote my quaker city roommate and having a splendid time charley langdon jack van nostrand dan and i all quaker city nighthawks had a blowout at dans house and a lively talk over old times we went through the holy land together and i just laughed till my sides ached at some of our reminiscences it was the unholiest gang that ever cavorted through palestine but those are the best boys in the world we needed moulton badly i started to make calls new years day but i anchored for the day at the first house i came to charlie langdons sister was there beautiful girl and miss alice hooker another beautiful girl a niece of henry ward beechers we sent the old folks home early with instructions not to send the carriage till midnight and then i just staid there and worried the life out of those girls i am going to spend a few days with the langdons in elmira new york as soon as i get time and a few days at mrs hookers in hartford conn shortly henry ward beecher sent for me last sunday to come over and dine he lives in brooklyn you know and i went harriet beecher stowe was there and mrs and miss beecher mrs hooker and my old quaker city favorite emma beach we had a very gay time if it was sunday i expect i told more lies than i have told before in a month i went back by invitation after the evening service and finished the blowout and then staid all night at mr beachs henry ward is a brick i found out at oclock last night that i was to lecture tomorrow evening and so you must be aware that i have been working like sin all night to get a lecture written i have finished it i call it frozen truth it is a little topheavy though because there is more truth in the title than there is in the lecture but thunder i mustnt sit here writing all day with so much business before me good by and kind regards to all yrs affy sam l clemens jack van nostrand of this letter is jack of the innocents emma beach was the daughter of moses s beach of the new york sun later she became the wife of the wellknown painter abbot h thayer we do not hear of miss langdon again in the letters of that time but it was not because she was absent from his thoughts he had first seen her with her father and brother at the old st nicholas hotel on lower broadway where soon after the arrival of the quaker city in new york he had been invited to dine long afterward he said it is forty years ago from that day to this she has never been out of my mind from his next letter we learn of the lecture which apparently was delivered in washington to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis wash jan my dear mother and sister that infernal lecture is over thank heaven it came near being a villainous failure it was not advertised at all the manager was taken sick yesterday and the man who was sent to tell me never got to me till afternoon today there was the dickens to pay it was too late to do anything too late to stop the lecture i scared up a doorkeeper and was ready at the proper time and by pure good luck a tolerably good house assembled and i was saved i hardly knew what i was going to talk about but it went off in splendid style i was to have preached again saturday night but i wont i cant get along without a manager i have been in new york ever since christmas you know and now i shall have to work like sin to catch up my correspondence and i have got to get up that book too cut my letters out of the altas and send them to me in an envelop some here that are not mailed yet i shall have to copy i suppose i have got a thousand things to do and am not doing any of them i feel perfectly savage good bye yrs aff sam on the whole matters were going well with him his next letter is full of his success overflowing with the boyish radiance which he never quite outgrew to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis hartford conn jan dear mother and sister this is a good week for me i stopped in the herald office as i came through new york to see the boys on the staff and young james gordon bennett asked me to write twice a week impersonally for the herald and said if i would i might have full swing and write about anybody and everybody i wanted to i said i must have the very fullest possible swing and he said all right i said its a contract and that settled that matter ill make it a point to write one letter a week anyhow but the best thing that has happened was here this great american publishing company kept on trying to bargain with me for a book till i thought i would cut the matter short by coming up for a talk i met rev henry ward beecher in brooklyn and with his usual wholesouled way of dropping his own work to give other people a lift when he gets a chance he said now here you are one of the talented men of the age nobody is going to deny that but in matters of business i dont suppose you know more than enough to came in when it rains ill tell you what to do and how to do it and he did and i listened well and then came up here and made a splendid contract for a quaker city book of or large pages with illustrations the manuscript to be placed in the publishers hands by the middle of july my percentage is to be a fifth more than they have ever paid any author except horace greeley beecher will be surprised i guess when he hears this but i had my mind made up to one thing i wasnt going to touch a book unless there was money in it and a good deal of it i told them so i had the misfortune to bust out one author of standing they had his manuscript with the understanding that they would publish his book if they could not get a book from me they only publish two books at a time and so my book and richardsons life of grant will fill the bill for next fall and winter so that manuscript was sent back to its author today these publishers get off the most tremendous editions of their books you can imagine i shall write to the enterprise and alta every week as usual i guess and to the herald twice a week occasionally to the tribune and the magazines i have a stupid article in the galaxy just issued but i am not going to write to this that and the other paper any more the chicago tribune wants letters but i hope and pray i have charged them so much that they will not close the contract i am gradually getting out of debt but these trips to new york do cost like sin i hope you have cut out and forwarded my printed letters to washington please continue to do so as they arrive i have had a tiptop time here for a few days guest of mr jno hookers family beechers relativesin a general way of mr bliss also who is head of the publishing firm puritans are mighty straightlaced and they wont let me smoke in the parlor but the almighty dont make any better people love to allgoodbye i shall be in new york days then go on to the capital yrs affly especially ma yr sam i have to make a speech at the annual herald dinner on the th of may no formal contract for the book had been made when this letter was written a verbal agreement between bliss and clemens had been reached to be ratified by an exchange of letters in the near future bliss had made two propositions viz ten thousand dollars cash in hand or a percent royalty on the selling price of the book the cash sum offered looked very large to mark twain and he was sorely tempted to accept it he had faith however in the book and in blisss ability to sell it he agreed therefore to the royalty proposition the best business judgment i ever displayed he often declared in after years five per cent royalty sounds rather small in these days of more liberal contracts but the american publishing company sold its books only by subscription and the agents commissions and delivery expenses ate heavily into the profits clemens was probably correct in saying that his percentage was larger than had been paid to any previous author except horace greeley the john hooker mentioned was the husband of henry ward beechers sister isabel it was easy to understand the beecher familys robust appreciation of mark twain from the office of dan slote his roommate of the quaker city dan of the innocents clemens wrote his letter that closed the agreement with bliss to elisha bliss jr in hartford office of slote woodman blank book manufacturers nos william st new york january mr e bliss jr secy american publishing co hartford conn dear sir your favor of jan th is received and in reply i will say that i accede to your several propositions viz that i furnish to the american publishing company through you with mss sufficient for a volume of to pages the subject to be the quaker city the voyage description of places c and also embodying the substance of the letters written by me during that trip said mss to be ready about the first of august next i to give all the usual and necessary attention in preparing said mss for the press and in preparation of illustrations in correction of proofs no use to be made by me of the material for this work in any way which will conflict with its interest the book to be sold by the american publishing co by subscription and for said ms and labor on my part said company to pay me a copyright of percent upon the subscription price of the book for all copies sold as further proposed by you this understanding herein set forth shall be considered a binding contract upon all parties concerned all minor details to be arranged between us hereafter very truly yours sam l clemens private and general i was to have gone to washington tonight but have held over a day to attend a dinner given by a lot of newspaper editors and literary scalliwags at the westminster hotel shall go down tomorrow if i survive the banquet yrs truly sam clemens mark twain in washington was in line for political preferment his wide acquaintance on the pacific slope his new fame and growing popularity his powerful and dreaded pen all gave him special distinction at the capital from time to time the offer of one office or another tempted him but he wisely or luckily resisted in his letters home are presented some of his problems to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis f street washington feb my dear mother and sister for two months there have been some fifty applications before the government for the postmastership of san francisco which is the heaviest concentration of political power on the coast and consequently is a post which is much coveted when i found that a personal friend of mine the chief editor of the alta was an applicant i said i didnt want it i would not take a year out of a friends pocket the two months have passed i heard day before yesterday that a new and almost unknown candidate had suddenly turned up on the inside track and was to be appointed at once i didnt like that and went after his case in a fine passion i hunted up all our senators and representatives and found that his name was actually to come from the president early in the morning then judge field said if i wanted the place he could pledge me the presidents appointment and senator conness said he would guarantee me the senates confirmation it was a great temptation but it would render it impossible to fill my book contract and i had to drop the idea i have to spend august and september in hartford which isnt san francisco mr conness offers me any choice out of five influential california offices now some day or other i shall want an office and then just my luck i cant get it i suppose they want to send me abroad as a consul or a minister i said i didnt want any of the pie god knows i am mean enough and lazy enough now without being a foreign consul sometime in the course of the present century i think they will create a commissioner of patents and then i hope to get a berth for orion i published or letters in the tribune while i was gone now i cannot get them i suppose i must have them copied love to all sam orion clemens was once more a candidate for office nevada had become a state with regularly elected officials and orion had somehow missed being chosen his day of authority had passed and the law having failed to support him he was again back at his old occupation setting type in st louis he was as ever full of dreams and inventions that would some day lead to fortune with the gift of the sellers imagination inherited by all the family he lacked the driving power which means achievement more and more as the years went by he would lean upon his brother for moral and physical support the chances for him in washington do not appear to have been bright the political situation under andrew johnson was not a happy one to orion clemens in st louis f street wash feb my dear bro i am glad you do not want the clerkship for that patent office is in such a muddle that there would be no security for the permanency of a place in it the same remark will apply to all offices here now and no doubt will till the close of the present administration any man who holds a place here now stands prepared at all times to vacate it you are doing now exactly what i wanted you to do a year ago we chase phantoms half the days of our lives it is well if we learn wisdom even then and save the other half i am in for it i must go on chasing them until i marry then i am done with literature and all other bosh that is literature wherewith to please the general public i shall write to please myself then i hope you will set type till you complete that invention for surely government pap must be nauseating food for a man a man whom god has enabled to saw wood and be independent it really seemed to me a falling from grace the idea of going back to san francisco nothing better than a mere postmaster albeit the public would have thought i came with gilded honors and in great glory i only retain correspondence enough now to make a living for myself and have discarded all else so that i may have time to spare for the book drat the thing i wish it were done or that i had no other writing to do this is the place to get a poor opinion of everybody in there isnt one man in washington in civil office who has the brains of anson burlingame and i suppose if china had not seized and saved his great talents to the world this government would have discarded him when his time was up there are more pitiful intellects in this congress oh geeminy there are few of them that i find pleasant enough company to visit i am most infernally tired of wash and its attractions to be busy is a mans only happiness and i am otherwise i should die yrs aff sam the secretarial position with senator stewart was shortlived one cannot imagine mark twain as anybodys secretary and doubtless there was little to be gained on either side by the arrangement they parted without friction though in later years when stewart had become old and irascible he used to recount a list of grievances and declare that he had been obliged to threaten violence in order to bring mark to terms but this was because the author of roughing it had in that book taken liberties with the senator to the extent of an anecdote and portrait which though certainly harmless enough had for some reason given deep offense mark twain really had no time for secretary work for one thing he was associated with john swinton in supplying a washington letter to a list of newspapers and then he was busy collecting his quaker city letters and preparing the copy for his book matters were going well enough when trouble developed from an unexpected quarter the altacalifornia had copyrighted the letters and proposed to issue them in book form there had been no contract which would prevent this and the correspondence which clemens undertook with the alta management led to nothing he knew that he had powerful friends among the owners if he could reach them personally and he presently concluded to return to san francisco make what arrangement he could and finish his book there it was his fashion to be prompt in his next letter we find him already on the way to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis at sea sunday march lat dear folks i have nothing to write except that i am well that the weather is fearfully hotthat the henry chauncey is a magnificent ship that we have twelve hundred passengers on boardthat i have two staterooms and so am not crowded that i have many pleasant friends here and the people are not so stupid as on the quaker city that we had divine service in the main saloon at this morning that we expect to meet the upward bound vessel in latitude and this is why i am writing now we shall reach aspinwall thursday morning at oclock and san francisco less than two weeks later i worry a great deal about being obliged to go without seeing you all but it could not be helped dan slote my splendid roommate in the quaker city and the noblest man on earth will call to see you within a month make him dine with you and spend the evening his house is my home always in new york yrs affy sam the san francisco trip proved successful once on the ground clemens had little difficulty in convincing the alta publishers that they had received full value in the newspaper use of the letters and that the book rights remained with the author a letter to bliss conveys the situation to elisha bliss jr in hartford san francisco may e bliss jr esq dr sir the alta people after some hesitation have given me permission to use my printed letters and have ceased to think of publishing them themselves in book form i am steadily at work and shall start east with the completed manuscript about the middle of june i lectured here on the trip the other nightover sixteen hundred dollars in gold in the house every seat taken and paid for before night yrs truly mark twain but he did not sail in june his friends persuaded him to cover his lecture circuit of two years before telling the story of his travels this he did with considerable profit being everywhere received with great honors he ended this tour with a second lecture in san francisco announced in a droll and characteristic fashion which delighted his pacific admirers and insured him a crowded house see mark twain a biography chap xlvi and appendix h his agreement had been to deliver his ms about august st returning by the chauncey july th he was two days later in hartford and had placid the copy for the new book in blisss hands it was by no means a compilation of his newspaper letters his literary vision was steadily broadening all of the letters had been radically edited some had been rewritten some entirely eliminated he probably thought very well of the book an opinion shared by bliss but it is unlikely that either of them realized that it was to become a permanent classic and the best selling book of travel for at least fifty years ix letters courtship and the innocents abroad the story of mark twains courtship has been fully told in the completer story of his life it need only be briefly sketched here as a setting for the letters of this period in his letter of january th we note that he expects to go to elmira for a few days as soon as he has time but he did not have time or perhaps did not receive a pressing invitation until he had returned with his ms from california then through young charles langdon his quaker city shipmate he was invited to elmira the invitation was given for a week but through a subterfuge unpremeditated and certainly fair enough in a matter of lovehe was enabled to considerably prolong his visit by the end of his stay he had become really like one of the family though certainly not yet accepted as such the fragmentary letter that follows reflects something of his pleasant situation the mrs fairbanks mentioned in this letter had been something more than a shipmother to mark twain she was a woman of fine literary taste and quaker city correspondent for her husbands paper the cleveland herald she had given mark twain sound advice as to his letters which he had usually read to her and had in no small degree modified his early natural tendency to exaggeration and outlandish humor he owed her much and never failed to pay her tribute part of a letter to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis elmira ny aug dear folks you see i am progressing though slowly i shall be here a week yet maybe two for charlie langdon cannot get away until his fathers chief business man returns from a journey and a visit to mrs fairbanks at cleveland would lose half its pleasure if charlie were not along moulton of st louis ought to be there too we three were mrs fs cubs in the quaker city she took good care that we were at church regularly on sundays at the bells prayer meeting every night and she kept our buttons sewed on and our clothing in order and in a word was as busy and considerate and as watchful over her family of uncouth and unruly cubs and as patient and as longsuffering withal as a natural mother so we expect aug th didnt finish yesterday something called me away i am most comfortably situated here this is the pleasantest family i ever knew i only have one trouble and that is they give me too much thought and too much time and invention to the object of making my visit pass delightfully it needs just how and when he left the langdon home the letters do not record early that fall he began a lecture engagement with james redpath proprietor of the boston lyceum bureau and his engagements were often within reach of elmira he had a standing invitation now to the langdon home and the end of the week often found him there yet when at last he proposed for the hand of livy langdon the acceptance was by no means prompt he was a favorite in the langdon household but his suitability as a husband for the frail and gentle daughter was questioned however he was carrying everything just then by storm the largest houses everywhere were crowded to hear him papers spoke of him as the coming man of the age people came to their doors to see him pass there is but one letter of this period but it gives us the picture to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis cleveland nov dear folks i played against the eastern favorite fanny kemble in pittsburgh last night she had in her house and i had upwards of all the seats were sold in a driving rain storm days ago as reserved seats at cents extra even those in the second and third tiers and when the last seat was gone the box office had not been open more than hours when i reached the theatre they were turning people away and the house was crammed or stood up all the evening i go to elmira tonight i am simply lecturing for societies at a pop yrs sam it would be difficult for any family to refuse relationship with one whose star was so clearly ascending especially when every inclination was in his favor and the young lady herself encouraged his suit a provisional engagement was presently made but it was not finally ratified until february of the following year then in a letter from one of his lecture points he tells his people something of his happiness to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis lockport n y feb dear folks i enclose for ma i thought i was getting ahead of her little assessments of a month but find i am falling behind with her instead and have let her go without money well i did not mean to do it but you see when people have been getting ready for months in a quiet way to get married they are bound to grow stingy and go to saving up money against that awful day when it is sure to be needed i am particularly anxious to place myself in a position where i can carry on my married life in good shape on my own hook because i have paddled my own canoe so long that i could not be satisfied now to let anybody help me and my proposed fatherinlaw is naturally so liberal that it would be just like him to want to give us a start in life but i dont want it that way i can start myself i dont want any help i can run this institution without any outside assistance and i shall have a wife who will stand by me like a soldier through thick and thin and never complain she is only a little body but she hasnt her peer in christendom i gave her only a plain gold engagement ring when fashion imperatively demands a twohundred dollar diamond one and told her it was typical of her future lot namely that she would have to flourish on substantials rather than luxuries but you see i know the girl she dont care anything about luxuries she is a splendid girl she spends no money but her usual years allowance and she spends nearly every cent of that on other people she will be a good sensible little wife without any airs about her i dont make intercession for her beforehand and ask you to love her for there isnt any use in that you couldnt help it if you were to try i warn you that whoever comes within the fatal influence of her beautiful nature is her willing slave for evermore i take my affidavit on that statement her father and mother and brother embrace and pet her constantly precisely as if she were a sweetheart instead of a blood relation she has unlimited power over her father and yet she never uses it except to make him help people who stand in need of help but if i get fairly started on the subject of my bride i never shall get through and so i will quit right here i went to elmira a little over a week ago and staid four days and then had to go to new york on business no further letters have been preserved until june when he is in elmira and with his fiancee reading final proofs on the new book they were having an idyllic good time of course but it was a useful time too for olivia langdon had a keen and refined literary instinct and the innocents abroad as well as mark twains other books are better today for her influence it has been stated that mark twain loved the lecture platform but from his letters we see that even at this early date when he was at the height of his first great vogue as a public entertainer he had no love for platform life undoubtedly he rejoiced in the brief periods when he was actually before his audience and could play upon it with his master touch but the dreary intermissions of travel and broken sleep were too heavy a price to pay to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis elmira june dear folks livy sends you her love and loving good wishes and i send you mine the last chapters of the book came tonight we shall read it in the morning and then thank goodness we are done in twelve months or rather i believe it is fourteen i have earned just eighty dollars by my pen two little magazine squibs and one newspaper letter altogether the idlest laziest months i ever spent in my life and in that time my absolute and necessary expenses have been scorchingly heavy for i have now less than three thousand six hundred dollars in bank out of the eight or nine thousand i have made during those months lecturing my expenses were something frightful during the winter i feel ashamed of my idleness and yet i have had really no inclination to do anything but court livy i havent any other inclination yet i have determined not to work as hard traveling any more as i did last winter and so i have resolved not to lecture outside of the new england states next winter my western course would easily amount to but i would rather make or thousand in new england than submit again to so much wearing travel i have promised to talk ten nights for a thousand dollars in the state of new york provided the places are close together but after all if i get located in a newspaper in a way to suit me in the meantime i dont want to lecture at all next winter and probably shant i most cordially hate the lecture field and after all i shudder to think that i may never get out of it in all conversations with gough and anna dickinson nasby oliver wendell holmes wendell phillips and the other old stagers i could not observe that they ever expected or hoped to get out of the business i dont want to get wedded to it as they are livy thinks we can live on a very moderate sum and that well not need to lecture i know very well that she can live on a small allowance but i am not so sure about myself i cant scare her by reminding her that her fathers family expenses are forty thousand dollars a year because she produces the documents at once to show that precious little of this outlay is on her account but i must not commence writing about livy else i shall never stop there isnt such another little piece of perfection in the world as she is my time is become so short now that i doubt if i get to california this summer if i manage to buy into a paper i think i will visit you a while and not go to cal at all i shall know something about it after my next trip to hartford we all go there on the lth the whole family to attend a wedding on the th i am offered an interest in a cleveland paper which would pay me to a year and a salary added of the salary is fair enough but the interest is not large enough and so i must look a little further the cleveland folks say they can be induced to do a little better by me and urge me to come out and talk business but it dont strike me i feel little or no inclination to go i believe i havent anything else to write and it is bedtime i want to write to orion but i keep putting it off i keep putting everything off day after day livy and i are together all day long and until at night and then i feel dreadfully sleepy if orion will bear with me and forgive me i will square up with him yet i will even let him kiss livy my love to mollie and annie and sammie and all goodbye affectionately sam it is curious with his tendency to optimism and general expansion of futures that he says nothing of the possible sales of the new book or of his expectations in that line it was issued in july and by june the publishers must have had promising advance orders from their canvassers but apparently he includes none of these chickens in his financial forecast even when the book had been out a full month and was being shipped at the rate of several hundreds a day he makes no reference to it in a letter to his sister other than to ask if she has not received a copy this however was a mark twain peculiarity writing was his trade the returns from it seldom excited him it was only when he drifted into strange and untried fields that he began to chase rainbows to blow iridescent bubbles and count unmined gold to mrs moffett in st louis buffalo aug my dear sister i have only time to write a line i got your letter this morning and mailed it to livy she will be expecting me tonight and i am sorry to disappoint her so but then i couldnt well get away i will go next saturday i have bundled up livys picture and will try and recollect to mail it tomorrow it is a porcelaintype and i think you will like it i am sorry i never got to st louis because i may be too busy to go for a long time but i have been busy all the time and st louis is clear out of the way and remote from the world and all ordinary routes of travel you must not place too much weight upon this idea of moving the capital from washington st louis is in some respects a better place for it than washington though there isnt more than a tossup between the two after all one is dead and the other in a trance washington is in the centre of population and business while st louis is far removed from both and you know there is no geographical centre any more the railroads and telegraph have done away with all that it is no longer a matter of sufficient importance to be gravely considered by thinking men the only centres now are narrowed down to those of intelligence capital and population as i said before washington is the nearest to those and you dont have to paddle across a river on ferry boats of a pattern popular in the dark ages to get to it nor have to clamber up vilely paved hills in rascally omnibuses along with a herd of all sorts of people after you are there secondly the removal of the capital is one of those old regular reliable dodges that are the breadand meat of back country congressmen it is agitated every year it always has been it always will be it is not new in any respect thirdly the capitol has cost already and lacks a good deal of being finished yet there are single stones in the treasury building and a good many of them that cost twentyseven thousand dollars apiece and millions were spent in the construction of that and the patent office and the other great government buildings to move to st louis the country must throw away a hundred millions of capital invested in those buildings and go right to work to spend a hundred millions on new buildings in st louis shall we ever have a congress a majority of whose members are hopelessly insane probably not but it is possibleunquestionably such a thing is possible only i dont believe it will happen in our time and i am satisfied the capital will not be moved until it does happen but if st louis would donate the ground and the buildings it would be a different matter no pamela i dont see any good reason to believe you or i will ever see the capital moved i have twice instructed the publishers to send you a book it was the first thing i did long before the proofs were finished write me if it is not yet done livy says we must have you all at our marriage and i say we cant it will be at christmas or new years when such a trip across the country would be equivalent to murder arson everything else and it would cost five hundred dollars an amount of money she dont know the value of now but will before a year is gone she grieves over it poor little rascal but it cant be helped she must wait awhile till i am firmly on my legs then she shall see you she says her father and mother will invite you just as soon as the wedding date is definitely fixed anyway she thinks thats bound to settle it but the ice snow the long hard journey the injudiciousness of laying out any money except what we are obliged to part with while we are so much in debt settles the case differently for it is a debt mr langdon is just as good as bound for for me and has already advanced half of it in cash i wrote and asked whether i had better send him my note or a duebill or how he would prefer to have the indebtedness made of record and he answered every other topic in the letter pleasantly but never replied to that at all still i shall give my note into the hands of his business agent here and pay him the interest as it falls due we must go slow we are not in the cleveland herald we are a hundred thousand times better off but there isnt so much money in it remainder missing in spite of the immediate success of his book a success the like of which had scarcely been known in americamark twain held himself to be not a literary man but a journalist he had no plans for another book as a newspaper owner and editor he expected with his marriage to settle down and devote the rest of his life to journalism the paper was the buffalo express his interest in it was onethird the purchase price twentyfive thousand dollars of which he had paid a part jervis langdon his future fatherinlaw having furnished cash and security for the remainder he was already in possession in august but he was not regularly in buffalo that autumn for he had agreed with redpath to deliver his quaker city lecture and the tour would not end until a short time before his weddingday february our next letter hardly belongs in this collection as it was doubtless written with at least the possibility of publication in view but it is too amusing too characteristic of mark twain to be omitted it was sent in response to an invitation from the new york society of california pioneers to attend a banquet given in new york city october and was of course read to the assembled diners to the new york society of california pioneers in new york city elmira october gentlemen circumstances render it out of my power to take advantage of the invitation extended to me through mr simonton and be present at your dinner at new york i regret this very much for there are several among you whom i would have a right to join hands with on the score of old friendship and i suppose i would have a sublime general right to shake hands with the rest of you on the score of kinship in california ups and downs in search of fortune if i were to tell some of my experience you would recognize california blood in me i fancy the old old story would sound familiar no doubt i have the usual stock of reminiscences for instance i went to esmeralda early i purchased largely in the wide west winnemucca and other fine claims and was very wealthy i fared sumptuously on bread when flour was a barrel and had beans for dinner every sunday when none but bloated aristocrats could afford such grandeur but i finished by feeding batteries in a quartz mill at a week and wishing i was a battery myself and had somebody to feed me my claims in esmeralda are there yet i suppose i could be persuaded to sell i went to humboldt district when it was new i became largely interested in the alba nueva and other claims with gorgeous names and was rich again in prospect i owned a vast mining property there i would not have sold out for less than at that time but i will now finally i walked home miles partly for exercise and partly because stage fare was expensive next i entered upon an affluent career in virginia city and by a judicious investment of labor and the capital of friends became the owner of about all the worthless wild cat mines there were in that part of the country assessments did the business for me there there were a hundred and seventeen assessments to one dividend and the proportion of income to outlay was a little against me my financial barometer went down to fahrenheit and the subscriber was frozen out i took up extensions on the main leadextensions that reached to british america in one direction and to the isthmus of panama in the other and i verily believe i would have been a rich man if i had ever found those infernal extensions but i didnt i ran tunnels till i tapped the arctic ocean and i sunk shafts till i broke through the roof of perdition but those extensions turned up missing every time i am willing to sell all that property and throw in the improvements perhaps you remember that celebrated north ophir i bought that mine it was very rich in pure silver you could take it out in lumps as large as a filbert but when it was discovered that those lumps were melted half dollars and hardly melted at that a painful case of salting was apparent and the undersigned adjourned to the poorhouse again i paid assessments on hale and norcross until they sold me out and i had to take in washing for a living and the next month that infamous stock went up to a foot i own millions and millions of feet of affluent silver leads in nevada in fact the entire undercrust of that country nearly and if congress would move that state off my property so that i could get at it i would be wealthy yet but no there she squats and here am i failing health persuades me to sell if you know of any one desiring a permanent investment i can furnish one that will have the virtue of being eternal i have been through the california mill with all its dips spurs and angles variations and sinuosities i have worked there at all the different trades and professions known to the catalogues i have been everything from a newspaper editor down to a cowcatcher on a locomotive and i am encouraged to believe that if there had been a few more occupations to experiment on i might have made a dazzling success at last and found out what mysterious designs providence had in creating me but you perceive that although i am not a pioneer i have had a sufficiently variegated time of it to enable me to talk pioneer like a native and feel like a fortyniner therefore i cordially welcome you to your oldremembered homes and your long deserted firesides and close this screed with the sincere hope that your visit here will be a happy one and not embittered by the sorrowful surprises that absence and lapse of years are wont to prepare for wanderers surprises which come in the form of old friends missed from their places silence where familiar voices should be the young grown old change and decay everywhere home a delusion and a disappointment strangers at hearthstone sorrow where gladness was tears for laughter the melancholypomp of death where the grace of life has been with all good wishes for the returned prodigals and regrets that i cannot partake of a small piece of the fatted calf rare and no gravy i am yours cordially mark twain in the next letter we find him in the midst of a sort of confusion of affairs which in one form or another would follow him throughout the rest of his life it was the price of his success and popularity combined with his general gift for being concerned with a number of things and a natural tendency for getting into hot water which becomes more evident as the years and letters pass in review orion clemens in his attempt to save money for the government had employed methods and agents which the officials at washington did not understand and refused to recognize instead of winning the credit and commendation he had expected he now found himself pursued by claims of considerable proportions the land referred to is the tennessee tract the heritage which john clemens had provided for his children mark twain had long since lost faith in it and was not only willing but eager to renounce his rights nasby is of course david r locke of the toledo blade whose popularity at this time both as a lecturer and writer was very great clemens had met him here and there on their platform tour and they had become good friends clemens in fact had once proposed to nasby a joint trip to the pacific coast the california idea had been given up but both mark twain and nasby found engagements enough and sufficient profit east of the mississippi boston was often their headquarters that winter and and they were much together josh billings another of redpaths lecturers was likewise often to be found in the lyceum offices there is a photograph of mark twain nasby and josh billings together clemens also that winter met william dean howells then in the early days of his association with the atlantic monthly the two men so widely different became firm friends at sight and it was to howells in the years to come that mark twain would write more letters and more characteristic letters than to any other living man howells had favorably reviewed the innocents abroad and after the first moment of their introduction had passed clemens said when i read that review of yours i felt like the woman who said that she was so glad that her baby had come white it was not the sort of thing that howells would have said but it was the sort of thing that he could understand and appreciate from mark twain in company with nasby clemens that season also met oliver wendell holmes later he had sent holmes a copy of his book and received a pleasantly appreciative reply i always like wrote holmes to hear what one of my fellow countrymen who is not a hebrew scholar or a reader of hieroglyphics but a goodhumored traveler with a pair of sharp twinkling yankee in the broader sense eyes in his head has to say about the things that learned travelers often make unintelligible and sentimental ones ridiculous or absurd i hope your booksellers will sell a hundred thousand copies of your travels a wish that was realized in due time though it is doubtful if doctor holmes or any one else at the moment believed that a book of that nature and price it was a copy would ever reach such a sale to mrs moffett in st louis boston nov my dear sister three or four letters just received from home my first impulse was to send orion a check on my publisher for the money he wants but a sober second thought suggested that if he has not defrauded the government out of money why pay simply because the government chooses to consider him in its debt no right is right the idea dont suit me let him write the treasury the state of the case and tell them he has no money if they make his sureties pay then i will make the sureties whole but i wont pay a cent of an unjust claim you talk of disgrace to my mind it would be just as disgraceful to allow ones self to be bullied into paying that which is unjust ma thinks it is hard that orions share of the land should be swept away just as it is right on the point as it always has been of becoming valuable let her rest easy on that point this letter is his ample authority to sell my share of the land immediately and appropriate the proceeds giving no account to me but repaying the amount to ma first or in case of her death to you or your heirs whenever in the future he shall be able to do it now i want no hesitation in this matter i renounce my ownership from this date for this purpose provided it is sold just as suddenly as he can sell it in the next place mr langdon is old and is trying hard to withdraw from business and seek repose i will not burden him with a purchase but i will ask him to take full possession of a coal tract of the land without paying a cent simply conditioning that he shall mine and throw the coal into market at his own cost and pay to you and all of you what he thinks is a fair portion of the profits accruing you can do as you please with the rest of the land therefore send me to elmira information about the coal deposits so framed that he can comprehend the matter and can intelligently instruct an agent how to find it and go to work tomorrow night i appear for the first time before a boston audience critics and on the success of this matter depends my future success in new england but i am not distressed nasby is in the same boat tonight decides the fate of his brandnew lecture he has just left my room been reading his lecture to me was greatly depressed i have convinced him that he has little to fear i get just about five hundred more applications to lecture than i can possibly fill and in the west they say charge all you please but come i shant go west at all i stop lecturing the d of january sure but i shall talk every night up to that time they flood me with highpriced invitations to write for magazines and papers and publishers besiege me to write books cant do any of these things i am twentytwo thousand dollars in debt and shall earn the money and pay it within two years and therefore i am not spending any money except when it is necessary i had my life insured for yesterday what ever became of mr moffett s life insurance for the benefit of my natural heirs the same being my mother for livy wouldnt claim it you may be sure of that this has taken out of my pocket which i was going to send to ma but i will send her some soon tell orion to keep a stiff upper lip when the worst comes to the worst i will come forward must talk in providence r i tonight must leave now i thank mollie and orion and the rest for your letters but you see how i am pushed ought to have clerks affectionately sam by the end of january more than thirty thousand copies of the innocents had been sold and in a letter to his publisher the author expressed his satisfaction to elisha bliss in hartford elmira jan friend bliss yes i am satisfied with the way you are running the book you are running it in staving tiptop firstclass style i never wander into any corner of the country but i find that an agent has been there before me and many of that community have read the book and on an average about ten people a day come and hunt me up to thank me and tell me im a benefactor i guess this is a part of the programme we didnt expect in the first place i think you are rushing this book in a manner to be proud of and you will make the finest success of it that has ever been made with a subscription book i believe what with advertising establishing agencies c you have got an enormous lot of machinery under way and hard at work in a wonderfully short space of time it is easy to see when one travels around that one must be endowed with a deal of genuine generalship in order to maneuvre a publication whose line of battle stretches from end to end of a great continent and whose foragers and skirmishers invest every hamlet and besiege every village hidden away in all the vast space between ill back you against any publisher in america bliss or elsewhere yrs as ever clemens there is another letter written just at this time which of all letters must not be omitted here only five years earlier mark twain poor and comparatively unknown had been carrying water while jim gillis and dick stoker washed out the pans of dirt in search of the gold pocket which they did not find clemens must have received a letter from gillis referring to some particular occasion but it has disappeared the reply however always remained one of james gilliss treasured possessions to james gillis in his cabin on jackass hill tuolumne co california elmira ny jan dear jim i remember that old night just as well and somewhere among my relics i have your remembrance stored away it makes my heart ache yet to call to mind some of those days still it shouldnt for right in the depths of their poverty and their pockethunting vagabondage lay the germ of my coming good fortune you remember the one gleam of jollity that shot across our dismal sojourn in the rain and mud of angels camp i mean that day we sat around the tavern stove and heard that chap tell about the frog and how they filled him with shot and you remember how we quoted from the yarn and laughed over it out there on the hillside while you and dear old stoker panned and washed i jotted the story down in my notebook that day and would have been glad to get ten or fifteen dollars for it i was just that blind but then we were so hard up i published that story and it became widely known in america india china england and the reputation it made for me has paid me thousands and thousands of dollars since four or five months ago i bought into the express i have ordered it sent to you as long as you live and if the book keeper sends you any bills you let me hear of it i went heavily in debt never could have dared to do that jim if we hadnt heard the jumping frog story that day and wouldnt i love to take old stoker by the hand and wouldnt i love to see him in his great specialty his wonderful rendition of rinalds in the burning shame where is dick and what is he doing give him my fervent love and warm old remembrances a week from today i shall be married to a girl even better and lovelier than the peerless chapparal quails you cant come so far jim but still i cordially invite you to come anyhow and i invite dick too and if you two boys were to land here on that pleasant occasion we would make you right royally welcome truly your friend saml l clemens p s california plums are good jim particularly when they are stewed steve gillis who sent a copy of his letter to the writer added dick stoker dear gentle unselfish old dickdied over three years ago aged i am sure it will be a melancholy pleasure to mark to know that dick lived in comfort all his later life sincerely loved and respected by all who knew him he never left jackass hill he struck a pocket years ago containing enough not only to build himself a comfortable house near his old cabin but to last him without work to his painless end he was a mason and was buried by the order in sonora the quails the beautiful the innocent the wild little quails lived way out in the chapparal on a little ranch near the stanislaus river with their father and mother they were famous for their beauty and had many suitors the mention of california plums refers to some inedible fruit which gillis once out of pure goodness of heart bought of a poor wandering squaw and then to conceal his motive declared that they were something rare and fine and persisted in eating them though even when stewed they nearly choked him x letters mark twain in buffalo marriage the buffalo express memoranda lectures a new book samuel l clemens and olivia langdon were married in the langdon home at elmira february and took up their residence in buffalo in a beautiful home a wedding present from the brides father the story of their wedding and the amusing circumstances connected with their establishment in buffalo have been told elsewhere mark twain a biography chap lxxiv mark twain now believed that he was through with lecturing two letters to redpath his agent express his comfortable condition to james redpath in boston buffalo march dear red i

menagerie parton and all and make comments in next galaxy i give nasbys friend and mine from philadelphia john quill a literary thief a hyste yours always and after mark the reference to the galaxy in the foregoing letter has to do with a department called memoranda which he had undertaken to conduct for the new magazine this work added substantially to his income and he believed it would be congenial he was allowed free hand to write and print what he chose and some of his best work at this time was published in the new department which he continued for a year mark twain now seemed to have his affairs well regulated his mother and sister were no longer far away in st louis soon after his marriage they had by his advice taken up residence at fredonia new york where they could be easily visited from buffalo altogether the outlook seemed bright to mark twain and his wife during the first months of their marriage then there came a change in a letter which clemens wrote to his mother and sister we get the first chapter of disaster to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in fredonia n y elmira n y june my dear mother and sister we were called here suddenly by telegram days ago mr langdon is very low we have wellnigh lost hope all of us except livy mr langdon whose hope is one of his most prominent characteristics says himself this morning that his recovery is only a possibility not a probability he made his will this morning that is appointed executors nothing else was necessary the household is sad enough charley is in bavaria we telegraphed munroe co paris to notify charley to come home they sent the message to munich our message left here at in the morning and charleys answer arrived less than eight hours afterward he sailed immediately he will reach home two weeks from now the whole city is troubled as i write at the office a dispatch arrives from charley who has reached london and will sail thence on th he wants news we cannot send him any affectionately sam p s i sent to fredonia bank for ma it is in her name mrs clemens herself was not in the best of health at this time but devotion to her father took her to his bedside where she insisted upon standing long hard watches the strain of which told upon her severely meantime work must go on the daily demand of the newspaper and the monthly call of the memoranda could not go unheeded also bliss wanted a new book and met mark twain at elmira to arrange for it in a letter to orion we learn of this project to orion clemens in st louis elmira july my dear bro per contract i must have another page book ready for my publisher jan z and i only began it today the subject of it is a secret because i may possibly change it but as it stands i propose to do up nevada and cal beginning with the trip across the country in the stage have you a memorandum of the route we took or the names of any of the stations we stopped at do you remember any of the scenes names incidents or adventures of the coach trip for i remember next to nothing about the matter jot down a foolscap page of items for me i wish i could have two days talk with you i suppose i am to get the biggest copyright this time ever paid on a subscription book in this country give our love to mollie mr langdon is very low yr bro sam the biggest copyright mentioned in this letter was a royalty of per cent which bliss had agreed to pay on the retail price of the book the book was roughing it though this title was not decided upon until considerably later orion clemens eagerly furnished a detailed memorandum of the route of their overland journey which brought this enthusiastic acknowledgment to orion clemens in st louis buf dear bro i find that your little memorandum book is going to be ever so much use to me and will enable me to make quite a coherent narrative of the plains journey instead of slurring it over and jumping miles at a stride the book i am writing will sell in return for the use of the little memorandum book i shall take the greatest pleasure in forwarding to you the third which the publisher of the forthcoming work sends me or the first i am not particular they will both be in the first quarterly statement of account from the publisher in great haste yr obliged bro sam love to mollie we are all getting along tolerably well mr langdon died early in august and mrs clemens returned to buffalo exhausted in mind and body if she hoped for rest now in the quiet of her own home she was disappointed as the two brief letters that follow clearly show to mrs moffett in fredonia n y buffalo aug my dear sister i know i ought to be thrashed for not writing you but i have kept putting it off we get heaps of letters every day it is a comfort to have somebody like you that will let us shirk and be patient over it we got the book and i did think i wrote a line thanking you for itbut i suppose i neglected it we are getting along tolerably well mother mrs langdon is here and miss emma nye livy cannot sleep since her fathers death but i give her a narcotic every night and make her i am just as busy as i can be am still writing for the galaxy and also writing a book like the innocents in size and style i have got my work ciphered down to days and i havent a single day to spare between this and the date which by written contract i am to deliver the ms of the book to the publisher in a hurry affectionately sam to orion clemens in st louis buf sept th my dear bro o here i dont want to be consulted at all about tenn i dont want it even mentioned to me when i make a suggestion it is for you to act upon it or throw it aside but i beseech you never to ask my advice opinion or consent about that hated property if it was because i felt the slightest personal interest in the infernal land that i ever made a suggestion the suggestion would never be made do exactly as you please with the land always remember this that so trivial a percentage as ten per cent will never sell it it is only a bid for a somnambulist i have no time to turn round a young lady visitor schoolmate of livys is dying in the house of typhoid fever parents are in south carolina and the premises are full of nurses and doctors and we are all fagged out yrs sam miss nye who had come to cheer her old schoolmate had been prostrated with the deadly fever soon after her arrival another period of anxiety and nursing followed mrs clemens in spite of her frail health devoted much time to her dying friend until by the time the end came she was herself in a precarious condition this was at the end of september a little more than a month later november th her first child langdon clemens was prematurely born to the rev joseph h twichell and wife of hartford mark twain characteristically announced the new arrival to rev joseph h twichell and wife in hartford conn buffalo nov dear uncle and aunt i came into the world on the th inst and consequently am about five days old now i have had wretched health ever since i made my appearance first one thing and then another has kept me under the weather and as a general thing i have been chilly and uncomfortable i am not corpulent nor am i robust in any way at birth i only weighed pounds with my clothes on and the clothes were the chief feature of the weight too i am obliged to confess but i am doing finely all things considered i was at a standstill for days and a half but during the last hours i have gained nearly an ounce avoirdupois they all say i look very old and venerableand i am aware myself that i never smile life seems a serious thing what i have seen of it and my observation teaches me that it is made up mainly of hiccups unnecessary washings and colic but no doubt you who are old have long since grown accustomed and reconciled to what seems to me such a disagreeable novelty my father said this morning when my face was in repose and thoughtful that i looked precisely as young edward twichell of hartford used to look some is months ago chin mouth forehead expression everything my little mother is very bright and cheery and i guess she is pretty happy but i dont know what about she laughs a great deal notwithstanding she is sick abed and she eats a great deal though she says that is because the nurse desires it and when she has had all the nurse desires her to have she asks for more she is getting along very well indeed my aunt susie crane has been here some ten days or two weeks but goes home today and granny fairbanks of cleveland arrives to take her place mrs fairbanks of the quaker city excursion very lovingly langdon clemens p s father said i had better write because you would be more interested in me just now than in the rest of the family clemens had made the acquaintance of the rev joseph hopkins twichell and his wife during his several sojourns in hartford in connection with his book publication and the two men had immediately become firm friends twichell had come to elmira in february to the wedding to assist rev thos k beecher in the marriage ceremony joseph twichell was a devout christian while mark twain was a doubter even a scoffer where orthodoxy was concerned yet the sincerity and humanity of the two men drew them together their friendship was lifelong a second letter to twichell something more than a month later shows a somewhat improved condition in the clemens household to rev twichell in hartford buf dec th dear j h all is well with us i believe though for some days the baby was quite ill we consider him nearly restored to health now however ask my brother about us you will find him at blisss publishing office where he is gone to edit blisss new paper left here last monday make his and his wifes acquaintance take mrs t to see them as soon as they are fixed livy is up and the prince keeps her busy and anxious these latter days and nights but i am a bachelor up stairs and dont have to jump up and get the soothing syrup though i would as soon do it as not i assure you livy will be certain to read this letter tell harmony mrs t that i do hold the baby and do it pretty handily too although with occasional apprehensions that his loose head will fall off i dont have to quiet him he hardly ever utters a cry he is always thinking about something he is a patient good little baby smoke i always smoke from till sunday afternoons and in new york the other day i smoked a week day and night but when livy is well i smoke only those two hours on sunday im boss of the habit now and shall never let it boss me any more originally i quit solely on livys account not that i believed there was the faintest reason in the matter but just as i would deprive myself of sugar in my coffee if she wished it or quit wearing socks if she thought them immoral and i stick to it yet on livys account and shall always continue to do so without a pang but somehow it seems a pity that you quit for mrs t didnt mind it if i remember rightly ah it is turning ones back upon a kindly providence to spurn away from us the good creature he sent to make the breath of life a luxury as well as a necessity enjoyable as well as useful to go and quit smoking when then aint any sufficient excuse for it why my old boy when they use to tell me i would shorten my life ten years by smoking they little knew the devotee they were wasting their puerile word upon they little knew how trivial and valueless i would regard a decade that had no smoking in it but i wont persuade you twichell i wont until i see you again but then well smoke for a week together and then shut off again i would have gone to hartford from new york last saturday but i got so homesick i couldnt but maybe ill come soon no sir catch me in the metropolis again to get homesick i didnt know warner had a book out we send oceans and continents of love i have worked myself down today yrs always mark with his establishment in buffalo clemens as already noted had persuaded his sister now a widow and his mother to settle in fredonia not far away later he had found a position for orion as editor of a small paper which bliss had established what with these several diversions and the sorrows and sicknesses of his own household we can readily imagine that literary work had been performed under difficulties certainly humorous writing under such disturbing conditions could not have been easy nor could we expect him to accept an invitation to be present and make a comic speech at an agricultural dinner even though horace greeley would preside however he sent to the secretary of the association a letter which might be read at the gathering to a b crandall in woodberry falls n y to be read at an agricultural dinner buffalo dec gentlemen i thank you very much for your invitation to the agricultural dinner and would promptly accept it and as promptly be there but for the fact that mr greeley is very busy this month and has requested me to clandestinely continue for him in the tribune the articles what i know about farming consequently the necessity of explaining to the readers of that journal why buttermilk cannot be manufactured profitably at cents a quart out of butter that costs cents a pound compels my stay at home until the article is written with reiterated thanks i am yours truly mark twain in this letter mark twain made the usual mistake as to the title of the greeley farming series what i know of farming being the correct form the buffalo express under mark twains management had become a sort of repository for humorous efforts often of an indifferent order some of these things signed by nom de plumes were charged to mark twain when bret hartes heathen chinee devastated the country and was so widely parodied an imitation of it entitled three aces and signed carl byng was printed in the express thomas bailey aldrich then editor of every saturday had not met mark twain and noticing the verses printed in the exchanges over his signature was one of those who accepted them as mark twains work he wrote rather an uncomplimentary note in every saturday concerning the poem and its authorship characterizing it as a feeble imitation of bret hartes heathen chinee clemens promptly protested to aldrich then as promptly regretted having done so feeling that he was making too much of a small matter hurriedly he sent a second brief note to thomas bailey aldrich editor of every saturday boston massachusetts buffalo jan dear sir please do not publish the note i sent you the other day about hy slocums plagiarism entitled three aces it is not important enough for such a long paragraph webb writes me that he has put in a paragraph about it too and i have requested him to suppress it if you would simply state in a line and a half under literary notes that you mistook one hy slocum no it was one carl byng i perceive carl byng for mark twain and that it was the former who wrote the plagiarism entitled three aces i think that would do a fair justice without any unseemly display but it is hard to be accused of plagiarism a crime i never have committed in my life yrs truly mark twain but this came too late aldrich replied that he could not be prevented from doing him justice as fortytwo thousand copies of the first note with the editors apology duly appended were already in press he would withdraw his apology in the next number of every saturday if mark twain said so mark twains response this time assumed the proportions of a letter to thomas bailey aldrich in boston delaware st buffalo jan dear mr aldrich no indeed dont take back the apology hang it i dont want to abuse a mans civility merely because he gives me the chance i hear a good deal about doing things on the spur of the moment i invariably regret the things i do on the spur of the moment that disclaimer of mine was a case in point i am ashamed every time i think of my bursting out before an unconcerned public with that bombastic powwow about burning publishers letters and all that sort of imbecility and about my not being an imitator etc who would find out that i am a natural fool if i kept always cool and never let nature come to the surface nobody but i did hate to be accused of plagiarizing bret harte who trimmed and trained and schooled me patiently until he changed me from an awkward utterer of coarse grotesquenesses to a writer of paragraphs and chapters that have found a certain favor in the eyes of even some of the very decentest people in the land and this grateful remembrance of mine ought to be worth its face seeing that bret broke our long friendship a year ago without any cause or provocation that i am aware of well it is funny the reminiscences that glare out from murky corners of ones memory now and then without warning just at this moment a picture flits before me scene private room in barnums restaurant virginia nevada present artemus ward joseph t goodman editor and proprietor daily enterprise and dan de quille and myself reporters for same remnants of the feast thin and scattering but such tautology and repetition of empty bottles everywhere visible as to be offensive to the sensitive eye time am artemus thickly reciting a poem about a certain infant you wot of and interrupting himself and being interrupted every few lines by poundings of the table and shouts of splendid by shorzhe finally a long vociferous poundiferous and vitreous jingling of applause announces the conclusion and then artemus let every man at loves his fellow man and preciates a poet at loves his fellow man stan up stan up and drink health and long life to thomas bailey aldrich and drink it stanning on all hands fervent enthusiastic and sincerely honest attempts to comply then artemus well consider it stanning and drink it just as ye are which was done you must excuse all this stuff from a stranger for the present and when i see you i will apologize in full do you know the prettiest fancy and the neatest that ever shot through hartes brain it was this when they were trying to decide upon a vignette for the cover of the overland a grizzly bear of the arms of the state of california was chosen nahl bras carved him and the page was printed with him in it looking thus rude sketch of a grizzly bear as a bear he was a success he was a good bear but then it was objected that he was an objectless bear a bear that meant nothing in particular signified nothing simply stood there snarling over his shoulder at nothing and was painfully and manifestly a boorish and illnatured intruder upon the fair page all hands said that none were satisfied they hated badly to give him up and yet they hated as much to have him there when there was no paint to him but presently harte took a pencil and drew these two simple lines under his feet and behold he was a magnificent success the ancient symbol of california savagery snarling at the approaching type of high and progressive civilization the first overland locomotive sketch of a small section of railway track i just think that was nothing less than inspiration itself once more i apologize and this time i do it stanning yrs truly saml l clemens the two simple lines of course were the train rails under the bears feet and completed the striking cover design of the overland monthly the brief controversy over the three aces was the beginning of along and happy friendship between aldrich and mark twain howells aldrich twichell and charles dudley warner these were mark twains intimates men that he loved each for his own special charm and worth aldrich he considered the most brilliant of living men in his reply to clemenss letter aldrich declared that he was glad now that for the sake of such a letter he had accused him falsely and added mem always abuse people when you come to boston if you do not make your presence manifest to me ill put in a in every saturday to the effect that though you are generally known as mark twain your favorite nom de plume is barry gray clemens did not fail to let aldrich know when he was in boston again and the little coterie of younger writers forgathered to give him welcome buffalo agreed with neither mrs clemens nor the baby what with nursing and anguish of mind mark twain found that he could do nothing on the new book and that he must give up his magazine department he had lost interest in his paper and his surroundings in general journalism and authorship are poor yokemates to onion clemens at this time editing blisss paper at hartford he explained the situation to onion clemens in hartford buffalo th my dear bro what i wanted of the liar sketch was to work it into the california book which i shall do but day before yesterday i concluded to go out of the galaxy on the strength of it so i have turned it into the last memoranda i shall ever write and published it as a specimen chapter of my forthcoming book i have written the galaxy people that i will never furnish them another article long or short for any price but cash and have requested them not to ask me for contributions any more even at that price i hope that lets them out for i will stick to that now do try and leave me clear out of the publisher for the present for i am endangering my reputation by writing too much i want to get out of the public view for awhile i am still nursing livy night and day and cannot write anything i am nearly worn out we shall go to elmira ten days hence if livy can travel on a mattress then and stay there till i have finished the california book say three months but i cant begin work right away when i get there must have a weeks rest for i have been through days terrific siege that makes it after the middle of march before i can go fairly to work and then ill have to hump myself and not lose a moment you and bliss just put yourselves in my place and you will see that my hands are full and more than full when i told bliss in n y that i would write something for the publisher i could not know that i was just about to lose fifty days do you see the difference it makes just as soon as ever i can i will send some of the book ms but right in the first chapter i have got to alter the whole style of one of my characters and rewrite him clear through to where i am now it is no fool of a job i can tell you but the book will be greatly bettered by it hold on a few days four or five and i will see if i can get a few chapters fixed to send to bliss i have offered this dwelling house and the express for sale and when we go to elmira we leave here for good i shall not select a new home till the book is finished but we have little doubt that hartford will be the place we are almost certain of that ask bliss how it would be to ship our furniture to hartford rent an upper room in a building and unbox it and store it there where somebody can frequently look after it is not the idea good the furniture is worth or and must not be jammed into any kind of a place and left unattended to for a year the first man that offers for our house can take it it cost that what are taxes there here all bunched together of all kinds they are per cent simply ruin the things you have written in the publisher are tiptop in haste yr bro sam there are no further letters until the end of april by which time the situation had improved clemens had sold his interest in the express though at a loss had severed his magazine connection and was located at quarry farm on a beautiful hilltop above elmira the home of mrs clemenss sister mrs theodore crane the pure air and rest of that happy place where they were to spend so many idyllic summers had proved beneficial to the sick ones and work on the new book progressed in consequence then mark twains old editor joe goodman came from virginia city for a visit and his advice and encouragement were of the greatest value clemens even offered to engage goodman on a salary to remain until he had finished his book goodman declined the salary but extended his visit and mark twain at last seems to have found himself working under ideal conditions he jubilantly reports his progress to elisha bliss in hartford elmira monday may th friend bliss yrs recd enclosing check for the old innocents holds out handsomely i have ms enough on hand now to make allowing for engravings about pages of the book consequently am twothirds done i intended to run up to hartford about the middle of the week and take it along because it has chapters in it that ought by all means to be in the prospectus but i find myself so thoroughly interested in my work now a thing i have not experienced for months that i cant bear to lose a single moment of the inspiration so i will stay here and peg away as long as it lasts my present idea is to write as much more as i have already written and then cull from the mass the very best chapters and discard the rest i am not half as well satisfied with the first part of the book as i am with what i am writing now when i get it done i want to see the man who will begin to read it and not finish it if it falls short of the innocents in any respect i shall lose my guess when i was writing the innocents my daily stunt was pages of ms and i hardly ever got beyond it but i have gone over that nearly every day for the last ten that shows that i am writing with a redhot interest nothing grieves me now nothing troubles me nothing bothers me or gets my attention i dont think of anything but the book and i dont have an hours unhappiness about anything and dont care two cents whether school keeps or not it will be a bully book if i keep up my present lick three weeks more i shall be able and willing to scratch out half of the chapters of the overland narrative and shall do it you do not mention having received my second batch of ms sent a week or two ago about pages if you want to issue a prospectus and go right to canvassing say the word and i will forward some more ms or send it by hand special messenger whatever chapters you think are unquestionably good we will retain of course so they can go into a prospectus as well one time as another the book will be done soon now i have pages of ms already written and am now writing a week more than that in fact during the past week wrote one day then and hows that it will be a starchy book and should be full of snappy pictures especially pictures worked in with the letterpress the dedication will be worth the price of the volume thus to the late cain this book is dedicated not on account of respect for his memory for it merits little respect not on account of sympathy with him for his bloody deed placed him without the pale of sympathy strictly speaking but out of a mere human commiseration for him that it was his misfortune to live in a dark age that knew not the beneficent insanity plea i think it will do yrs clemens p s the reaction is beginning and my stock is looking up i am getting the bulliest offers for books and almanacs am flooded with lecture invitations and one periodical offers me cash for articles of any length and on any subject treated humorously or otherwise the suggested dedication to the late cain may have been the humoristic impulse of the moment at all events it did not materialize clemenss enthusiasm for work was now such that he agreed with redpath to return to the platform that autumn and he began at once writing lectures his disposal of the buffalo paper had left him considerably in debt and platforming was a sure and quick method of retrenchment more than once in the years ahead mark twain would return to travel and onenight stands to lift a burden of debt brief letters to redpath of this time have an interest and even a humor of their own letters to james redpath in boston elmira june dear red wrote another lecture a third onetoday it is the one i am going to deliver i think i shall call it reminiscences of some pleasant characters whom i have met or should the whom be left out it covers my whole acquaintance kings lunatics idiots and all suppose you give the item a start in the boston papers if i write fifty lectures i shall only choose one and talk that one only no sir dont you put that scarecrow portrait from the galaxy in i wont stand that nightmare yours mark elmira july dear redpath i never made a success of a lecture delivered in a church yet people are afraid to laugh in a church they cant be made to do it in any possible way success to falls carbuncle and many happy returns yours mark to mr fall in boston elmira n y july friend fall redpath tells me to blow up here goes i wanted you to scare rondout off with a big price aint big i got the first time i ever talked there and now they have a much larger hall it is a hard town to get to i run a chance of getting caught by the ice and missing next engagement make the price and let them draw out yours mark letters to james redpath in boston hartford tuesday aug dear red i am different from other women my mind changes oftener people who have no mind can easily be steadfast and firm but when a man is loaded down to the guards with it as i am every heavy sea of foreboding or inclination maybe of indolence shifts the cargo see therefore if you will notice one week i am likely to give rigid instructions to confine me to new england next week send me to arizona the next week withdraw my name the next week give you full untrammelled swing and the week following modify it you must try to keep the run of my mind redpath it is your business being the agent and it always was too many for me it appears to me to be one of the finest pieces of mechanism i have ever met with now about the west this week i am willing that you shall retain all the western engagements but what i shall want next week is still with god let us not profane the mysteries with soiled hands and prying eyes of sin yours mark p s shall be here weeks will run up there when nasby comes elmira n y sept dear redpath i wish you would get me released from the lecture at buffalo i mortally hate that society there and i dont doubt they hired me i once gave them a packed house free of charge and they never even had the common politeness to thank me they left me to shift for myself too a la bret harte at harvard get me rid of buffalo otherwise ill have no recourse left but to get sick the day i lecture there i can get sick easy enough by the simple process of saying the word well never mind what word i am not going to lecture there yours mark buffalo sept dear redpath we have thought it all over and decided that we cant possibly talk after feb we shall take up our residence in hartford days from now yours mark xi letters removal to hartford a lecture tour roughing it first letter to howells the house they had taken in hartford was the hooker property on forest street a handsome place in a distinctly literary neighborhood harriet beecher stowe charles dudley warner and other wellknown writers were within easy walking distance twichell was perhaps half a mile away it was the proper environment for mark twain he settled his little family there and was presently at redpaths office in boston which was a congenial place as we have seen before he did not fail to return to the company of nasby josh billings and those others of redpaths attractions as long and as often as distance would permit bret harte who by this time had won fame was also in boston now and frequently with howells aldrich and mark twain gathered in some quiet restaurant corner for a luncheon that lasted through a dim winter afternoon a period of anecdote reminiscence and mirth they were all young then and laughed easily howells has written of one such luncheon given by ralph keeler a young californian a gathering at which james t fields was present nothing remains to me of the happy time but a sense of idle and aimless and joyful talkplay beginning and ending nowhere of eager laughter of countless good stories from fields of a heatlightning shimmer of wit from aldrich of an occasional concentration of our joint mockeries upon our host who took it gladly but a lecture circuit cannot be restricted to the radius of boston clemens was presently writing to redpath from washington and points farther west to james redpath in boston washington tuesday oct dear red i have come square out thrown reminiscences overboard and taken artemus ward humorist for my subject wrote it here on friday and saturday and read it from ms last night to an enormous house it suits me and ill never deliver the nasty nauseous reminiscences any more yours mark the artemus ward lecture lasted eleven days then he wrote to redpath and fall in boston buffalo depot dec redpath fall boston notify all hands that from this time i shall talk nothing but selections from my forthcoming book roughing it tried it last night suits me tiptop saml l clemens the roughing it chapters proved a success and continued in high favor through the rest of the season to james redpath in boston logansport ind jan friend redpath had a splendid time with a splendid audience in indianapolis last night a perfectly jammed house just as i have had all the time out here i like the new lecture but i hate the artemus ward talk and wont talk it any more no man ever approved that choice of subject in my hearing i think give me some comfort if i am to talk in new york am i going to have a good house i dont care now to have any appointments cancelled ill even fetch those dutch pennsylvanians with this lecture have paid up indebtedness you are the last on my list shall begin to pay you in a few days and then i shall be a free man again yours mark with his debts paid clemens was anxious to be getting home two weeks following the above he wrote redpath that he would accept no more engagements at any price outside of new england and added the fewer engagements i have from this time forth the better i shall be pleased by the end of february he was back in hartford refusing an engagement in boston and announcing to redpath if i had another engagement id rot before id fill it from which we gather that he was not entirely happy in the lecture field as a matter of fact mark twain loathed the continuous travel and nightly drudgery of platform life he was fond of entertaining and there were moments of triumph that repaid him for a good deal but the tyranny of a schedule and timetables was a constant exasperation meantime roughing it had appeared and was selling abundantly mark twain free of debt and in pleasant circumstances felt that the outlook was bright it became even more so when in march the second child a little girl susy was born with no attending misfortunes but then in the early summer little langdon died it was seldom during all of mark twains life that he enjoyed more than a brief period of unmixed happiness it was in june of that year that clemens wrote his first letter to william dean howells the first of several hundred that would follow in the years to come and has in it something that is characteristic of nearly all the clemenshowells letters a kind of tender playfulness that answered to something in howellss makeup his sense of humor his wide knowledge of a humanity which he pictured so amusingly to the world to william dean howells in boston hartford june friend howells could you tell me how i could get a copy of your portrait as published in hearth and home i hear so much talk about it as being among the finest works of art which have yet appeared in that journal that i feel a strong desire to see it is it suitable for framing i have written the publishers of h h time and again but they say that the demand for the portrait immediately exhausted the edition and now a copy cannot be had even for the european demand which has now begun bret harte has been here and says his family would not be without that portrait for any consideration he says his children get up in the night and yell for it i would give anything for a copy of that portrait to put up in my parlor i have oliver wendell holmes and bret hartes as published in every saturday and of all the swarms that come every day to gaze upon them none go away that are not softened and humbled and made more resigned to the will of god if i had yours to put up alongside of them i believe the combination would bring more souls to earnest reflection and ultimate conviction of their lost condition than any other kind of warning would where in the nation can i get that portrait here are heaps of people that want it that need it there is my uncle he wants a copy he is lying at the point of death he has been lying at the point of death for two years he wants a copy and i want him to have a copy and i want you to send a copy to the man that shot my dog i want to see if he is dead to every human instinct now you send me that portrait i am sending you mine in this letter and am glad to do it for it has been greatly admired people who are judges of art find in the execution a grandeur which has not been equalled in this country and an expression which has not been approached in any yrs truly s l clemens p s copies of roughing it sold and delivered in months the clemens family did not spend the summer at quarry farm that year the sea air was prescribed for mrs clemens and the baby and they went to saybrook connecticut to fenwick hall clemens wrote very little though he seems to have planned tom sawyer and perhaps made its earliest beginning which was in dramatic form his mind however was otherwise active he was always more or less given to inventions and in his next letter we find a description of one which he brought to comparative perfection he had also conceived the idea of another book of travel and this was his purpose of a projected trip to england to orion clemens in hartford fenwick hall saybrook conn aug my dear bro i shall sail for england in the scotia aug but what i wish to put on record now is my new invention hence this note which you will preserve it is this a selfpasting scrapbook good enough idea if some juggling tailor does not come along and antedate me a couple of months as in the case of the elastic veststrap the nuisance of keeping a scrapbook is one never has paste or gum tragacanth handy mucilage wont stick or stay weeks mucilage sucks out the ink and makes the scraps unreadable to daub and paste or pages of scraps is tedious slow nasty and tiresome my idea is this make a scrapbook with leaves veneered or coated with gumstickum of some kind wet the page with sponge brush rag or tongue and dab on your scraps like postage stamps lay on the gum in columns of stripes each stripe of gum the length of say ems small pica and as broad as your finger a blank about as broad as your finger between each stripes so in wetting the paper you need not wet any more of the gum than your scrap or scraps will cover then you may shut up the book and the leaves wont stick together preserve also the envelope of this letter postmark ought to be good evidence of the date of this great humanizing and civilizing invention ill put it into dan slotes hands and tell him he must send you all over america to urge its use upon stationers and booksellers so dont buy into a newspaper the name of this thing is mark twains selfpasting scrapbook all well here shall be up a p m tuesday send the carriage yr bro s l clemens the dan slote of this letter is of course his old quaker city shipmate who was engaged in the blankbook business the firm being slote woodman located at and william street new york xii letters mark twain in england london honors acquaintance with dr john brown a lecture triumph the gilded age clemens did in fact sail for england on the given date and was lavishly received there all literary london joined in giving him a good time he had not as yet been received seriously by the older american men of letters but england made no question as to his title to first rank already too they classified him as of the human type of lincoln and reveled in him without stint howells writes in england rank fashion and culture rejoiced in him lord mayors lord chief justices and magnates of many kinds were his hosts he was treated so well and enjoyed it all so much that he could not write a book the kind of book he had planned one could not poke fun at a country or a people that had welcomed him with open arms he made plenty of notes at first but presently gave up the book idea and devoted himself altogether to having a good time he had one grievance a publisher by the name of hotten a sort of literary harpy of which there were a great number in those days of defective copyright not merely content with pilfering his early work had reprinted under the name of mark twain the work of a mixed assortment of other humorists an offensive volume bearing the title screamers and eyeopeners by mark twain they besieged him to lecture in london and promised him overflowing houses artemus ward during his last days had earned london by storm with his platform humor and they promised mark twain even greater success for some reason however he did not welcome the idea perhaps there was too much gaiety to mrs clemens he wrote to mrs clemens in hartford london sep livy darling everybody says lecturelecturelecture but i have not the least idea of doing it certainly not at present mr dolby who took dickens to america is coming to talk business to me tomorrow though i have sent him word once before that i cant be hired to talk here because i have no time to spare there is too much sociability i do not get along fast enough with work tomorrow i lunch with mr toole and a member of parliament toole is the most able comedian of the day and then i am done for a while on tuesday i mean to hang a card to my keybox inscribed gone out of the city for a week and then i shall go to work and work hard one cant be caught in a hive of people like this i have got such a perfectly delightful razor i have a notion to buy some for charley theodore and slee for i know they have no such razors there i have got a neat little watchchain for annie i love you my darling my love to all of you saml that mark twain should feel and privately report something of his triumphs we need not wonder at certainly he was never one to give himself airs but to have the worlds great literary center paying court to him who only ten years before had been penniless and unknown and who once had been a barefoot tom sawyer in hannibal was quite startling it is gratifying to find evidence of human weakness in the following hearttoheart letter to his publisher especially in view of the relating circumstances to elisha bliss in hartford london sept friend bliss i have been received in a sort of tremendous way tonight by the brains of london assembled at the annual dinner of the sheriffs of london mine being between you and me a name which was received with a flattering outburst of spontaneous applause when the long list of guests was called i might have perished on the spot but for the friendly support and assistance of my excellent friend sir john bennett and i want you to paste the enclosed in a couple of the handsomest copies of the innocents and roughing it and send them to him his address is sir john bennett cheapside london yrs truly s l clemens the relating circumstances were these at the abovementioned dinner there had been a rollcall of the distinguished guests present and each name had been duly applauded clemens conversing in a whisper with his neighbor sir john bennett did not give very close attention to the names applauding mechanically with the others finally a name was read that brought out a vehement handclapping mark twain not to be outdone in cordiality joined vigorously and kept his hands going even after the others finished then remarking the general laughter he whispered to sir john whose name was that we were just applauding mark twains we may believe that the friendly support of sir john bennett was welcome for the moment but the incident could do him no harm the diners regarded it as one of his jokes and enjoyed him all the more for it he was ready to go home by november but by no means had he had enough of england he really had some thought of returning there permanently in a letter to mrs crane at quarry farm he wrote if you and theodore will come over in the spring with livy and me and spend the summer you will see a country that is so beautiful that you will be obliged to believe in fairyland and theodore can browse with me among dusty old dens that look now as they looked five hundred years ago and puzzle over books in the british museum that were made before christ was born and in the customs of their public dinners and the ceremonies of every official act and the dresses of a thousand dignitaries trace the speech and manners of all the centuries that have dragged their lagging decades over england since the heptarchy fell asunder i would a good deal rather live here if i could get the rest of you over in a letter home to his mother and sister we get a further picture of his enjoyment to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett london nov my dear mother and sister i have been so everlasting busy that i couldnt write and moreover i have been so unceasingly lazy that i couldnt have written anyhow i came here to take notes for a book but i havent done much but attend dinners and make speeches but have had a jolly good time and i do hate to go away from these english folks they make a stranger feel entirely at home and they laugh so easily that it is a comfort to make afterdinner speeches here i have made hundreds of friends and last night in the crush of the opening of the new guildhall library and museum i was surprised to meet a familiar face every few steps nearly people of both sexes came and went during the evening so i had a good opportunity to make a great many new acquaintances livy is willing to come here with me next april and stay several months so i am going home next tuesday i would sail on saturday but that is the day of the lord mayors annual grand state dinner when they say of the great men of the city sit down to table a great many of them in their fine official and court paraphernalia so i must not miss it however i may yet change my mind and sail saturday i am looking at a fine magic lantern which will cost a deal of money and if i buy it sammy may come and learn to make the gas and work the machinery and paint pictures for it on glass i mean to give exhibitions for charitable purposes in hartford and charge a dollar a head in a hurry ys affly sam he sailed november th on the batavia arriving in new york two weeks later there had been a presidential election in his absence general grant had defeated horace greeley a result in some measure at least attributed to the amusing and powerful pictures of the cartoonist thomas nast mark twain admired greeleys talents but he regarded him as poorly qualified for the nations chief executive he wrote to th nast in morristown n j hartford nov nast you more than any other man have won a prodigious victory for grant i mean rather for civilization and progress those pictures were simply marvelous and if any man in the land has a right to hold his head up and be honestly proud of his share in this years vast events that man is unquestionably yourself we all do sincerely honor you and are proud of you mark twain perhaps mark twain was too busy at this time to write letters his success in england had made him more than ever popular in america and he could by no means keep up with the demands on him in january he contributed to the new york tribune some letters on the sandwich islands but as these were more properly articles they do not seem to belong here he refused to go on the lecture circuit though he permitted redpath to book him for any occasional appearance and it is due to one of these special engagements that we have the only letter preserved from this time it is to howells and written with that exaggeration with which he was likely to embellish his difficulties we are not called upon to believe that there were really any such demonstrations as those ascribed to warner and himself to w d howells in boston farmington ave hartford feb my dear howells i am in a sweat and warner is in another i told redpath some time ago i would lecture in boston any two days he might choose provided they were consecutive days i never dreamed of his choosing days during lent since that was his special horror but all at once he telegraphs me and hollers at me in ail manner of ways that i am booked for boston march of all days in the year and to make matters just as mixed and uncertain as possible i cant find out to save my life whether he means to lecture me on the th or not warners been in here swearing like a lunatic and saying he had written you to come on the th and i said you leatherhead if i talk in boston both afternoon and evening march ill have to go to boston the th and then he just kicked up his heels and went off cursing after a fashion i never heard of before now lets just leave this thing to providence for hours you bet it will come out all right yours ever mark he was writing a book with warner at this time the gilded age the two authors having been challenged by their wives one night at dinner to write a better book than the current novels they had been discussing with some severity clemens already had a story in his mind and warner agreed to collaborate in the writing it was begun without delay clemens wrote the first three hundred and ninetynine pages and read there aloud to warner who took up the story at this point and continued it through twelve chapters after which they worked alternately and with great enjoyment they also worked rapidly and in april the story was completed for a collaboration by two men so different in temperament and literary method it was a remarkable performance another thing mark twain did that winter was to buy some land on farmington avenue and begin the building of a home he had by no means given up returning to england and made his plans to sail with mrs clemens and susy in may miss clara spaulding of elmira later mrs john b stanchfield of new york a girlhood friend of mrs clemens was to accompany them the daily graphic heard of the proposed journey and wrote asking for a farewell word his characteristic reply is the only letter of any kind that has survived from that spring to the editor of the daily graphic in new york city hartford apl ed graphic your note is received if the following two lines which i have cut from it are your natural handwriting then i understand you to ask me for a farewell letter in the name of the american people bless you the joy of the american people is just a little premature i havent gone yet and what is more i am not going to stay when i do go yes it is true i am only going to remain beyond the sea six months that is all i love stir and excitement and so the moment the spring birds begin to sing and the lagging weariness of summer to threaten i grow restless i get the fidgets i want to pack off somewhere where theres something going on but you know how that is you must have felt that way this very day i saw the signs in the air of the coming dullness and i said to myself how glad i am that i have already chartered a steamship there was absolutely nothing in the morning papers you can see for yourself what the telegraphic headings were by telegraph a father killed by his son a bloody fight in kentucky a court house fired and negroes therein shot while escaping a louisiana massacre an eightyearold murderer two to three hundred men roasted alive a town in a state of general riot a lively skirmish in indiana and thirty other similar headings the items under those headings all bear date yesterday apl refer to your own paper and i give you my word of honor that that string of commonplace stuff was everything there was in the telegraphic columns that a body could call news well said i to myself this is getting pretty dull this is getting pretty dry there dont appear to be anything going on anywhere has this progressive nation gone to sleep have i got to stand another month of this torpidity before i can begin to browse among the lively capitals of europe but never mindthings may revive while i am away during the last two months my nextdoor neighbor chas dudley warner has dropped his backlog studies and he and i have written a bulky novel in partnership he has worked up the fiction and i have hurled in the facts i consider it one of the most astonishing novels that ever was written night after night i sit up reading it over and over again and crying it will be published early in the fall with plenty of pictures do you consider this an advertisement and if so do you charge for such things when a man is your friend yours truly saml l clemens mark twain an amusing even if annoying incident happened about the time of mark twains departure a man named chew related to twichell a most entertaining occurrence twichell saw great possibilities in it and suggested that mark twain be allowed to make a story of it sharing the profits with chew chew agreed and promised to send the facts carefully set down twichell in the mean time told the story to clemens who was delighted with it and strongly tempted to write it at once while he was in the spirit without waiting on chew fortunately he did not do so for when chews material came it was in the form of a clipping the story having been already printed in some newspaper chews knowledge of literary ethics would seem to have been slight he thought himself entitled to something under the agreement with twichell mark twain by this time in london naturally had a different opinion to rev j h twichell in hartford london june dear old joe i consider myself wholly at liberty to decline to pay chew anything and at the same time strongly tempted to sue him into the bargain for coming so near ruining me if he hadnt happened to send me that thing in print i would have used the story like an innocent fool and would straightway have been hounded to death as a plagiarist it would have absolutely destroyed me i cannot conceive of a man being such a hopeless ass after serving as a legislative reporter too as to imagine that i or any other literary man in his senses would consent to chew over old stuff that had already been in print if that man wernt an infant in swaddling clothes his only reply to our petition would have been it has been in print it makes me as mad as the very old harry every time i think of mr chew and the frightfully narrow escape i have had at his hands confound mr chew with all my heart im willing that he should have ten dollars for his trouble of warming over his cold victuals cheerfully willing to that but no more if i had had him near when his letter came i would have got out my tomahawk and gone for him he didnt tell the story half as well as you did anyhow i wish to goodness you were here this moment nobody in our parlor but livy and me and a very good view of london to the fore we have a luxuriously ample suite of apartments in the langham hotel rd floor our bedroom looking straight up portland place and our parlor having a noble array of great windows looking out upon both streets portland place and the crook that joins it to regent street pm full twilight rich sunset tints lingering in the west i am not going to write anything rather tell it when i get back i love you and harmony and that is all the fresh news ive got anyway and i mean to keep that fresh all the time lovingly mark p s am luxuriating in glorious old pepys diary and smoking letters are exceedingly scarce through all this period mark twain now on his second visit to london was literally overwhelmed with honors and entertainment his rooms at the langham were like a court such men as robert browning turgenieff sir john millais and charles kingsley hastened to call kingsley and others gave him dinners mrs clemens to her sister wrote it is perfectly discouraging to try to write you the continuous excitement presently told on her in july all further engagements were canceled and clemens took his little family to scotland for quiet and rest they broke the journey at york and it was there that mark twain wrote the only letter remaining from this time part of a letter to mrs jervis langdon of elmira n y for the present we shall remain in this queer old walled town with its crooked narrow lanes that tell us of their old day that knew no wheeled vehicles its plasterandtimber dwellings with upper stories far overhanging the street and thus marking their date say three hundred years ago the stately city walls the castellated gates the ivygrown foliagesheltered most noble and picturesque ruin of st marys abbey suggesting their date say five hundred years ago in the heart of crusading times and the glory of english chivalry and romance the vast cathedral of york with its worn carvings and quaintly pictured windows preaching of still remoter days the outlandish names of streets and courts and byways that stand as a record and a memorial all these centuries of danish dominion here in still earlier times the hint here and there of king arthur and his knights and their bloody fights with saxon oppressors round about this old city more than thirteen hundred years gone by and last of all the melancholy old stone coffins and sculptured inscriptions a venerable arch and a hoary tower of stone that still remain and are kissed by the sun and caressed by the shadows every day just as the sun and the shadows have kissed and caressed them every lagging day since the roman emperors soldiers placed them here in the times when jesus the son of mary walked the streets of nazareth a youth with no more name or fame than the yorkshire boy who is loitering down this street this moment their destination was edinburgh where they remained a month mrs clemenss health gave way on their arrival there and her husband knowing the name of no other physician in the place looked up dr john brown author of rab and his friends and found in him not only a skilful practitioner but a lovable companion to whom they all became deeply attached little susy now seventeen months old became his special favorite he named her megalops because of her great eyes mrs clemens regained her strength and they returned to london clemens still urged to lecture finally agreed with george dolby to a weeks engagement and added a promise that after taking his wife and daughter back to america he would return immediately for a more extended course dolby announced him to appear at the queens concert rooms hanover square for the week of october his lecture to be the old sandwich islands talk that seven years before had brought him his first success the great hall the largest in london was thronged at each appearance and the papers declared that mark twain had no more than whetted the public appetite for his humor three days later october clemens with his little party sailed for home halfway across the ocean he wrote the friend they had left in scotland to dr john brown in edinburgh midatlantic oct our dear friend the doctor we have plowed a long way over the sea and theres twentytwo hundred miles of restless water between us now besides the railway stretch and yet you are so present with us so close to us that a span and a whisper would bridge the distance the first three days were stormy and wife child maid and miss spaulding were all seasick hours out of the and i was sorry i ever started however it has been smooth and balmy and sunny and altogether lovely for a day or two now and at night there is a broad luminous highway stretching over the sea to the moon over which the spirits of the sea are traveling up and down all through the secret night and having a genuine good time i make no doubt today they discovered a collie on board i find as per advertisement which i sent you that they wont carry dogs in these ships at any price this one has been concealed up to this time now his owner has to pay l or heave him overboard fortunately the doggie is a performing doggie and the money will be paid so after all it was just as well you didnt intrust your collie to us a poor little child died at midnight and was buried at dawn this morning sheeted and shotted and sunk in the middle of the lonely ocean in water three thousand fathoms deep pity the poor mother with our love s l clemens mark twain was back in london lecturing again at the queens concert rooms after barely a months absence charles warren stoddard whom he had known in california shared his apartment at the langham and acted as his secretary a very necessary office for he was besieged by callers and bombarded with letters he remained in london two months lecturing steadily at hanover square to full houses it is unlikely that there is any other platform record to match it one letter of this period has been preserved it is written to twichell near the end of his engagement to rev j h twichell in hartford london jan my dear old joe i knew you would be likely to graduate into an ass if i came away and so you have if you have stopped smoking however i have a strong faith that it is not too late yet and that the judiciously managed influence of a bad example will fetch you back again i wish you had written me some news livy tells me precious little she mainly writes to hurry me home and to tell me how much she respects me but shes generally pretty slow on news i had a letter from her along with yours today but she didnt tell me the book is out however its all right i hope to be home days from today and then ill see her and that will make up for a whole years dearth of news i am right down grateful that she is looking strong and lovelier than ever i only wish i could see her look her level best once i think it would be a vision i have just spent a good part of this day browsing through the royal academy exhibition of landseers paintings they fill four or five great salons and must number a good many hundreds this is the only opportunity ever to see them because the finest of them belong to the queen and she keeps them in her private apartments ah theyre wonderfully beautiful there are such rich moonlights and dusks in the challenge and the combat and in that long flight of birds across a lake in the subdued flush of sunset or sunrise for no man can ever tell tother from which in a picture except it has the filmy morning mist breathing itself up from the water and there is such a grave analytical profundity in the faces of the connoisseurs and such pathos in the picture of the fawn suckling its dead mother on a snowy waste with only the blood in the footprints to hint that she is not asleep and the way he makes animals absolute flesh and blood insomuch that if the room were darkened ever so little and a motionless living animal placed beside a painted one no man could tell which was which i interrupted myself here to drop a line to shirley brooks and suggest a cartoon for punch it was this in one of the academy salons in the suite where these pictures are a fine bust of landseer stands on a pedestal in the centre of the room i suggest that some of landseers best known animals be represented as having come down out of their frames in the moonlight and grouped themselves about the bust in mourning attitudes well old man i am powerful glad to hear from you and shall be powerful glad to see you and harmony i am not going to the provinces because i cannot get halls that are large enough i always felt cramped in hanover square rooms but i find that everybody here speaks with awe and respect of that prodigious place and wonder that i could fill it so long i am hoping to be back in days but i have so much to go home to and enjoy with a jubilant joy that it seems hardly possible that it can ever come to pass in so uncertain a world as this i have read the novel the gilded age published during his absence december here and i like it i have made no inquiries about it though my interest in a book ceases with the printing of it with a world of love saml xiii letters hartford and elmira a new study beginning tom sawyer the sellers play naturally redpath would not give him any peace now his london success must not be wasted at first his victim refused pointblank and with great brevity but he was overborne and persuaded and made occasional appearances wiring at last this final defiant word telegram to james redpath in boston hartford march james redpath why dont you congratulate me i never expect to stand on a lecture platform again after thursday night mark that he was glad to be home again we may gather from a letter sent at this time to doctor brown of edinburgh to dr john brown in edinburgh farmington avenue hartford feby my dear friend we are all delighted with your commendations of the gilded ageand the more so because some of our newspapers have set forth the opinion that warner really wrote the book and i only added my name to the title page in order to give it a larger sale i wrote the first eleven chapters every word and every line i also wrote chapters and portions of and so i wrote of the chapters entirely and part of others beside the fearful financial panic hit the book heavily for we published it in the midst of it but nevertheless in the weeks that have now elapsed since the day we published we have sold copies which gives l royalty to be divided between the authors this is really the largest twomonths sale which any american book has ever achieved unless one excepts the cheaper editions of uncle toms cabin the average price of our book is shillings a copy uncle tom was shillings a copy but for the panic our sale would have been doubled i verily believe i do not believe the sale will ultimately go over copies i shipped to you from liverpool barleys illustrations of judds margaret the waiter at the adelphi hotel agreeing to ship it securely per parcel delivery and i do hope it did not miscarry for we in america think a deal of barleys felix octavius carr barley illustrator of the works of irving cooper etc probably the most distinguished american illustrator of his time work i shipped the novel margaret to you from here a week ago indeed i am thankful for the wife and the child and if there is one individual creature on all this footstool who is more thoroughly and uniformly and unceasingly happy than i am i defy the world to produce him and prove him in my opinion he doesnt exist i was a mighty rough coarse unpromising subject when livy took charge of me years ago and i may still be to the rest of the world but not to her she has made a very creditable job of me success to the mark twain cluband the novel shibboleth of the whistle of course any member rising to speak would be required to preface his remark with a keen respectful whistle at the chairthe chair recognizing the speaker with an answering shriek and then as the speech proceeded its gravity and force would be emphasized and its impressiveness augmented by the continual interjection of whistles in place of punctuationpauses and the applause of the audience would be manifested in the same way theyve gone to luncheon and i must follow with strong love from us both your friend saml l clemens these were the days when the howells and clemens families began visiting back and forth between boston and hartford and sometimes aldrich came though less frequently and the gatherings at the homes of warner and clemens were full of nevertobeforgotten happiness of one such visit howells wrote in the goodfellowship of that cordial neighborhood we had two such days as the aging sun no longer shines on in his round there was constant running in and out of friendly houses where the lively hosts and guests called one another by their christian names or nicknames and no such vain ceremony as knocking or ringing at doors clemens was then building the stately mansion in which he satisfied his love of magnificence as if it had been another sealskin coat and he was at the crest of the prosperity which enabled him to humor every whim or extravagance it was the delight of such a visit that kept clemens constantly urging its repetition one cannot but feel the genuine affection of these letters to w d howells in boston mch my dear howells now you will find us the most reasonable people in the world we had thought of precipitating upon you george warner and wife one day twichell and his jewel of a wife another day and chas perkins and wife another only those simply members of our family they are but ill close the door against them all which will fix all of the lot except twichell who will no more hesitate to climb in at the back window than nothing and you shall go to bed when you please get up when you please talk when you please read when you please mrs howells may even go to new york saturday if she feels that she must but if some gentle unannoying coaxing can beguile her into putting that off a few days we shall be more than glad for i do wish she and mrs clemens could have a good square chance to get acquainted with each other but first and last and all the time we want you to feel untrammeled and wholly free from restraint here the date suits all dates suit yrs ever mark to w d howells in boston farmington avenue hartford mch dear howells you or aldrich or both of you must come to hartford to live mr hall who lives in the house next to mrs stowes just where we drive in to go to our new house will sell for or the lot is feet front and deep long time and easy payments on the purchase you can do your work just as well here as in cambridge cant you come will one of you boys buy that house now say yes mrs clemens is an invalid yet but is getting along pretty fairly we send best regards mark april found the clemens family in elmira mrs clemens was not overstrong and the cares of housebuilding were many they went early therefore remaining at the langdon home in the city until quarry farm should feel a touch of warmer sun clemens wrote the news to doctor brown to dr john brown in edinburgh elmira n y april dear doctor this town is in the interior of the state of new york and was my wifes birthplace we are here to spend the whole summer although it is so near summer we had a great snowstorm yesterday and one the day before this is rather breaking in upon our plans as it may keep us down here in the valley a trifle longer than we desired it gets fearfully hot here in the summer so we spend our summers on top of a hill or feet high about two or three miles from here it never gets hot up there mrs clemens is pretty strong and so is the little wifie barring a desperate cold in the head the child grows in grace and beauty marvellously i wish the nations of the earth would combine in a baby show and give us a chance to compete i must try to find one of her latest photographs to enclose in this and this reminds me that mrs clemens keeps urging me to ask you for your photograph and last night she said and be sure to ask him for a photograph of his sister and jockbut say master jock do not be headless and forget that courtesy he is jock in our memories and our talk but he has a right to his title when a body uses his name in a letter now i have got it all in i cant have made any mistake this time miss clara spaulding looked in a moment yesterday morning as bright and good as ever she would like to lay her love at your feet if she knew i was writing as would also fifty friends of ours whom you have never seen and whose homage is as fervent as if the cold and clouds and darkness of a mighty sea did not lie between their hearts and you poor old rab had not many friends at first but if all his friends of today could gather to his grave from the four corners of the earth what a procession there would be and rabs friends are your friends i am going to work when we get on the hilltill then ive got to lie fallow albeit against my will we join in love to you and yours your friend ever saml l clemens p s i enclose a specimen of villainy a man pretends to be my brother and my lecture agent gathers a great audience together in a city more than a thousand miles from here and then pockets the money and elopes leaving the audience to wait for the imaginary lecturer i am after him with the law it was a historic summer at the farm a new baby arrived in june a new study was built for mark twain by mrs crane on the hillside near the old quarry a new book was begun in it the adventures of tom sawyer and a play the first that mark twain had really attempted was completed the dramatization of the gilded age an early word went to hartford of conditions at the farm to rev and mrs twichell in hartford elmira june my dear old joe and harmony the baby is here and is the great american giantess weighing pounds we had to wait a good long time for her but she was full compensation when she did come the modoc was delighted with it and gave it her doll at once there is nothing selfish about the modoc she is fascinated with the new baby the modoc rips and tears around out doors most of the time and consequently is as hard as a pine knot and as brown as an indian she is bosom friend to all the ducks chickens turkeys and guinea hens on the place yesterday as she marched along the winding path that leads up the hill through the red clover beds to the summerhouse there was a long procession of these fowls stringing contentedly after her led by a stately rooster who can look over the modocs head the devotion of these vassals has been purchased with daily largess of indian meal and so the modoc attended by her bodyguard moves in state wherever she goes susie crane has built the loveliest study for me you ever saw it is octagonal with a peaked roof each octagon filled with a spacious window and it sits perched in complete isolation on top of an elevation that commands leagues of valley and city and retreating ranges of distant blue hills it is a cosy nest with just room in it for a sofa and a table and three or four chairs and when the storms sweep down the remote valley and the lightning flashes above the hills beyond and the rain beats upon the roof over my head imagine the luxury of it it stands feet above the valley and miles from it however one must not write all day we send continents of love to you and yours affectionately mark we have mentioned before that clemens had settled his mother and sister at fredonia new york and when mrs clemens was in condition to travel he concluded to pay them a visit it proved an unfortunate journey the hot weather was hard on mrs clemens and harder still perhaps on mark twains temper at any period of his life a bore exasperated him and in these earlier days he was far more likely to explode than in his mellower age remorse always followed the price he paid was always costly we cannot know now who was the unfortunate that invited the storm but in the next letter we get the echoes of it and realize something of its damage to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in fredonia elmira aug mx dear mother and sister i came away from fredonia ashamed of myself almost too much humiliated to hold up my head and say goodbye for i began to comprehend how much harm my conduct might do you socially in your village i would have gone to that detestable oysterbrained bore and apologized for my inexcusable rudeness to him but that i was satisfied he was of too small a calibre to know how to receive an apology with magnanimity pamela appalled me by saying people had hinted that they wished to visit livy when she came but that she had given them no encouragement i feared that those people would merely comprehend that their courtesies were not wanted and yet not know exactly why they were not wanted i came away feeling that in return for your constant and tireless efforts to secure our bodily comfort and make our visit enjoyable i had basely repaid you by making you sad and sorehearted and leaving you so and the natural result has fallen to me likewise for a guilty conscience has harassed me ever since and i have not had one short quarter of an hour of peace to this moment you spoke of middletown why not go there and live mr crane says it is only about a hundred miles this side of new york on the erie road the fact that one or two of you might prefer to live somewhere else is not a valid objection there are no people who would all choose the same place so it will be vain to wait for the day when your tastes shall be a unit i seriously fear that our visit has damaged you in fredonia and so i wish you were out of it the baby is fat and strong and susie the same susie was charmed with the donkey and the doll ys affectionately saml p s dear ma and pamela i am mainly grieved because i have been rude to a man who has been kind to you and if you ever feel a desire to apologize to him for me you may be sure that i will endorse the apology no matter how strong it may be i went to his bank to apologize to him but my conviction was strong that he was not man enough to know how to take an apology and so i did not make it william dean howells was in those days writing those vividly realistic indeed photographic stories which fixed his place among american men of letters he had already written their wedding journey and a chance acquaintance when a foregone conclusion appeared for the reason that his own work was so different and perhaps because of his fondness for the author clemens always greatly admired the books of howells howellss exact observation and his gift for human detail seemed marvelous to mark twain who with a bigger brush was inclined to record the larger rather than the minute aspects of life the sincerity of his appreciation of howells however need not be questioned nor for that matter his detestation of scott to w d howells in boston elmira aug dear howells i have just finished reading the foregone conclusion to mrs clemens and we think you have even outdone yourself i should think that this must be the daintiest truest most admirable workmanship that was ever put on a story the creatures of god do not act out their natures more unerringly than yours do if your genuine stories can die i wonder by what right old walter scotts artificialities shall continue to live i brought mrs clemens back from her trip in a dreadfully brokendown condition so by the doctors orders we unpacked the trunks sorrowfully to lie idle here another month instead of going at once to hartford and proceeding to furnish the new house which is now finished we hate to have it go longer desolate and tenantless but cannot help it by and by if the madam gets strong again we are hoping to have the grays there and you and the aldrich households and osgood down to engage in an orgy with them ys ever mark howells was editor of the atlantic by this time and had been urging clemens to write something suitable for that magazine he had done nothing however until this summer at quarry farm there one night in the moonlight mrs cranes colored cook who had been a slave was induced to tell him her story it was exactly the story to appeal to mark twain and the kind of thing he could write he set it down next morning as nearly in her own words and manner as possible without departing too far from literary requirements he decided to send this to howells he did not regard it very highly but he would take the chance an earlier offering to the magazine had been returned he sent the true story with a brief note to w d howells in boston elmira sept my dear howells i enclose also a true story which has no humor in it you can pay as lightly as you choose for that if you want it for it is rather out of my line i have not altered the old colored womans story except to begin at the beginning instead of the middle as she did and traveled both ways yrs ever mark but howells was delighted with it he referred to its realest kind of black talk and in another place added this little story delights me more and more i wish you had about forty of them along with the true story mark twain had sent the fable for good old boys and girls but this howells returned not as he said because he didnt like it but because the atlantic on matters of religion was just in that good lord good devil condition when a little fable like yours wouldnt leave it a single presbyterian baptist unitarian episcopalian methodist or millerite paying subscriber while all the deadheads would stick to it and abuse it in the denominational newspapers but the shorter ms had been only a brief diversion mark twain was bowling along at a book and a play the book was tom sawyer as already mentioned and the play a dramatization from the gilded age clemens had all along intended to dramatize the story of colonel sellers and was one day thunderstruck to receive word from california that a san francisco dramatist had appropriated his character in a play written for john t raymond clemens had taken out dramatic copyright on the book and immediately stopped the performance by telegraph a correspondence between the author and the dramatist followed leading to a friendly arrangement by which the latter agreed to dispose of his version to mark twain a good deal of discussion from time to time having arisen over the authorship of the sellers play as presented by raymond certain among the letters that follow may be found of special interest meanwhile we find clemens writing to dr john brown of edinburgh on these matters and events in general the book ms which he mentions as having put aside was not touched again for nearly a year to dr john brown in edinburgh quarry farm near elmira n y sept dear friend i have been writing fifty pages of manuscript a day on an average for sometime now on a book a story and consequently have been so wrapped up in it and so dead to anything else that i have fallen mighty short in letterwriting but night before last i discovered that that days chapter was a failure in conception moral truth to nature and execution enough blemish to impair the excellence of almost any chapter and so i must burn up the days work and do it all over again it was plain that i had worked myself out pumped myself dry so i knocked off and went to playing billiards for a change i havent had an idea or a fancy for two days now an excellent time to write to friends who have plenty of ideas and fancies of their own and so will prefer the offerings of the heart before those of the head day after tomorrow i go to a neighboring city to see a fiveactdrama of mine brought out and suggest amendments in it and would about as soon spend a night in the spanish inquisition as sit there and be tortured with all the adverse criticisms i can contrive to imagine the audience is indulging in but whether the play be successful or not i hope i shall never feel obliged to see it performed a second time my interest in my work dies a sudden and violent death when the work is done i have invented and patented a pretty good sort of scrapbook i think but i have backed down from letting it be known as mine just at present for i cant stand being under discussion on a play and a scrapbook at the same time i shall be away two days and then return to take our tribe to new york where we shall remain five days buying furniture for the new house and then go to hartford and settle solidly down for the winter after all that fallow time i ought to be able to go to work again on the book we shall reach hartford about the middle of september i judge we have spent the past four months up here on top of a breezy hill six hundred feet high some few miles from elmira n y and overlooking that town elmira is my wifes birthplace and that of susie and the new baby this little summer house on the hilltop named quarry farm because theres a quarry on it belongs to my wifes sister mrs crane a photographer came up the other day and wanted to make some views and i shall send you the result per this mail my study is a snug little octagonal den with a coalgrate big windows one little one and a wide doorway the latter opening upon the distant town on hot days i spread the study wide open anchor my papers down with brickbats and write in the midst of the hurricanes clothed in the same thin linen we make shirts of the study is nearly on the peak of the hill it is right in front of the little perpendicular wall of rock left where they used to quarry stones on the peak of the hill is an old arbor roofed with bark and covered with the vine you call the american creeper its green is almost bloodied with red the study is yards below the old arbor and yards above the dwellinghouseit is remote from all noises now isnt the whole thing pleasantly situated in the picture of me in the study you glimpse through the lefthand window the little rock bluff that rises behind the pond and the bases of the little trees on top of it the small square window is over the fireplace the chimney divides to make room for it without the stereoscope it looks like a framed picture all the study windows have venetian blinds they long ago went out of fashion in america but they have not been replaced with anything half as good yet the study is built on top of a tumbled rockheap that has morningglories climbing about it and a stone stairway leading down through and dividing it there now if you have not time to read all this turn it over to jock and drag in the judge to help mrs clemens must put in a late picture of susie a picture which she maintains is good but which i think is slander on the child we revisit the rutland street home many a time in fancy for we hold every individual in it in happy and grateful memory goodbye your friend saml l clemens p s i gave the p o department a blast in the papers about sending misdirected letters of mine back to the writers for reshipment and got a blast in return through a new york daily from the new york postmaster but i notice that misdirected letters find me now without any unnecessary fooling around the new house in hartford was now ready to be occupied and in a letter to howells written a little more than a fortnight after the foregoing we find them located in part of it but what seems more interesting is that paragraph of the letter which speaks of close friendly relations still existing with the warners in that it refutes a report current at this time that there was a break between clemens and warner over the rights in the sellers play there was in fact no such rupture warner realizing that he had no hand in the character of sellers and no share in the work of dramatization generously yielded all claim to any part of the returns to w d howells in boston farmington avenue hartford sept my dear howells all right my boy send proof sheets here i amend dialect stuff by talking and talking and talking it till it sounds rightand i had difficulty with this negro talk because a negro sometimes rarely says goin and sometimes gwyne and they make just such discrepancies in other words and when you come to reproduce them on paper they look as if the variation resulted from the writers carelessness but i want to work at the proofs and get the dialect as nearly right as possible we are in part of the new house goodness knows when well get in the rest of it full of workmen yet i worked a month at my play and launched it in new york last wednesday i believe it will go the newspapers have been complimentary it is simply a setting for the one character col sellers as a play i guess it will not bear a critical assault in force the warners are as charming as ever they go shortly to the devil for a year which is but a poetical way of saying they are going to afflict themselves with the unsurpassable bad word of travel for a spell i believe they mean to go and see you firstso they mean to start from heaven to the other place not from earth how is that i think that is no slouch of a compliment kind of a dim religious light about it i enjoy that sort of thing yrs ever mark raymond in a letter to the sun stated that not one line of the california dramatization had been used by mark twain except that which was taken bodily from the gilded age clemens himself in a statement that he wrote for the hartford post but suppressed probably at the request of his wife gave a full history of the plays origin a matter of slight interest today sellers on the stage proved a great success the play had no special merit as a literary composition but the character of sellers delighted the public and both author and actor were richly repaid for their entertainment xiv letters mississippi chapters visits to boston a joke on aldrich couldnt you send me some such story as that colored one for our january number that is within a month wrote howells at the end of september and during the week following mark twain struggled hard to comply but without result when the month was nearly up he wrote to w d howells in boston hartford oct my dear howells i have delayed thus long hoping i might do something for the january number and mrs clemens has diligently persecuted me day by day with urgings to go to work and do that something but its no use i find i cant we are in such a state of weary and endless confusion that my head wont go so i give it up yrs ever mark but two hours later when he had returned from one of the long walks which he and twichell so frequently took together he told a different story later pm home th my dear howells i take back the remark that i cant write for the jan number for twichell and i have had a long walk in the woods and i got to telling him about old mississippi days of steamboating glory and grandeur as i saw them during years from the pilothouse he said what a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine i hadnt thought of that before would you like a series of papers to run through months or or or about months say yrs ever mark howells himself had come from a family of pilots and rejoiced in the idea a few days later mark twain forwarded the first instalment of the new series those wonderful chapters that begin now with chapter four in the mississippi book apparently he was not without doubt concerning the manuscript and accompanied it with a brief line to w d howells in boston dear howells cut it scarify it reject it handle it with entire freedom yrs ever mark but howells had no doubts as to the quality of the new find he declared that the piece about the mississippi was capital that it almost made the water in their icepitcher turn muddy as he read it the sketch of the lowlived little town was so good that i could have wished that there was more of it i want the sketches if you can make them every month the lowlived little town was hannibal and the reader can turn to the vivid description of it in the chapter already mentioned in the same letter howells refers to a letter from limerick which he declares he shall keep until he has shown it around especially to aldrich and osgood the letter from limerick has to do with a special episode mention has just been made of mark twains walk with twichell frequently their walks were extended tramps and once in a daring moment one or the other of them proposed to walk to boston the time was november and the bracing air made the proposition seem attractive they were off one morning early twichell carrying a little bag and clemens a basket of luncheon a few days before clemens had written redpath that the rev j h twichell and he expected to start at eight oclock thursday morning to walk to boston in twentyfour hours or more we shall telegraph youngs hotel for rooms saturday night in order to allow for a low average of pedestrianism they did not get quite to boston in fact they got only a little farther than the twentyeight miles they made the first day clemens could hardly walk next morning but they managed to get to north ashford where they took a carriage for the nearest railway station there they telegraphed to redpath and howells that they would be in boston that evening howells of course had a good supper and good company awaiting them at his home and the pedestrians spent two happy days visiting and recounting their adventures it was one morning at his hotel that mark twain wrote the limerick letter it was addressed to mrs clemens but was really intended for howells and twichell and the others whom it mentions it was an amusing fancy rather than a letter but it deserves place here to mrs clemens intended for howells aldrich etc boston nov dear livy you observe i still call this beloved old place by the name it had when i was young limerick it is enough to make a body sick the gentlemeninwaiting stare to see me sit here telegraphing this letter to you and no doubt they are smiling in their sleeves but let them the slow old fashions are good enough for me thank god and i will none other when i see one of these modern fools sit absorbed holding the end of a telegraph wire in his hand and reflect that a thousand miles away there is another fool hitched to the other end of it it makes me frantic with rage and then am i more implacably fixed and resolved than ever to continue taking twenty minutes to telegraph you what i communicate in ten sends by the new way if i would so debase myself and when i see a whole silent solemn drawingroom full of idiots sitting with their hands on each others foreheads communing i tug the white hairs from my head and curse till my asthma brings me the blessed relief of suffocation in our old day such a gathering talked pure drivel and rot mostly but better that a thousand times than these dreary conversational funerals that oppress our spirits in this mad generation it is sixty years since i was here before i walked hither then with my precious old friend it seems incredible now that we did it in two days but such is my recollection i no longer mention that we walked back in a single day it makes me so furious to see doubt in the face of the hearer men were men in those old times think of one of the puerile organisms in this effeminate age attempting such a feat my airship was delayed by a collision with a fellow from china loaded with the usual cargo of jabbering coppercolored missionaries and so i was nearly an hour on my journey but by the goodness of god thirteen of the missionaries were crippled and several killed so i was content to lose the time i love to lose time anyway because it brings soothing reminiscences of the creeping railroad days of old now lost to us forever our game was neatly played and successfully none expected us of course you should have seen the guards at the ducal palace stare when i said announce his grace the archbishop of dublin and the rt hon the earl of hartford arrived within we were all eyes to see the duke of cambridge and his duchess wondering if we might remember their faces and they ours in a moment they came tottering in he bent and withered and bald she blooming with wholesome old age he peered through his glasses a moment then screeched in a reedy voice come to my arms away with titles ill know ye by no names but twain and twichell then fell he on our necks and jammed his trumpet in his ear the which we filled with shoutings to this effect god bless you old howells what is left of you we talked late that night none of your silent idiot communings for us of the olden time we rolled a stream of ancient anecdotes over our tongues and drank till the lord archbishop grew so mellow in the mellow past that dublin ceased to be dublin to him and resumed its sweeter forgotten name of new york in truth he almost got back into his ancient religion too good jesuit as he has always been since omulligan the first established that faith in the empire and we canvassed everybody bailey aldrich marquis of ponkapog came in got nobly drunk and told us all about how poor osgood lost his earldom and was hanged for conspiring against the second emperor but he didnt mention how near he himself came to being hanged too for engaging in the same enterprise he was as chaffy as he was sixty years ago too and swore the archbishop and i never walked to boston but there was never a day that ponkapog wouldnt lie so be it by the grace of god he got the opportunity the lord high admiral came in a hale gentleman close upon seventy and bronzed by the suns and storms of many climes and scarred with the wounds got in many battles and i told him how i had seen him sit in a high chair and eat fruit and cakes and answer to the name of johnny his granddaughter the eldest is but lately warned to the youngest of the grand dukes and so who knows but a day may come when the blood of the howellss may reign in the land i must not forget to say while i think of it that your new false teeth are done my dear and your wig keep your head well bundled with a shawl till the latter comes and so cheat your persecuting neuralgias and rheumatisms would you believe it the duchess of cambridge is deafer than you deafer than her husband they call her to breakfast with a salvo of artillery and usually when it thunders she looks up expectantly and says come in the monument to the author of gloverson and his silent partners is finished it is the stateliest and the costliest ever erected to the memory of any man this noble classic has now been translated into all the languages of the earth and is adored by all nations and known to all creatures yet i have conversed as familiarly with the author of it as i do with my own greatgrandchildren i wish you could see old cambridge and ponkapog i love them as dearly as ever but privately my dear they are not much improvement on idiots it is melancholy to hear them jabber over the same pointless anecdotes three and four times of an evening forgetting that they had jabbered them over three or four times the evening before ponkapog still writes poetry but the oldtime fire has mostly gone out of it perhaps his best effort of late years is this o soul soul soul of mine soul soul soul of thine thy soul my soul two souls entwine and sing thy lauds in crystal wine this he goes about repeating to everybody daily and nightly insomuch that he is become a sore affliction to all that know him but i must desist there are drafts here everywhere and my gout is something frightful my left foot hath resemblance to a snuffbladder god be with you hartford these to lady hartford in the earldom of hartford in the upper portion of the city of dublin one may imagine the joy of howells and the others in this ludicrous extravaganza which could have been written by no one but mark twain it will hardly take rank as prophecy though certainly true forecast in it is not wholly lacking clemens was now pretty well satisfied with his piloting story but he began to have doubts as to its title old times on the mississippi it seemed to commit him to too large an undertaking to w d howells in boston dec my dear howells let us change the heading to piloting on the miss in the old times or to steamboating on the m in old times or to personal old times on the miss we could change it for feb if now too late for jan i suggest it because the present heading is too pretentious too broad and general it seems to command me to deliver a second book of revelation to the world and cover all the old times the mississippi dang that word it is worse than type or egypt ever saw whereas here i have finished article no iii and am about to start on no and yet i have spoken of nothing but of piloting as a science so far and i doubt if i ever get beyond that portion of my subject and i dont care to any muggins can write about old times on the miss of different kinds but i am the only man alive that can scribble about the piloting of that day and no man ever has tried to scribble about it yet its newness pleases me all the time and it is about the only new subject i know of if i were to write fifty articles they would all be about pilots and piloting therefore lets get the word piloting into the heading theres a sort of freshness about that too ys ever mark but howells thought the title satisfactory and indeed it was the best that could have been selected for the series he wrote every few days of his delight in the papers and cautioned the author not to make an attempt to please any supposed atlantic audience adding yarn it off into my sympathetic ear clemens replied to w d howells in boston htfd dec my dear howells it isnt the atlantic audience that distresses me for it is the only audience that i sit down before in perfect serenity for the simple reason that it doesnt require a humorist to paint himself striped and stand on his head every fifteen minutes the trouble was that i was only bent on working up an atmosphere and that is to me a most fidgety and irksome thing sometimes i avoid it usually but in this case it was absolutely necessary else every reader would be applying the atmosphere of his own or sea experiences and that shirt wouldnt fit you know i could have sent this article ii a week ago or more but i couldnt bring myself to the drudgery of revising and correcting it i have been at that tedious work hours now and by george but i am glad it is over say i am as prompt as a clock if i only know the day a thing is wanted otherwise i am a natural procrastinaturalist tell me what day and date you want nos and and i will tackle and revise them and theyll be there to the minute i could wind up with no but there are some things more which i am powerfully moved to write which is natural enough since i am a person who would quit authorizing in a minute to go to piloting if the madam would stand it i would rather sink a steamboat than eat any time my wife was afraid to write you so i said with simplicity i will give you the language and ideas through the infinite grace of god there has not been such another insurrection in the family before as followed this however the letter was written and promptly too whereas heretofore she has remained afraid to do such things with kind regards to mrs howells yrs ever mark the old times papers appeared each month in the atlantic until july and take rank today with mark twains best work when the first number appeared john hay wrote it is perfect no more nor less i dont see how you do it which was reported to howells who said what business has hay i should like to know praising a favorite of mine its interfering these were the days when the typewriter was new clemens and twichell during their stay in boston had seen the marvel in operation and clemens had been unable to resist owning one it was far from being the perfect machine of today the letters were all capitals and one was never quite certain even of those mark twain however began with enthusiasm and practised faithfully on the day of its arrival he wrote two letters that have survived the first to his brother the other to howells typewritten letter to w d howells in boston hartford dec my dear howells i want to add a short paragraph to article no when the proof comes merely a line or two however i dont know whether i am going to make this typewriting machine go or nto that last word was intended for nnot but i guess i shall make some sort of a succss of it before i run it very long i am so thickfingered that i miss the keys you neednt a swer this i am only practicing to get three another slipup there only practicing to get the hang of the thing i notice i miss fire get in a good many unnecessary letters and punctuation marks i am simply using you for a target to bang at blame my cats but this thing requires genius in order to work it just right yours ever mark knowing mark twain howells wrote when you get tired of the machine send it to me clemens naturally did get tired of the machine it was ruining his morals he said he presently offered it to howells who by this time hesitated but eventually yielded and accepted it if he was blasted by its influence the fact has not been recorded one of the famous atlantic dinners came along in december dont you dare to refuse that invitation wrote howells to meet emerson aldrich and all those boys at the parker house at six oclock tuesday december th come clemens had no desire to refuse he sent word that he would come and followed it with a characteristic line to w d howells in boston hartford sunday my dear howells i want you to ask mrs howells to let you stay all night at the parker house and tell lies and have an improving time and take breakfast with me in the morning i will have a good room for you and a fire cant you tell her it always makes you sick to go home late at night or something like that that sort of thing rouses mrs clemenss sympathies easily the only trouble is to keep them up twichell and i talked till or in the morning the night we supped at your house and it restored his health on account of his being drooping for some time and made him much more robuster than what he was before will mrs howells let you yrs ever s l c aldrich had issued that year a volume of poems and he presented clemens with a copy of it during this boston visit the letter of appreciation which follows contains also reference to an amusing incident but we shall come to that presently to t b aldrich in ponkapog mass farmington avenue hartford dec my dear aldrich i read the cloth of gold through coming down in the cars and it is just lightning poetry a thing which it gravels me to say because my own efforts in that line have remained so persistently unrecognized in consequence of the envy and jealousy of this generation baby bell always seemed perfection before but now that i have children it has got even beyond that about the hour that i was reading it in the cars twichell was reading it at home and forthwith fell upon me with a burst of enthusiasm about it when i saw him this was pleasant because he has long been a lover of it thos bailey aldrich responded etc in one of the brightest speeches of the evening that is what the tribune correspondent says and that is what everybody that heard it said therefore you keep still dont ever be so unwise as to go on trying to unconvince those people ive been skating around the place all day with some girls with mrs clemens in the window to do the applause there would be a power of fun in skating if you could do it with somebody elses muscles there are about twenty boys booming by the house now and it is mighty good to look at im keeping you in mind you see in the matter of photographs i have a couple to enclose in this letter and i want you to say you got them and then i shall know i have been a good truthful child i am going to send more as i ferret them out about the place and i wont forget that you are a subscriber the wife and i unite in warm regards to you and mrs aldrich yrs ever s l clemens a letter bearing the same date as the above went back to howells we find in reference to still another incident which perhaps should come first mark twain up to this time had worn the black string necktie of the west a decoration which disturbed mrs clemens and invited remarks from his friends he had persisted in it however up to the date of the atlantic dinner when howells and aldrich decided that something must be done about it to w d howells in boston hartford dec my dear howells i left no miss chapter in my eldests reach and it may have gone to the postman and it likewise may have gone into the fire i confess to a dread that the latter is the case and that that stack of ms will have to be written over again if so o for the return of the lamented herod you and aldrich have made one woman deeply and sincerely grateful mrs clemens for months i may even say years she had shown unaccountable animosity toward my necktie even getting up in the night to take it with the tongs and blackguard it sometimes also going so far as to threaten it when i said you and aldrich had given me two new neckties and that they were in a paper in my overcoat pocket she was in a fever of happiness until she found i was going to frame them then all the venom in her nature gathered itself together insomuch that i being near to a door went without perceiving danger now i wear one of the new neckties nothing being sacred in mrs clemenss eyes that can be perverted to a gaud that shall make the person of her husband more alluring than it was aforetime jo twichell was the delightedest old boy i ever saw when he read the words you had written in that book he and i went to the concert of the yale students last night and had a good time mrs clemens dreads our going to new orleans but i tell her shell have to give her consent this time with kindest regards unto ye both yrs ever s l clemens the reference to new orleans at the end of this letter grew naturally out of the enthusiasm aroused by the mississippi papers the more clemens wrote about the river the more he wished to revisit it and take howells with him howells was willing enough to go and they eventually arranged to take their wives on the excursion this seemed all very well and possible so long as the time was set for some date in the future still unfixed but howells was a busy editor and it was much more easy for him to promise goodnaturedly than to agree on a definite time of departure he explained at length why he could not make the journey and added forgive me having led you on to fix a time i never thought it would come to that i supposed you would die or something i am really more sorry and ashamed than i can make it appear so the beautiful plan was put aside though it was not entirely abandoned for a long time we now come to the incident mentioned in mark twains letter to aldrich of december the th it had its beginning at the atlantic dinner where aldrich had abused clemens for never sending him any photographs of himself it was suggested by one or the other that his name be put down as a regular subscriber for all mark twain photographs as they came out clemens returned home and hunted up fiftytwo different specimens put each into an envelope and began mailing them to him one each morning when a few of them had arrived aldrich wrote protesting the police he said have a way of swooping down on that kind of publication the other day they gobbled up an entire edition of the life in new york whereupon clemens bundled up the remaining collection fortyfive envelopes of photographs and printsand mailed them together aldrich wrote now violently declaring the perpetrator of the outrage to be known to the police that a sprawling yellow figure against a green background had been recognized as an admirable likeness of mark twain alias the jumping frog a wellknown californian desperado formerly the chief of henry plummers band of road agents in montana the letter was signed t bayleigh chief of police on the back of the envelope t bayleigh had also written that it was no use for the person to send any more letters as the postoffice at that point was to be blown up fortyeight hogshead of nitroglycerine had been syrupticiously introduced into the cellar of the building and more was expected rwe hwl owh and other conspirators in masks have been seen flitting about the town for some days past the greatest excitement combined with the most intense quietness reigns at ponkapog xv letters from hartford much correspondence with howells orion clemens had kept his job with bliss only a short time his mental makeup was such that it was difficult for him to hold any position long he meant to do well but he was unfortunate in his efforts his ideas were seldom practical his nature was yielding and fickle he had returned to keokuk presently and being convinced there was a fortune in chickens had prevailed upon his brother to purchase for him a little farm not far from the town but the chicken business was not lively and orion kept the mail hot with manuscripts and propositions of every sort which he wanted his brother to take under advisement certainly to mark twain orion clemens was a trial the letters of the latter show that scarcely one of them but contains the outline of some rainbowchasing scheme full of wild optimism and the certainty that somewhere just ahead lies the pot of gold only now and then there is a letter of abject humiliation and complete surrender when some golden vision some iridescent soapbubble had vanished at his touch such depression did not last by sunrise he was ready with a new dream new enthusiasm and with a new letter inviting his brother sams interest and investment yet his fear of incurring his brothers displeasure was pitiful regardless of the fact that he constantly employed the very means to insure that result at one time clemens made him sign a sworn agreement that he would not suggest any plan or scheme of investment for the period of twelve months orion must have kept this agreement he would have gone to the stake before he would have violated an oath but the stake would have probably been no greater punishment than his sufferings that year on the whole samuel clemens was surprisingly patient and considerate with orion and there was never a time that he was not willing to help yet there were bound to be moments of exasperation and once when his mother or sister had written suggesting that he encourage his brothers efforts he felt moved to write at considerable freedom to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in fredonia n y hartford sunday my dear mother and sister i saw gov newell today and he said he was still moving in the matter of sammys appointment as a west point cadet and would stick to it till he got a result of a positive nature one way or the other but thus far he did not know whether to expect success or defeat ma whenever you need money i hope you wont be backward about saying so you can always have it we stint ourselves in some ways but we have no desire to stint you and we dont intend to either i cant encourage orion nobody can do that conscientiously for the reason that before ones letter has time to reach him he is off on some new wildgoose chase would you encourage in literature a man who the older he grows the worse he writes would you encourage orion in the glaring insanity of studying law if he were packed and crammed full of law it would be worthless lumber to him for his is such a capricious and illregulated mind that he would apply the principles of the law with no more judgment than a child of ten years i know what i am saying i laid one of the plainest and simplest of legal questions before orion once and the helpless and hopeless mess he made of it was absolutely astonishing nothing aggravates me so much as to have orion mention law or literature to me well i cannot encourage him to try the ministry because he would change his religion so fast that he would have to keep a traveling agent under wages to go ahead of him to engage pulpits and board for him i cannot conscientiously encourage him to do anything but potter around his little farm and put in his odd hours contriving new and impossible projects at the rate of a year which is his customary average he says he did well in hannibal now there is a man who ought to be entirely satisfied with the grandeurs emoluments and activities of a hen farm if you ask me to pity orion i can do that i can do it every day and all day long but one cant encourage quicksilver because the instant you put your finger on it it isnt there no i am saying too much he does stick to his literary and legal aspirations and he naturally would select the very two things which he is wholly and preposterously unfitted for if i ever become able i mean to put orion on a regular pension without revealing the fact that it is a pension that is best for him let him consider it a periodical loan and pay interest out of the principal within a years time he would be looking upon himself as a benefactor of mine in the way of furnishing me a good permanent investment for money and that would make him happy and satisfied with himself if he had money he would share with me in a moment and i have no disposition to be stingy with him affly sam livy sends love the new orleans plan was not wholly dead at this time howells wrote near the end of january that the matter was still being debated now and then but was far from being decided upon he hoped to go somewhere with mrs howells for a brief time in march he said clemens in haste replied to w d howells in boston hartford jan my dear howells when mrs clemens read your letter she said well then wherever they go in march the direction will be southward and so they must give us a visit on the way i do not know what sort of control you may be under but when my wife speaks as positively as that i am not in the habit of talking back and getting into trouble situated as i am i would not be able to understand now how you could pass by this town without feeling that you were running a wanton risk and doing a daredevil thing i consider it settled that you are to come in march and i would be sincerely sorry to learn that you and mrs howells feel differently about it the piloting material has been uncovering itself by degrees until it has exposed such a huge hoard to my view that a whole book will be required to contain it if i use it so i have agreed to write the book for bliss the book idea was later given up for the time being i wont be able to run the articles in the atlantic later than the september number for the reason that a subscription book issued in the fall has a much larger sale than if issued at any other season of the year it is funny when i reflect that when i originally wrote you and proposed to do from to articles for the magazine the vague thought in my mind was that might exhaust the material and would be pretty sure to do it or rather it seems to me that that was my thought cant tell at this distance but in truth chapters dont now seem to more than open up the subject fairly and start the yarn to wagging i have been sick abed several days for the first time in years how little confirmed invalids appreciate their advantages i was able to read the english edition of the greville memoirs through without interruption take my meals in bed neglect all business without a pang and smoke cigars a day i try not to look back upon these years with a feeling of resentment and yet the partialities of providence do seem to me to be slathered around as one may say without that gravity and attention to detail which the real importance of the matter would seem to suggest yrs ever mark the new orleans idea continued to haunt the letters the thought of drifting down the mississippi so attracted both clemens and howells that they talked of it when they met and wrote of it when they were separated howells beset by uncertainties playfully tried to put the responsibility upon his wife once he wrote she says in the noblest way well go to new orleans if you want to so much you know the tone i suppose it will do if i let you know about the middle of february but they had to give it up in the end howells wrote that he had been under the weather and on half work the whole winter he did not feel that he had earned his salary he said or that he was warranted in taking a three weeks pleasure trip clemens offered to pay all the expenses of the trip but only indefinite postponement followed it would be seven years more before mark twain would return to the river and then not with howells in a former chapter mention has been made of charles warren stoddard whom mark twain had known in his california days he was fond of stoddard who was a facile and pleasing writer of poems and descriptive articles during the period that he had been acting as mark twains secretary in london he had taken pleasure in collecting for him the news reports of the celebrated tichborn claimant case then in the english courts clemens thought of founding a story on it and did in fact use the idea though the american claimant which he wrote years later had little or no connection with the tichborn episode to c w stoddard hartford feb dear charley all right about the tichborn scrapbooks send them along when convenient i mean to have the beechertilton trial scrapbook as a companion i am writing a series of page articles for the atlantic at a page but as they do not pay anybody else as much as that i do not complain though at the same time i do swear that i am not content however the awful respectability of the magazine makes up i have cut your articles about san marco out of a new york paper joe twichell saw it and brought it home to me with loud admiration and sent it to howells it is too bad to fool away such good literature in a perishable daily journal do remember us kindly to lady hardy and all that rare family my wife and i so often have pleasant talks about them ever your friend saml l clemens the price received by mark twain for the mississippi papers as quoted in this letter furnishes us with a realizing sense of the improvement in the literary market with the advent of a flood of cheap magazines and the sunday newspaper the atlantic page probably contained about a thousand words which would make his price average say two cents per word thirty years later when his fame was not much more extended his pay for the same matter would have been fifteen times as great that is to say at the rate of thirty cents per word but in that early time there were no sunday magazines no literary magazines at all except the atlantic and harpers and a few fashion periodicals probably there were newsstands but it is hard to imagine what they must have looked like without the gay pictorial coverfemininity that today pleases and elevates the public and makes author and artist affluent clemens worked steadily on the river chapters and howells was always praising him and urging him to go on at the end of january he wrote youre doing the science of piloting splendidly every words interesting and dont you drop the series til youve got every bit of anecdote and reminiscence into it to w d howells in boston hartford feb my dear howells your praises of my literature gave me the solidest gratification but i never did have the fullest confidence in my critical penetration and now your verdict on s has knocked what little i did have gullywest i didnt enjoy his gush but i thought a lot of his similes were ever so vivid and good but its just my luck every time i go into convulsions of admiration over a picture and want to buy it right away before ive lost the chance some wretch who really understands art comes along and damns it but i dont mind i would rather have my ignorance than another mans knowledge because i have got so much more of it i send you no today i have written and rewritten the first half of it three different times yesterday and today and at last mrs clemens says it will do i never saw a woman so hard to please about things she doesnt know anything about yours ever mark of course the reference to his wifes criticism in this is tenderly playful as always of a pattern with the severity which he pretends for her in the next to mrs w d howells in boston dear mrs howells mrs clemens is delighted to get the pictures and so am i i can perceive in the group that mr howells is feeling as i so often feel viz well no doubt i am in the wrong though i do not know how or where or why but anyway it will be safest to look meek and walk circumspectly for a while and not discuss the thing and you look exactly as mrs clemens does after she has said indeed i do not wonder that you can frame no reply for you know only too well that your conduct admits of no excuse palliation or argument none i shall just delight in that group on account of the good old human domestic spirit that pervades it bother these family groups that put on a state aspect to get their pictures taken in we want a heliotype made of our eldest daughter how soft and rich and lovely the picture is mr howells must tell me how to proceed in the matter truly yours sam l clemens in the next letter we have a picture of susy this spelling of the name was adopted somewhat later and much preferred it appears as susie in most of the earlier letters clemenss third birthday certainly a pretty picture and as sweet and luminous and tender today as it was forty years agoas it will be a hundred years hence if these lines should survive that long the letter is to her uncle charles langdon the charlie of the quaker city atwater was associated with the langdon coal interests in elmira the play is of course the gilded age to charles langdon in elmira mch dear charlie livy after reading your letter used her severest form of expression about mr atwater to wit she did not approve of his conduct this made me shudder for it was equivalent to allie spauldings saying mr atwater is a mean thing or rev thomas beechers saying damn that atwater or my saying i wish atwater was three hundred million miles in however livy does not often get into one of these furies god be thanked in brooklyn baltimore washington cincinnati st louis and chicago the play paid me an average of nine hundred dollars a week in smaller towns the average is to this is susies birthday lizzie brought her in at this morning before we were up hooded with a blanket red curlpapers in her hair a great red japonica in one hand for livy and a yellow rosebud nestled in violets for my buttonhole in the other and she looked wonderfully pretty she delivered her memorials and received her birthday kisses livy laid her japonica down to get a better holt for kissingwhich susie presently perceived and became thoughtful then said sorrowfully turning the great deeps of her eyes upon her mother dont you care for you wow right after breakfast we got up a rousing wood fire in the main hall it is a cold morning illuminated the place with a rich glow from all the globes of the newell chandelier spread a bright rug before the fire set a circling row of chairs pink ones and dovecolored and in the midst a low invalidtable covered with a fanciful cloth and laden with the presents a pink azalia in lavish bloom from rosa a gold inscribed russialeather bible from patrick and mary a gold ring inscribed from maggy cook a silver thimble inscribed with motto and initials from lizzie a rattling mob of sunday clad dolls from livy and annie and a noahs ark from me containing wooden animals such as only a human being could create and only god call by name without referring to the passenger list then the family and the seven servants assembled there and susie and the bay arrived in state from above the bays head being fearfully and wonderfully decorated with a profusion of blazing red flowers and overflowing cataracts of lycopodium wee congratulatory notes accompanied the presents of the servants i tell you it was a great occasion and a striking and cheery group taking all the surroundings into account and the wintry aspect outside remainder missing there was to be a centennial celebration that year of the battles of lexington and concord and howells wrote urging clemens and his wife to visit them and attend it mrs clemens did not go and clemens and howells did not go either to the celebration they had their own ideas about getting there but found themselves unable to board the thronged train at concord and went tramping about in the cold and mud hunting a conveyance only to return at length to the cheer of the home defeated and rather low in spirits twichell who went on his own hook had no such difficulties to howells mark twain wrote the adventures of this athletic and strenuous exponent of the gospel the winnie mentioned in this letter was howellss daughter winifred she had unusual gifts but did not live to develop them to w d howells in boston farmington avenue hartford apl my dear howells ive got mrs clemenss picture before me and hope i shall not forget to send it with this joe twichell preached morning and evening here last sunday took midnight train for boston got an early breakfast and started by rail at a m for concord swelled around there until p m seeing everything then traveled on top of a train to lexington saw everything there traveled on top of a train to boston with hundreds in company deluged with dust smoke and cinders yelled and hurrahed all the way like a schoolboy lay flat down to dodge numerous bridges and sailed into the depot howling with excitement and as black as a chimneysweep got to youngs hotel at p m sat down in readingroom and immediately fell asleep was promptly awakened by a porter who supposed he was drunk wandered around an hour and a half then took p m train sat down in smoking car and remembered nothing more until awakened by conductor as the train came into hartford at a m thinks he had simply a glorious time and wouldnt have missed the centennial for the world he would have run out to see us a moment at cambridge but was too dirty i wouldnt have wanted him there his appalling energy would have been an insufferable reproach to mild adventurers like you and me well he is welcome to the good time he had i had a deal better one my narrative has made mrs clemens wish she could have been there when i think over what a splendid good sociable time i had in your house i feel ever so thankful to the wise providence that thwarted our several ablyplanned and ingenious attempts to get to lexington i am coming again before long and then she shall be of the party now you said that you and mrs howells could run down here nearly any saturday very well then let us call it next saturday for a starter can you do that by that time it will really be spring and you wont freeze the birds are already out a small one paid us a visit yesterday we entertained it and let it go again susie protesting the spring laziness is already upon me insomuch that the spirit begins to move me to cease from mississippi articles and everything else and give myself over to idleness until we go to new orleans i have one article already finished but somehow it doesnt seem as proper a chapter to close with as the one already in your hands i hope to get in a mood and rattle off a good one to finish with but just now all my moods are lazy ones winnies literature sings through me yet surely that child has one of these futures before her now try to come will you with the warmest regards of the two of us yrs ever s l clemens mrs clemens sent a note to mrs howells which will serve as a pendant to the foregoing from mrs clemens to mrs howells in boston my dear mrs howells dont dream for one instant that my not getting a letter from you kept me from boston i am too anxious to go to let such a thing as that keep me mr clemens did have such a good time with you and mr howells he evidently has no regret that he did not get to the centennial i was driven nearly distracted by his long account of mr howells and his wanderings i would keep asking if they ever got there he would never answer but made me listen to a very minute account of everything that they did at last i found them back where they started from if you find misspelled words in this note you will remember my infirmity and not hold me responsible affectionately yours livy l clemens in spite of his success with the sellers play and his itch to follow it up mark twain realized what he believed to be his literary limitations all his life he was inclined to consider himself wanting in the finer gifts of charactershading and delicate portrayal remembering huck finn and the rare presentation of joan of arc we may not altogether agree with him certainly he was never qualified to delineate those fine artificialities of life which we are likely to associate with culture and perhaps it was something of this sort that caused the hesitation confessed in the letter that follows whether the plan suggested interested howells or not we do not know in later years howells wrote a novel called the story of a play this may have been its beginning to w d howells in boston farmington avenue hartford apl my dear howells an actor named d h harkins has been here to ask me to put upon paper a act play which he has been mapping out in his mind for or years he sat down and told me his plot all through in a clear bright way and i was a deal taken with it but it is a line of characters whose fine shading and artistic development requires an abler hand than mine so i easily perceived that i must not make the attempt but i liked the man and thought there was a good deal of stuff in him and therefore i wanted his play to be written and by a capable hand too so i suggested you and said i would write and see if you would be willing to undertake it if you like the idea he will call upon you in the course of two or three weeks and describe his plot and his characters then if it doesnt strike you favorably of course you can simply decline but it seems to me well worth while that you should hear what he has to say you could also average him while he talks and judge whether he could play your priest though i doubt if any man can do that justice shant i write him and say he may call if you wish to communicate directly with him instead his address is larchmont manor westchester co n y do you know the chill of that th of april seems to be in my bones yet i am inert and drowsy all the time that was villainous weather for a couple of wandering children to be out in ys ever mark the sinister typewriter did not find its way to howells for nearly a year meantime mark twain had refused to allow the manufacturers to advertise his ownership he wrote to them hartford march please do not use my name in any way please do not even divulge the fact that i own a machine i have entirely stopped using the typewriter for the reason that i never could write a letter with it to anybody without receiving a request by return mail that i would not only describe the machine but state what progress i had made in the use of it etc etc i dont like to write letters and so i dont want people to know i own this curiositybreeding little joker three months later the machine was still in his possession bliss had traded a twelvedollar saddle for it but apparently showed little enthusiasm in his new possession to w d howells in boston june my dear howells i told patrick to get some carpenters and box the machine and send it to you and found that bliss had sent for the machine and earned it off i have been talking to you and writing to you as if you were present when i traded the machine to bliss for a twelvedollar saddle worth cheating him outrageously of course but conscience got the upper hand again and i told him before i left the premises that id pay for the saddle if he didnt like the machine on condition that he donate said machine to a charity this was a little over five weeks ago so i had long ago concluded that bliss didnt want the machine and did want the saddle wherefore i jumped at the chance of shoving the machine off onto you saddle or no saddle so i got the blamed thing out of my sight the saddle hangs on taras walls down below in the stable and the machine is at blisss grimly pursuing its appointed mission slowly and implacably rotting away another mans chances for salvation i have sent bliss word not to donate it to a charity though it is a pity to fool away a chance to do a charity an ill turn but to let me know when he has got his dose because ive got another candidate for damnation you just wait a couple of weeks and if you dont see the typewriter come tilting along toward cambridge with an unsatisfied appetite in its eye i lose my guess dont you be mad about this blunder howells it only comes of a bad memory and the stupidity which is inseparable from true genius nothing intentionally criminal in it yrs ever mark it was november when howells finally fell under the baleful influence of the machine he wrote the typewriter came wednesday night and is already beginning to have its effect on me of course it doesnt work if i can persuade some of the letters to get up against the ribbon they wont get down again without digital assistance the treadle refuses to have any part or parcel in the performance and i dont know how to get the roller to turn with the paper nevertheless i have begun several letters to my dar lemans as it prefers to spell your respected name and i dont despair yet of sending you something in its beautiful handwriting after ive had a man out from the agents to put it in order its fascinating in the meantime and it wastes my time like an old friend the clemens family remained in hartford that summer with the exception of a brief season at batemans point r i near newport by this time mark twain had taken up and finished the tom sawyer story begun two years before naturally he wished howells to consider the ms to w d howells in boston hartford july th my dear howells i have finished the story and didnt take the chap beyond boyhood i believe it would be fatal to do it in any shape but autobiographically like gil blas i perhaps made a mistake in not writing it in the first person if i went on now and took him into manhood he would just like like all the onehorse men in literature and the reader would conceive a hearty contempt for him it is not a boys book at all it will only be read by adults it is only written for adults moreover the book is plenty long enough as it stands it is about pages of ms and may be when i shall have finished working up vague places so it would make from to pages of the atlantic about what the foregone conclusion made isnt it i would dearly like to see it in the atlantic but i doubt if it would pay the publishers to buy the privilege or me to sell it bret harte has sold his novel same size as mine i should say to scribners monthly for publication to begin in september i think and he gets a royalty of per cent from bliss in book form afterwards he gets a royalty of ten per cent on it in england issued in serial numbers and the same royalty on it in book form afterwards and is to receive an advance payment of five hundred pounds the day the first no of the serial appears if i could do as well here and there with mine it might possibly pay me but i seriously doubt it though it is likely i could do better in england than bret who is not widely known there you see i take a vile mercenary view of things but then my household expenses are something almost ghastly by and by i shall take a boy of twelve and run him on through life in the first person but not tom sawyer he would not be a good character for it i wish you would promise to read the ms of tom sawyer some time and see if you dont really decide that i am right in closing with him as a boyand point out the most glaring defects for me it is a tremendous favor to ask and i expect you to refuse and would be ashamed to expect you to do otherwise but the thing has been so many months in my mind that it seems a relief to snake it out i dont know any other person whose judgment i could venture to take fully and entirely dont hesitate about saying no for i know how your time is taxed and i would have honest need to blush if you said yes osgood and i are going for the puppy g on infringement of trademark to win one or two suits of this kind will set literary folks on a firmer bottom i wish osgood would sue for stealing holmess poem wouldnt it be gorgeous to sue r for petty larceny i will promise to go into court and swear i think him capable of stealing peanuts from a blind pedlar yrs ever clemens of course howells promptly replied that he would read the story adding youve no idea what i may ask you to do for me some day im sorry that you cant do it for the atlantic but i succumb perhaps you will do boy no for us clemens consciencestricken meantime hastily put the ms out of reach of temptation to w d howells in boston july my dear howells just as soon as you consented i realized all the atrocity of my request and straightway blushed and weakened i telegraphed my theatrical agent to come here and carry off the ms and copy it but i will gladly send it to you if you will do as follows dramatize it if you perceive that you can and take for your remuneration half of the first which i receive for its representation on the stage you could alter the plot entirely if you chose i could help in the work most cheerfully after you had arranged the plot i have my eye upon two young girls who can play tom and huck i believe a good deal of a drama can be made of it come cant you tackle this in the odd hours of your vacation or later if you prefer i do wish you could come down once more before your holiday id give anything yrs ever mark howells wrote that he had no time for the dramatization and urged clemens to undertake it himself he was ready to read the story whenever it should arrive clemens did not hurry however the publication of tom sawyer could wait he already had a book in press the volume of sketches new and old which he had prepared for bliss several years before sketches was issued that autumn and howells gave it a good notice possibly better than it deserved considered among mark twains books today the collection of sketches does not seem especially important with the exception of the frog story and the true story most of those included might be spared clemens himself confessed to howells that he wished when it was too late that he had destroyed a number of them the book however was distinguished in a special way it contains mark twains first utterance in print on the subject of copyright a matter in which he never again lost interest the absurdity and injustice of the copyright laws both amused and irritated him and in the course of time he would be largely instrumental in their improvement in the book his open petition to congress that all property rights as well as literary ownership should be put on the copyright basis and limited to a beneficent term of fortytwo years was more or less of a joke but like so many of mark twains jokes it was founded on reason and justice he had another idea that was not a joke an early plan in the direction of international copyright it was to be a petition signed by the leading american authors asking the united states to declare itself to be the first to stand for right and justice by enacting laws against the piracy of foreign books it was a rather utopian scheme as most schemes for moral progress are in their beginning it would not be likely ever to reach congress but it would appeal to howells and his cambridge friends clemens wrote outlining his plan of action to w d howells in boston hartford sept my dear howells my plan is this you are to get mr lowell and mr longfellow to be the first signers of my copyright petition you must sign it yourself and get mr whittier to do likewise then holmes will sign he said he would if he didnt have to stand at the head then im fixed i will then put a gentlemanly chap under wages and send him personally to every author of distinction in the country and corral the rest of the signatures then ill have the whole thing lithographed about a thousand copies and move upon the president and congress in person but in the subordinate capacity of a party who is merely the agent of better and wiser men men whom the country cannot venture to laugh at i will ask the president to recommend the thing in his message and if he should ask me to sit down and frame the paragraph for him i should blush but still i would frame it next i would get a prime leader in congress i would also see that votes enough to carry the measure were privately secured before the bill was offered this i would try through my leader and my friends there and then if europe chose to go on stealing from us we would say with noble enthusiasm american lawmakers do steal but not from foreign authors not from foreign authors you see what i want to drive into the congressional mind is the simple fact that the moral law is thou shalt not steal no matter what europe may do i swear i cant see any use in robbing european authors for the benefit of american booksellers anyway if we can ever get this thing through congress we can try making copyright perpetual some day there would be no sort of use in it since only one book in a hundred millions outlives the present copyright term no sort of use except that the writer of that one book have his rights which is something if we only had some god in the countrys laws instead of being in such a sweat to get him into the constitution it would be better all around the only man who ever signed my petition with alacrity and said that the fact that a thing was right was allsufficient was rev dr bushnell i have lost my old petition which was brief but will draft and enclose another not in the words it ought to be but in the substance i want mr lowell to furnish the words and the ideas too if he will do it say redpath beseeches me to lecture in boston in november telegraphs that beechers and nasts withdrawal has put him in the tightest kind of a place so i guess ill do that old roughing it lecture over again in november and repeat it or times in new york while i am at it can i take a carriage after the lecture and go out and stay with you that night provided you find at that distant time that it will not inconvenience you is aldrich home yet with love to you all yrs ever s l c of course the petition never reached congress holmess comment that governments were not in the habit of setting themselves up as high moral examples except for revenue was shared by too many others the petition was tabled but clemens never abandoned his purpose and lived to see most of his dream fulfilled meantime howellss notice of the sketches appeared in the atlantic and brought grateful acknowledgment from the author to w d howells in boston hartford oct my dear howells that is a perfectly superb notice you can easily believe that nothing ever gratified me so much before the newspaper praises bestowed upon the innocents abroad were large and generous but somehow i hadnt confidence in the critical judgement of the parties who furnished them you know how that is yourself from reading the newspaper notices of your own books they gratify a body but they always leave a small pang behind in the shape of a fear that the critics good words could not safely be depended upon as authority yours is the recognized critical court of last resort in this country from its decision there is no appeal and so to have gained this decree of yours before i am forty years old i regard as a thing to be right down proud of mrs clemens says tell him i am just as grateful to him as i can be it sounds as if she were grateful to you for heroically trampling the truth under foot in order to praise me but in reality it means that she is grateful to you for being bold enough to utter a truth which she fully believes all competent people know but which none has heretofore been brave enough to utter you see the thing that gravels her is that i am so persistently glorified as a mere buffoon as if that entirely covered my case which she denies with venom the other day mrs clemens was planning a visit to you and so i am waiting with a pleasurable hope for the result of her deliberations we are expecting visitors every day now from new york and afterward some are to come from elmira i judge that we shall then be free to go bostonward i should be just delighted because we could visit in comfort since we shouldnt have to do any shopping did it all in new york last week and a tremendous pull it was too mrs c said the other day we will go to cambridge if we have to walk for i dont believe we can ever get the howellses to come here again until we have been there i was gratified to see that there was one string anyway that could take her to cambridge but i will do her the justice to say that she is always wanting to go to cambridge independent of the selfish desire to get a visit out of you by it i want her to get started now before childrens diseases are fashionable again because they always play such hob with visiting arrangements with love to you all yrs ever s l clemens mark twains trips to boston were usually made alone women require more preparation to go visiting and mrs clemens and mrs howells seem to have exchanged visits infrequently for mark twain perhaps it was just as well that his wife did not always go with him his absentmindedness and boyish ingenuousness often led him into difficulties which mrs clemens sometimes found embarrassing in the foregoing letter they were planning a visit to cambridge in the one that follows they seem to have made it with certain results perhaps not altogether amusing at the moment to w d howells in boston oct my dear howells we had a royal good time at your house and have had a royal good time ever since talking about it both privately and with the neighbors mrs clemenss bodily strength came up handsomely under that cheery respite from household and nursery cares i do hope that mrs howellss didnt go correspondingly down under the added burden to her cares and responsibilities of course i didnt expect to get through without committing some crimes and hearing of them afterwards so i have taken the inevitable lashings and been able to hum a tune while the punishment went on i caught it for letting mrs howells bother and bother about her coffee when it was a good deal better than we get at home i caught it for interrupting mrs c at the last moment and losing her the opportunity to urge you not to forget to send her that ms when the printers are done with it i caught it once more for personating that drunken col james i caught it for mentioning that mr longfellows picture was slightly damaged and when after a lull in the storm i confessed shamefacedly that i had privately suggested to you that we hadnt any frames and that if you wouldnt mind hinting to mr houghton c c c the madam was simply speechless for the space of a minute then she said how could you youth the idea of sending mr howells with his sensitive nature upon such a repulsive er oh howells wont mind it you dont know howells howells is a man who she was gone but george was the first person she stumbled on in the hall so she took it out of george i was glad of that because it saved the babies ive got another rattling good character for my novel that great work is mulling itself into shape gradually mrs clemens sends love to mrs howells meantime she is diligently laying up material for a letter to her yrs ever mark the george of this letter was mark twains colored butler a valued and even beloved member of the household a most picturesque character who one day came to wash windows as clemens used to say and remained eighteen years the fiction of mrs clemenss severity he always found amusing because of its entire contrast with the reality of her gentle heart clemens carried the tom sawyer ms to boston himself and placed it in howellss hands howells had begged to be allowed to see the story and mrs clemens was especially anxious that he should do so she had doubts as to certain portions of it and had the fullest faith in howellss opinion it was a gratifying one when it came howells wrote i finished reading tom sawyer a week ago sitting up till one am to get to the end simply because it was impossible to leave off its altogether the best boys story i ever read it will be an immense success but i think you ought to treat it explicitly as a boys story grownups will enjoy it just as much if you do and if you should put it forth as a study of boy character from the grownup point of view you give the wrong key to it the adventures are enchanting i wish i had been on that island the treasurehunting the loss in the cave its all exciting and splendid i shouldnt think of publishing this story serially give me a hint when its to be out and ill start the sheep to jumping in the right places meaning that he would have an advance review ready for publication in the atlantic which was a leader of criticism in america mark twain was writing a great deal at this time howells was always urging him to send something to the atlantic declaring a willingness to have his name appear every month in their pages and clemens was generally contributing some story or sketch the proof referred to in the next letter was of one of these articles to w d howells in boston hartford nov my dear howells herewith is the proof in spite of myself how awkwardly i do jumble words together and how often i do use three words where one would answer a thing i am always trying to guard against i shall become as slovenly a writer as charles francis adams if i dont look out that is said in jest because of course i do not seriously fear getting so bad as that i never shall drop so far toward his and bret hartes level as to catch myself saying it must have been wiser to have believed that he might have accomplished it if he could have felt that he would have been supported by those who should have c c c the reference to bret harte reminds me that i often accuse him of being a deliberate imitator of dickens and this in turn reminds me that i have charged unconscious plagiarism upon charley warner and this in turn reminds me that i have been delighting my soul for two weeks over a bran new and ingenious way of beginning a novel and behold all at once it flashes upon me that charley warner originated the idea years ago and told me about it aha so much for selfrighteousness i am well repaid here are pages of ms new and clean lying disgraced in the waste paper basket and i am beginning the novel over again in an unstolen way i would not wonder if i am the worst literary thief in the world without knowing it it is glorious news that you like tom sawyer so well i mean to see to it that your review of it shall have plenty of time to appear before the other notices mrs clemens decides with you that the book should issue as a book for boys pure and simple and so do i it is surely the correct idea as to that last chapter i think of just leaving it off and adding nothing in its place something told me that the book was done when i got to that point and so the strong temptation to put hucks life at the widows into detail instead of generalizing it in a paragraph was resisted just send sawyer to me by express i enclose money for it if it should get lost it will be no great matter company interfered last night and so private theatricals goes over till this evening to be read aloud mrs clemens is mad but the story will take that all out this is going to be a splendid winter night for fireside reading anyway i am almost at a dead standstill with my new story on account of the misery of having to do it all over again we all send love to you all yrs ever mark the story referred to may have been any one of several begun by him at this time his head was full of ideas for literature of every sort many of his beginnings came to nothing for the reason that he started wrong or with no definitely formed plan others of his literary enterprises were condemned by his wife for their grotesqueness or for the offense they might give in one way or another however worthy the intention behind them once he wrote a burlesque on family history the autobiography of a damned fool livy wouldnt have it he said later so i gave it up the world is indebted to mark twains wife for the check she put upon his fantastic or violent impulses she was his public his best public clearheaded and wise that he realized this and was willing to yield was by no means the least of his good fortunes we may believe that he did not always yield easily and perhaps sometimes only out of love for her in the letter which he wrote her on her thirtieth birthday we realize something of what she had come to mean in his life to mrs clemens on her thirtieth birthday hartford november livy darling six years have gone by since i made my first great success in life and won you and thirty years have passed since providence made preparation for that happy success by sending you into the world every day we live together adds to the security of my confidence that we can never any more wish to be separated than that we can ever imagine a regret that we were ever joined you are dearer to me today my child than you were upon the last anniversary of this birthday you were dearer then than you were a year before you have grown more and more dear from the first of those anniversaries and i do not doubt that this precious progression will continue on to the end let us look forward to the coming anniversaries with their age and their gray hairs without fear and without depression trusting and believing that the love we bear each other will be sufficient to make them blessed so with abounding affection for you and our babies i hail this day that brings you the matronly grace and dignity of three decades always yours s l c
