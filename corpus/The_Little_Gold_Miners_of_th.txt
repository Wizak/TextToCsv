sierras their mother had died crossing the plains and their father had had a leg broken by a wagon wheel passing over it as they descended the sierras and he was for a long time after reaching the mines miserable lame and poor the eldest boy jim keene as i remember him was a bright little fellow but wild as an indian and full of mischief the next eldest child madge was a girl of ten her fathers favorite and she was wild enough too the youngest was stumps poor timid starved little stumps i never knew his real name but he was the baby and hardly yet out of petticoats and he was very short in the legs very short in the body very short in the arms and neck and so he was called stumps because he looked it in fact he seemed to have stopped growing entirely oh you dont know how hard the old plains were on everybody when we crossed them in oxwagons and it took more than half a year to make the journey the little children those that did not die turned brown like the indians in that long dreadful journey of seven months and stopped growing for a time for the first month or two after reaching the sierras old mr keene limped about among the mines trying to learn the mystery of finding gold and the art of digging but at last having grown strong enough he went to work for wages to get bread for his halfwild little ones for they were destitute indeed things seemed to move on well then madge cooked the simple meals and little stumps clung to her dress with his little pinched brown hand wherever she went while jim whooped it over the hills and chased jackrabbits as if he were a greyhound he would climb trees too like a squirrel and oh it was deplorable but how he could swear at length some of the miners seeing the boy must come to some bad end if not taken care of put their heads and their pockets together and sent the children to school this school was a mile away over the beautiful brown hills a long pleasant walk under the green california oaks well jim would take the little tin dinner bucket and his slate and all their books under his arm and go booming ahead about half a mile in advance while madge with brown little stumps clinging to her side like a burr would come stepping along the trail under the oaktrees as fast as she could after him but if a jackrabbit or a deer or a fox crossed jims path no matter how late it was or how the teacher had threatened him he would drop books lunch slate and all and spitting on his hands and rolling up his sleeves would bound away after it yelling like a wild indian and some days so fascinating was the chase jim did not appear at the schoolhouse at all and of course madge and stumps played truant too sometimes a week together would pass and the keene children would not be seen at the schoolhouse visits from the schoolmaster produced no lasting effect the children would come for a day or two then be seen no more the schoolmaster and their father at last had a serious talk about the matter what can i do with him said mr keene youll have to put him to work said the schoolmaster set him to hunting nuggets instead of birdsnests i guess what the boy wants is some honest means of using his strength hes a good boy mr keene dont despair of him jim would be proud to be an honest miner jims a good boy mr keene well then thank you schoolmaster said mr keene jims a good boy and madge is good mr schoolmaster and poor starved and stunted motherless little stumps he is good as gold mr schoolmaster and i want to be a mother to em i want to be father and mother to em all mr schoolmaster and ill follow your advice ill put em all to work ahuntin for gold the next day away up on the hillside under a pleasant oak where the air was sweet and cool and the ground soft and dotted over with flowers the tenderhearted old man that wanted to be father and mother both located a claim the flowers were kept fresh by a little stream of waste water from the ditch that girded the brow of the hill above here he set a sluicebox and put his three little miners at work with pick pan and shovel there he left them and limped back to his own place in the mine below and how they did work and how pleasant it was here under the broad boughs of the oak with the water rippling through the sluice on the soft loose soil which they shoveled into the long sluicebox they could see the muletrains going and coming and the clouds of dust far below which told them the stage was whirling up the valley but jim kept steadily on at his work day after day even though jackrabbits and squirrels appeared on the very scene he would not leave till like the rest of the honest miners he could shoulder his pick and pan and go down home with the setting sun sometimes the men who had tried to keep the children at school would come that way and with a shy smile talk very wisely about whether or not the new miners would strike it under the cool oak among the flowers on the hill but jim never stopped to talk much he dug and wrestled away day after day now up to his waist in the pit one saturday evening the old man limped up the hillside to help the young miners clean up he sat down at the head of the sluicebox and gave directions how they should turn off the most of the water wash down the toilings very low lift up the riffle brush down the apron and finally set the pan in the lower end of the sluicetoil and pour in the quicksilver to gather up and hold the gold what for you put your hand in de water for papa queried little stumps who had left off his work which consisted mainly of pulling flowers and putting them in the sluicebox to see them float away he was sitting by his fathers side and he looked up in his face as he spoke hush child said the old man softly as he again dipped his thumb and finger in his vest pocket as if about to take snuff but he did not take snuff again his hand was reached down to the rippling water at the head of the sluicebox and this time curious but obedient little stumps was silent suddenly there was a shout such a shout from jim as the hills had not heard since he was a schoolboy he had found the color two colors three four five a dozen the boy shouted like a modoc threw down the brush and scraper and kissed his little sister over and over and cried as he did so then he whispered softly to her as he again took up his brush and scraper that it was for papa all for poor papa that he did not care for himself but he did want to help poor tired and crippled papa but papa did not seem to be excited so very much the little miners were now continually wild with excitement they were up and at work monday morning at dawn the men who were in the fathers tender secret congratulated the children heartily and made them presents of several small nuggets to add to their little horde in this way they kept steadily at work for half the summer all the gold was given to papa to keep papa weighed it each week and i suppose secretly congratulated himself that he was getting back about as much as he put in before quite the end of the third month jim struck a thin bed of blue gravel the miners who had been happily chuckling and laughing among themselves to think how they had managed to keep jim out of mischief began to look at each other and wonder how in the world blue gravel ever got up there on the hill and in a few days more there was a welldefined bed of blue gravel too and not one of the miners could make it out one saturday evening shortly after as the old man weighed their gold he caught his breath started and stood up straight straighter than he had stood since he crossed the plains then he hastily left the cabin he went up the hill to the childrens claim almost without limping then he took a pencil and an old piece of a letter and wrote out a notice and tacked it up on the big oaktree claiming those mining claims according to miners law for the three children a couple of miners laughed as they went by in the twilight to see what he was doing and he laughed with them but as he limped on down the hill he smiled that night as they sat at supper he told the children that as they had been such faithful and industrious miners he was going to give them each a present besides a little gold to spend as they pleased so he went up to the store and bought jim a red shirt long black and bright gum boots a broadbrimmed hat and a belt he also bought each of the other children some pretty trappings and gave each a dollars worth of gold dust madge and stumps handed their gold back to poor papa but jim was crazy with excitement he put on his new clothes and went forth to spend his dollar and what do you suppose he bought i hesitate to tell you but what he bought was a pipe and a paper of tobacco that red shirt that belt and broadbrimmed hat together with the shiny top boots had been too much for jims balance how could a man he spoke of himself as a man now how could a man be an honest miner and not smoke a pipe and now with his manly clothes and his manly pipe he was to be so happy he had all that went to make up the honest miner true he did not let his father know about the pipe he hid it under his pillow at night he meant to have his first smoke at the sluicebox as a miner should monday morning he was up with the sun and ready for his work his father who worked down the gulch had already gone before the children had finished their breakfast so now jim filled his brandnew pipe very leisurely and with as much calm unconcern as if he had been smoking for forty years he stopped to scratch a match on the door as he went out from under his broad hat he saw his little sister watching him and he fairly swelled with importance as stumps looked up at him with childish wonder leaving madge to wash the few tin dishes and follow as she could with little stumps he started on up the hill pipe in mouth he met several miners but he puffed away like a tugboat against the tide and went on his bright new boots whetted and creaked together the warm wind lifted the broad brim of his sombrero and his bright new red shirt was really beautiful with the green grass and oaks for a background and so this brave young man climbed the hill to his mine ah he was so happy illustration he took the limp young miner in his arms suddenly as he approached the claim his knees began to smite together and he felt so weak he could hardly drag one foot after the other he threw down his pick he began to tremble and spin around the world seemed to be turning over and over and he trying in vain to hold on to it he jerked the pipe from his teeth and throwing it down on the bank he tumbled down too and clutching at the grass with both hands tried hard oh so hard to hold the world from slipping from under him o jim you are white as snow cried madge as she came up white as er sunshine an blue an green too sisser look at brurrer all colors piped little stumps pitifully o jim jim brother jim what is the matter sobbed madge sunstroke murmured the young man smiling grimly like a true californian no it is not sunstroke its its cholera he added in dismay over his falsehood poor boy he was sorry for this second lie too he fairly groaned in agony of body and soul oh how he did hate that pipe how he did want to get up and jump on it and smash it into a thousand pieces but he could not get up or turn around or move at all without betraying his unmanly secret a couple of miners came up but jim feebly begged them to go sunstroke whispered the sister no tolera piped poor little stumps get out leave me groaned the young redshirted miner of the sierras the biggest of the two miners bent over him a moment yas its both he muttered choleranicotinefantum then he looked at his partner and winked wickedly without a word he took the limp young miner up in his arms and bore him down the hill to his fathers cabin while stumps and madge ran along at either side and tenderly and all the time kept asking what was good for cholera the other old honest miner lingered behind to pick up the baleful pipe which he knew was somewhere there and when the little party was far enough down the hill he took it up and buried it in his own capacious pocket with a halfsorrowful laugh poor little miner he sighed dont ever swear any more windy pleaded the boy to the miner who had carried him down the hill as he leaned over him and dont never lie i am going to die windy and i should like to be good windy it aint sunstroke its hush yer mouth growled windy i know what tis weve left it on the hill the boy turned his face to the wall the conviction was strong upon him that he was going to die the world spun round now very very fast indeed finally halfrising in bed he called little stumps to his side stumps dear good little stumps if i die dont you never never try for to smoke for thats whats the matter with me no stumps dear little brother stumps dont you never try for to go the whole of the honest miner for it cant be did by a boy were nothing but boys you and i stumps little stumps he sank back in bed and little stumps and his sister cried and cried and kissed him and kissed him the miners who had gathered around loved him now every one for daring to tell the truth and take the shame of his folly so bravely im going to die windy groaned the boy windy could stand no more of it he took jims hand with a cheery laugh git well in half an hour said he now that youve out with the truth and so he did by the time his father came home he was sitting up and he ate breakfast the next morning as if nothing had happened but he never tried to smoke any more as long as he lived and he never lied and he never swore any more oh no this jim that i have been telling you of is moral jim of the sierras the mine oh i almost forgot well that blue dirt was the old bed of the stream and it was ten times richer than where the miners were all at work below struck it i should say so ask any of the old sierras miners about the childrens claim if you want to hear just how rich they struck it a modern hero it was a very humble house only a flat of three rooms on the third floor of a tall tenementhouse in a back street near the river a bedroom a tiny parlor and a kitchen which was also an eatingroom made up the suite the briggses did all their daylight living in the lastnamed apartment the floor was painted yellow the walls were whitewashed the furniture was homely substantial and wellkept everything was shining clean and both windows were full of plants many of them in flower mrs briggs was fully persuaded in her own mind that no other woman in the city had such a tale of daily mercies as herself among them were the southern exposure of those windows and the circumstance that a gap in the buildings back of them let in the sunshine freely her nasturtiums blossomed there all winter from a pot she had suspended by strings from the top of the casing sweet alysseum flowed downward like a fountain of soft green waters tipped with white scarlet geraniums shot up rank shoots that had to be pruned into reasonableness and as to christmas roses but there the worthy soul would assure her acquaintances they do beat everything this winter the calla was about to bloom a kind lady had given the bulb to mrs briggss son and there was no telling the store he set by it topliffe briggs alias top senior was an engineer on the great north east west and south railway he sat at the teatable with his wife and son at fivethirty one cloudy february afternoon his next train went out at sixfortyfive he had run her into the station at four and his house was but two blocks away mrs briggs could see from those unparalleled kitchenwindows the bridge by which the track crossed the river separating the town from the marshes and could calculate to a minute when the familiar step would be heard on the stairs you see we live by railroad time was her modest boast and my husband always comes straight home she did not emphasize the my knowing in her compassionate heart what other husbands were prone to lag by the way until they came home late and crookedly top senior was on time today i ken trust her with bartlett you see he remarked to his wife he wont leave tel shes all trig an tidy for the next trip i wisht i could be as sure o stokes mrs briggs looked up inquiringly

tall stem crowned by the unfolding calyx juniors goin to be a masterhand with flowers observed the mother he saves me pretty nigh all the trouble o takin keer of em ive been thinkin that might be a good business for him when he grows up she was always forecasting his future with more anxiety than generally enters into maternal hopes and fears when but a year old he had fallen from the arms of a neighbor who had caught him up from the floor in a fit of tipsy fondness the childs back and hip were severely injured he had not walked a step until he was five years of age and would be lame always he was now twelve a dwarf in statue humpbacked weazenfaced and shrillvoiced unsightly in all eyes but those of his parents to them he was a miracle of precocity and beauty his mother took in fine ironing to pay for his private tuition from a public schoolteacher who lived in the neighborhood he learned fast and eagerly his father at the teachers suggestion subscribed to a circulating library and the same kind friend selected books for the cripples reading there was a hundred dollars in the savings bank against the name of topliffe briggs junior deposited dollar by dollar and representing countless acts of selfdenial on the part of the industrious couple and his possible profession was a favorite theme of family converse for that matter theres lot o things a scholard like him ken do

id cut a figger at the head of an army or speakin in congress or asetten on a gold throne wouldnt i no no my man sobering down suddenly into a sort of sad dignity yer father aint got the brains nor the eddication for nothin of that kind all he ken do is to live clean an honest in the sight o the lord an to run his ingine cordin to the best o his lights the lords too reasonable to expect more of

he had said the same thing every time he put them on since christmas they were a holiday gift from the conductors on the line between the two cities which was his semidaily beat i take a world o

top junior from his post at the callawindow saw the long line of cars spaced by dots of murkey red the luminous plume of smoke trailing cometwise above them slowly pass over the bridge it was a cloudy evening and the marshmists swallowed up the blinking windows as soon as the train gained the other shore junior loved his mother but his father seemed to take most of the life and cheer out of the room when he went existence stagnated for the boy who had no mates of his own age i wish he didnt hev to run in bad weather and nights he said fretfully its his business child an your father aint one to dodge his duty i hate the word retorted the petted cripple when im a man ill be my own master and switch duty off the track the obnoxious word came up again in the course of the evening in reading aloud to his teacher they happened upon this definition of a hero given by one of the characters in the story under his eyes one who in a noble work or enterprise does more than his duty junior looked up disappointed is that the meaning of hero he said intensely chagrined that is one way of stating it i doubt myself if we can do more than our duty what do you think mrs briggs asked the young woman she esteemed the honest couple for their sterling worth and sense and liked to draw them out a person ken ondertake more i spose ef they dont carry it through its a sign twas meant fur them to go jest that fur an no further twont do fur us to be skeery bout layin holt of the handle the good lord puts nighest to us fur fear its too big a thing fur us to manage thats what my husband says an if ever a man lived up to it he does top junior looked sober and mortified the heroism of common life does not commend itself to the youthful imagination when his lesson was finished it was time for him to go to bed wake me when father comes in was the formula without which he never closed his eyes his mother never failed to do it but he wanted to make sure of it she put on a lump of coal just enough to keep the fire in and sat down to the weekly mending at elevenforty she would open the draughts and cook the sausages readylaid in the pan on the table top senior liked something hot and hearty after his midnight run and this dispatched smoked the nightcap pipe of peace junior rolled in a shawl on his knee the wifes face and heart were calm with thankful content as the hours moved on she was rosy and plump with pleasant blue eyes and brown hair a wholesome presence at the hearthstone in her gown of clean chocolate calico with her linen collar and scarlet cravat top senior had noticed and praised the new red ribbon he comprehended that it was put on to please him and junior both of whom liked to see mother fixed up in this life they were her all and she accounted that life full and rich as she served she heard the slow patter of february rain on the shelf outside of the window where her flowers stood in summer the great city was sinking into such halfsleep as it took between midnight and dawn the shriek and rush of incoming and outgoing trains grew less frequent she did not fret over the disagreeable weather top senior had often said that such made home and fire and supper more welcome at juniors bedtime he was eighty miles away walking up and down the muddy platform of the principal station of agapolis stamping his feet at each turn in his promenade to restore the circulation his was a fast express train and he stood during most of the run on the alert to guard against accident there was no more careful engineer on the road fireman and brakeman were off for supper in or near the station he slouched as he walked his hands thrust deep into his pockets his overcoat was heavy and too loose even for his bulky figure he had taken it off the hands of an engineers widow whose husband was dragged from under a wrecked train one night last summer mother used to look grave when top senior began to wear it but she was not a mite notional mother wasnt and she was glad now that poor mrs wilson had the money and he had the beavercloth coat his face was begrimed with smoke his beard clogged with cinders and vapor a lady travelling alone hesitated visibly before she asked a question looked surprised when he touched his hat and turned to go half the length of the platform that he might point out the parlorcar he observed and interpreted hesitation and surprise and was goodhumoredly amused i spose i dont look much like what junior calls a hero he meditated with a broader gleam what a cute young one he is please god hell make a better figure in the world n his father hes done i hope that lilyflower o hisn will be open in the mornin seems if i got softerhearted bout hevin thet boy disappinted every day i live come summer he shell hev a run or two on her every week mother n me hes got to make up to him for what he loses in not bein strong an like other chillren mother shes disposed to spile him jest a leetle but dear me what a fustrate fault that is in a woman she did look good in that ere red necktie tonight an she was always pretty the rain was fine and close like a slanting mist that pierced the pores when the express drew out of the station and as it fell it froze stokes growled that the track would be one glare of ice before they got her in he was inclined to be surly tonight an uncommon circumstance with the young fellow and after several attempts to enliven him top senior let him alone he was not in a talkative mood himself the teatable chat ran in his head and set him to dreaming and calculating in five years junior would be seventeen old enough even for a lad who was not strong to earn his living if all went well there ought to be a hundred and fifty dollars in the bank by then there might be something in mothers idea of setting him up as a florist and mother could help with the flowers hello ole feller look out stokes had stumbled over the fuel in the tender in replenishing the boilerfires he recovered himself with an oath at the slippery rubbish something had upset his temper but he neither spoke nor looked like a man who had been drinking the teazing chilling drizzle continued the headlight of the locomotive glanced sharply from glazed rails and embankments the long barrelback of the engine shone as with fresh varnish dye know that on a night like this she beats out the tune o home sweet home s plain as ever you heerd a band play it said top senior cheerily out of the thickening damps it makes me see mother n the boy clear s ken be its a great thing fur a man to hev a comfortable home n a good woman in it stokes burst out vehemently at that this is worse than a dogs life we you n me are no more to them selfish creturs in there nodding backwards at the passenger cars then the ingine that draws em im sick o freezin an slavin an bein despised by men no better n i be how a man of any sperrit n ambition ken stan it fur twenty years as you hev beats my onderstandin he will always remember the pause that prefaced the reply and how top senior patted the polished lever under his hand as he spoke shes a pretty respectable cretur take her all in all when you n i run into the las dark deepo thats waitin fur us at the end i hope well be able to shows good stiffikits as hern heres the bridge will be soon home now it was a long bridge built far out to be above high tides as they touched it the furnacedoor flew open some said afterwards that the door was not properly secured others spoke of a backdraught others suspected that the fire was overfed the volume of flame that leaped out licked the very faces of the two men they recoiled with a bound and made a simultaneous rush for the airbrake in the forward passengercar to stop the train and check the backward sweep of the blaze the passengers seeing the flash and hearing the whistle and shouts of down brakes pressed against the front windows and a dense living mass blocked the door against which topliffe briggs flung all his weight illustration he held fast git in ef you ken he said to the fireman ill try her he fastened the shaggy greatcoat up to his chin as he faced the pursuing fires walked forward to the stand where lapped and curled the fiercest flames laid hold of steambrake and the lever by which he drove the engine his furlined gauntlets scorched and shrivelled as he grasped the bar the fire seized upon his hair and garments with an exultant roar he held fast he must get the passengers off the floorless bridge that might ignite at any moment he must check the engine as soon as he cleared the last pier or the cars would take fire before they could be uncoupled he shut his eyes from the maddening heat and glare and drove straight on not so fast as to hurry the greedy flames that were doing their worst upon him but at a rate that ran them over the river and upon solid earth as the fuel in the tender burst into a blaze and the forward car began to crackle and smoke in the hot draught at that point steam and airbrakes did their work in effecting a safe halt the fireman was badly scorched reported the press next day but train and passengers were saved by the heroism of the engineer the words flashed along the wires over land and ocean were set up in startling type in hundreds of newspaper offices while he who did not know heroism by name was breathing his last on a mattress laid on the yellowpainted floor of the room he had seen so clear when the enginethrob and pistonbeat played home sweet home the sunshine that had followed the rain touched the white cheek of the opened lily before falling on his sightless eyes and charred right hand when they brought him in he knew whose silent tears dropped so fast upon his face and the poor burned lips moved in a husky whisper the wife put her ear close to his mouth not to lose his dying words i was afraid youd see that we was afire from the winder i hope you didnt wake junior the boy who had begged his father to be a hero bennys wigwam now pettikins said benny briggs on the first day of vacation come along if you want to see the old witch pettikins got her little straw hat and holding bennys hand with a desperate clutch trotted along beside him giving frequent glances at his heroic face to keep up her courage her heart beat hard as they took their way across to the island the island is really no island at all but a lonely lovely portion of still harbor between bennys home and grandma potters which by means of a small inlet and a little creek and one watery thing and another is so nearly surrounded by water as to feel justified in calling itself an island they crossed over the little bridge that took them to this wouldbe island and following an almost imperceptible wood path came within sight of the witchs hut it was a deserted useless woodchoppers hut which the mysterious creature whom the children called a witch had taken possession of not long before here fanny drew back o benny i am afraid said she humph she cant hurt you in the daytime said benny she aint no different in the daytime from any other old woman its only nights she is a witch fanny allowed herself to be led a few steps further and then drew back again o benny said she theres her broomstick there it is right outside o the door and o benny benny theres her old black cat wal what on it hey what on it creaked a dreadful voice close behind them then indeed fanny shrieked and tried to run but bennys hand held her fast she hid her face against bennys arm and sobbed it was the old witch her very self she looked at them out of her glittering eyes o how she did look at them with her head drooped until her chin rested on her chest this seemed to bring the arrows of her eyes to bear upon the enemy with greater force and precision there aint any law agin my having a cat and a broomstick is there she asked in a voice like the cawing of a crow bringing her staff down with a thump at the words cat and broomstick what are you skeered of why youre queer you know said benny desperately queer queer piped the witch and then she laughed or had a dreadful convulsion benny couldnt tell which ending in a long gurgling hoooooo on a very high key now spose you tell me what is t makes me queer said she sitting down on a log and extracting from the rags on her bosom a pipe which she prepared to smoke whew whistled benny twould take me from now till christmas id rather youd tell me the crone lighted her pipe the match flaring upon her wrinkled coppercolored face and its gaunt features made her hideous poor little fanny who ventured to peep out at this moment sobbed louder and begged to go to her mother the old woman puffed away at her pipe fixing her gaze upon the children got a mother hey said she yes and a father yes ummm she puffed and gazed you wouldnt like to see em shot at this benny stood speechless and fanny set up such a cry to go home that benny was afraid he should have to take her away that is if the witch would let him he began to consider his chances still the more terrible the old witch seemed the more benny wanted to see and hear her he whispered to fanny she wont hurt you pettikins she cant i wont let her hush a minute and see what im going to say to her fanny hushed a little and benny fixed an audacious gaze upon the witch or a gaze which he meant should be audacious what is the matter with you said he the old woman removed her pipe and sat holding it with her forefinger lapped over it like a hook they call it exterminated said she pushing back the broadbrimmed highcrowned mans hat that she wore and showing her gray ragged locks im exterminated you dont know what that is i spose exterminated exterminated said benny scratching his head why to to

palms of her hands injuns before theyre exterminated stick to their homes like other folks illustration they encounter the witch you aint an injun be you gasped benny with a look and tone which expressed volumes of consternation and disappointment at her utter failure to come up to his ideal indian why she wasnt the least bit like the pictures she wasnt like the magnificent figures he had seen in front of the cigar stores in new haven where were all her feathers and things her red and yellow tunic her gorgeous moccasons her earrings and noserings and bracelets and armlets and beads why she was juuuust as ragged and dirty all this and more bennys tone expressed when he said why you aint an injun be you well i was i aint nothing at all now i aint even a squaw and they said they was going to make a christian on me i was a chetonquin oh yes said benny looking at her now with the interest attaching to one who had worn the feathers and beads and moccasons and rings well what did you do when the colonel told you to go west we had a fight that was satisfactory to benny which whipped he asked with his own native briskness as if this now was common ground and he was ready to talk at his ease which amost always whips it was a hard fight i hid behind a big tree and watched it when i saw my father shot i started to go to him and a shot struck me see there said she pushing up her coarse gray locks and showing a deeper wider seam than the creases and wrinkles on her face a bullet grazed me hard and i was stunned and blinded with the blood and couldnt run but my people had to they didnt any on em see or know about me i spose and i laid there and sorter went to sleep colonel hammerton took a notion to pick me up when he rode over the ground he had soaked with the blood of my people ground that belonged to my people shrieked the woman straightening herself up and shaking her fists in the air benny liked that even fanny gazed at the strange creature with fascination and when the indians excitement abated and she ceased to mutter and chatter to herself and sunk her face into her palms again gazing absently on the ground fanny pulled bennys sleeve and whispered ask her what he did then after he picked her up what did he do with you then ventured benny the old woman started and gazed at them curiously as if she had forgotten all about them and had to recall them out of the distant past what did who do said she what did colonel hammerton do with you when he picked you up oh i didnt know who picked me up thought twas some of my people i spose colonel hammerton carried me off to the fort and then took me to washington said he was going to make a christian on me i had to stay in houses sleep in houses like being nailed up in a box ugh what a misery tis to be made a christian on hoooooooooo you wouldnt want to know all the racks and miseries and fights and grinds on it i guess they got sick on it themselves for after id tried a many times to get away from houses and been brought back i tried again and they let me go and ive been agoing ever since i asked for my people and they told me they was exterminated every one on em yes ive been agoing ever since but i cant go any more i hope theyll let me stay in these forests till the great spirit takes me away to my people he cant find me in the houses but if i keep out in the forest i hope hell find me soon its been a weary long time are you two hundred years old asked benny softly thats what folks say two hunderd hoooooooo two hunderd im ten hundered if im a day said the poor old creature but dont be afeard on me i hope there wont be anybody afeard on me here for then theyd be driving on me off or shutting me up again somewhere where the great spirit cant find me tell your people not to be skeered on me ask em to let me stay here the sad old eyes looked wistfully at benny whose generous heart took up the poor indians cause at once you can stay here fast enough said he i know who these woods belong to some o my relations there wont anybody be afraid of you me n bijahll take care of you o bless you said she i thought id got to the right place when i got here it looked like it it felt like it it seemed amost as if i most expected to see wigwams ahhhh if i could sleep in a wigwam benny felt that he could sympathize with her in that he and the boys had played indians and bijah had built wigwams for them in the wood and he had greatly wished and entreated to be allowed to sleep all night in one but he could not guess at the longing of the aged to go back to the things dear and familiar to them in childhood he did not know that all the old indians days were spent in dreaming of those things and that she often wandered all night in the woods fancying herself surrounded by the wigwams of her people searching anxiously for that of her father though benny could understand nothing of the pathetic sadness he felt a strong desire to offer consolation and cheer and he said i can build wigwams me n bijahll make you a wigwam but the aged chetonquin muttered to herself in a tuneless quaver and shook her head doubtingly what she dont believe it benny exclaimed to himself dont believe that bijah can make wigwams well show her and he was so eager to be about it that he took leave directly of his strange acquaintance who seemed lost in reverie and to have forgotten him entirely when mr and mrs briggs heard bennys story of the poor indian woman their excellent hearts were at once filled with compassion for so forlorn a creature mr briggs had very radical theories about equal mercy and justice for each member of the human race it isnt likely he often said that some have a right to be in this world and others havent and he immediately set himself to illustrate his theories in the case of the chetonquin mrs briggs said there could be not doubt that she needed other things besides wigwams which conjecture was found to be sadly true upon investigation an attempt was made to put this last of the chetonquins into more comfortable quarters but she received the suggestion with dismay and prayed so earnestly to be left on the spot she seemed to think was like her own native forest that it was decided to make her as comfortable as possible there since it was early summer and no harm could come from exposure when the weather was cold again she would be glad to be sheltered elsewhere so mr and mrs briggs grandma potter and bijah took care that she needed nothing and left her to be happy in her own way her shattered mind little by little let go of everything save the memories of her childhood all the people of the neighboring region old and young came to understand and respect the sorrows of the poor creature they had talked of as a witch but the most friendly people seemed to disturb her to break in upon her dreams and children especially were not allowed to visit her benny could not forego however the pleasure he had promised himself of getting bijah to help him make a fine wigwam in the woods and saying to old winneenis as she called herself there what dye call that theres a wigwam for ye n me n bijah made it too benny might make as many wigwams as he pleased mr briggs said but he was not to go near or disturb old winneenis one extremity of the island was in the vicinity of grandma potters and benny passed a good many days of his vacation at grandmas one day benny said to bijah now you can make that wigwam cant you bijah you said you would when the hay was all in and it is all in aint it les make it today over there in the woods on the island the boys are coming over tomorrow and i want to have it done before they get here say will you bijah wal id know but i can said bijah i want a real one said benny lifesize just like them you saw when you was out there to dakota none o your babyhouses bijah went upstairs into the barn chamber humming the sweet by and by and benny accompanied him in doing both bijah opened an enormous chest and pulled out a lot of old buffalo and other robes the wornout and motheaten accumulation of years not to say generations and sitting down took out his jackknife and ripped the ragged linings out of several that were pretty well divested of their fur and making a pile of skins old horse blankets and lap rugs he said now then sir well have a wigwam fit for old black hawk himself and you may be sure bijah was as good as his word he got out old tom and the wagon and he and benny and the skins and blankets all got in and drove over to the woods on the island and there bijah cut poles and made the finest wigwam ever seen this side of the rocky mountains or the other side either for that matter they spread blankets on the ground inside and benny declared it wanted nothing but a few indians and tomahawks and bows and arrows lying round to make it look just like the picture in his gography bennys last thought was of his wigwam that night as he slid off into the delicious sleep that only rosycheeked tired boys know he dreamed he was the chief of a powerful tribe and that he found old winneenis not old any longer but a little girl like fanny crying in the forest because she couldnt find her way to her people and that he took her by the hand and led her home her shout of rapture when she found herself once more with her people wakened benny and he saw it was morning and the shout he had heard instead of being that of little winneenis was grandmas voice calling him to get up he was rather disappointed to find he wasnt a powerful chief but he consoled himself with the thought of his uncommonly fine wigwam and hurried down stairs to see what time it was for the boys were to come on the early train and he meant to go right over to the woods with them he had scarcely finished his breakfast when the boys arrived and they all started for the woods in great glee on the way benny told them the story of old winneenis and the boys were full of wonder interest and curiosity to see her upon reaching the wigwam they admired its outside agreed that nothing in that style of architecture could surpass it and now said benny see how nice tis inside and he took a peep in himself why whispered he drawing back shes here shes here in the wigwam sound asleep and she looks awful glad shsh with a warning shake of his finger we mustnt disturb her father said i mustnt les go away and wait till she wakes up they each took a peep at the old indian woman and went away softly they remained in sight of the wigwam exhausting every device for wearing away the time and joes watch was frequently consulted time and patience wore away together there said charlie at last weve waited long enough we ought to wake her up now it might make her crazy again to see such a lot of us and i i dont like to said benny ill go n ask bijah what to do they went and brought bijah who said he should think likely she would want to sleep a spell she must be pretty well beat out pokin around all night hed heard her making them queer noises o hern something like a hoarse kind o phoebe bird it sounded in the distance i shouldnt be surprised he began in a low tone stooping and peering in at the wigwam but contrary to his words he did look very much surprised indeed he stepped into the wigwam and touched the sleeper gently then he shook his head at the boys and motioned them away and when he came out they understood from his look that old winneenis was dead wandering as was her wont at night she had come upon bennys wigwam standing in the clear moonlight and to her longing bewildered mind it had probably seemed the wigwam of her father who can ever know the joy the feeling of peace and rest and relief with which she laid her tired bones down in it and fell asleep a carefree child once more and thus passed from its door into the happy huntinggrounds and benny always felt glad the wigwam had been built bennys disappearance every year a few of the blest among the boys of still harbor were taken to new haven or new london to see the greatest show on earth while the unlucky remainder were obliged to content themselves with what imagination could do for them but one memorable year mr p t barnum landed and magnified himself on our own fences his magnanimity ran over and flamed into still harbor bringing all his miracles and monsters to our very doors as it were and we had no more miserable boys but we had plenty of boys who aspired to be miracles and monsters or boys who essayed the trapeze the tight rope the flying leap and all sorts of possible and impossible acrobatic contortions and distortions eminent among these was benny briggs for if you looked high enough you could see him any day with a balancing pole in his hand walking on the ridgepoles and fences or making of himself all sorts of peduncles and pendulums bringing about in his own individual person the most astonishing inversions subversions and retroversions and the most remarkable twists and lurches and topseyturveys and topplingsover but there was one opportunity that bennys soaring ambition had not embraced his active mind had never yet discovered the possibility of a real tight rope for a real tight rope he languished on a tight rope he yearned to walk the clothes line was a little too slender his sister fannys skipping rope was not only too slender but too short and these were the only ropes of his acquaintance the ridgepoles and fences only mocked at his ideal he wanted something that hung unsupported something airy something worthy of the acrobatic art upon which he could walk with credit and grace and reaching the end bow and kiss his hand to the spectators before returning for this he searched by day and of this he dreamed by night and one day he found it benny said his mother on the morning of that day your grandmother potter has sent for you to come over shes going to have uncle johns and uncle calvins boys there youll like that wont you hi shouted benny throwing up his new straw hat the sign and seal of pleasant summer weather id like to see the fellow that wouldnt at nine oclock that morning at exactly nine oclock benny started his mother remembered it well for she looked up at the clock and said now dont hurry benny go along easily and youll get there before ten for grandmother potters was scarcely two miles back in the country and benny thought nothing of stepping over there especially when inducements were offered he called his dog sandy and marched off with a light step and a light heart but his hands remained at home that is to say his hands were nowhere so much at home as in his trousers pockets and there they reposed while benny paced along whistling not for joseph not if i knows it and sandy nosing it all the way his mother watched him with pride as usual the neighbors saw him go by and said there goes benny briggs he haint broken his neck yet but i presume to say thatll be the next thing he does uncle johns and uncle calvins boys from new haven arrived early at grandmother potters a place which seemed to them to contain all the pleasures of all the spheres for grandmothers weakness was for boys and nothing suited her better than getting all her grandsons together and giving them full swing as abijah called it and abijah was made by nature to help grandmother out in her benevolent plans he instituted jolly measures and contrived possibilities of riot and revel that no mortal ever thought of before as circuses were the fashion in urchin society on that particular day abijah like a wizard had called up out of the farm resources and out of certain mysterious resources of his own that were so plainly of unearthly origin that it was of no use in the world to try to look into or understand them such a circus as would have made not only p t barnum but the ancient romans themselves perfectly miserable with envy there was the trapeze the tight rope the well alas i dont know the names of them all having had a limited education in such matters but there they all were whatever they are called those things that make a perfect finished spalendid beyeutiful circus there were hoops with tissue paper pasted over them to be jumped through by the most wonderful bareback riders on earth and old tom grandmothers own horse was perfectly safe as a trained arabian steed when bijah was there to see how the thing was managed everything was safe and sure and delightful when bijah had charge of it nothing ever went wrong or upset or came to a sorry end with him or his plans he knew what he was about and ends with him were even more brilliant and satisfactory than beginnings and means i shouldnt dare to fully tell you what good times the boys had at grandmother potters especially on fourth of julys thanksgivings christmases and birthdays for fear of making all the boys who couldnt go there discontented and low spirited for the rest of their lives im sorry for those boys but at the same time i may as well go on and tell them about benny briggs he was preparing to be very discontented and low spirited just at the moment when joe and will and harry and rob and charlie and morris and cad were shouting their exultation at the only wonderful circus on earth they all decided that the performances were not to begin however until benny briggs arrived there could be no circus without ben no indeed there were stars of the arena among them of various magnitudes but benny was the comet that outshone and outstripped them all why dont he come along said charlie dancing a doubleshuffle on the barn floor to let off his impatience lets go and look for him said joe and they all shuffled off down to the gate thinking to see benny with his nose pointed straight for that gate or as straight as could be expected considering its faithfulness in another direction but no benny was to be seen he cant be far off said joe seizing an opportunity to look at his new silver watch for its halfpast ten now and ben is always here before ten always was i mean lets go up to the top of the hill and meet him proposed will we can see him from there anyhow so charlie and joe and morris and will and cad started for the top of the hill while harry and rob who were a good deal inclined to wait for things to come to them remained to swing on the gate the five spies soon returned and reported that benny was nowhere to be seen impatience now seized them all and they flocked into the house to put it to grandma whether it wasnt mighty queer that ben briggs hadnt come he hasnt come exclaimed grandma looking up over her glasses at the clock why what can be the matter its almost eleven oclock its one minute and a quarter past said joe appealing to his watch your clocks leven minutes slow o get out said charlie with a contemptuous sniff all the clocks are either fast or slow according to that turnip here would have ensued a good deal of pro and con about watches but grandma held them to the subject of benny briggs she drew from them that they had been to the very top of the hill and couldnt see him coming grandma was surprised and disappointed its incomprehensible said she o i say grandma groaned charlie flopping into a chair and fanning himself with his hat what a big word incomprehensible and the other day you said pristbyterianism o my pppppooh stuttered morris who was always a little ahead of everybody except in conversation i know a lllllonger word lets hear you say it then shouted the rest of the boys takes you to make long words said charlie iiiiiii began morris embarrassed by the evident want of confidence in his ability go it said charlie fire away said joe incococococo proceeded morris spell it suggested harry in in come come spelled morris with great fluency and then stopped short income exclaimed two or three voices disdainfully call that a long word hoho nnno wawawawait a minute implored morris tugging at a button on his jacket and fixing a studious inquiring gaze on the kitchen floor write it said will i cccccant said poor morris gloomily give it up then recommended joe no sir said charlie putting his feet up in a second chair and making himself comfortable i dont give it up sir im going to know what this bumper of a word is well how are we ever going to know if morris cant say it nor spell it nor write it demanded joe mebby he can thing it said little cad good for you caddy said charlie youve hit it morris can sing fast enough now morris well sing i love to go to sundayschool and you sing your word instead of those begin boys sing loud morris so the boys all sang softly i love i love i love i love i love to go to sundayschool except morris who sang with a triumphant shout i love i love i love i love incomprehensibility and the boys gave him three cheers at that moment grandma purposely left the pantry door open and there disclosed to view was a land of promise a row of delicious little cakes with chocolate frosting smiling on the pantry shelf the boys instantly crossed over to this inviting land and took possession while grandma who was sometimes rather unwise in her loving kindness looked greatly pleased i do wish benny was here said she boys she added as if a new thought had come to her go and tell bijah i want to speak to him the boys clattered out a stampede of young colts it seemed and soon returned each doing his part in bringing bijah for every separate boy had hold of him somewhere as if at the least laxity on their part there was danger of his escape bijah grinned broadly and bore it bravely bijah said grandma potter i must have benny here to dinner i cant have his place vacant what can have kept him away she added as if to herself i hope he hasnt been doing anything he ought not to hes such a little rogue wal i d knows i should be for goin so furs to say that mis potter but benny is curis and mebby he has slipped over to spain or france before comin round here said bijah o dear groaned grandmother the names of these faraway regions giving her a sense of exposure and danger i hope nothing has happened to my benny bijah you must harness up and go over and see whats the matter yesm said bijah turning to obey and every boy set up a petition that he should go in the long wagon and let them go too so in the long wagon they went shouting and whistling and singing along with their eyes wide open to catch a sight of benny if by chance he should be coming loitering on his way but not one of them looked in the right direction in spite of bennys frequent little derelictions from the path he might have been expected to walk in his mother was greatly surprised and troubled to hear that he had not arrived at his grandmothers and furthermore that he had not been seen on the road why nothing could have tempted him to stay away from grandmas said she still she added after a moments reflection he may have gone by the brook road and met johnny barstow if he has and then stopped to do a little fishing he would never think how the time was flying i never saw a boy who had so little idea of time as benny wal said bijah well go down the brook road way n see f we cn ketch this young trout so they returned by the brook but found no benny and johnny barstow hadnt seen him every ray of the calm smile which usually shone in grandma potters face faded when she saw bijah and the boys come back without benny and heard of their fruitless search she sat silently down in her rockingchair and her dear sweet old face was pale bijah said she at length you must take the colt and the light buggy and go go somewhere anywhere everywhere until you find him no boys you cant go bijah mustnt be hindered bijah was at a loss where to go but he obeyed directions and went somewhere anywhere and it seemed as if he had been everywhere and inquired at every house in and about still harbor along the shore in the woods and through the fields but nobody had seen benny since about nine oclock that morning at last he went again to see if benny perhaps had got home what cried mrs briggs when she saw bijah come the second time he hasnt come you havent found him o my boy my boy o now mis briggs dont you go to worry about benny said bijah i never see a boy t knew how to take care of himself bettern benny hell turn up all right youll see but in spite of his apparent cheerfulness bijah was a good deal troubled himself where could benny be unless at the bottom of the sound bijah in his search had already been to mr briggs store to inquire for benny and in starting to go there again he met mr briggs coming home he and bijah discussed the possibilities and probabilities of bennys case and mr briggs agreed to send word over to grandma potter if benny came home and bijah agreed to come directly over and tell his father and mother if benny should reach his grandmothers at the eleventh hour the eleventh hour arrived however and still no benny the boys sat in the barn door and wondered in voices hushed almost to whispers where benny could be where is benny asked little fanny again and again o where is benny moaned his poor mother and the question sank like lead into his fathers heart grandma raised her gentle eyes and asked it of heaven itself and you my children by this time are asking it of me i feel bound to tell you this much benny was i shudder to say it benny was enduring the fate once proposed for mr jefferson davis the sun was getting low the shadows were long on the grass and bennys pitiful shadow as it lengthened stretched nearer and nearer home ah would he ever get there himself again it was milking time bijah sat milking the cows in the barnyard when in bounced sandy he hadnt come on bennys account that was plain he was thirsty and begged for milk which he had frequently had from the hand of bijah he was no storybook dog only quite a commonplace fellow who hadnt the faintest idea that he ought to have arrived here hours ago and won fame for himself by showing the way to benny however youll see presently that he wasnt to blame for that illustration they start in search of benny bijah stopped milking and sprang to his feet hello said he sandy i vum that means t benny aint fur off you dont ketch that feller to stir a peg from benny f he cn help himself bijah gave sandy some milk feeling sure that if benny was on earth sandy would go straight back again to where he had left him benny was not on earth but sandy having finished his refreshment without even waiting to return thanks trotted off across lots at a great pace bijah following in hot pursuit away they splashed through the marshy meadows jump they went over the stone walls land said bijah where be you agoin as sandy leaped across a ditch into the great kingsbury orchard mr kingsbury had died a year before his wife had closed the old homestead and gone to live with her daughter and the farm had been for sale ever since bijah sprang over the ditch and came sprawling into the orchard when he had picked himself up sandy was nowhere to be seen the loneliness of the deserted farm and the soberness of approaching evening were all about him hello he shouted and he thought he heard a response hello he repeated and he was sure of a faint faint cry towards which he bounded shouting benny benny and presently directly over his head he heard a voice which seemed to come from heaven saying bijah o bijah here up here bijah looked toward the sky and behold dangling from one of the topmost branches of a famous big sour appletree a pair of sturdy boys legs and there was sandy lying on the ground beneath them jericho said bijah and he hadnt much more than said it before he was scrambling up the tree like a great ourangoutang with some difficulty he unhooked benny and brought him to earth and his great warm heart swelled with tender pity as he returned home with the poor boy in his arms and his shoulder was as wet with bennys tears when he reached there as if he had been out in a thunder storm i dare say you will partly guess the story of bennys misfortune but for the sake of those who are not good guessers i shall tell you that he had taken a fancy to cut across a corner of the kingsbury farm that morning to make the distance to his grandmothers shorter in his unwise fashion never considering that climbing walls and fences paddling through the marshy meadows and contriving to get over the ditch would more than overbalance the few steps he saved when he reached the kingsbury orchard where all the apple boughs were trained in horizontal lines with a view to making them bear well his head seemed to swim with suggestions of tight ropes around and above the air was filled with golden opportunities as near to tight ropes as paradise is near to heaven itself these precious opportunities whispered to benny the charming visions beckoned and benny felt that if it cost him two and sixpence he must have a walk on some of those enchanting boughs everything was just as it had been left when mr kingsbury died against one of the trees stood a ladder and scattered all about under the trees were the limbs that had been lopped off under his direction the very day when he fell with apoplexy here and there they had been gathered up in bristling piles benny ascended into one after another of these blissful trees at first he walked on the lowest boughs but gradually went higher and higher until he promenaded fearlessly on the very topmost he bowed he kissed his hand he turned and returned he was happy and time sped swiftly by he was so absorbed in his delight that he heard as one who hears not a wagon go rattling along the road and the shouting whistling and singing of boys it was past noon before he recalled the object with which he had left home that morning he sat upon the very pinnacle of achievement that is to say he sat upon the very highest point in the orchard his head up his spirits up with such a decidedly upward tendency that it was hard for him to make up his mind to descend to the plane of common life however he thought it must be something past ten oclock so he slipped himself off his pinnacle or was in the act of doing so when he missed his hold and went off with a sudden jerk something scraped the whole length of his back and seemed to hold him in a relentless grip it was the stump of a small branch which had caught him by the bottom of his loose jacket and slipped up under it quicker than a wink as benny slid down it was one of those things of which we say you couldnt do it again to save your life and there benny exalted hung the tips of his toes just touched a bough below with the tips of his fingers and thumb he could reach and pick at the end of a branch above he tried to throw his legs up and catch on some salient point he struggled to reach his elbows up and pull himself back he would have unbuttoned his jacket and slipping his arms out dropped to the ground but it looked a long way and directly below him was a pile of the loppedoff branches with their sharp ends sticking up towards him like the spikes of cruel chevauxdefrise and he didnt fancy dropping on those he shouted for help but there was no one to hear him on the deserted farm and the few farmers who rattled by in their wagons paid no heed to a boys shout boys are always shouting and the more hideous the noises they make the more it is like them sandy who had remained asleep in the grass while benny performed his manoeuvres thought no more of this one than he had thought of the others he supposed it was a part of the fun the very best part of it as he opened one eye and saw those legs dancing in air and bennys yells were the things to be expected of benny but when benny shouted go sandy go home and various other commands to sandy hoping the dog might go and bring some one to his rescue as dogs always do in stories sandy sat upon his hind legs and looked at benny in amazement these were remarks that had never been made to him before and he couldnt guess for his life what they meant never had he been sent home he had stuck to benny through thick and thin during all his eventful life and he meant to do it now so there he did stick until he saw by the shadows that it was about milking time and being thirsty to say nothing of hungry and observing that benny was still engaged in dancing and tilting on the tips of his toes sandy excused himself went after his milk and brought back deliverance to benny as we have seen poor poor benny the joy of his return called out more tears than smiles worn and faint and nervous he was put to bed at grandma potters and it was many days before he was the same old benny briggs again in one respect he was never quite the same his views in respect to tight ropes had met with a radical change p s if any of you boys should say as charlie potter did pooh if id been benny briggs i could have got down out of that tree ill say to you as benny said to him humph id like to see you try it how two schoolboys killed a bear it was an unpleasant day the gray clouds looked cold and dark and the wind was blowing a gale as the stage left the little village of lowton on its daily trip to the summit the weather prophets said it was the equinoctial although it was ten days too early if the almanac was right and every one predicted a storm a northeaster that would set all the streams boiling and probably carry away all the bridges between lowton and the summit but little for northeasters cared leon and sam bearer as they settled themselves cosily inside they each carried a shotgun and under the care of their elder brother herbert they were going on a two weeks hunt among the well stocked forests on the mountains back of the summit at noon they stopped at the halfway house a little hotel built just at the rise of the mountain where they were served with fresh venison in a diningroom hung with great antlers from the deer killed by the landlord and his son who was only fourteen years old no older than sam the boys became very much excited listening to their hunting stories and after dinner nothing but herberts decided command prevented their loading the guns to be ready for any game they might see on the road the landlord and the driver said that they never saw any deer driving along the road but the boys thought it might be that they would and after they started a strict watch was kept which resulted in seeing fortyone squirrels but nothing larger they had not driven many miles up the mountain before it cleared off and the sun came out the forest road lined with ferns and banks of moss was very picturesque and leon and sam enjoyed the ride as only happy schoolboys can in the pleasantest spot that boys can be a forest peopled with deer and squirrels and when they reached the summit house they were in as good spirits as jolly boys could be who expected a glorious chase the next day the hotel was a large pleasant one and on every side were the trophies of game that so delight a boys heart the office and diningroom were hung with antlers and the hat rack in the hall was made from them then there was a couch and some seats covered with bear skins and supported by great branching antlers with so many prongs that leon tired of counting them although he knew each one represented a year and that he could compute the deers age by them in the sittingroom there were a stuffed deer a fox a number of similar animals a partridge some pigeons and many small birds and in the office were two large panthers that looked very fierce and natural their glass eyes glaring as if watching a victim their feet placed as if ready for a leap but the boys enjoyed most the deer in the large park back of the hotel there were four old deer and two pretty young fawns with glossy spotted coats that sam and leon thought were the most beautiful animals they had ever seen as they ran and played together like lambs jumping and capering with a perfect grace that only deer possess after a nice venison supper the boys went to bed and in a few minutes both were dreaming of deer and bears panthers and hounds and all the excitements of the chase among the gamecovered mountains early in the morning and long before herbert was up sam and leon were out again watching the deer in the park and examining again the terrible panthers whose changeless eyes looked just as fierce as the night before their guns were loaded and when they had eaten breakfast and the men were ready to start the boys were off ahead ready for the expected game all the way up the mountain path to the runways they kept the lead occasionally stopping to rest in the shade of some great pine where chattering squirrels were quarrelling over their breakfast often too they would leave the path and plunge off in search of track which they failed to find so that by the time the runways were reached they were well tired the landlord stationed sam and leon on the lower runway while he and herbert went to those higher up the mountain there was a long time to wait before any game could be expected as the man who was to start the hounds had a good distance to make before sending them off and he was only a halfhour ahead of the watchers leon laid down to rest after making sure that his gun was in good order but sam wandered around looking for squirrels and signs of game until suddenly he heard away back on the mountain the bay of a hound this was a signal that the chase had begun and he hurried back to the watchingplace to be ready for the deer should the deer come for nearly an hour the boys stood with guns ready every minute hoping to see a deer a squirrel running through the brush would bring their guns to their faces and at the slightest rustle of the bushes they would start and listen meanwhile the hounds were surely coming nearer and nearer their excited barking proclaiming that they were close upon the game and at last sam was sure they were down on the lower runway and turning to leon in great excitement he said lets keep cool and we can kill this deer then wont herb be sorry he went further up both boys felt sure there must be a deer coming although they had been told that the hounds often came in without anything at last they could hear the brush crackling yes the hounds were surely down on their runway and in a minute the dogs and game did come in sight together but what a surprised pair of huntsmen they were when they saw what the game was leon was frightened while even sam felt a little uneasy the hounds had not started a deer at all instead they were pursuing an old bear and two young cubs about the size of a large dog the old bear was very large and fierce and whenever the hounds came up with the cubs that could not run very fast she would turn around and fight until the cubs ran on a few rods and then she would run again just as the bear and cubs reached the watching place there was a fight and the great creature caught one of the hounds and hugged him in her arms till he was breathless all the time sitting up on her hind legs and looking as tall as a man while she was in this position sam took aim at her head and fired and a moment later leon fired too then the bear started to run and they both fired the other barrel of their shotguns though without taking much aim but a moment after they saw her lying on the ground surrounded by the pack by this time herbert and the landlord had come down in hot haste to see what the shooting was for and in great surprise they gathered around the huge creature which the boys had secured leon and sam had really killed a bear a genuine black bear a large one too the landlord said the largest he had seen that year and there were never two prouder fellows than these two schoolboys as they surveyed their noble game but this was not all the hounds were sent after the cubs and in a few minutes they were caught alive they were taken to the hotel and caged very quiet animals they were in a few days they would eat from the boys hands as tame as the fawns in the park never trying to bite or showing any crossness with these pets and with their fine bear skin to show it is no wonder that the boys thought there was never a pleasanter place than the hotel in the mountains and it is not at all strange that they hated to leave it when their two weeks were up but they had a new strong cage made for the baby bears and took them home to keep in the little yard near the barn where every boy and nearly every man in town came to see them and to hear the story of their capture and take the dimensions of the handsome black bear skin at school certainly nothing else was talked of that term and i fear the boys really believed they were the best hunters in the state how long their mamma will allow them to keep their pets they do not know but they hope it will be as long as the two bears live and behave petes printing press what do you want for christmas asked mrs downs in a kindly manner i dont know mother replied pete slowly last year it was a paintbox bicycle foils and you said i could use dicks foils and that you couldnt afford bicycles after the new carpet so it got down to a paintbox and that wasnt much of a christmas thats the comfort in regularly having christmases in time you get what you want answered his mother that isnt always so i think it depends on what a fellow wants and ive made a strike this year im not going to say thank you for what i dont want only i dont exactly know what i do want it must be either either a bicycle or a printing press or indian clubs and if it is a bicycle it must be the real kind wooden ones are not allowed in processions and if it is clubs i shall knock my head off so it better be a printing press it doesnt make any difference to you this year does it as we have not got to buy a new carpet i have decided it shall be a printing press and i shall get orders enough to pay for new curtains not quite so fast i dont know about the orders and i do know printing presses cost and that indian clubs are cheap oh you cant put me off till another christmas it is like alice in wonderland having jam tomorrow and when tomorrow comes it isnt tomorrow i am going to have it and you can all club together and buy it instead of giving me separately sleeve buttons and scarf pins and cologne and paper and pocket scissors a fellow wants real things that he can do something with printing press now you remember and off rushed pete as dick gave a low warwhoop the signal for an incursion of boys into the shed this shed was filled with relics of former joys with the dйbris of unsuccessful inventions with toolboxes whose tools were missing with oil cans without oil with boards full of nails with the wheels of broken carts and with strings ropes and clothes lines of various lengths yet to a newcomer it was always an el dorado of enjoyment into this now sprang tumbled the cronies dick jack phil and shel which latter name was a contraction for general sheridan i say exclaimed phil i am getting tired of your shed havent had an idea in it for months same old contrivances get up something new you just wait said pete the proprietor o come along boys if it is wait dont let us wait here said shel and off they started on a raid for fun pete returned from the excursion to dream all night of what might and of what might not be his wishes became so thoroughly mixed that he fancied he had told his mother he wanted nothing not even christmas itself but the horror of such a mistake effectually roused him the next morning there was no indication of forthcoming glories except that they had less than usual for breakfast a kind of atonement to which mrs downs sometimes treated her family pete sighed the greetings for a merry christmas were of doubtful value to him he was of a foreboding nature and experience had taught him to be prepared for disappointment in the matter of presents he went to church and noticed carefully the style of type in the hymn books he came home and took down all his books from their shelves for the same purpose of investigation even dinner itself failed to bring forgetfulness for he thought if he could print billsoffare for such lengthy repasts he might make money though he felt he could never spell the queer french names of dishes at last the meal was ended and the big parlor doors were thrown open displaying horizontal rows of evergreen with various knickknacks fastened to these mysterious lines which on inspection proved to be the bars of an oldfashioned clotheshorse it made one think of sums in addition put down in agreeable shapes one green line of gifts and then another and another which suddenly changed into a sum in long division brownlooking packages lay about the feet of the clotheshorse and on them pete fastened his eyes for printing presses cannot hang his name was called several times and he received the very things he did not want sleeve buttons scarfpins cologne and paper he says thank you each time more faintly whilst his mothers eyes twinkle at last santa claus tried to lift a big bundle he puffed and panted and called pete to help him pete comes slowly forward bends down to help felt something cold and hard beneath the wrapper fumbled over it clasped it round excitedly tried to lift it whispered awestruck it is it is a selfinker bends further down lifted it up awkwardly and dropped it on his little slippered foot with a big bang and a painful oh the scene was too funny for sympathy and the general laugh increased the ache in the righthand corner of the big toe on the left foot pete limped out of the room and was soon forgotten in the universal excitement but when all were busy with their ice cream he crept back to his beloved bundle unwrapped it and lying flat down on his stomach hugged himself to it and gazed at it again it was growing late he knew that as soon as the guests were gone he must do his share in putting things to rights restoring furniture to its place and worse than all in smoothing out the wrapping paper and tying it up in little bundles and in unravelling all the knotted strings for his mother was accustomed to take off the edge of too great christmas enjoyment by enforcement of this economical rule that night he dreamed of franklin of editors of type setting and of sensible mothers who knew what fellows want the next morning he woke with a sense of much to do and soon began his future career by sorting the type this was a long job for he had several kinds capitals and small letters heavy face and light face type besides commas hyphens and periods and somehow everything was mixed up now and then he stopped to admire his new gift and his own energy or to call some one to help him at last his task was done pete was a methodical boy and always finished one job before he began another now said he what shall i do first set the type or ink the tablet ill ink the tablet and then print my name it is so short he began the inking process just as dick announced himself by his warwhoop and called out at it are you got any orders shel has a big job whole lots of placards from his father flaming ones to print takes all kinds of type makes money on it so busy he cant speak to a fellow so i came along here for im one of the kind dont believe in orders for boys learn by looking on is my way have all of the fun and none of the ink guess ill say seeing how your hands are that isnt the way your mother will have something to say to that you keep still and let me alone answered pete ill come out all right i am going to set the type for pete downs centreville illinois u s and he carefully began to insert the letters on the left hand of the chase he placed the chase in the body of the press put some paper on the pressure and began to work the handle up and down till the type was well inked he next marked out the size of his card on the pressure inserted his gauge pins placed his card upon them took hold of the handle and pushed it up and down thus bringing the card on the pressure against the inked type he pushed with all his might and lifted up his work with a conquerors air dick who had been maliciously watching burst into peals of laughter the name read thus petedown ne s youve forgotten the quads said dick and you havent enough ink you must put on spectacles to read it thats nothing replied pete growing red as he began to separate the words and rub more ink on the tablet again he pressed down the handle lifted it up and gazed again this time the name ran petedow ce rville ill the rest was so smutchy that not a letter was legible better go into partnership said dick you are not smart enough for an apprentice but on account of your capital you might be worth something as a partner pete cleaned the tablet with half the turpentine and benzine in the bottle and began afresh this time came out in watery lines pete downs centreville illinois u s why whats the matter now forgotten enough leads and a capital replied dick what is the use in trying alone go in with some boy who knows and youll get on perhaps but ill clear up first his mother had provided him with overalls for just such occasions but pete was confident that printing was neater work than carpentering and had avoided thinking of them the ink was so imbedded in one corner of the tablet and so scanty in another that he tried to even the amount and then wash off the whole soon his fingertips were coal black and sticky to remove this difficulty he put finger by finger into the turpentine rendering that muddy and spreading five distinct streaks on the back of his right hand then he poured benzine into the left hand to rub on the back of the right hand this operation sent ink and benzine up his coatsleeve and all ten fingers became so useless that in order to use them more freely he rubbed off their contents on his jacket seeing what he had done his increasing fears brought tears to check which he stuck his fingers into his eyes which hurting sent more tears mingling with ink down his cheeks just at the moment that his mother appeared and that dicks instinct led him to disappear out of the window or door he never knew which my son for shame said she how could you forget the overalls oh i dont know wish i hadnt i am going to take a partner and then it wont happen again he cried and was so funnylooking that there was nothing for his mother to do but to laugh and advise speedy partnership what boy would you have asked he dick has been here tormenting me i dont want him i might try shel it need not be for life you know he had a press last year and has got used to it very well answered his mother i expected as much change your suit go ask him and tell him i approve because his mother makes him wear overalls pete had not anticipated such a speedy ending of his troubles and hastened away to do his mothers bidding but whilst dressing he reflected that shel knew too much and would snub him and that clarence was the kind of boy who could get jobs easily so he went to clarences and proposed partnership what terms demanded clarence in a businesslike manner hands in his pockets im pretty particular about the contract are you a greenhorn thats got to be taken into account well yes suppose i am now but i need not be long if you keep your bargain besides my press is new and that counts for me well yes it does selfinker lots of type well not so very much selfinker though or come you just go in and try it for a month and well make terms afterwards pretty dangerous plan but ill try it seeing it is a new press ill come to your house right after dinner and we have dinner right after breakfast so the kitchen work can be all done up one gets hungry between dinner and supper and its always a cold supper so it neednt be any work agreed said pete i know those tricks on meals too the boys parted till halfpast twelve when clarence appeared and set to work in a vigorous manner to properly clean and ink the tablet pete with overalls on watched every motion his name was printed and came out clear beautiful pete downs centreville illinois u s quads leads capitals spelling all right pete felt as if he had done it himself now you try said clarence and success again came in a dozen cards then his name became an old story ill go and ask the cook declared pete if she dont want her name printed and off he ran certainly was her obliging answer she added slowly only i havent a name good enough to print you call me hannah but if you put that on a card it looks common and if you say ora no one will know it is me and if you only put my last name theyll think the whole family has called you better take the nurses name mehitable jones you cant get round that hardly waiting till she had finished pete went to mehitable who kindly consented to believe that she needed a dozen cards and to write down her name that it might be printed correctly this looked like business the cards were quickly printed and delivered and the package was marked on the wrapper c o d that is not my name exclaimed mehitable of course that isnt your name explained the boys cards are inside that means you must pay us right off just what you please we didnt say anything about it first because we trusted you but we cant afford to work for nothing well said mehitable here is five cents petes first money earned by honest hard labor two and a half cents apiece thats an unfortunate price for us said clarence though it be convenient for the buyer lets keep all uneven sums as capital towards other type and all even sums well divide this was rather a shock at first to pete but with a partner who was such a superior business man he would not dispute the first great trouble stated clarence is to get orders the second to execute them you be the travelling agent and ill be the office man now said pete i wont i want to print as well as you ill be travelling agent in your family and you in mine and then well get more out of each thats an idea replied clarence and the partnership which to judge by the angry looks of the past second seemed on the point of dissolution still remained unbroken that afternoons success was marked and afterwards when business called clarence away for if the truth must be told he was partner in two other firms on strict terms of secrecy pete did not prosper it was always too much or too little ink quads were not even and a sufficient number of leads were seldom inserted he often set the type the wrong way so that it printed backwards and worse than all he did not know how to spell and as he before had had occasion to accuse his mother of moral reasons for her gifts he now declared that she had only given him the press to teach him how to spell one day she particularly distressed both his memory and conscience by wishing him to print for the nursery the motto fidelity is a virtue and it came out fiddility is a virtu notwithstanding this the firm had made one dollar and in the course of the next two months pete had acquired enough skill to feel himself an expert a change had also come over clarence his spirit was too aspiring to be bound by rules of constant neatness and he grew jealous of petes increasing ability so he proposed a partnership on new terms namely that the cash on hand should be devoted to the purchase of some new fonts and that afterwards the earnings should be divided but that as he would always ink the tablet and as the workshop of the firm had been transferred to his shed he should have two thirds of the profits pete objected and insisted that until the business was on a better foundation all the profits should be turned in for the improvement of their stock in trade no said clarence i cant print all day and every day and not feel any cents in my pocket i want peanuts and candy and i want to give the boys a treat too now and then thats what i am going to print for after we have got these new fonts well you can do as you please i shant try such things i shall keep my money for type and cards we neednt quarrel yet till we have more money clarence did not feel easy pete had shown more energy patience and neatness than he thought was right under the circumstances though what the circumstances were he confessed to himself he did not know and he summed up the whole offence when he was speaking of the affairs of the concern to other boys by saying o petes getting too proud after the new type was bought the following order was received for twentyfive postal card notices the q f u will hold its tenth peripatetic occasion at degrees seconds north latitude degrees minutes seconds west longitude on the th instant this was a very important order requiring great care received from an older boy a member of a secret society most obscure it seemed to the firm clarence insisted on printing it in plain english and on setting up in type a walking match will take place etc etc pete thought they had no right to argue about the matter simply to do what was ordered i should not mind it so much if they would not have such long words and we shall have to buy special marks for degrees minutes and seconds charge extra on that but peripatetic i didnt agree to print such nonsense said clarence if we are going to do it i am going to be quick about it and set it all up except the marks and see how it looks he was in such a hurry that he set the type wrong three times at last peripatetic was right but no space was left for the right number of leads rejecting petes help he lifted a row of type to make room did not hold it tight enough the middle sank down fell out and the line went to pieces i say now he exclaimed i didnt do that you did it it did itself i never made a pie in all my life and see here i wont have it said that i made one now i have made them lots of times calmly said pete you o yes i dare say you have but i never did and thats why the other boys want me in their business what business i would not get so excited just because of this pie you would if your reputation depended on it why i wont tell but the other firms will have to know it our honor is pledged to tell whenever such a thing happens to any one of us are you in other business shel said you were when he wanted us to take him in and i said you were not thats the end of it if you are any ones else partner you cant be mine pie or no pie very well just as you please you can take shel you always put on too much ink and that wastes capital well then you put on too little ink and blurred work dont bring orders i am done with you and i with you i shall bring up my cart tomorrow and take my things away what are you going to do about those new fonts i would rather you would have them all than be partner with a boy who invests in bogus firms bogus or not i never mix accounts you can have the first half and i the second only as x and z dont count i ought to have two more letters in my half than you in yours i should call that mixing halves if you dont call it mixing accounts said pete who was so hurt by this unexpected closeness that he instantly went off to get his cart meeting shel on the way he retailed his wrongs and met with such hearty sympathy that he formed a copartnership with him on the spot shel advised him to wait till tomorrow before taking action and give clarence time to think over the matter and see if it would not be better for his pecuniary interests to remain a silent partner you know urged he that he has got a good deal of type and though he works too quickly to admit him as active partner he might do very well as a retired one and thus keep the peace then it is always a good plan to have three partners one of them or all together they somehow act as judge i must be off now and the boys separated that afternoon it rained and pete had to stay at home early the next day he drew his cart up the hill to clarences house with very forgiving feelings but found he had left word with the hired man that he had gone off and wasnt going to have any more to do with him of course honor and justice then compelled him to take what belonged to him especially as the man told him that clarence had expected him with his cart so pete sadly entered the shed looked at the forms thought everything was mixed up and did what he always did when longing to speak right out but afraid to do so he took hold of his lower lip with thumb and forefinger and twirled it back and forth turning it over and under clarences little sister appeared whilst he was thus engaged and seeing the sadness of his eyes and the perplexity of his mouth and fingers she ventured to say it is too bad and clarence said it was and that he did not mean to upset the type but that you got him so provoked he could not help it and that you could come and pick it out if you choose cause it was yours but he and she stopped frightened thats just what i shall do you tell him it is a mighty mean trick that i have left him fifteen letters you remember fifteen not thirteen said pete he had a hard time sorting the type part of it was smashed part of it very dirty his cart at last laden he sorrowfully bore home his press and its appendages only to spend still more time in cleaning and getting it to rights i must finish that order thought he for orders are business even if a firm is dissolved the remaining partner is bound to complete the work so he manfully invested some capital in the type for degrees minutes and seconds closed the contract and received extra pay for his neatness and quickness but he grew tired and longed for companionship so that when shel appeared he found pete quite dejected willing to listen to terms of partnership but utterly unwilling to have anything more to do with clarence very well said shel ill give him up if youll give up some one else and then well start even why i never thought of any one never mind was the reply make believe you did just like politics each of us gives up his best man and takes an unknown third man we must agree on one who has a selfinker larger than this and lots of type i want to extend the business why cant we begin at once as jones downs co and when we find the right kind of boy let him be co agreed well get out handbills at once that evening the large trees on the road down to the village postoffice the doors of the grocery the dry goods the apothecary and provision stores even the depot itself bore large placards with the following announcement jones downs co job printers orders promptly executed many a tired man stopped his horse that night and through the next week to read those staring notices the schoolboys made fun of the new concern wondered how long it would last and tried to rouse distrust of each other in the minds of the two partners who saw that if they could only obtain orders they could boast that they understood the tricks of the trade and knew the use of advertisements and so it proved for the city musicteacher coming to the village was so amused by these white patches on the trees that she sought their shop and gave them an order to print her bill and when the young townspeople received instead of a written bill one printed in due form by those at whom they had laughed they became strangely silent soon came an order for some tags for a large family with an endless amount of baggage all to be marked alike as easier to read an actual stranger sent an order for work the village calling increased so fast that it was difficult to meet the demands for visiting cards at last came an order from a church fair for handbills but of too large a size for their press they had often reflected upon the co but had delayed action which now became imperative and necessitated partnership with the boy who would have the biggest press and this was dick he was interviewed but proved refractory on a point of honor for said he no one will know i am co and if you are such a great firm i want the public honor of belonging to you what was to be done the fair could not be delayed until matters were settled nor could the boys give up their job as being beyond their power ill tell you my terms said dick finally ill put my press and all its fixings into the concern if youll let me have two thirds of the profits on this job and on all the rest of the work you do this week i am hard up and i know you have got orders ahead these were hard terms but on the other hand as dick could command custom and was a good clean printer they acceded to his conditions and printed the bills in startling type using one or two kinds in the same word so as to make through the eye a vivid impression of the meaning of the fair from this time they had so much work to do in bill heads tickets envelopes etc that they led a calm life of unbroken industry laying aside one quarter of their earnings each week as a fund for future stock and dividing the other three quarters equally between them aunt elizabeths fence the little village of h is a sort of doubleheader having a centre at each end so to speak the end nearest the railroad is known as the three corners on account of a certain arrangement of the roads meeting at that point while the farther assemblage of houses bears a similar appellation the four corners for a similar reason the two parts of the town are in reality two distinct villages although existing as one corporate body and are banded together like the siamese twins by a road leading directly from the heart of one to that of the other on each side of this rural street at neighborly distances stand pretty white cottages a story and a half high nestling behind white fences under shading maples midway between the two centres these dwellings stand further apart and are more evidently farmhouses and just beyond a peaceful green meadow ones attention is suddenly arrested by a queer house an architectural oddity having an insignificant main part and numerous additions of different heights jutting forth in every direction without any seeming plan but looking as if they might have crept together some cold winters day for mutual warmth or as if the middle house was a bantam trying to shield an overgrown brood a solitary tower having the effect of a chicken on the mother hens back it was in one of the rooms of this odd residence that our young hero jem french was born his father like his house is decidedly odd mr joseph french was a man of ideas not a farmer as you might suppose from his living in such a locality but a jackatalltrades and in spite of the proverb good at all therein lays the secret of his queershaped house one of the little extensions is a tin shop where he mends the pots and pans of the neighborhood or creates any new vessels desired another projection is devoted to carpenter work and in a third addition he makes boots and shoes for his own family and cobbles for others in the room above with the big glass window the rustic beaux and belles sit like statuary while he preserves their pictures in ambrotypes each part of the building seems to be devoted to some specialty but in one part the door is always found to be locked and the window carefully curtained and even the children are forbidden to enter in this room mr french still spends hours and hours sometimes days and weeks inventing nobody knows what as yet jem early bid fair to become another such man as his father though evidently that would not be to his pecuniary benefit for the entire surplus earnings of his parent had thus far been spent in obtaining materials for further experimenting still jem inherited the inventive talent he was envied and admired by schoolfellows and playmates not even the richest among them could boast of owning such unique toys as jem was constantly making the little stream that ran through the meadow was spanned by miniature bridges of which he was sole architect his sailing craft of all kinds and fully rigged swam in the placid water dams were placed here and there and sluiceways conducted the water to its work of turning sundry overshot wheels which in their turn operated little pumps or moved the machinery of a mill he made his sisters various mechanical figures which moved to the swinging of a pendulum cardboard images were made to saw wood fiddle or dance for hours together the motive power being obtained from sand running through an inverted cone as for carving he had ornamented the walls of the house with a profusion of brackets wallpockets and the like taking his designs of birds or flowers from natures own pattern he was in fact a veritable young yankee with his jackknife and few were the things he could not fashion with it and few the principles of physics studied at school which he did not seek to embody or illustrate and he had advanced beyond the range of studies in a country school when he was withdrawn by his father to assist in doing the chores then having little society except his own thoughts he gradually became discontented one day the mailwagon stopped at his fathers gate a letter for mr french said the carrier even such a commonplace occurrence had an interest for the listless jem and he ran to pick it up it didnt come very far i guess for here is the village postmark said he to his mother who came to the door and extended her hand for the epistle its from aunt elizabeth said she looking at the superscription jem puckered his lips to a whistle for aunt elizabeth was not on good terms with her brother and had little intercourse with the family what news could his aunt have to impart thus to break her usual silence the more he thought about it the stronger grew his curiosity nevertheless it remained ungratified until his father made his appearance at the suppertable and broke the seal if chirography gives any clew to the character of a writer the person who penned that letter was certainly plain hard and angular while the composition of the epistle indicated the author was in the habit of bluntly freeing her mind she began by telling her brother he was shiftless progressed by referring to the great number of mouths he had to fill and ended by offering to take the care of one of the children off his hands and requesting jem should be sent to her house at the four corners o father do let me go said jem write to your aunt and tell her to expect you next thursday said he at last the time that intervened seemed to drag slowly to jem but the supreme moment finally came and he stood at the gate with his best suit on be a good boy and try to be useful to your aunt elizabeth were his mothers parting words goodby goodby merrily shouted jem and waving a farewell salute with his handkerchief he started away with a quick elastic step that would soon bring him to his destination only two miles away miss elizabeth french lived at the old homestead she was a maiden lady and had lived alone ever since the death of her father once a year she made a bargain with the man who tilled the farm on shares and occasionally asked him a few questions relative to the crops further than that she had little to do with the outside world one consequence was that her house and its surroundings showed the urgent need of a caring hand stones were missing from the chimney and shingles from the roof the frame was out of repair and there were only traces left of former coats of paint of the picket fence which had once bounded her possessions in front not even a post remained years before the slats had begun to decay until the dilapidation became an eyesore to even miss elizabeth herself but when the cowboys in search of their charges that always pastured along the sides of the road rattled their sticks over its surface it became a nuisance she could no longer stand so one morning after having been awakened unusually early by her noisy tormentors she had every vestige removed and the postholes filled leaving the yard as open and unprotected as the street itself it may have been the need of some one to help her put her outside world to rights and her knowledge of jems peculiar talents that inspired the unexpected invitation however that might be she stood at the window watching as jem redfaced and dusty from his walk came up the path so yeve come hev ye said she as she let him in and relieved him of his satchel ye look kind o tuckered out spose the folks must all be well or ye wouldnt hev come yer father aint doin nothin yet i take it cept shettin himself up same as ever and leavin his family to shift for themselves hungry too aint ye that minds me but first she took him to a little room he was to occupy that he might bathe his hands and face the apartment was neat and cosey for however slack she may have been with the outside of her mansion miss french was a good housekeeper and by the time he had washed and looked over a little pile of books that lay upon the oldfashioned bureau his aunt was calling him down to dinner well jem said miss elizabeth as they sat facing each other at the little table it seems good to see somebody asittin here an eatin besides myself hope ye wont git lonesome no danger of that auntie if you only give me something to do was the cheerful response if thats all ye want the land knows theres enough to be done said his aunt with a laugh well then what first wal what bothers me most jest now are them cattle walkin round the yard twant only yisterday squire mullinses cow hed to eat up the top of my pennyroyal geranium and trod down my eardrops and ladyslippers and now they aint anything left but bachelorsbuttons thats worth looking at ye might set somethin alongside of the road jest enough to keep out the critters dont spose ye could build a fence could ye well aunty said jem i never did build one but i think i could what shall it be made of thats a question i burned up all there was left of the old fence for kindlin wood you might find somethin out in the old workshop nex to the barn father always use to be tinkerin around an theres lots of rubbish up under the roof what kind of a fence would you like oh anything anything to keep out the critters ef ye could think of anything to git the best o them cowboys twould suit pretty well them boys are gettin to be a reglar nuisance they go long drawin of their sticks on peoples fences jist as if there was solid comfort in that eternal rattle rattle rattle what makes boys think they cant never enjoy themselves unless theyre amakin a noise but ive had the best of them for two or three years they had to stop in front of my place but now the cows is gittin to be wus than the racket an ef ye could think of any way to kill two birds with one stun jest do it ill leave you to plan it your own way ye might look round this arternoon an see what there is to do with so when dinner was over jem began to look round in the old workshop were some sticks of timber that might serve for posts but there were few boards and not half enough for pickets knowing that his aunt would be indisposed to lay out any money he looked very thoroughly through sheds and barn in the latter place he moved a pile of rubbish in hopes of finding something beneath the heap consisted mostly of halfinch iron rods of various sizes and he was about to go elsewhere when he stumbled against a short piece and set it rolling to the middle of the floor picking it up he threw it back into the corner where it clanged with a noise that sent a hen cackling from her nest in a remote part of the mow perhaps i could use these rods mused he but then the boys could make more noise than ever and that would hardly do just then his face seemed to be illuminated by an inspiration his eyes twinkled with fun but his reflections were interrupted by a call to supper tea time was occupied in the discussion of family matters and his aunt related bits of private history that kept his attention well occupied until eight oclock at which time miss elizabeth usually retired for the night jem was tired too and was soon upstairs and fast asleep it seemed hardly anytime at all ere jem was in the barn again ready to begin work on the fence he had now a clear idea regarding it and smiling often he worked with a will first he sorted the pieces of rod into piles according to length if took some little time to accomplish this part of his task then humming to himself as he worked he would both listening and humming as he did it strike each piece with a stick to determine its suitability if so it was placed on some one of eight piles which he had labelled with brown paper as a b and so on if not it was thrown back to the corner the next thing he did was to set two posts at each end of the proposed line with fifteen others at regular intervals between across the tops he secured his principal rail with another to correspond a few inches from the ground boring holes through these cross rails he inserted one of the iron bars letting it project six inches at the top and resting the bottom on a stake driven into the ground directly beneath it the next bar was shorter than the first and a longer stake had to be driven in order that the top should be on a level with the first as he went on the rods were inserted without any seeming regularity of spacing passersby stopped to gaze at the singular construction and made various comments concerning it illustration the neighbors looked on in bewilderment thats a kinder queer pattern for a fence aint it queried a lad who came along heres a mistake anyhow said he pointing to a space between the fourteenth and fifteenth bars which was twice as great as any interval before left one out here or be ye going to leave this cat hole for dogs to git through thats to make boys ask questions was the only reply vouchsafed one old farmer advised him to put all the bars of one length together yell find it a good deal easier jem thanked him respectfully for the advice but neglected to follow it his aunt also came to the front door occasionally to watch his progress but shook her head as if doubtful of either the ornament or utility of his work but jem went on steadily with the undertaking until he reached the end of his line having just enough bars to finish as it happened or perhaps as he had planned at the bottom he then boarded the fence to cover the stakes and the irregularity of the iron bars and then he announced the completion of the work to his aunt taint jest sech a fence as i had been thinking of but i spose itll answer only it wont be twentyfour hours before them everlastin boys ll be drawin of their sticks on it but jest let me ketch em at it an ill ill in fact his aunt seemed more troubled than pleased with her new fence but jem only smiled at her apprehensions our young fencebuilder was up before the sun next morning and downstairs peeping through the front blinds at length he hears the sound of tramping hoofs and a cow comes lazily down the road cropping a mouthful of grass here and there on a distant fence he hears the old familiar rattling will it be kept up when the new fence is reached ah there is the cowboy he is stopping to examine the new construction now he is satisfied swings the butt end of his whip against the first rod and starts along jem listens eagerly a sound fills the air as of some one playing a gigantic harp the cowboy stops in amazement at the effect he has produced recovering from his astonishment he goes a little further and again comes the sound of a tune which seems to grow familiar to the dazed performer finally he starts off on a run to the very end of the fence when the tune is finished at this point jem is conscious of the presence of his aunt craning her neck through the window for a look wheres the music aplayin said she jem laughing pointed to the boy who had gone back to the starting point and was about to repeat the performance here you young rascal screamed miss elizabeth but the lad had started the tune again and was not to be deterred by threats and miss elizabeth stared surprised and speechless as the note vibrated with great resonance as the air was finished the second time the boy acted as if suddenly made crazy he shouted he threw his cap in the air and himself on the ground screaming and laughing as he rolled over and over on the grass suddenly he scrambled to his feet and ran towards home leaving the cow to take care of herself mercy said miss elizabeth ef that dont beat anythin i ever heard on a fence thatll play a tune a yankee doodle fence what ever got into your head to git up such a thing as that youre your fathers own son by this time the cowboy had returned with half a dozen companions all as excited as himself miss french was now as eager for the boys to draw their sticks on her fence as she had been unwilling before the patriotic tune rung out again and again the neighbors came to the scene and looked on in bewilderment i knew that chap was up to sunthin jem could hear the farmer say who had proffered the advice on the day previous hes old joe frenchs boy you know you might aknown then he was smarter n lightnin said another guess ill get him to build me a musical fence remarked a third only ill hav home sweet home cuz thats samanthys favorite tune he might fence in the meetinhouse with old hundred suggested deacon mullen but the novelty soon wore away and miss french began to tire of the ceaseless repetition besides the boys were too impatient to have their turns in playing to allow their predecessors to finish ere they commenced to cap the climax one boy having concluded turned about and ran the other way playing the tune backwards to the great disgust of both the builder and proprietoress miss elizabeth rushed out see here cried she i guess youve played that fence long enough for one morning now youd better go home go home i say but the boys were not to be deprived of such an amusement and they hammered away furiously wherever they could get a chance unable to make any impression upon them miss elizabeth turned fiercely upon poor jem and said in a voice that admitted no compromise take it down i cant abide it no longer its wus than the cows and with that she seized one of the bars while jem alarmed for his marvellous fence gave a great leap and sprang out of bed broad awake the button boy the wind blew as it never had blown before i think it blew that boy straight through the gate up the path through the door and into the back parlor where the family sat he stopped there gave a little puff of spent breath and sat down he had a box under his arm it was flat and wide a pasteboard box and when he put it down all the family dropped their books and looked at it attentively they were a very literary family and read so much that it was a great compliment to any box to have them put down their books when they had once taken them up you havent opened it yet asked the mother no said the boy scornfully all the family had long ago agreed he had a high caste of countenance which this manner suited remarkably well but he was not in the least conscious of it himself no whats the hurry plenty of time to look in it when i get home its a suit a suit of clothes calmly said the sister picking up her book again every one stared at the sister who could see through a pasteboard box somebody has made a hole in the bottom of the box and i see a button a brass button she explained true there was a hole in the bottom of the box he said if i put the contents of this box to their proper use said the boy every day as long as they would bear it i would not only learn something but i should be his heir so i might as well open the lid and see what is inside i thought books for uncle knows i always put books to their proper use of course said the father it is books no doubt but said the sister turning a page and reading all the time nobody puts brass buttons on books i think you might as well open the box said the mother i think we are all curious curious exclaimed the family indignantly curiously affected by your uncles making such a strange and trifling condition after our boys visit to him went on the mother but he is certainly very odd i should really like to know why dont take time to untie the knot said the father heres my knife said the elder brother the boy cut the string the sharpeyed sister looked over the top of her book the father put on his glasses and the lid was lifted yes it was a suit a blue cloth suit quite bright in color but of very fine material and good make it consisted of a pair of knickerbockers and a tight jacket and it was most extraordinary how the tailor had ever been able to put on so many buttons the jacket was doublebreasted and there were three rows down the front a dozen in each the size of a copper penny there were some fancy slits in the back buttons to the number of nine ornamented these there were four on each sleeve there were three on each pocket of the breeches and four again appeared on the outside above the knee on each leg for a moment the family was silent the buttons must have cost a great deal said the mother finally i should really like to know the price a dozen you couldnt have made a hole anywhere in that box without striking a button said the sharpeyed sister she gave one a little knock adding perhaps they are gold i think said the father taking off his glasses and wiping them i think i would have a few removed i have never observed anything like this in my uncles own dress remarked the elder brother he certainly has peculiar taste in boys clothing i think ill drop in on him and ask him a few leading questions as to his object you will have to drop after a special journey of twentyfive miles by rail said the sharpeyed sister and he wont appreciate your thirst for knowledge during this time the boy had said nothing but the scornful caste had entirely vanished from his countenance for he had discovered a note in one of the pockets and had been reading it the family now saw this and although they were not in the least hurry to hear its contents they ceased their remarks at once to kindly give him a chance to tell them what he read it was this the suit was to be worn upon all occasions until it should be outgrown or worn out no risk of damage was ever to be run with it no allusion of any sort was ever to be made to it by the boy or the family and no alterations of any description to be made in it unless to sew on a button when it should happen to come off wear that burst out the boy scornfully does he think me an idiot why id be the laughingstock of the town i should think he saw enough of me to know i have at least as much intelligence as most boys of my age very much more said the mother i never saw such cloth said the sharpeyed sister it will never wear out and you are not growing very fast either i would not like to wear it myself i dont even know as i would like to be in its society observed the elder brother but neither would i like to lose fifty thousand dollars well now said the mother with her mild smile there arent so very many there arent seven dozen quite they must be hollow for the suit isnt so heavy they are said the sister ive been sounding them put on the thing and wear it dont be so silly as to throw away all that money you cant wear it more than two years two years said the boy turning red people will get accustomed to you by that time urged the father it is very extraordinary said all the family with a wondering air and then they all fell to reading for a halfhour with their books upside down the boy decided to wear the suit and follow the conditions and wrote so to his uncle his first appearance in the street in his new attire was greeted by a lady who stopped short and exclaimed good gracious what singular parents that child must have and he actually looks proud of his dress too its my caste of countenance thought the boy but as he was quite unaccustomed to have it connected with his dress and disgusted beside that he should be thought vulgar he tried to alter the caste though he turned very red when people looked at him for some time it went on this same way he caught glances and overheard remarks such as he had once applied to other people but which he never dreamed could enter peoples minds in regard to him even his own family did not spare him a dozen times he was on the point of casting off the glittering suit and renouncing the money it represented but just as many times he thought he would try it yet another day but to do this he learned he must be quiet and prefer the background and silence to the attention he was once so eager to receive one day he sat in the sunlight with a book trying to read and wishing very much to run outdoors and play with the rest of the boys but kept back by an uncomfortable recollection of a great deal of badgering the sharpeyed sister was reading in the same room too and every once in a while she would blink and wink and frown and look about finally she looked straight at him you tiresome object she cried do get out of the sun i wondered what it was dazzling my eyes like the reflection of seven dozen looking glasses and there it is your odious buttons the boy got out of the sun without a reply feeling a little restless he moved now and then dear me said the mother starting from her nap with a jerk you do jingle so after this the boy concluded to go out when his playfellows saw him they all set up a shout but he said to himself if i dont think about myself perhaps they wont think of me either and he met them running with an answering shout he had never worked so hard at forgetting himself before and it answered so well that in the ardor of play by and by he forgot the buttons too they began a game of leapfrog and whether the fault of the back given him or whether his own fault the boy missed twice jumping and hurt his temper he began to dispute about it with the back and presently they grew personal look here cried the boy angrily it was your fault i say if i were in fault dont you suppose id own it no said the back shortly the boy smiled scornfully cause you dont understand such a thing as owning up when youre in the wrong eh you act so but all fellows arent made on your pattern id have you know nor all clothes on yours buttons id have you know said the back coolly the boy glared at him and began to stutter you let my clothes alone dye hear well said the back you say i dont know how to give a back i say if i was buttoned up like you are i wouldnt know how to take one i put it to vote all in favor please say aye contrary no aye shouted the boys ayes have it said the back now you know everybody knows you within ten miles by the name of the button boy and i wouldnt seek any more notoriety if i was you id be content to come in second best on leapfrog and say no more about it illustration the boy glared at him you let my clothes alone said he all the boys began to hoot and laugh none of them sympathized with him in his moments of superiority and his scornful air failed to impress them as of old the button boy choked by anger and mortification could not reply but after a moment all right for you ill be even with you he said with a nod to the chief laugher and went away it was some time before he had his chance and during that time things went from bad to worse with his conspicuous dress forcing him to be unostentatious exact for his goings and comings could be seen for a mile even retiring he found now that he began to think of some acts and some speeches of his in the time when he was not a button boy with as much mortification as the buttons often gave him and he often checked himself when halfway into some piece of conceited folly yet he never forgot that he owed the back one nor that it was he who had given him the worst smart of this miserable period at last an event occurred in the family the uncle arrived unexpectedly and stated his intention of spending the night that is he said if you will give me something better for my supper than a lot of quotations and rules of grammar i cant eat them you know the family thought this a very odd speech and a very grumpy old gentleman but they didnt tell him so he put on his spectacles and looked at the button boy very attentively but the boy didnt mind he was too conscious of fulfilling faithfully for six months his part of the contract and beside he stood before the designer of the buttons but when he took the glasses off and said well you must be pretty fond of money i dont think double the sum could hire me to make such a show of myself the boy minded it exceedingly he sat down for half an hour and considered whether he wasnt doing a sort of mean thing after all and he became exceedingly miserable in the conclusion that he was not at all the noble pattern of a boy he used to think he was in the morning the uncle declared his intention of taking a walk and invited his nephew to go with him very sure that the peculiar disposition of the old gentleman was capable of bringing him into plenty of unpleasant situations before they reached home again the boy found himself almost indifferent to them a feeling had been growing on him that anything short of meanness or wrongdoing was not worth being mortified about he felt calm even at a public exhibition of the buttons he was so disturbed by the discovery of the unworthy motive which had supported him in making a show of himself but the uncle made himself such delightful company on their walk they left the town that at last he forgot himself forgot himself until they saw before them a boy running he knew him it was the back he stumbled pitched fell picked himself up slowly limped painfully to the roadside and sat down there holding on to his ankle the boy and the uncle soon came up humph sprained your ankle said the uncle i think so replied the back looking very white the uncle took out his handkerchief tore it in two and dipping it in the cold waters of the brook tied it tightly about his limb thank you sir said the back almost groaning i guess i cant walk just yet ill stay here till something comes along to take me in the trouble is the trouble is i ought to be going on i ought not to lose a moment humph said the uncle you might better have thought of that before you fell what time is it if you please asked the back anxiously twenty minutes of eleven replied the uncle oh dear sighed the back only hard running would do it now i left my sketch at home this morning i took up another by mistake it is to try for the prize sketch and the master said if i would get it into the studio by eleven he would accept it but he couldnt later because the rule is any coming after that hour cant compete ive worked so hard at it and i thought i had a good chance oh dear let me see considered the uncle turning to the boy you stopped with yours this morning and we saw a number there yours was undoubtedly very good now open your portfolio and let me see yours he added to the back the back hesitated glanced at the button boy then yielded humph observed the uncle and put on his glasses well i declare whom have we here the arrogant page eh well i declare look at this nephew here you are with your buttons and your most scornful expression disdaining to pick up the little princes hat where did you learn to draw like this you rascal i had plenty of chances with the model said the back slyly then he sighed if i had got the prize i would have been sent to the academy i cant go without and im sure it is very original tie up your portfolio quick said the button boy his face was working his eyes shone they outshone his buttons seven dozen times what are you going to do you foolish fellow cried the uncle run with it it will take the prize from under your very nose and make a show of you too will you trust me asked the button boy of the back not minding his uncle you know ive often said i owed you one but i dont mean it o buttons cried the back will you will you really do it there uncle cried the button boy stripping off his jacket i cant run in that tight thing and if you choose to count this you may i give up the money sir in vain the uncle shouted after him you young rascal ill be done with you what an exhibition youll make now away he ran fleet as a deer then the uncle clapped his hands vociferously burst out with i knew there was something in that lad chuckled till he was purple in the face and finally sat down by the back and blew his nose very hard look here said the uncle to the button boy that evening i had a purpose in putting you in this livery you may guess if you like what it was and i think it hasnt been a failure now if you will go home with me for the rest of the year we will hold to the contract and suspend the buttons really said the mother with her mild smile already brother i dont recognize my boy and i should like to ask you i am very much afraid interrupted the father busily you will let his mind vegetate he is certainly not as thoroughly intellectual as before he wore those buttons i should like to ask you my dear uncle broke in the sharpeyed sister if you will please invent some kind of headgear for the brains as good as this for the heart i yes said the elder brother hastily i should like to ask you but the uncle was seized with such a severe sneezing fit that no one could ask him after all dan hardys crippy among the flock of geese that toddled in and out of farmer hardys barnyard last winter hissing in protest at the ice which covered the pond so that there was no chance of a swimming match was one remarkable neither for its beauty nor its grace this particular goose was gray and was looked upon with no especial favor by mrs hardy who had great pride in all the flock but the gray one when it was a little fluffy drabcolored gosling one of the sheep had stepped on it crushing out its life so nearly that mrs hardy had no idea it would ever recover but dan begged for its life he felt sure he could set the broken leg and he pleaded so hard that his mother finally allowed him to make the attempt and he did succeed the gosling was naturally a strong little thing and thanks to dans nursing was soon able to limp around the shed that had been converted into an hospital one of its legs was nearly a quarter of an inch shorter than the other but the little fellow increased in strength as rapidly as he did in size and seemed to consider dan as his owner and especial protector like marys lamb it followed dan about whenever the opportunity offered until crippy which was the name dan had given it was known in the village quite as well as the boy was many were the long walks confidential chats when the boy talked and the goose cackled that dan and crippy had and when the preparations for the thanksgiving festival were begun the gray goose was decidedly the fattest in the flock dan had always given crippy a share of his luncheon or had supplied for him a separate and private allowance of corn and by this very care of his pet did he get into serious trouble dans goose is the largest and the fattest and i think we had better kill him for the thanksgiving dinner dan heard his father say three days before thanksgiving and mrs hardy replied i had thought of that gray feathers never bring as much money as white ones and the goose is terribly in the way he is always in the house and always directly under foot dan could hardly believe his own ears the thought of killing and eating crippy seemed wicked why he would as soon have thought his parents would serve him up for dinner as crippy and as for eating any of his pet it would to his mind be little short of cannabalism you wouldnt be so wicked as to kill crippy would you mother he asked while the big tears came into his eyes almost spilling over the lashes why not mrs hardy was so busily engaged in her work of making mince pies that she did not notice the sorrow on dans face why not hes only a goose and gray weve got to have one and crip is the fattest but mother i couldnt have poor crippy killed he an i do love each other so much now dont be foolish about a goose danny come help me stem these raisins dan said nothing more for he knew by the way she had spoken that his mother had fully made up her mind and that it would be useless to try to induce her to change her cruel plans he stemmed the raisins as she had requested but he worked as quickly as possible and when the task was done he ran out to the barn when the gray goose toddled toward him immediately he opened the barndoor cackling and hissing with delight at seeing his young master the tears which dan had managed to keep back came at last and with the goose in his arms he seated himself on the barn floor with a feeling in his heart that he and crippy were the two most unhappy and abused fellows in the world o crippy they say theyre goin to kill you an id a heap sooner theyd kill me what shall we do crippy the goose made no reply he was perfectly content to nestle down in dans arms and so far as he could see he and his master were in remarkably comfortable quarters much as the goose had been petted by dan the affection bestowed upon him just then seemed to surprise him and while the boy was still crying over him he struggled until he got away when he limped over to the cornbin as a gentle reminder that grain would please him far better than tears during that day and the next dan spent his time alternately begging for crippys life and petting him but all to no purpose so far as inducing his mother to change her mind was concerned on the following morning the gray goose was to be killed and dan could see no way to save him that afternoon he spent the greater portion of his time with the doomed crippy crying and talking until all the fowls must have wondered what the matter was for there being no almanac in the barn of course they could have no idea thanksgiving was so near suddenly dan thought of a plan by which crippy might be saved it was a desperate one and almost frightened him as he thought it over but with his pets life in the balance he could not hesitate at anything ill tell you what well do crippy he said as he succeeded in making the goose remain quietly in his arms by feeding him with corn uncle robert lives in new york an hes awful good i know if we could find him he could save you now ill get up in the night an come out here for you its only seven miles an im most sure we could walk there in a day then if he wont come out here to see mother thanksgiving will be gone an they cant have you for dinner crippy swallowed the corn greedily and dan looked upon this as a sign that he not only understood what had been said but was eating an unusually hearty meal by way of preparation for the journey under any less desperate circumstances dan could not have been persuaded to go away from home for an hour without asking his mothers permission and even as he was situated then he felt that he was about to do something which was almost wicked but since he could save crippys life in no other way what could he do he almost felt as if by taking the goose away he was preventing his parents from committing a crime for it could hardly be less than one to kill so intelligent and loving a creature but though he tried to persuade himself that what he was doing was under the circumstances a favor to his parents there was a big lump in his throat as he did his work that night and realized that in a few hours neither his father nor his mother would know where he was he was more than usually careful about the kindlingwood and the water and when his mother spoke to him so kindly he had the greatest difficulty in keeping his secret it was only the thought that he was by no means running away that prevented him from telling his mother what he intended to do he argued with himself that he was only going to uncle roberts on business and that he should return the day after he arrived there that would be entirely different from running away during the evening dan worked hard at a message which he was to leave for his parents feeling obliged to take every precaution lest they should see what he was about and after the most painful efforts he succeeded in printing this note crip me have gorne to unkle roberts to get him to come up here to koax you not to kill crip we will come right back daniel k hardy dan had six cents which he had earned carrying milk and his preparations for the journey consisted simply in putting these in his pocket together with some corn for crippy and in placing the little clock and some matches by the side of his bed so that he might be able to tell when the proper time had come for him to start perhaps mr and mrs hardy were surprised by dans unusually affectionate manner when he bade them goodnight but if they were nothing was said about it and the inmates of the hardy farmhouse retired on the night before the proposed execution of poor crippy at the usual early hour of nine oclock dans idea was to lie awake until three in the morning then steal cautiously out of the house get crippy and start but it was much harder work to remain awake than he had fancied and before he had been in bed an hour he was sleeping soundly but even though his eyes persisted in closing despite his will dan did not sleep very long at a time he was awake at least every halfhour and his small stock of matches was exhausted as early as two oclock with no means of procuring a light it would be impossible for him to know when the time had come and since he did not dare to go to sleep again he concluded it would be better to set out at once than run the risk of delaying until his father should awaken during the time he was making very awkward attempts to dress himself in the darkness his fingers trembling violently both from fear and the cold he fancied each moment that he could hear his parents moving around as if they had suspected his purpose and were on the alert to prevent him from carrying it into execution it seemed too as if each particular board in the floor creaked in protest at what he was doing and to give the alarm the note which was to inform his parents of where he had gone was placed conspicuously on the chair by the bed where his mother could not fail to see it when she came to awaken him and when that was done his journey seemed more like some demand of business and less like disobedience to what he knew his parents commands would be he did finally succeed in dressing himself although his jacket was buttoned in a very curious fashion and then with his shoes and mittens in his hands he started down stairs if the boards of the floor had tried to arouse his parents the stairs appeared bent on awakening the entire household although he did his best to put as little weight as possible upon them they creaked and screamed in a most alarming fashion it seemed strange to him that his parents could sleep while so much noise was being made but when he finally succeeded in closing the outside door behind him there had been no sign made to show that his departure was known dan was so nervous and excited that he hardly felt the frost when he stepped with stockinged feet upon the snow but instinct prompted him to put on his boots and mittens and it only remained to get crippy and start he almost expected that the goose would be waiting for him at the stable door when he opened it but since he knew he should find his pet in the warm box he had made for him he was not greatly disappointed at not seeing him ready for the journey besides he had come an hour before he told crippy he would be there which was sufficient reason why the goose was not ready and anxious to start after groping his way around the barn to the corner in which was crippys sleeping apartment dan was considerably surprised because the goose was so very careless both in regard to his safety and the possibility of arousing the household he cackled and hissed when dan took him from the box as if he preferred to be killed and served up for the thanksgiving dinner rather than go out of doors so early on a cold morning dan whispered that he knew it was hard to be obliged to start so early but that they must do so and the more he explained matters the harder the goose struggled until it seemed much as if the attempt to save crippys life would be a dismal failure im doin this sos you wont have to be killed crippy whispered dan as he held the goose tightly clasped in his arms an it does seems if you might help a feller instead of tryin to wake up father an mother perhaps crippy was weary with struggling dan thought he began to realize his position for he ceased all protests after his masters last appeal and with his head tucked under dans coat submitted quietly to the rescue if he had not repeated to himself so many times that he was not running away from home but simply going to uncle roberts to save poor crippys life dan would have felt that he was doing something wrong because of the warning cries uttered by everything around the stable door when he tried to close it softly shut with a spiteful clatter and even the snow gave forth a sharp crunching sound such as he had never heard before but he must keep on for to remain would be to see the plump brown body of poor crippy on the thanksgiving dinner table while to go on would be at the worst but a few hours discomfort with crips life as the reward once they were out of doors crippy behaved much as if he had suddenly realized how important it was for him to get away from the hardy farm and dan had no trouble with him while he was passing the house there seemed to be an unnatural stillness everywhere amid which the crunching of the dry snow sounded with a distinctness that almost frightened the boy who was simply going to his uncle roberts to spend a day or two but finally dan was on the main road where the snow was frozen so hard that his footsteps could not be heard as distinctly and where the two tracks worn smooth by the runners of the sleighs lay spread out before him looking like two satin ribbons on white broadcloth illustration on the way dan trudged slowly on his heart growing lighter as the moments went by and he knew he had actually gotten away without arousing any one but after he had walked some distance he began to realize how heavy crippy was he had thought he could carry his pet almost any length of time but at the very commencement of his journey his arms began to ache its no use crippy youll have to walk some of the way he said as he put the goose on the snow and then started off to show him he must follow now a moonlight promenade on the snow in the morning with the thermometer several degrees below zero was not at all to crips liking and he scolded most furiously in his goose dialect but he took good care to run after his master at the same time as mrs hardy had said crippy was very fat and when he toddled on at full speed he could only get along about half as fast as his master so that dans journey was made up with alternately trudging over the frozen road and waiting for his pet to overtake him and soon it was necessary to make a change even in this slow way of travelling for before crippy had been half an hour on the road he began to evince the most decided aversion to walking and it became necessary for dan to take him in his arms again on he walked carrying crippy the greater portion of the time and coaxing him along when it became absolutely necessary for him to give his aching arms a little relief until the sun came up over the hills and he could see the great city but a short distance ahead of him during all this time he had not stopped once to rest but now since he was so near his destination at such an early hour in the morning he sat down in the snow and began to arrange with the discontented crippy as to how they might best find uncle robert for dan had not the slightest idea of where his relative lived ill tell you what well do crip he said as he gave the goose a handful of corn contenting himself with half a biscuit he had taken from the suppertable the night previous well walk right along till we see uncle robert or some of the folks its the day before thanksgiving you know an some of em will be sure to be out buyin things crippy had finished eating the corn as his master ceased speaking and he looked up sideways into dans face much as if he doubted the success of their plan if carried out in that manner well if we dont find him that way well ask some of the boys an theyll be sure to know said dan replying as earnestly to crippys look as if his pet had spoken then the weary journey was resumed much to crippys displeasure even though he was carried comfortably in dans arms and it was not until the outskirts of the city were reached that the goose was requested to walk there the pavements were free from snow and crippy could move along much faster than on the icy road but yet his progress was far from satisfactory the great number of people all of whom regarded the boy and the goose curiously bewildered both the travellers more than once when dan was sure crippy was close at his heels on looking around he would see the goose standing on one foot near the curbstone looking sideways at the street much as if trying to decide whether he would continue to follow his master or toddle back home as fast as his legs of unequal length would carry him o come on crippy dan said in a tone that showed plainly how tired and discouraged he was we shant ever find uncle robert this way an if a strange dog comes along where will you be it seemed very much as if crippy had not realized that he might chance to meet a dog until dan spoke of it for then he ran hurriedly on as if he fully understood the danger that might come to him by loitering on the way but there were other enemies besides dogs which crippy was to meet with as he and dan learned when they reached the more densely populated portions of the city and those enemies were boys dan was walking slowly on looking first at the houses in the hope of seeing some of his uncles family and then at crippy to make sure he was following when half a dozen boys who had been watching the singular pair from the opposite side of the street made a sudden dash at the goose the first intimation dan had that his pet was in danger was when he heard the shouts of the boys followed by crippys angry hiss and the flapping of his wings quickly turning dan saw the goose closely pressed by the boys all of whom were trying to catch him and some of whom already had one or more feathers as trophies it did not take dan many moments to catch his pet up in his arms and then he stood ready to do battle for the goose while the city boys advanced towards him threateningly there could have been but one result to such a battle where six boys attacked one who was hampered in his movements by the goose and some serious injury might have been done to both dan and crippy had not a policeman come from around the corner just at that instant dans assailants fled at the sight of the officer and the country boy with his heavy noisy burden continued on his journey there was no further interruption for nearly an hour for when dan carried the goose in his arms he was by no means the object of curiosity he was with crippy following him at the expiration of that time it dawned upon him that in a place as large as new york it was useless for him to walk around in the hope of meeting his uncle or any of his family i declare i dont know what to do crippy he said as he seated himself on a doorstep with the goose by his side and looked mournfully up and down the street i shouldnt wonder if we hadnt been moren halfway round the city in all this time an yet we haint seen any of uncle roberts folks what shall we do crippy made no reply to the question but a boy about dans size who was looking wonderingly at the goose as he stood on his shortest leg in a mournful way spoke wot is it yer dont know wot ter do i dont know how to find my uncle robert crippy an me come down to see him an now we cant find his house do you call him crippy asked the boy as he nodded toward the goose yas hes crippy hardy mother was goin to kill him for dinner tomorrer so we come down here to get uncle robert to go up an see about it how far have you come seven miles did you walk every step well said the boy as he looked at crippy in a critical way it seems to me thats a mighty mean kind of a goose ter walk so far fur he haint handsome no ways an i think hed look a good deal better on ther table roasted than he does out here on ther street up to that moment dan had been disposed to trust this boy who was so friendly but when he spoke so slightingly of crippy he was disappointed in him you dont know crippy or you wouldnt say that replied dan gravely i would walk seventeen times as far if it would keep him from gettin killed well i tell yer wot it is and the boy spoke like one thoroughly conversant with geese and their ways hes got ter be a good deal bettern he looks ter mount to anything an he is replied dan and then he gave the stranger a full account of crippys sagacity and wisdom with such success that when he had finished the goose evidently stood high in the city boys estimation hes probly a mighty nice kind of a goose said the boy but it seems to me if i had a pet id want one that could sleep with me an you know you couldnt take this goose to bed i could if mother would let me an i dont see why she wont for i know crippy would just snuggle right down as good as anybody could for some time the two discussed the question of pets in general and crippy in particular then the city boy remembered his mother sent him on an errand which should have been done an hour before dan felt more lonely than ever after this newmade friend had gone and with crippy in his arms he started wearily out in search of uncle robert hardly knowing where he was going in his bewilderment he had walked entirely around the same block four times and an observant policeman asked him where he was going under the circumstances dan did not require much urging to induce him to tell the man his story do you know your uncles name asked the officer uncle robert hardy what is his business i mean what kind of work does he do he keeps store the officer led dan to the nearest drug store and there after consulting the directory told him there were several robert hardys mentioned at the same time giving him a list of the names dan took the paper with the written directions upon it feeling more completely at a loss to know how to proceed than he had before and it was in a dazed way that he listened to the instructions as to how he should find the nearest hardy but he started bravely off still carrying crippy who seemed to have doubled in weight and when he had walked half an hour in the direction pointed out by the policeman he appeared to be no nearer his destination than when he started what can we do crippy he cried as again he took refuge on a doorstep weary hungry and footsore he had seen no opportunity to buy a breakfast with his six cents it was then long past his usual time for dinner and his hunger did not tend to make him more cheerful the goose was as unable to answer this question as he had been the ones dan had previously asked and the only reply he made was a loud cackling which in his language signified that he thought it quite time that he had some dinner by this time and dan had not been on the doorstep more than five minutes a crowd of boys gathered around all disposed to make sport of the goose and to annoy the boy say country why dont you sell your goose where did the bird find you does yer mother know youre so far away from home these and other equally annoying questions dan listened to until he could no longer control himself and he cried to his tormentors see here boys if you had somethin you thought a good deal of an it was goin to be killed an roasted for dinner what would you do the boys were too much surprised by the question to reply and dan continued earnestly this goose is crippy an ive had him ever since he was a baby an got his leg broke we come in here to find uncle robert sos he could tell mother not to kill poor crip an now we cant find him an an well were jest two as lonesome fellers as you ever saw an if you knew jest how we did feel you wouldnt stand there pokin fun at us for a moment none of dans tormentors spoke and then the tallest one said sympathetically as he seated himself by the country boys side to show that he took both the boy and the goose under his protecting arm they shant plague you any more an ef id a known how you was feelin i wouldnt a said a word now tell us all about it dan was in that frame of mind where he needed sympathy and he told the whole story while the entire party stood around interrupting him now and then by exclamations of surprise that his parents should have been so cruel as to even think of killing that faithful crippy this consolation even though it did dan no material good was very sweet to him and he would have continued to sing the praise of his pet had not one of the boys proposed that an effort be made to find uncle roberts house then each one had a different plan to propose none of them thinking that at that hour four oclock in the afternoon it might be an act of charity first to give dan and crippy something to eat it surely seemed as if this discussion as to how the search should be begun would continue until it would be too late to do anything and while each one was stoutly maintaining that his plan was the best an oldfashioned sleigh drawn by a clumsylooking horse stopped directly opposite where the boys were holding their conference why father cried dan as he saw the occupant of the sleigh and at the same time he hugged crippy close to him as if he believed his father had come for the goose well dan you did find your uncle robert after all didnt you asked mr hardy as he alighted covered old dobbin carefully with the robe and then went to where dan was sitting already deserted by his newmade friends who feared mr hardy was about to inflict some signal punishment no sir i didnt find him faltered dan wondering what his father would do to him and crippy why havent you been in yet in where asked dan in surprise in here of course this is where your uncle robert lives and mr hardy pointed to the house on the steps of which dan had been sitting to his great surprise dan learned that he had followed the policemans directions exactly but not knowing it had neglected to look on the housedoors for his uncles name in a few moments more he and his father were in the house while crippy was in the kitchen actually gorging himself with food when mr hardy found the note dan had left he was not at all worried about his sons safety but when later in the day he had leisure he started to the city for the travellers and driving directly to his brothers house found them as has been seen it is easy to understand that after all this labor on dans part to save his pet mr hardy readily promised that crippy should be allowed to die of old age instead of being killed and roasted and dan with crippy hugged very close to him started for home with his father sure that no boy in all the wide world would spend a merrier thanksgiving than he crippy was also happy on that day if food could make him so and it is safe to say that if he survives the wonderfully big dinner dan proposes to give him this year he will live to a green old age his three trials i as carpenter and chemist for three years hal had been trying to decide what should be his business in life and now at the age of fifteen and in his last school year he was as far as ever from any fixed plan a profession he argued required too much study a trade meant ten hours a day of hard labor he was too old for an officeboy and he had no capital to put into business well if he could only even find out now for what he was fitted it would save time in the end how do people ever sit still and think he exclaimed aloud ill go over and consult ned ned was two years his senior he had started in life with the idea of being a doctor and had kept to it consequently he had little sympathy with hals vagaries and often chided him for his lack of definite purpose but as hals wellknown warwhoop sounded under the window he came out on his steps whats up he asked you look as black as a thunder cloud father says ive got to make up my mind what to do and that if i dont hell do it for me answered hal laconically and that might not suit you know i told you it would come to that if you did not look sharp answered ned take my advice now a boy like you better begin with a trade and work up to be boss mechanic then when you are rich buy a library and turn scholar theres a swell carpenters school just started down at the institute box and tools included in the tuition so youll have some property at the end of the term if you havent ideas i had thought of being a physicist or chemist replied hal but carpentering is really more in my line might try it at least suppose i talk it over at home you better said ned than keep me out here bareheaded goodby much obliged and goodby called out hal as he turned homewards it did not take long to obtain his parents consent as they hoped they saw in this definite wish an earnest of practical ability which would help them and him to decide the question of what he had better do he had owned one or two carpenters chests and had broken several tools so that he knew something about their use which would count in the beginning hals pride suffered however when at the institute he had to learn how to strike square blows and to practise the wrist elbow and shoulder movement in striking with light tools then too he had to submit to be taught how to drive nails just so many inches apart exactly as if he had never hammered before he was as indignant also at being told to neither split nor cut towards himself as if he had never hurt his jacket at last he was permitted to begin to make a picture frame its four sides had to be glued and dovetailed together and the fitting required careful measurements as hal was too anxious to go ahead to attend to details it is not surprising that the sides would not meet the more he planed and chiselled the worse it grew till in despair he took it home for kindling wood next he started on a bevellededge frame and still despising exact measurements he made the inner curve too deep thus injuring the effect of his design weary of mathematical carpentering he turned to the ordinary rough work of making a miniature house frame his previous mistakes had helped him so much that here he soon went ahead of the other boys but when he reached the staircase he began to fail the steps were not alike in depth nor were they placed at the right angles he used up four blocks of wood succeeding on the fifth though the stairs were still rather steep his frame completed he discovered that his acquaintances at the institute had advanced to the turninglathe too vexed and proud to go on and take up what they were leaving he went into the moulding room all went well at first the frame was evenly placed put together and inserted in the sandbox but when he came back two days later and lifted the upper half the sand all fell out and spoilt his mould for he had paid very little attention to getting it into the completely proper condition for receiving an impression this final failure at the institute convinced him that nature had not fitted him for a carpenter which knowledge he bore calmly for as he said it was a saving of time to find out what he could not be in his need he turned again to ned whom he had ignored during this two months at the institute ned looked as if he had expected him but could only learn that carpentering had gone up and that hal would now like to try his first idea and enter the chemical business provided that ned would become a partner and put in some stock ned demurred at first but finally concluded it might be helping himself as a doctor especially as the stock he had on hand and the use of his laundry could be considered an offset for hals capital my laundry would do just as well said hal you ought to put in money oh you had better take my laundry replied ned my mother does not object to smells for she thinks chemistry is going to revolutionize perfumery ive got some scales and a spiritlamp and we can get bottles and tumblers enough yes but you know we must have a roundbottomed receiver a measuring glass crucibles retorts and testtubes as you seem to know all about it replied ned carelessly you buy them and come here tomorrow hal assented and they separated to meet the next afternoon when they began with a manual of chemistry as their guide they first distilled water and then they analyzed it by boiling it but all this was too safe they wished to venture upon something dangerous so they put three drops of nitric acid on a copper cent and wrote out the result thus copper cent drops nitric acid result a greenish liquid nitrate of copper this formula was so pleasing that they continued to note down their work somewhat as follows shell drops nitric acid result shell dissolved solution muriate of lime carbonate of potassium result solid from these simple but important discoveries they proceeded to move difficult analyses and syntheses they made ammonia water they combined weights they experimented in acids bases and salts they produced explosions they almost set the house on fire with their experiments in hydrogen they tested iodine and chlorine the greatest hindrance to their advancement was the amount of care required they had burnt holes in their clothes the laundry had became an inconvenient refuge for the cats and dogs of the house the younger children could no longer play there but broken glass should injure them and the maids dreaded entering a place where unlookedfor events were always happening a crisis was at last developed by the gift of a friend who sent them some lumps of sulphuret potass which the boys heated when a strange and still stranger odor arose absorbed in their experiments they heard neither approaching footsteps nor voices the door was even opened but quickly shut at last neds mother courageously rushed up to them holding her handkerchief tight over her face and insisted with unmistakable gestures upon their leaving the laundry the odor had penetrated every nook and corner of the house a committee meeting had vanished and windows were all thrown open this is an end to your chemistry she declared in injured tones you have discovered nothing except how to make yourselves sick have injured your coats and trousers and i wont have any more of it do you understand yes said both boys meekly perhaps they were rather glad than otherwise of any expression of authority which could plausibly end what they were secretly longing to give up as partners they had been faithful to each others interests but did it pay to give up baseball week after week just to carry out an idea hals money was gone and both boys had done a large amount of trading of books and curiosities for some other boys halfused chemical stock ned was sure he knew enough to aid him in his profession and hal valued failure as an exponent in indicating negatively his future career glad of it ned ventured to assert at last when the family had dispersed and windows were closed we must clean up and we might as well sell out the whole concern take account of stock and divide the profits dont flatter yourself replied hal that therell be much profit if there is i ought to have two thirds of it as i put in the most capital yes as far as cash goes but brains count too and i think you will admit that the ideas have been furnished by me chiefly besides my trousers were burned more than yours but i dont care divide things as you like i am agreed ii as office boy when all was definitely settled between ned and himself and the assets of the firm disposed of hal felt for some days as if he had been to a funeral he wandered around the house disconsolately and then suddenly a new influence crossed his path which promised tangible and immediate rewards in other fields of labor money prizes were offered to graduates of the high schools for the best two essays which should be written one on the colonial policy towards quakers the other on the value of republican government the money was not considerable but the work looked toward political journalism perhaps on to a career like motleys or bancrofts hal had always been an attentive lounger around newspaper offices on election nights and in the representatives hall of the state house when any interesting bill was being debated this he considered as proof of his love of history history was the one study too in which he invariably gained the highest marks at school these indications greatly encouraged him now he felt impelled to write the essays even if they should be failures because he was really interested in the subjects and had often talked with his father about them both the closing day of school soon came the boys marched sang received their diplomas and then threw up their hats when free and in the street very early the next morning hal visited three libraries and took down the titles of innumerable books and sketched two plans for he intended as i have before said to write two essays each in different style thus to increase his chance of success he selected nisus sum and america as signatures he furnished himself with a quart bottle of ink a box of pens two dozens of lead pencils and two reams of paper and greatly enjoyed these preliminaries thus equipped he began with no depressing circumstances except his mothers words that if by the first of september he had not decided what he should like to do she should decide for him he went out of town as usual in the hot weeks he fished and climbed hills and got lost as usual but through it all he thought and read of the colonial policy and wondered whether he should have fallen in love with a quaker girl and whether the troubles between england and ireland arose from a need of republican government in spite of his ramblings and in spite of some discouraged moods some unexamined idea always urged him on and the result was that in two months he had prepared rough sketches of his work and his parents were this time convinced of his earnestness coming home the very evening of the first day of september the day and the hour he had dreaded as the last of his liberty because as he had not made up his mind it was to be made up for him he saw two men lifting his father out of a carriage he stopped and looked at them he had no power to speak or help he saw them carry his father upstairs and lay him on the bed then at a word from his mother he went for a doctor he never could recall the manner of his errand but the physician came at last some one said to him it is a slight shock of paralysis if another does not follow he will soon get well this was like saying to him if your father does not die hell live how long was he to wait for that knowledge an hour would be a year and a year would be a century he helped in all things as he was told to do but his fingers were like thumbs and his feet like clubs he felt a singular and confusing sense of identity with his father as though the paralysis had included him by and by the room grew quiet he and his mother were left alone he would have given anything if he had dared to speak or touch her nothing was near him had he ever been a boy was there a prize essay were there only three people in the world his father his mother and himself later came his uncle his mother then called him by name for the first time in those terrible hours and bade him bid his father goodnight as he went mechanically to do so his father seemed to keep hals hand in his own numb fingers and to look most imploringly the mothers hand on to harrys the mother as the hands met said hal will take care of me dear and hal exclaimed i will then they knew they were right in their interpretation as the sick face brightened and the eyelids slowly closed in weariness hal went upstairs to his own room the thinking he did that night made a man of him he was sure his father would live but also that his salary would cease and that he himself must help to support the family and so help me god ill do it said he but ill win the prizes too the growing strength of his purpose soon overcame him and he fell asleep to dream of olympic games and wreaths of victory when the physicians visit was over the next day the world did not look quite so dark uncle joe was to live with them awhile and the father was conscious and quiet goodby mother said hal goodby she answered the front door closed and hal went down town to the office of newton bryce old friends of his fathers he walked up to the senior partner and said very like a mechanical toy unwinding my father has had a stroke of paralysis he cant do anything for months i heard you say once that if you could get an officeboy who could keep accounts you would make it worth while for him to stay with you i can stop stop said mr bryce i had just heard of your fathers illness and am very sorry but you talk so fast i dont understand you what is it you want who sent you no one i suppose i did rattle on but i had been saying over to myself on the way down what i meant to say to you like points in an essay points in an essay the boy is a daft one im all right sir or will be if you take me how much wages can you pay the senior partner smiled three dollars a week at first and more by and by is that what you want i need my evenings sir said hal i forgot to mention that you can have them but why as hal made no reply mr bryce added kindly never mind the boy i have goes tonight i was to tell him today whether i would take his brother or make an arrangement with the janitor i have no opinion of officeboys ill confess to you young sir but for your fathers sake i am going to try you be here tomorrow at eight oclock put the office in order get the mail and have my table ready for me at halfpast eight much obliged thank you for my fathers sake ill furnish you with an opinion of officeboys presently said hal he started and got as far as the door when he turned back i really do thank you said he thats a new sort of boy anyway one consolation said mr bryce but it will cost something to teach him bother the change mother said hal on reaching home ive been and gone and done it i am an officeboy at three dollars a week now more in prospect you blessed child she exclaimed and then she and hal had a good oldfashioned cry together which saved much talking explanation and advice hals work was promptly done the next morning mr bryces table was ready at halfpast eight in ideal order yet though he went to the bank wrote and added figures he still had much idle time on his hands therefore the following day when there was really nothing more for him to do he felt at liberty to seat himself at a table and begin to write mr bryce noticing him thus occupied walked leisurely by and beheld out of the corner of his eye two rolls of manuscript but if the boy could be silent so could his master still the masters curiosity was excited this new kind of officeboy piqued his interest ill call him off and see how hell take it reasoned mr bryce and he whistled hal came at once alert attentive and did the errands assigned mr bryce could not detect any sign of a preoccupied mind thus passed the week hal bore home his first earnings saturday night and laid the bills on his fathers bed with a deeper and more pleasurable feeling of having done something worth doing than he had ever felt or dreamt of before yet if any one had spoken a word of appreciation to him he could not have borne it that first week was the type of weeks to come his officework was not heavy though he was more and more trusted at times he had to bite his lips as his brain came to a sudden stop in its work when the whistle sounded for him in the midst of his own personal copying or reading but as the evenings grew longer and his father better he had more time at home to work on his essays he had however decided to give up trying for two prizes and he also had become very doubtful about the certainty of receiving even one as his ideal of an essay grew and perfected itself and as he realized how much hard work was required in both reading and reflection and even in any truly logical arrangement of his ideas he had made several rough drafts of his essay he had wholly rewritten it twice but the hard work of form development and finish remained still when he considered his previous failures as carpenter and as chemist he was determined to be patient with himself and try his utmost with this plan in this painstaking mood the essay was completed he sent it in on the last hour of the last day assigned iii as historian now that hal had sent in his essay he felt weary for the excitement of composition and of haste had ceased and he tormented himself too by recalling sentence after sentence which he wished he could remodel also memory brought back his past failures he had not succeeded as chemist or carpenter and all the boys knew it what would they say when his name would be posted on the bulletin down town as a rejected essayist presently too it was announced that the bestowal of the old south prizes must be deferred as an unexpectedly large number of essays had been presented hal whistled shrugged his shoulders refused to endure the suspense cast aside his interest in the matter and resolved to settle down into an officeboy he cleaned the office more vigorously than ever and as he began a catalogue of his employers library there arose the faint glimpse of a new hope in the thought that his present pursuit might eventuate in his being a lawyer but with it there came a hot flush of shame as he remembered his many visions of the future and to get rid of them he would run to the bank on an errand with such fury that his haste suggested a panic but in spite of all his changes of intention he was growing manly making character developing mental fibre and muscle his mother trusted him with her hopes and fears and his father talked to him with a respect that was very consoling to his wounded spirit also the boys ceased to come for him in the evening if they met him on the street they called him a dig and asked him what new hobby made him so serious some months had thus passed when one day hal who had almost forgotten his history in his law thought mr bryces whistle for him had a peculiar sound get your hat said the lawyer and follow me i want you to go to the court house hals active imagination instantly saw himself seated there as judge yes law was his vocation but when there he was almost pushed into a corner while mr bryce pointed him out to the clerk of the court this rather frightened hal but he felt reassured at the command to stay where he was until the clerk should bid him go for mr bryce for the latter could not afford to spend the morning in court waiting for his case to come up it was a new world to hal and his astonishment and interest was increased as he recognized an old playmate in the one who was being examined an officer had removed the boys jacket and was calling the attention of the judge to long deep welts on the boys back the result of lashes inflicted by his father because his son earned but little the contents of a dirty paperbag were also exhibited as being the only dinner allowed the boy who with his mouldy crust walked three miles each day to the shop where he worked that very morning he had been so dull that some one suspecting the truth had told the boss of his condition and through an officer of the society for the prevention of cruelty to children his case had been brought into court poor hal perhaps he was born to be a philanthropist after all he resolved to interest himself in the s p c c visions of cases hunted out and brought before the officers thrilled his soul how he ached for this particular boy and how he contrived to make that boy feel he was there and to tuck some lozenges into his hand as his former companion passed by him under the kind guardianship of the secretary of the society and then the clerk ordered him to find mr bryce the next day when he was summoned to mr bryces inner office from dreams of himself as the eminent legal adviser and prosecutor for the s p c c that gentleman asked him rather quizzically how he liked court business hal replied that he did not know surely but guessed he might come to prefer it to office work and cataloguing well said mr bryce i am rather sorry to hear that for i had thought of raising your wages however i am doubtful about employing essayists as officeboys it might work badly has it sir he asked then in an embarrassed manner i am not certain what you mean the lawyer made no reply and hal turned away crestfallen o come back here boy called out mr bryce then and by the way can you tell me who is nisus sum harry wriggled with conflicting sensations until he could scarcely stand at last he burst out what is that to you o not much replied mr bryce with an amused look only i hold an essay to return to him hal grew so white that his employer pitied him and forebore you did not know i was chairman of the committee on the old south prizes did you he added in a different tone no sir i did not exclaimed hal flushing to his very temples and i did not know that you were nisus sum until ten minutes ago well this may be fun to you sir but it isnt to me said hal almost with a sob look here my boy listen you knew mr akers died well he was one of the judges and i was asked to take his place and i consented because i saw that i had an officeboy who would attend to his work hal put his hand out vaguely towards the table as if to lean on it for support mr bryces tone involuntarily softened as he continued i have been comparing the estimates sent in by the other judges and i see that we agree that the first prize for colonial policy is taken by nisus sum nisus sum said the boy dreamily first prize then suddenly as if beside himself he twirled mr bryces chair round and round with the poor man in it until the lawyer had to exert his strength to stop him thatll do exclaimed he dont get frantic but it was really very risky for you to try to do my work and yours too there was danger of doing neither satisfactorily did i neglect anything sir you know i didnt i began to read up for the essay before father was taken sick and then when that came i was bound i would do something at last well well you succeeded didnt you go home now and tell them only remember this and mr bryce grew stern dont think because you have succeeded now that you always are to win stick to your daily work be a good clerk first that you may be a good historian later trust me said hal gravely who felt the awe of success stealing over him he felt queer yet happy and humble and bowing low he left the room it took but a few moments for him to rush home and if his father had not gained in strength he certainly would have suffered for hal bounded into the room upsetting the chairs and a table and spinning his mother round in circles somewhat as he had treated mr bryce he exclaimed i have won i have won first prize now you can be sick father as long as you please then followed explanation and a quiet talk which made harry always look back upon that evening as the happiest one of his boyhood it only remains to add that he was as good as his word he was an able clerk first and an historian only as a middleaged man in the second dormitory ramon valdez was an acquisition he was a cuban father had picked him up at havana where he was looking out for somebody who could teach him english instead of the queer jabber that he learned secondhand from a wizened little french adventurer who had set up as a teacher of languages and had nearly forgotten even his own i did get sold in the most ridiculous way over fathers telegram that announced his coming but thats all over they have about forgotten it he was real fun after we got acquainted he didnt seem to know anything about baseball and couldnt catch a fly worth a cent guess it is too hot in havana to play ball he couldnt fish either but it wasnt the season for that so we didnt care but he could ride he mounted the colt one day bareback and went around the lot five times before he fell off and not one of us boys could stay on a rod we respected him some after that but he was queer the first thing mother did was to buy him a lung protector as he wasnt acclimated yet she said jack the sixyearold got hold of it and put it on outside of his frock and then came galloping around with it on in that way well ramon came down to breakfast the next morning with that protector on just as jack had fixed it then he wanted some johnbread where he got it i dont know but what he meant was johnnycake i heard him reciting some poetry to mollie one night that was fathers way in teaching languages to make us commit poetry and recite to each other and this was what he made of it zoze zevening bells zoze zevening bells how maynay tales zheir moozic tells of yuz an home an zat sweet time wen first i heard zheir queezing chime their what ramon cried mollie zheir queezing chime he repeated innocently staring at her soothing ramon soothing he laughed away too like a good fellow and didnt get mad in the least i suppose our spanish was as funny to him he never laughed at us though i presume he was too polite but he just got into the ways of us boys about as quickly as any new boy that ever came to the highland school and before he had been there two weeks he was in a scrape its dreadfully dull to be the teachers son you have to do just so you know to set a good example and it isnt any fun father never asked me to tell what was going on no matter what was up but he put me upon honor not to go in myself so of course i had to keep out but the fellows understood and used to tell me all about it afterward and as somehow they always came to grief i felt a little more contented than i might have done one night we could not get to sleep the long moonbeams came down athwart the dormitory through the great windows and lay in broad parallelograms bisected and quartered upon the floor we got our geometry lesson out of the figures and reeled off a whole section of theorems without the least effect that ought by rights to be enough to set a whole houseful of boys journeying into the land of nod but it didnt us father heard us jabbering and came up to see what the matter was but our sudden interest in the science of planes and prisms so amused him that he laughed all the way downstairs for charlie brown crept to the door and heard him at last frank hapgood happygolucky sat up in desperation flung his pillow on the floor got out of bed deliberately and sat down on it nine other pillows nine other whiterobed figures solemnly followed suit said harry eveleth fellows ive tried to do my duty and go to sleep and i cant we must do something a silence broken by a sigh from ramon ah on nights like zis i have gone to ze ze zoogar houses to sleep some time in habana illustration the old horse was sleepy but they were ready at last frank happy gave a start looked at the circle intently then gave a little nod and winked eight others of the owl committee gave a simultaneous start in answer as though they had been unconsciously fooling around a galvanic battery the gentleman from havana alone was quiet he did not yet understand but the others did and he was ready to follow texan herders say that a drove of ten thousand cattle will sometimes at night leap to their feet like a flash without apparent cause or warning there will be a roar of thundering hoofs a distant rumble and that herd will have vanished like smoke from the campfire on the stampede our boys had stampeded ten or fifteen minutes later a certain wakeful teacher was pleasantly made aware of the fact that a cataract of boys each with one of the nice white blankets belonging to mrs teacher tied across his shoulders was streaming down the lightningrod by his window and stepping lightly thither he caught a disconnected word or two about old browns sugarhouse how shall we get her out tie up her feet in straw but the carriage will make such a racket well after a moments thought we can take the cart thats been newly greased there was a rumble a slow squeeak and the cart was out without much noise two boys at the thills and two more pushing behind they softly trundled it down the yard stopping at every unusually loud squeak it was almost as light as day only in the yard the trees cast a slight shadow of tangled branches leafless as they were there was a suppressed sense of excitement a strained thrill of the nerves that made thumby work of their handling the buckles the old horse was sleepy and wouldnt stand round to order and they had to push her into place but they were ready at last and happygolucky whispered pile in they piled in literally one above the other and lay down upon the hay in the bottom of the cart there might yet be some stray wanderer to meet and run the gauntlet of his crossquestioning the wheel struck a stone and there was a jounce the bottom fellows wriggled out what was left of them and sat up gasping they had rather run the risk than try that again but they met no one illustration the return of the valiant stampeders it was a night when there is no sound the insects are dead the birds have gone south with the other members of the higher circles of society there was only the rattle of the heavy cart springless and jolty along the dusty road that wound like a great horseshoe around the long slope of the ridge that shot up suddenly into paradise hill beyond the river a dog barked a mile away and ended in a melancholy howl ramon shivered and drew his blanket around him he had a superstitious fear of that sound the mountains in the north never seemed so high and dark before then they saw that it was a cloud black sullenlooking great masses of vapor heaped in billowy folds blackening the slopes with shadow and barely touched above with silvergilt looks a little like a storm tomorrow said harry no one answered him the chatter had somehow died away and they were more intent on keeping warm than talking it wasnt all their fancy painted it this clear cold moonlight it was icy never mind boys cried charlie brown cheerfully as they drew up at an old hophouse by the side of the road and got out stiffly we can howl now if we like and nobody to hear but nobody wanted to howl they did want to get up the slope to the edge of the woods where the sugarhouse was and putting horse and cart together in the shed they scaled the fence and started up the hill at a lumbering trot now that their beds were so far away they were sleepy enough as it happened just as they struck the fence a brisk elderly gentleman with irongray hair and spectacles and a queer twinkle in his eye as he glanced up at the mass of clouds piling up in the mountains walked hurriedly down a narrow sheeppath through the leafless woods and entered the sugarcamp it was dark in there dark as erebus only in two or three places a ray of light streamed down through the holes in the roof the gentleman in spectacles glanced around serenely as though it was quite the thing for him to be wandering around in the woods at that unearthly hour poked at the roof here and there with his cane knocked up a few shingles that let more light in on the subject of his investigations and came out again hastily as he heard the boys approach and disappeared in a clump of spruces five or ten minutes afterward he suddenly appeared at the bottom of the hill backed the horse out of the shed put on the bridle and removed his blanket sedately got in and drove quietly home charlie brown was the first up the hill and heralded the sight of the camp with a cheer now then lively out with your jackknives and off with a lot of spruce boughs then followed a great hacking of dull knives and cracking of limbs with the occasional swish of an armful into the camp the boys worked like beavers for a while and got thoroughly warmed again and the air within was filled with resinous fragrance that done and arranged to their experienced leaders satisfaction they wrapped themselves like indians in their blankets and tumbled down upon the heap of boughs the air trembled with a chorus of strange sounds as one by one they dropped off into a drowsy sleep with an occasional wriggle as a knot or the end of a limb made itself felt through the manyfolded blanket and engraved a distinct dent upon the sleepers back while overhead the giant cloud crept upward slowly slowly toward the zenith spreading east and west without a break one half of the valley had vanished in the blackest shadow and still the gilded edge swung steadily on with the slow resistless sweep of misty legions upon legions armed in ebon mail vast billows of night that drowned the scattered stars that met them one by one then it struck the full moon and blotted it from sight the world of the little valley dropped into night and all was dark as erebus a breath of wind whispered through the forest and died away sighing in the pines ramon awoke suddenly straight from the centre of that sea of blackness like the plummet of an engineer like the lead of a stormtossed sailor shot a drop of rain down it came with unerring swiftness right through one of the spectacled gentlemans improvised skylights in the roof and splashed in the cubans face halfdreaming still he sleepily rolled over out of range he had been awakened before in that way and was used to it there was a slope now in the pile of boughs and harry eveleth slid down into the vacated place unconsciously splash and the raindrop covered his cheek with water dimly through his dormant brain the idea crept that he was back in the dormitory and some one was trying the old trick of hanging a saturated sponge above his head he had done it himself once and this was retribution with a smothered grunt of discontent he gave ramon a shove that sent him further and rolled over into his place frank hapgood began to slide began to dream that he was falling down through a frightful place that had no bottom the air whistled shrilly past his head the black walls of the pit shot upward swiftly and he could see the faint light far up at the mouth of the shaft growing dimmer until it too went out he tried to scream but the wind caught the sound and carried it away with a rush of mocking laughter he tried to reach out and grasp the walls but his hands were bound then he felt that he was drawing near the end he had fallen miles and now his speed was slackening and he was falling so softly so lightly till at last like a downy feather he floated on the air as a spirit from another world he had reached the centre of the earth splash came the rain upon his face and the cold breath of the night and storm great cжsar boys its raining there wasnt much doubt of that fact and as stream after stream began to pour through the roof there was a sudden resurrection among the white mummies stretched upon the spruce boughs frank glanced around and then made another equally wise observation this old shantys mighty leaky as the ground covered by the mansion thus disrespectfully alluded to was about eight feet by twelve and there were at that particular moment sixteen different streams of water pouring down upon their heads the rest had already discovered the fact and there was a hasty consultation cant we stop up the holes nothing to do it with said harry eveleth mournfully and ive been sitting in a puddle for the last two minutes ramon jumped a waterspout had shot down the back of his neck we mus go out of zis we soon shall be wetter we can run to ze horses house good for you havana your heads solid sang out charlie brown heartily now for it put your blankets over your heads womanfashion and travel like a blue streak and jupiter pluvius how cold this rain is his words ended in an involuntary chatter there was a momentary hesitation then with a sigh they ducked under the blankets and dashed out into the darkness and the rain which fell hissing through the tossing limbs of the trees and stumbling over the fence with a crash of breaking rails they ran violently down a steep place without the least idea of the direction till they all brought up in a heap in the bottom of a ditch with some six inches of water for company however within a few rods was the horses house they scrambled out and ran for it their once white blankets streaming with muddy water chilled through and through with the cutting wind they reached it crowded in felt blindly around in the dark and then came a cry of dismay the horse is gone they looked at each other in silence it was too dark in there to distinguish a single feature so they did not get much comfort from that for a full minute not a word was spoken then frank hapgood drew a long breath and then ejaculated well im blessed so ze horse is stole by ze ladrones remarked ramon philosophically how we shall pay pay no the beast untied the knot and walked home which is what we shall have to do and its raining brickbats snapped harry as a gust of hail crashed upon the roof he did that once before somehow their spirits rose a little at that the indefiniteness of the animals fate had alarmed some of them and pocket money was scanty they even cracked a feeble joke or two in a halfhearted way but the steady splash and spatter of the rain chilled the fun all out of it and wet as they were they huddled together among a lot of straw and blankets until they were quite comfortably warm they were even dozing when charlie brown suddenly pointed to the doorway with a husky hurrah it was the gray light of a cold november dawn father had some peculiar ideas when he built our house and the diningroom juts out from the rest like a great baywindow a room with three sides of glass we were at breakfast discussing buckwheats diligently when father glanced down the roadway and began to laugh we turned looked and then rushed to the great windows in a crowd up the drive with slow and solemn tread swaying under the gale pelted with rain came the valiant stampeders a procession of blanketmantled figures in dingy white the water dripping from their coverings in streams squashing and churning in their boots as they splashed indifferently onward through mud or grass alike such miserablelooking rats frank looked up with a wan attempt at a smile as he passed under the windows and saw the rows of grinning faces looking down but the rest kept their eyes fixed upon the ground father went out upon the piazza goodmorning boys out for a constitutional nothing better to get up an appetite he said with a cheerful smile frank laughed he really couldnt help it although a moment before he had been mad with himself the horse the rain and the world in general as they looked at each other sheepishly out of the corner of their eyes the rest took it in and began to grin at the ludicrous sight of themselves and for a few minutes very great was the hilarity thats right thats right a hearty laugh is good medicine but you will need something more so in with you quick and before they knew it they were running the gauntlet of the rest of us and scudding for the dormitory from whence came presently a sound as of mighty rubbing and the flavor of jamaica ginger but they had to stay in bed all day to their great disgust and ginger was a dangerous word to mention for weeks after and for two whole terms not one of those boys were in any of the scrapes that were going on they had been there they said with a rueful smile which we could appreciate as father used to say theres nothing like learning the logical sequence of consequences and they had a big washing bill that week the doughnut bait a schoolboy a few weeks since told me of an amusing encounter that he and his brother had just had with a bear it was at thanksgiving time and they were enjoying the few days vacation in hunting in the maine woods the locality to be exact was the north side of roach river about halfway from the first pond to where the stream empties into moosehead lake near a deserted log hut known as mcpheters camp they had discovered signs of a bear his tracks and the spot where he had lain down among the tall dead grasses lets stay here all night and watch for him said willie willie was the one who related the adventure to me that wouldnt be right for theyre looking for us at home replied his brother dick to this somewhat tempting invitation besides there might not come a bear here again for a week well lets rest here a few minutes anyway said willie opposite the door of the hut was its one window the glass so covered with cobwebs that very little light came through it was dark enough in there for a bears den he might in fact be in there but flinging the door wide open the boys ventured in there was a visible movement at the window but it proved to be only three or four great gray spiders hurrying to their coverts from the unwonted light whats this dick and will kicked a tangled mass of iron from a corner into the sunshine dick eyed it a moment aha its a bear trap said he well we will catch him now said will triumphantly the old things too rusty and weak dick pronounced finally after examining it twouldnt hold a bear oh lets just set it anyhow and try coaxed will after repeated efforts in which will got caught himself or rather his boot they got the huge iron jaws wide open and the trencher in place next thing we must shoot something for bait said will i really think we havent time not tonight will said dick see its almost sunset and we are two miles from home through the woods well then ive got two doughnuts left lets put them on very well laughed dick goodnaturedly if you can wait for your supper so the trap with a doughnut tied to the trencher was placed a few feet just outside the cabin where any one within could plainly see it from the window the chain was made fast and the other doughnut broken to bits and scattered about the next morning the boys were early on the tramp in order to visit a shallow pond some three miles eastward where they expected to find moose after tiptoing about and impatiently watching the shores till afternoon they did see a moose but before they were within range he turned to run fire will shouted dick the report of two guns echoed from the woods about while the moose with a sudden bound or two disappeared among the trees they could hear the great creature crashing through the woods and they hurried on in pursuit after going about a mile they lost track of him and they gave it up as neither had detected any token that the animal was hurt the chase had led them near a trail that passed the mcpheters camp and they jokingly turned that way to see if anything had happened there if that doughnut isnt gone im going to eat it murmured will im awful hungry i doubt that the birds and squirrels have left any till this time said dick a large bird or a gray squirrel would get caught if they touched it wouldnt they questioned will hopefully perhaps if the old trap wasnt so rusty but hush theres the camp supposing we keep behind it and go in until we see if theres anything in the trap they opened the door softly and moved lightly in and toward the window the first glance gave them a start there was a big bear sitting bolt upright with his forepaws hanging right before the window he had evidently heard the sound of their approach and was looking around for them dick gave one long but weary look then he shouted all right will hes caught the doughnut did it for a moment the boys stood looking out of the window and the bear sat looking in it was too much for bruin that gaze of exultant victory he struggled a moment with the trap then with one vigorous leap he cleared himself and went head and shoulders into that window dick sprang for a hole in the low roof and will dashed out of the door he had just time to shut it behind him before the bear came bumping against it it were hard to say who was hunter and who was hunted just then will was outside but virtually the bears captive as he stood braced back against the door dick was creeping about on the rotten creaking roof the bear was inside vigorously snuffing about for his enemies he repeatedly tried the door but it failed to open he growled up the hole in the roof at dick but couldnt reach him there they were three very uncomfortable parties at last the boys heard the sound of rattling glass again evidently the bear was going to try the hunt outside will made a frantic endeavor to open the door but he had pushed so hard that now it stuck he got it open at last and peeped in just at the instant when the bear came round the corner this was the situation now will was looking in after the bear the bear had come round after will and dick on the roof was trying to get a good sight at the bear without slipping off by holding to the hole in the roof with his foot he found himself able to peep over the eaves and when the bear turned the corner he with lucky aim and plucky quickness put a moosecharge into the back of the creatures head will turned and was putting his gun out to fire just as dick dropped down through the roof but the bear lay still dicks shot had finished him there was of course great rejoicing between the two young hunters they started a fire then took off bruins skin and soon some most delicious bearsteaks were broiling on the coals i dont miss that doughnut at all somehow said will as they sat at dinner a real happening old beppo and nina his wife with their two boys lived in one of those little excavations which everybody who has visited naples will remember i hardly know what to call them for they certainly do not deserve the name of dwellings they are little holes dug in the sandy hillsides just outside the busy city where the poor people crawl in at night and where they keep their little belongings by day the poor of naples live out of doors as indeed the poor people all through southern italy do and it does not seem half as hard to be poor in italy as elsewhere the beautiful clear blue sky overhead and the soft warm earth to sit and lie upon with the delicious air to breathe and the great duomos always open to them where they can go at any hour of the day and feel that they have just as much right as kings and princes who wonders that they are contented lazy and dreamy give a neapolitan beggar macaroni and sunshine and he will sit and dream away the hours with no thought or care of what will come tomorrow he has just energy to whine poverino signorina and it matters little whether his extended hand is filled with centismi or not according as it may be he calls upon the sanctissmi virgina to bless or curse you and sinks away into dreamy content till the next stranger approaches not so with old beppo he tugged all day grinding out dolorous tunes from his old organ and whether people paid him for grinding or paid him to stop grinding all the same old beppo thought he was earning an honest living everybody in the little neighborhood of lazzaroni knew and loved old beppo why he was always called old beppo i never knew unless it was because his homelife had given him a subdued downcast look and his shoulders were more rounded and bent than even his heavy organ would have made them if he could have had a little comfort and cheer in the poor place he called home nina was a peevish querulous wife always finding fault and never satisfied with beppos earnings true it was little enough he brought at night after trudging all day with his handorgan and as he approached the little rookery at the end of the day his steps grew languid and heavy for he knew his only welcome would be ninas grumbling fretful greeting and poor old beppo after unstrapping his burden and eating his poor meal of macaroni found rest not on the little seat outside his own door with his wife and children but on the sandbank or on a neighbors doorseat where he could smoke his pipe in peace beyond the sound of ninas croaking scolding voice the two boys were like their mother and beppo found little comfort in them so it must be confessed that when in the summer of nina was called away to a country where old beppo hoped she would not find so much to scold about his grief was not inconsolable and a year later he found a more congenial companion in a trim pretty little widow whose husband was taken off by the same scourge that carried nina away italia had one little boy who was like his mother amiable and pretty with the beautiful great black eyes of a true italian and all the fascinating ways of a pretty child of nature he might have been used for a model of italian childbeauty old beppo spent two peaceful and happy years with italia and then came again the summer pestilence and poor italia was one of the victims little dino was heartbroken at the loss of his mother and old beppo after trying in vain to console the little boy decided to take him with the two halfbrothers to america as much perhaps to change the scene for little dino as to better his condition in our land of hope and promise dino played the violin and accompanied old beppo in his wanderings over the country for a time until the old man became restless and unhappy and longed for his native air dino had recovered his childish spirits and was happy in the freedom of our free sunny summer weather where he had plenty to eat and was petted and pampered because of his pretty little ways and his bright black eyes but old beppo could not live away from his beautiful italy and as soon as he gathered pennies enough he took passage for naples and left the three boys in america the two older boys were to look after little dino and to give him such care as he needed true to their coarse nature and instincts they began as soon as their father had left to send dino out with his violin to earn not only his own bread but theirs for they knew that his attractive little face and winsome manners would win for them more pennies than they could for themselves this was true but sometimes the pennies failed and the days were dull and people did not care for dinos music and then the brothers beat him and illtreated him until he could endure it no longer the summer was passing the days were becoming cool and the nights damp and chilly and oftentimes little dino rather than go to his brothers where he was sure to meet with cruel treatment would creep under an old cart or under some doorsteps and spend the night this he did not complain of until the nights grew frosty and the poor little fellow found himself stiff and cold when morning came and then with the tears streaming down his cheeks he longed for my italy i fraid i freeze to death i want my mother he said pitifully his brothers kept track of him and lost no opportunity to illtreat him and he resolved to run away from boston and go to some place where they could not find him accordingly one rainy chilly night in november he took the cars and started to go he knew not where but anywhere beyond the knowledge of the brothers who had whipped him until he bore the marks all over his little body crouched down in a corner of the cars dino was counting his pennies when the conductor found him and asked in not the pleasantest tones where he wished to go of course he had no idea how much money it took to ride in the cars even a short distance so he gave the conductor all the pennies he had and said i want to go so far illustration little dino at the fair it was on this dismal chilly november night that little dino found himself in one of the suburban towns of boston where some young ladies were holding a little sale for the benefit of a home for orphan children in their neighborhood the day being so unpropitious visitors had been few and sales very slow the young people with rueful faces were talking in the twilight of their disappointed hopes and wondering if the evening would bring customers for the little articles they had spent all their leisure summer hours upon in the hope of adding a large sum to the depleted treasury of the town when suddenly a childs voice was heard at the door me want to play me fiddle for some supper no one who saw that tiny boy with his pleading eyes and his rich soft voice and his broken foreign accent as he stood half clad in the chill of that november night can ever forget the picture they were at a loss to know what to do they said but we dont want to hear your fiddle where did you come from and what is your name and where are you going it is night and where will you sleep me come from naple he said and holding out his little brown hands he displayed the scratches and said me big brothers beat me and scratch me and me run away but where did you come from a half a dozen eager girls asked all at once me dont know me sleep under cart and me very cold cant me play me fiddle for some supper the tears began to start not only in the eyes of the little waif but handkerchiefs were in demand among all who stood listening to the story forgetful of sales or profits for the moment and intent only upon feeding the little orphan who stood before them come they said and you shall have some supper but where will you stay tonight me dont know me mother die me father go back to naple and me cry the interest grew with every word he uttered and the excitement ran high among the enthusiastic young girls each of whom fed and petted him till the little fellows countenance beamed with happiness he had never fallen into such hands before and his sorrows like all childish sorrows melted away under the first rays of loving kindness he was placed on the flowerstand and there among the flowers in the warm cheerful hall he was reminded of his own beautiful italy the land of flowers and the notes of his little fiddle attracted the visitors so that as the evening wore on dino found his friends increasing and his pockets filling with pennies and his eyes overflowing with joy pointing to one of the ladies he said in a plaintive tone nobody love me nobody smile on me but her and my mother die and i cry but the evening was wearing away the flowers were fading the people were leaving one by one and the hall would soon be deserted what then would become of poor dino it was decided at length after much consultation to place him in the orphans home the morning dawned and brought one of those clear crisp november days which are common in our new england after a rain and dino was taken to his new home this home for orphan boys is a cosey cheerful house and when dino was introduced to the kind man who has charge and told if he would be a good boy he should have a home there have dinners and suppers have a place to sleep like other little boys he gave a sigh of relief took a deliberate look around the sunny room and then thrust his little brown chubby hand into the pocket of his torn dilapidated trousers and drew forth the pennies that were snugly tucked away in their depths and with a grateful smile his black eyes fairly dancing for joy he handed them to the superintendent saying you give me home i give you my pennies i was so fraid i freeze to death it was touching to see how dino clung to his little old fiddle it seemed to be the one connecting link between the days in italy where he had lived an easy happy life with his mother whom he seemed to love so dearly and the new home which promised to give him shelter his little old fiddle was a source of much amusement to the children whose tunes he readily caught and he soon became a great favorite the visitors who came to the home always asked first for dino the italian boy and seldom went away without leaving something for the little fellow as the days and weeks wore away dino constantly improved in mind and manners and developed all the sweetness of heart and disposition that he promised on that november morning when he gave his pennies for a home at the end of five years he left the home and sought a place where he could earn his own living years passed and the memory of little dino was fading out of the hearts of those who had befriended him when the sabbath stillness of a midsummer afternoon was broken by the sound of approaching footsteps as the family sat on the broad piazza of a pleasant country house a young gentleman was seen coming up the shady avenue and the question went around who can the stranger be the bell rang and the message came say to the lady dino would like to see her i think she will remember the name as the lady approached she of whom he had said on that dreary night in november nobody love me nobody smile on me but her she recognized the italian eyes and the old sweet musical accent with which she had been familiar years before with a graceful bow he said as if to assure himself of a welcome madam i should not have ventured in your presence if i had not been informed by my friends at the home upon whom i have called that you would be glad to see me for i felt that by my long silence i had forfeited all claim to your friendship of course he was most cordially welcomed and invited to tell the story of his long absence he said i was earning an honest living in a grocers establishment as jobboy after i left the home when the idea took possession of me that i must have more education and i knew the only way i could get it was to go into the country and work for my board where i could go to school i found a kind old farmer who gave me board and lodging for what i could do out of schoolhours on the farm and here i remained for some years then came over me the old longing for music i had kept the little music i knew during my stay at the farm for i had led the sabbath choir and the sundayschool singing and had never missed a sabbath while i was there but i longed for some knowledge of music i felt that i could not live without it and though the kind old farmer offered me good wages if i would remain with him and a generous sum when i should become of age i said i cannot live without music and so i bade adieu to my pleasant home and went to a city where i could hear music my hearts great desire and take lessons as soon as i could earn money enough to pay for them i soon found occupation and now i am earning an honest living he then modestly added perhaps madam you will be gratified to learn that i have never tasted intoxicating drink nor spoken a profane word since i left the home i have never forgotten the first passages of scripture i learned from the little bible you gave me there is not a word in my tongue but lo o lord thou knowest it altogether the little italian beggar now has a wife and a pretty little boy in a comfortable home of his own and his testimony is if i had not been cared for and instructed in that christian home i should be a beggar now as i was when i entered it pansy books probably no living author has

in the united states a work second to that of no publishing house little change can be made in the literary tastes of a generation which is passing off the stage if there are evidences of dangerous tendencies in popular thought or if an infection of the public mind is being spread by unwholesome reading the antidote for all this so far as the future is concerned lies in the protection of the young by providing them with a literature which is at once attractive and wholesome this work was undertaken by d lothrop co years ago with the firm conviction that ultimate success would attend their efforts they have employed the pens of scores of those who have shared their convictions including some of the best known authors at home and abroad and have sent out an ever increasing stream of pure
