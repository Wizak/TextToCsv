presence the door opened and philip andrews came in r s t read the official he was even present at the wedding three thousand dollars chapter i do you know what would happen to him now state your problem the man who was thus addressed shifted uneasily on the long bench which he and his companion bestrode he was facing the speaker and though very little light sifted through the cobwebcovered window high over their heads he realized that what there was fell on his features and he was not sure of his features or of what effect their expression might have on the other man are you sure we are quite alone in this big desolate place he asked it seemed a needless question though it was broad daylight outside and they were in the very heart of the most populated district of lower new york they could not have been more isolated had the surrounding walls been those of some old ruin in the heart of an untraversed desert a short description of the place will explain this they were in the forsaken old church not far from avenue a a building long given over to desolation and empty of everything but dйbris and one or two broken stalls which for some inscrutable reason possibly from some latent instinct of inherited reverence had not yet been converted into junk and sold to the old clothes men by the rapacious denizens of the surrounding tenements perhaps you remember this building perhaps some echo of the bygone and romantic has come to you as you passed its decaying walls once dedicated to worship but soulless now and only distinguishable from the fivestory tenements pressing up on either side by its one high window in which some bits of colored glass still lingered amid its twisted and battered network you may remember the building and you may remember the stray glimpses afforded you through the arched opening in the lower story of one of the adjacent tenements of the churchyard in its rear with its chipped and tumbling headstones just showing here and there above the accumulated litter but it is not probable that you have any recollections of the interior of the church itself shut as it has been from the eye of the public for nearly a generation and it is with the interior we have to do a great hollow vault where once altar and priest confronted a reverent congregation there is no altar here now nor any chancel hardly any floor the timbers which held the pews have rotted and fallen away and what was once a cellar has received all this rubbish and held it piled up in mounds which have blocked up most of the windows and robbed the place even of the dim religious light which was once its glory so that when the man whose words we have just quoted asked if they were quite alone and peered into the dim belumbered corners it was but natural for his hardy resolute and unscrupulous companion to snort with impatience and disgust as he answered would i have brought you here if i hadnt known it was the safest place in new york for this kind of talk why man there may be in this city five men all told who know the trick of the door i unfastened for you and not one of them is a cop you may take my word for that besides but the kids theyre everywhere and if one of them should have followed us do you know what would happen to him ill tell you a story no i wont youre frightened enough already but theres no kid here nor any one else but our two selves unless it be some wandering spook from the congregations laid outside and spooks dont count so out with your proposition mr fellows i chapter ii thousands in that safe no names hoarsely interrupted the other if you speak my name again ill give the whole thing up no you wont youre too deep in it for that but ill drop the fellows and just call you sam if thats too familiar well drop the job im not so keen on it you will be its right in your line sam fellows as he was called was whispering now a hot eager whisper breathing of guilt and desperation if i could do it alone but i havent the wit the experience dryly put in the other well well he exclaimed impatiently as fellows crept nearer but said nothing im going to speak but well then heres how it is he suddenly conceded warned by the others eye the building is a twentystory one chuck full and alive with business the room i mean is on the twelfth floor it is one of five all communicating and all in constant use except the one holding the safe and that is visited constantly some one is always going in and out indeed it is a rule of the firm that every one of the employees must go into that room once at least during the day and remain there for five minutes alone i do it every one does it its a very mysterious proceeding which only a crank like my employer would devise what do you do there nothing im speaking now for myself the others some of the others one of the others may open the safe thats what i believe thats what i want to know about and how its done there are thousands in that safe and the old man being away yes this is all very interesting go on what you want is an artist with a jimmy no no its no such job as that i want to know the person the trusted person who has all those securities within touch its a mania with me i should have been the man im im manager the hoarseness with which this word was uttered the instinct of shame which made his eyes fall as it struggled from his lips wakened a curious little gleam of hardy cynicism in the steady gaze of his listener oh youre manager are you came in slow retort filling a silence that had more of pain than pleasure in it well manager your story is very interesting but by no means complete suppose you hurry on to the next instalment cringing as from a blow fellows took up his tale no longer creeping nearer his wouldbe confederate but if anything edging away chapter iii how does it stand ive watched and watched and watched said he but i cant pick out the man letters come orders are given and those orders are carried out but not by me im speaking now of investments or the payment of large sums anything which calls for the opening of that safe where the old man has stuffed away his thousands small matters fall to my share there is another safe of which i hold the combination childs play but the other it would make both of us independent and yet leave something for appearances but it cant be worked it stands in front of a glass door from which the curtain is drawn every night every passerby can look in if it is opened it must be done in broad daylight and by the person whom the old man trusts by that means only would i get my revenge and revenge is what i want he dont trust me me who have been with him for seven years and drop that it isnt interesting the facts are what i want what kind of safe is it the strangest you ever saw i dont know who made it theres nothing on it to show nor is there a lock or combination but it opens you can just see the outline of a door steel fine steel and not so very large but the contents well take its contents for granted how does it stand on a platform yes one foot from the floor the platform runs all the way across the room and holds other things a table which nobody uses a revolving bookcase and a series of shelves fitted with boxes containing old receipts and such junk sometimes i go through these but nothing ever comes of it he paused as if the subject were distasteful and the safe is opened almost every week im ashamed to tell you the old duffers methods theyre loony but he isnt a lunatic at any rate they dont think so in wall street ill make a guess at his name not yet youll have to swear oh were both in it never mind the heroics its too good a thing to peach on me and the manager i like that take it easy till the jobs done anyway and now ill take a fly at the name its he had the grace to whisper chapter iv stenographers must be counted young fellows squirmed and turned a shade paler if one could trust the sickly violet ray that shot down from the once exquisitely colored window high up over their heads hush he muttered and the other grinned evidently the guess was a correct one no hes no lunatic the professional quietly declared but he has queer ways which of his queers do you object to when his letters come or more often his cablegrams they are opened by me and then put in plain view on a certain little bulletin board in the main office these are his orders any one who knows the cipher can read them i dont know the cipher at night i take them down number them and file them away they have served their purpose they have been seen by the person whose business it is to carry out his instructions and the rest you must guess his brokers know the secret but it is never discussed by us the least word and the next cablegram would read in good plain english fire him ive had that experience ive had to fire three since he went away two months ago thats good why good that cuts out three from your list the person is not among the ones dismissed thats so new life seemed to spring up in fellows youll do the job he cried somehow i never thought of going about it that way and i know another man thats out who myself for one there are only seven more counting all all stenographers included oh stenographers stenographers must be counted well then seven men and one woman our stenographer is a woman what kind of a woman a young girl ordinary but good enough ive never noticed her very much tell me about the men whats the use you wouldnt take my word theyre a cheap lot beneath contempt in my estimation theres not one of them clever enough for the business jack forbush comes the nearest to it and probably is the one the way he keeps his eye on me makes me suspect him or is he too playing my game how can i tell how can i tell anything from what you say ill have to look into the matter myself give me the names and addresses and ill look the parties up get their rating so to speak leave it to me and ill land the old mans confidential clerk heres the list i thought you might want it wheres the girls name the girl oh pshaw put her name down just the same there then grace lee address east street and now swear on the honor of a gentleman beau johnson pulled the rim of fellowss hat over his eyes to suggest what he thought of this demand chapter v ive business with him next day there appeared at the offices of thomas stoughton in nassau street a trim welllooking man who had urgent business with mr fellows the manager he was kept waiting for some time before being introduced into that gentlemans private room but this did not seem to disturb him there was plenty to look at or so he seemed to think and his keen noncommittal eyes flashed hither and thither and from face to face with restless activity he seemed particularly interested in the bookkeeper of the establishment but it was an interest which did not last long and when a neat pleasantfaced young woman rose from her seat and passed rapidly across the room it was upon her his eyes settled and remained fixed with a growing attention until a certain door closed upon her with a sound like a snapping lock then he transferred his attention to the door and was still gazing at it when a boy summoned him to the managers office he went in with reluctance he had rather have watched that door but he had questions to ask and so made a virtue of necessity mr fellows was not pleased to see him he started quite guiltily from his seat and only sat again on compulsion the compulsion of his visitors steady and quelling eye ive business with you mr fellows then the boy being gone which is the room the one opening out of the general office directly opposite this illustration he transferred his attention to the door mr fellows nodded i have just seen one of the employees go in there i should like to see that person come out do you mind talking with this door open i know enough about banking to hold up my end of the conversation fellows rose with a jerk and pushed the door back his visitor smiled easily and launched into a discussion about stocks and bonds interspersed with a few assertions and questions not meant for the general ear as its the girl who is in there not ordinary by any means just the sort an old smudge like stoughton would be apt to trust now whats that singing she often sings ive forbidden it but she forgets she says answered fellows pretty good music listen to that note high as a prima donnas does she sing at her work no id fire her if she did its only when shes walking about or when shes in that room yes at par i buy nothing at par there shes coming i wish i dared intercept her rifle her pockets do you know if she has pockets no how should i fellows youre not worth your salt ah theres a face for you and i can read it like a book did a letter or cablegram come today yes didnt you see it hung up in the outer office i thought i saw something ninetyfive thats a quotation worth listening to three at ninetyfive that girls a trump i will see more of my lady here he took care to shut the door ive been the rounds fellows privatedetective work and all that she is the only puzzler among the group youll hear from me again meanwhile treat the girl well dont spring any traps leave that to me and fellows panting with excitement promised muttering under his breath a woman thats even worse than i thought but well make the old fellow pay for it those securities are ours i already feel them in my hand the sinister twitch which marred the others mouth emphasized the assertion in a way grace lees friends would have trembled to see chapter vi if i could tell you his story that evening a young woman and a young man sat on one of the benches in central park they were holding hands but modestly and with a clinging affection no one appeared in sight they had the moonlight the fragrance of the spring foliage and their true love all to themselves the woman was grace the young man was philip andrews a candideyed wholehearted fellow whom any girl might be proud to be seen with much more to be engaged to grace was proud but she was more than that her heart was all involved in her hope a good heart which he was equally proud to have won yet while love was theirs and the surroundings breathed peace and joy they did not look quite happy a cloud was on his brow and something like a tear in her eye as she spoke gently but with rare firmness philip we must wait one love does not put out another i cannot leave my old father now he is too feeble and much too dependent on me philip you do not know my father you have seen him it is true many many times you have talked with him and even have nursed him at odd moments when i had to be out of the room getting supper or supplying some of his many wants yet you do not know him i know that he is intelligent yes yes that is evident any one can see that and you can see too that he is frequently fretful and exacting as all old people are but the qualities he shows me his strong melancholy but devoted nature quickened by an unusually unhappy life that you do not see and cannot much as you like him and much as he likes you only the child who has surprised him at odd moments when he thought himself quite alone wringing his hands and weeping over some intolerable memory who has listened in the dead of night to his smothered but heartbreaking groans can know either his suffering or the one joy which palliates it if i could tell you his story but that would be treason to one whose rights i am bound to reverence you will respect my silence but you must also take my word that he needs and has a right to all the pleasure and all the hope my love can give him i cannot be with him much my work forbids but the little time i have is his except on rare occasions like this and he knows it and is satisfied were i married but you will wait philip it may not be long he grows weaker every day besides you are not ready yet yourself you are doing wonderfully well but a years freedom will help you materially as it will me every day is adding to our store in a year we may be almost independent grace you have misunderstood me i said that i was no good without you that i needed your presence to make a man of me but i did not mean that you were to share my fortunes now i would not ask that i would be a fool or worse for grace im not doing so well as you think while i knew that my present employment was for a specified time i had hopes of continuing on but this cannot be thats what i have to tell you tonight it looks as if our marriage would have to be postponed indefinitely instead of hastened and i cant bear it you dont know what you are to me or what this disappointment is i expected to be raised not dismissed and if i had had illustration grace you have misunderstood me what the word came very softly and with rare tenderness it made him turn and look at her sweet upturned face with its resources of strength and shy unfathomable smile what she asked again with a closer pressure of her hand you must finish all your sentences with me im ashamed he uttered it breathlessly what am i to say if i had three thousand dollars the stickney company would keep me i have barely three hundred and those are dedicated to you chapter vii im sure that i can get them for you if you had three thousand she repeated it in surprise and yet with an indescribable air which to one versed in human nature would have caught the attention and aroused strange inner inquiries does the stickney company want money so badly as that thats not it they have plainly told me that for three thousand dollars and my services they would give me ten thousand dollars stock interest but insist that the man who assumes the responsibility of the position must be financially interested as well but i havent the money and without the money my experience appears to them valueless i despair of getting another situation in these hard times and grace you dont look sorry because she paused and her fine eyes roamed about her jealous of a listener to her secret but did not pierce the bush which rose up cloudy with blossoms a few feet behind their bench because it is not impossible for you to hope for those thousands i think i am sure that i can get them for you her voice had sunk to a whisper but it was a very clear whisper young andrews looked at her in surprise there was something besides pleasure in that surprise where he asked she hesitated and just at that moment the moon slipped behind a cloud where grace can you get three thousand dollars from mr stoughton he is generous to you he pays you well for what you do for him but i do not think he would give you that amount nor do i think he would risk it on any venture involving my judgment i should not like to have you ask him i should like to rise feeling absolutely independent of mr stoughton i never thought of asking him there is another way id id like to think it over if your scheme is good very good i might be brought to aid you in the way my mind suggests but i should want to be sure she was not looking at him now if she had been she might have been startled at his expression nor could he see her face she had turned it aside grace he prayed dont do anything rash you handle so much money that three thousand dollars may seem very little to you but its a goodly sum to get or to replace if one loses it you must not borrow i will not borrow nor raise it in any way without telling me the sacrifice you must make to obtain it but its all a dream tell me that its all a dream you were talking from your wishes not from any certainty you have say so and i will not be disappointed i do not want your money id rather go poor and wait till the times change dont you see id be more of a man but youd have to take it if i gave it to you and perhaps i shall i want to see you happy philip i must see you happy id be willing to risk a good deal for that im not so happy myself father suffers so and the care of it weighs on me you are all i have to make me glad and when you are troubled my heart goes down down but its getting late dear its time we went home dont ask me whats in my mind but dream of riches im sure they will come you shall earn them with the three thousand dollars you want and which i will give you i shall earn them honestly were the last words he said as they rose from the seat and began to move toward the gate and the moon coming out from its temporary eclipse shone on his clearcut face as he said this but not on her bowed head and sidelong look they were in the shadow there was something else in the shadow as they moved away and disappeared in the darkness the long slim figure of a man rose from behind the bush i have mentioned he had a sparkling eye and a thinlipped mouth and he smiled very curiously as he looked after the pair before turning himself about and going the other way it was not fellows it was his chosen confederate in the nefarious scheme they had planned between them chapter viii i did as you bid me another meeting in the old church but this time at night the somberness of the surroundings was undiminished by any light they were in absolute darkness absolute darkness but not absolute silence noises strange and suggestive but not of any human agency whispered sighed rattled and grumbled from far away recesses the snap of wood the gnawing of rats the rustling of bat wings disturbed the ears of one of the guilty pair till his voice took on unnatural tones as he tried to tell his story to his greedy companion they were again astride the bench and their thin faces were so near that their breaths commingled at times yet fellows felt at moments so doubtful of all human presence that instinctively his hand would go groping out till it touched the others arm or breast when it would fall back again satisfied he was in a state of absolute terror of the darkness the oppressive air the ghostly sounds and possibly of the image raised by his own conscience yet he hugged to himself the thought of secrecy which it all involved and never thought of yielding up his scheme or even shortening his tale so long as the other listened and gave his mind to the problem which promised them thousands without the usual humdrum method of working for them we will listen to what he had to say leaving to your imagination the breaks and guilty starts and moments of intense listening and anxious fear with which he seasoned it i did as you bid me he whispered yesterday fresh orders came from abroad in cipher as usual its an unreadable cipher ive had experts on it many times i had hung it up and though business was heavy my business you know i had eyes for our fair friend and knew every step she took about the offices i even knew when her eyes first fell on the cablegram i had my door open and i caught her looking up from her work and what was more caught the pause in the clickclick of the typewriter as she looked and read if she had not been able to read the clickclick would have gone on for i believe she could work that typewriter with her eyes shut but her attention was caught and she stopped i tell you ive been humiliated for the last time im in for anything that will make that girl step down and out what was that muttered curses from his companion brought him back to his story with a gulp he went on you may bet your bottom dollar that i watched her after that and sure enough in less than half an hour she had gone into the room where the safe is instantly i prepared my coup dкtat i waited just long enough to hear her voice in that one song she sings then i jumped from my seat and rushed to the door shouting miss lee miss lee your father your father making hullabaloo enough to raise the dead and scare her out of her wits for she dotes on that old man and would sell her soul for his sake i do believe great heavens it worked as i live it worked i heard her voice fail on that high upper note of hers and then the sound of her feet staggering slipping over the floor and in another moment the fumbling of her hand on the knob and the slow opening of the door which she seemed to have no power to manage helping her i pulled it open and there beyond her and her white shocked face i saw i saw chapter ix the safe door is opened i cried go on dont be a fool that was nothing i dont know it was like a great sigh at my ear but this is awful couldnt we have one spark of light and have the police upon us the next minute look up at that window you can see it cant you yes yes but very faintly fellows whispered but you can see it so could those outside if we had one glimmer of light in here no no youll have to stand the dark or quit but you shant quit till youve told me what you saw in the room where the safe is the safe door opening his voice trembled so that the other shook him to steady his nerves not opened mind you but opening it was like magic and i stared so that she forgot her fears and forgot her questions turning from me with a startled cry she looked behind her and saw what i saw and tried to push me out ill come ill come she whispered leave me a minute and ill come but i wasnt going to do that the safe door is opened i cried did you do it she didnt know what to say i have never seen a woman in such a state then she whispered in awful agitation yes ive been given the combination by mr stoughton im duly following his orders but my father what about my father you frightened me so i forgot that i waited staring at her but she didnt finish she just asked my father what has happened to him nothing serious i managed to say i wished the old father was in ballyhack but hed served his turn i must say that hed served his turn a telephone message i went on he had had a nervous spell and wanted you i said that you could go home at noon she stood looking at me doubtfully then her eyes stole back to the safe you will have to leave me here for a few minutes she said i have mr stoughtons business to attend to he will not be pleased at my having given away his secret he did not wish it known who controlled his affairs in his absence but now that you do know you will be doing the right thing to let me go on in the way he has planned for me his orders must be carried out she is very determined and understands herself only too well but i am manager and i paid her back in her own coin thats all very well said i but what proof have i that you are telling me the truth you have opened the safe you say you have the combination but people sometimes surprise a combination and open a safe from other interests than those of their employer you seem a good girl but you are a girl and there are men here much more likely to be in mr stoughtons confidence than yourself with that open safe before us i cannot leave you here alone what you take from it i must see and if possible be present at your negotiations that i consider a managers duty under the circumstances mr fellows she asked can you read this mornings telegram no i felt bound to reply then that acquits you i can and again she tried to urge me to go out but i would not be urged i was staring across the room at the open safe and in fancy clutching its contents in fact i made one step toward them but she drew herself up with such an air that i paused shes a big girl you know and not to be fooled with when shes angry come a step farther and i will scream for the watchman she whispered all our talk had been low for there were listening ears everywhere we couldnt risk that and i stepped back immediately she saw her advantage and added if you do not think better of it and leave the room ill scream for answer to this i said that i chapter x i have a scheme what a yell answered him something hit me something hit me yes i hit you and ill hit you again if you dont go on fellows shivered attempted some puerile protest balked and stammeringly obeyed his restless and irritated companion i i said i wasnt such a fool then as i am now that she had lied when she told me that she had the combination there was no combination the safe did not even have a lock the door opened with a spring how had she induced that spring to give way i demanded to know and did she tell you no she merely repeated i will scream and that will cause a scandal which will lead to your discharge not mine so so i came out blast your eyes and when did she come out within five minutes i watched the clock and what did she have nothing in sight i see a deep game but i know a deeper there is no possibility of breaking into that safe by night undetected by the watchman none and that watchman is incorruptible the whole contents of the safe wouldnt move him to connect himself with this job the job must be done by day and during office hours yes and cannot be done without the assistance of this girl youve heard very well i have a scheme now listen to me not even the rat which at that minute nibbled at fellowss boot heel could have heard what followed the panting of two breasts was however audible and when fifty minutes later both crawled out of the cellar window among the rubbish which littered the rear of this once holy place the one was trembling with excitement and the other with fear they parted at the first thoroughfare neither having eyes to see nor hearts to appreciate the touching scene which miles away was taking place in a little flat not very far from harlem an old man frail in body but with a sturdy spirit yet was looking up from his pillow at the loving face of a young girl who was bending over him i cannot sleep tonight he said to her i cannot sleep but that must not disturb you i have so many things to think pleasant things but you have only cares and must rest from them you look very tired tonight tired and worried leave me and sleep i want to see you bright in the morning illustration an old man was looking up at the loving face of a young girl chapter xi she will go in the next day there was a dearth of assistants in the office one was sick one had pleaded a longdelayed vacation two had business for the concern which took them into different quarters of the city and mr beers who was next in authority to mr fellows had been summoned to serve on the grand jury perhaps it was this knowledge that mr beers would be absent which had led to the managers easiness in regard to the others for he had been easy or so miss lee thought when she arrived in the morning and saw the office almost empty however it did not trouble her much on the contrary the quiet and nonsurveillance of the two clerks who did the business of the day seemed rather to elate her and she went about her work copying letters and taking down notes with an alacrity and air of cheerful hope which caused the manager to cast toward her more than one suspicious look from his desk in the adjoining room he was not busy though he had been the first to arrive that morning and he had brought with him a large square package which he had taken into the room which held the safe he pretended to be busy but any one watching him closely would have noticed that his eyes and not his hands were all that were engaged and they were anywhere but on his desk or the letter he appeared to be reading an observer would also have noticed that his nervousness was of the extreme sort and that the trembling which shook his whole body increased visibly whenever his glance fell on the door of mr beerss private room opening at his back no one was supposed to be in that room today and had miss lee not been one minute late this especial morning perhaps there might not have been but in that one minutes grace a man had entered the office who had not gone out again and where could he be if not in that one closed room the room which held the safe was open as usual and many of mr fellowss glances traveled that way he had entered it once only since his first hurried visit of the early morning but only to pull down the shade over the glass in the door communicating with the outside hall this was his usual custom and it attracted no attention why shouldnt he enter it again he thought he would a fascination was upon him the problem he had given beau johnson to solve was to receive a test this day which would make him a rich man or a felon but before that hour why not make his own study his own investigation true he had made these many times before but not with such lights to guide him he might learn but no the very conceit was folly he knew his own limitations else he had not called in the services of this crook he could learn nothing by himself but he might look the place over and see if all was in shape for the great attempt that was only his duty beau johnson had a right to expect that of him if the scrub woman had moved anything at the thought that this possibly might have happened he jumped to his feet and hurried into the outer office but when he turned toward the room of the safe he met miss lees eye fixed upon him with such a keen inquiring look that he faltered in his determination and went in another direction instead she knew that he had no business in that room and she also knew that he knew she knew this any pretense that he had would only rouse her suspicions and these must be lulled to the point of security or she might not enter there herself and on her entering there everything depended almost immediately upon the thought he was back in his seat and the weary moments crept on would she never make her accustomed visit to that room no cablegram had come that morning but she would find some reason for going in of that he had been assured by johnson why he had not been told she will go in beau johnson had said and fellows believed him he believed everything the other said otherwise he could not have gone on with this business but she was very long about it harlowe would be coming back chapter xii a block of steel ah he had an idea it was not his own but for the moment he thought it was he would leave the office himself and thus give her an opportunity to quit her work and shut herself up with the safe but was his mind leaving him there was something to be done first the way must be cleared for the man in hiding to enter that room before she did how was this to be accomplished a dozen suggestions had been given him by his confederate but he had forgotten them all he was in too great a whirl to think yet he must think some way must be found ah he had it taking up the receiver at his side he telephoned to a german friend to call him up in five minutes giving him the number of the telephone in the farthest room this he did in german telling him it was a joke and that he was not to insist upon an answer then he waited in five minutes this farther bell rang calling to miss lee he asked her to answer for him saying he was very busy as she rose he gave a preconcerted signal on the door of mr beerss room as she disappeared in the one beyond the dapper figure of johnson crossed the outer office and slipped into the one holding the safe a minute later she was back reporting the message and getting instructions but the one thing she had to fear had been done the trap had been laid and now for its victim it was not long before that victim responded to the call on the departure of the manager from the room grace lee rose and with a conscious look toward the two clerks slipped across the floor to the open door of the safe room entering she swung to the door which closed with a snap then with just a moment of hesitation in which she seemed to be trying to regain her breath she passed quickly across to the safe and took up her stand before it so directly and so quickly had she done this that she had not seen the slim immovable figure drawn up against the wall at her right behind the projection of a large bookcase nor did any influence for good or evil cause her to turn after she had reached the safe all her thoughts all her hopes all the dreams which she had cherished seemed to be concentrated in the blank eyeless object which confronted her impenetrable to all appearance a block of steel without visible opening an enigma among safes the problem of all problems to every cracksman in town but one which was about to be solved if one could judge from the thrill which now shook her and in shaking her communicated the same excitement to the silent breathless determined man in her rear watching her as the tiger watches the quarry and with the same tiger spring latent in his eye in a moment her secret would be out and then chapter xiii i am from headquarters for just a minute grace lee paused before the blank door of the safe then she passed around to an unused speaking tube in the neighboring wall halting before it in low but distinct tones she began to sing the famous aria from the magic flute all agog with eyes starting and ears alert the man behind listened and watched nothing happened then came a change gradually her voice rose sweet and piercing till it reached that famous f in alt so rarely attempted so exciting to the ear when fairly taken and fairly held grace lee could take it and as it hung sweet and deliciously thrilling in the air beau johnson saw to his amazement though he was in a way prepared for it the heavy safe door slip softly ajar she had done it with her voice how he could only vaguely guess he was better educated than most of his class or he could not have understood it at all as it was he laid it to the vibration caused by a certain definite note acting on some delicate mechanism set in accord with that note which mechanism starting another and a stronger one gradually led up to that which drew the bolts and set the door ajar whether his theory were true or not mattered little at the moment the event for which he waited had been accomplished and accomplished before his eyes to profit by it was his next thought and to this end he held himself ready for the spring which had laid latent in his eyes since he first saw her advance toward the safe she was ignorant of his presence this was evident from the jaunty way she turned from the tube still singing but in a desultory way which showed that her thoughts were no longer on her music but she was not so engrossed that she did not see him the moment that her face turned his way her eyes enlarged her body stiffened her whole personality took on power and purpose and she sprang more quickly than he did and shut the safe door with one quick movement of her hand that fastened it as securely as before then she drew herself up to meet his rush a noble figure of resolute womanhood which any other man would have hesitated to assail but he was proof to any appeal of this kind she had been quicker than he who was esteemed the readiest in his class and he owed her a grudge if only for that smiling it was a way of his when deeply moved or deeply dangerous he accosted her with smooth and treacherous words dont scream young lady screaming will do you no good mr fellows has left the business to me and i am quite competent to manage it i am from headquarters a detective yesterday you aroused the managers suspicions and i was detailed this morning to watch you what do you want from mr stoughtons safe an honest answer may help you nothing else will illustration she was ignorant of his presence i want she hesitated eyeing him over with an insight and an undoubted air of selfcommand which told the hardy rascal that in this woman he was likely to meet his match i want some securities of mr stoughtons which he has ordered me to dispose of for him i am in his confidence as i can prove to you if you will give me the opportunity i have papers at home that will satisfy any one of my right to open this safe and to negotiate such papers as are designated in mr stoughtons cablegrams i dont doubt it the words came easily from the mobile lips of the wily beau johnson but it was not to do mr stoughtons business that you opened the safe just now you have had no orders today you had no order yesterday another purpose is in your mind a personal purpose it is this abuse of mr stoughtons confidence which brings me here you want three thousand dollars badly chapter xiv you do not answer she recoiled strong as she was she was not proof against this surprise how do you know that she asked her voice losing its clear tone i do not deny it but how could you know what i thought to be a secret between you and your lover well we the police know many things young lady we have a gift we also have a kind of foreknowledge i could tell you something of your future if you will deign to listen to me your lover is an honest man what do you suppose he will do when he hears that you have been arrested for attempted burglary on your employers effects he had been slowly advancing as he reeled off these glib sentences but he paused as he met her smile it was not of the same sort as his but it was not without a certain suggestiveness which he felt it would be best for him to understand before he threw off his mask i dont know what he will do said she meeting the false detectives eye as she laid her hand on the safe but i know what i shall do if you carry out the purpose you threaten show my papers to the police and demand evidence of my having any bad intentions in opening this safe this morning i think you will have difficulty in producing any i think that you will only prove yourself a fool are you so strong with the authorities as to brave that astonished at her insight and more than astonished at her selfcontrol the experienced cracksman paused and then in tones he rarely used remarked quietly you are playing with your life miss lee i have a pistol leveled at you from my pocket and im the man to fire if you give me the slightest occasion to do so im beau johnson miss a detective if you please but also a tolerably experienced cracksman and i want a taste of those bonds and mr fellows the words rang out clear and fearlessly oh he hes a muff you neednt concern yourself about him the matters between us two three thousand dollars for you and a little more perhaps for me and i to take all the blame her eye stole toward the door no one could enter that way she knew even her screams if she survived them might alarm but could not bring her help for several minutes if not longer yet she did not tremble only grew a shade paler you do not answer what have you to say this she was like marble now you will not kill me because that would be virtually to kill yourself you cannot leave this room without my help nor fire a shot without being caught like a rat in a trap i want three thousand dollars and i mean to have them but i do not see how you are going to get the few more which you promise yourself certainly i am not going to aid you in doing so and you cannot open that safe you have not the musical training no the word came like a shot possibly in lieu of a shot for if ever he felt murderous it was at that moment i have not a musical training but that does not make me helpless in a few moments i shall have the pleasure of hearing you test your voice again theres the office clock ticking count the strokes she stood fascinated what did he mean by this involuntarily she did his bidding one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven yes he repeated eleven and at half past your old father dies dies her lips did not frame the words her eyes looked it her whole sinking suddenly collapsing figure gave voice to the maddening query dies chapter xv now if fellows will stay away yes such is the understanding if i do not telephone my pals to hold off hes not at home hes with my friends they dont care very much about old men and if i have not a decent show of money by halfpast eleven this morning the orders are to knock him on the head it wont take a very hard knock he was far from being in prime condition this morning she had shown great feeling at the beginning of this address but at its close she drew herself up again and met him with something of her old composure these are all lies said she my father would never leave his house at the instigation of any gang in the first place he is not strong enough to attempt the stairs you cannot deceive me in this fashion he might be carried down he wouldnt submit to that nor would the other lodgers in the house allow it without an express order from me they got the order not from you but from him he demanded to be allowed to go you see mr fellows sent a message that you were hurt i will speak the whole truth and say dying the old man could not be held after that he went with the messenger her cheeks were now like ashes she had gauged the man before her and felt that he was fully capable of this villainy how great a villainy she alone knew who had the history of this old man in her heart he went with the messenger repeated johnson watching her face with a cruel leer that messenger knew where to take him you may be sure it was to a place quite unknown to the police and to every one else but myself five minutes more gone miss in just twentyfive minutes more you will be an orphan and one impediment to your marriage will be at an end how about the other oh she wailed if i could really believe you i can smooth away that doubt if you will promise not to compromise me with the clerks or any one inside there i will allow you to telephone home and learn the truth of what i have told you anything further will end all business between us and wind up your fathers affairs at the hour set i can afford to humor you for ten minutes more in this nonsense i will do it she cried i must know what i am fighting before she caught herself back but he was quite able to finish the sentence for her before you submit to the inevitable he smiled her head fell and he pointed toward the door i will trust you to guard my our interests said he open and go directly to your own telephone with a staggering step she obeyed creeping up stealthily behind her he watched her manner of opening the door and profited by the one quick glance he got of the office as she stepped through and passed hurriedly forward to her desk there was no one within sight mr fellows had not yet returned and the clerks were too remote to notice her agitation or pay attention to her gait or the tremulousness of her tone as she called for her home number couldnt be better thought he now if fellows will stay away long enough ill be able to double the boodle ive promised myself this with a chuckle meantime miss lee had got in her message the answer sent her flying toward him hes gone hes gone she gasped my old old father oh you wretch save him and you save me first he whispered and was about to draw her back into the room with the safe when the outer door opened and a stranger entered on business her agony at the interruption and the few necessary words it involved caused the visitor to stare but she was able to make herself intelligible and to turn him over to one of the clerks after which she rejoined johnson closing the door quietly behind her his greeting was characteristic you waste breath said he by all this emotion youll need it to open the safe what guarantee have i that you will keep your part of the contract she cried i sing the door opens you help yourself and you go that does not restore to me my father oh ill play fair in proof of it heres my pistol if on our going out i do not stop with you at the telephone and let you communicate with your father and send my own message of release then shoot me in the back i give you leave taking the pistol he held out she cocked it and looking into the chambers found they were all full i know how to use it she said simply admiration showed in his face he bowed and pointed toward the tube now for the song he cried chapter xvi it was not paper i meant to have with a bound she took her stand she was white as death and greatly excited watching her curiously the crafty villain noted the quick throbbing of her throat and the feverish grip on the pistol time is galloping he remarked she gave a gasp opened her lips and essayed to sing an awful indescribable murmur was all that could be heard stiffening herself she resolutely calmed down her agitation and tried again the result was but little better than before turning with a cry she looked with horrorstricken eyes into the unmoved slightly sardonic face of the man behind her i cannot sing you have frightened away my voice i cannot raise that note even to save my fathers life im choking choking then as she caught the devilish gleam lighting up his eye she added you will never have those thousands the safe is closed to us both he laughed a very low cautious laugh but it made her eyes distend with uncertainty and dread you fail to do justice to my forethought said he i took this into my calculations i know women they can be wicked enough but they lack coolness let me see now what i can do i cannot sing but i have a little aide de camp which can walking away from her he approached a small table on which stood an object she had never seen in that room before it was covered with a cloth and as he removed this cloth she reeled with surprise then she became still with hope and the rush of fresh and overpowering emotions a graphophone stood revealed one of the finest quality it was set to play the air so often on her lips and in another moment that keen high note rang through the room that and no more it answered slowly softly after one breathless moment the door they both watched with fascinated gaze swung slowly ajar just as they had seen it do at the beginning of this interview and johnson coming forward pulled it open with a jerk and began to fumble among the contents of the safe she could have killed him easily he had forgotten but so had she and there was no one else by to remind her had there been he would have seen a strange spectacle for no sooner had johnsons hand struck those shelves and minute drawers than grace lees whole attitude and expression changed from a terrified incapable woman she became again her old self strong selfcontrolled watchful creeping up behind him she looked over his shoulders as he examined with his quick experienced eye the various papers he drew out noting his anger and growing disappointment as he found them unavailable for immediate use conscious of her presence his rage grew till it shot forth in words not stinting oaths he whirled on her after a moment and asked where the securities were you meant to have them you know where the ready money is show me show me at once or then a great anguish passed across her face a look of farewell to hopes sweet and dearly cherished if he saw it he did not heed all his evil indomitable will shone in the eye he turned up askance at her and though she held the means of killing him in her hand she bowed to that will and leaning over him she whispered in his ear it was not paper i meant to have but but something else i she stopped for breath was leaving her his slim assured hand was straying toward a certain knob hidden partly from sight but plain to the touch if his fingers crept that way listen she was gasping now but her hand laid on his shoulder emphasized her words there are jewels at the other end mrs stoughtons bridal jewels they are worth thousands i i meant to take those they are in a compartment under that lower drawer yes yes there they are take them and be gone i i have lost but you will give me back my father see there are not many minutes left oh be merciful and chapter xvii now for my part of the bargain he was looking at the jewels appraising them making sure they were real and marketable she was looking at them too with a wild longing and a bitter disappointment which he turning at that moment to mark her looks saw and rated at its full value well i guess theyll do he exclaimed pausing in his task of thrusting the gems in his pocket to hand her a bracelet ornamented with one small diamond but i expected more from all this fuss and feathers was it to guard these yes she murmured thrusting the bracelet into the neck of her dress and stepping quickly back they are priceless to the owner associations you know mrs stoughton is dead there that will do now for my part of the bargain and bethinking her at last of the pistol she raised it and pointed it full in his face you will close that door now and send the telephone you promised he rose and banged to the door all right he cried youve behaved well now hide that pistol in your waist and well step into the outer office she did as she was bid and in a moment more they were crossing the floor outside as they did so she noticed that the two clerks had been sent out to luncheon leaving them alone with mr fellows this was not encouraging nor did she like the click which at this moment beau johnson made with his tongue it sounded like a preconcerted signal whether so or not it brought mr fellows from his room and in another instant he was standing with them before the telephone there was a clock over the saferoom door it stood at just twentyfive minutes after eleven hurry she whispered as the other took up the receiver she did not need to say it his own anxiety seemed to be as great as hers but his anxiety was to be gone the nerve which sustained him while the issue was doubtful gave some slight tokens of failing now that his efforts had brought success and only this small obligation lay between him and the enjoyment of the booty he had won at such a risk she was sure that his voice trembled as he uttered the familiar hello and during the interchange of words which followed the strain was perhaps as great on him as on her hello hows the old man she could hear the answer it swept her fears away in a moment well but anxious about the girl shes all right everythings all right take the sick man home and tell him that his daughter will be there almost as soon as he is i must hear my fathers voice it was grace who was speaking i will give a cry that will echo through this building if you do not put me in communication with him at once her hand went out to the receiver the veins on beau johnsons forehead stood out threateningly curse you he muttered but he gave the order just the same hello dont shut off the girls nervous wants to hear her fathers voice have him up two words from him will answer father graces mouth was at the phone no reply she cast one look at johnson theyre getting him on his feet he grumbled his eye was on the door father she called again her voice tremulous with doubt and anxiety a murmur this time but she recognized it its he its he she cried hes safe hes well father but johnson had no time for dillydallying catching the receiver back he took his place again at the phone and shouted a few final injunctions then he faced her with the question are you satisfied she nodded speechless at last and almost breathless from exhaustion he bowed and made for the door as he opened it mr fellows slid forward and joined him both were leaving he as well as johnson she caught the look which the manager threw her as he closed the door behind them there was threat in that look and her heart strings tightened as she stood alone there facing her fearful duty mr fellows was a thief the manager of this concern was even then perhaps walking off with the booty wrenched from her care by the devils own inquisition what should she do send for philip yes that was all her tortured mind could grasp she would send for her own philip and get his advice before she notified the police or sent the inevitable cablegram she was too ill too shaken to do more philip philip she was fainting she felt it and was raising her voice to call in one of the clerks when the outer door opened and mr fellows came in she had not expected him back she had fondly believed that he had gone with his professional comrade and the sight of him caused her to rise again to her feet you she murmured facing him in dull wonder at his renewed look of threat i cannot stay in the same room with you you are chapter xviii what have you done among you never mind me came clearly and coldly from his lips it is of yourself you must think here officer he cried opening the door again and ushering in a man in plain clothes but evidently one of the force this is the young lady i accuse her of taking advantage of her power to open mr stoughtons private safe to steal his jewels her confederate has escaped he had a pistol and i had no means of stopping him but she is right here and you will make no mistake in arresting her the booty is on her and smart as she is she cannot deny that proof with a cry graces hand went up to her throat then she settled into her usual self once more the officer eyeing her asked what she had to say for herself a great deal was her low answer but i shall not say it here if mr fellows will go with me to wherever you take people suspected of what you suspect me i can soon make plain my position but first i should like to send for my friend mr philip andrews he is with the stickney company and he is acquainted with my affairs and the understanding between mr stoughton and myself by which i have access to that gentlemans safe and do much of his private business for him thats all right send for mr andrews if you wish but you mustnt expect to talk to him without witnesses is that your coat and hat yes well put them on mr fellows advanced and whispered something in the officers ear immediately the suspicious look grew in his eyes and he watched her every movement with increased care she saw this and stepped up to him i shall not deny having this piece of jewelry about my person she said drawing the bracelet from its hiding place the man whom mr fellows calls my confederate gave it to me and i took it but it will be hard for him or any one else to prove that it is a theft harder than it will be for me to prove who is the real culprit here and the man whom you ought to arrest watch me but watch him also he is more deserving of your close attention than i am her disdain her poise the beauty which came out on her face when she was greatly stirred gave her a striking appearance at that moment the officer stared then followed her glance toward mr fellows what he saw in him made him thoughtful turning back to miss lee he said kindly enough will you let me have that bracelet she passed it over and he thrust it in his pocket now said he i will go first in a few minutes follow me and go down nassau street a carriage will be at the curb take it as for mr fellows i cannot leave till some of the clerks come in we will all wait till a clerk comes mr fellows paled here is one now the door opened and philip andrews came in illustration the door opened and philip andrews came in oh philip what is this what have you done among you it was no wonder he asked at sight of him grace lee had fainted chapter xix so that was your motive two hours later grace was explaining herself she was still pale but very calm now though a little sad the sadness was not occasioned by any doubt she felt about her father she had telephoned home and learned that he had arrived there and was well and had nothing but good to say of his captors no there was another cause for her manifest depression a cause not disconnected with philip toward whom her eyes ever and anon stole with an uneasy appeal which her mother would have been troubled to see but it comforted fellows who began to regard her threats as idle in face of the evidence of her complicity as afforded by the concealed bracelet the officer on duty was questioning her had she done this and that yes she had why then she told her story the story you have already read as she proceeded with it every eye sparkled under the graphic tale and the police who had some acquaintance with beau johnson recognized his hand in all that she told one face only wore a sneer and that was fellowss but no sneer could discredit a story told with such vim and straightforward earnestness as she mentioned the emptying of the office each person present turned and gave him a look the manager had undertaken a piece of work too big for him his explanations of the presence of the graphophone in this inner office were feeble and contradictory but he had his revenge or thought he had when she came to the jewels she had pointed them out but only to save a worse disaster injury to her father yes and she paused and her voice thrilled in one of the secret drawers she continued there was an immense amount of currency in large denominations the loss of which would cripple the business if not bankrupt mr stoughton his hand was feeling its way along the face of this drawer in another moment he would have discovered the tiny knob by the manipulation of which this drawer opens to save the struggle which would have ensued i directed his attention elsewhere i dont believe i did wrong but you accepted one of these articles as your share do you believe you did right in this yes i will not mention the smallness of the share for that makes the portion saved for the owner of little account yet that portion is saved i wish it had been a larger one no doubt so that was your motive to save this souvenir for mr stoughton casting a proud look at philip she moved a step nearer to the table on which the bracelet lay will you be good enough she asked her interrogator to take up that bracelet and read the initials on the inner side r s t read the official does any one here know mrs stoughtons maiden name evidently not for all remained silent does any one here know my mothers maiden name philip started yes he cried i do her name was rhoda selden titus illustration r s t read the official r s t smiled grace this bracelet was my mothers mr stoughton allowed me to place this keepsake and some other valuables of mine in his private safe gentlemen the whole of those jewels were mine my sole and only fortune i was keeping them for her eyes stole toward philip for my marriage portion the secret and great surprise i had planned for my future husband they are worth some five thousand dollars my mother was the daughter of a wealthy man they would have given us a home if i could have kept them they would also have given my husband a start in business and this i should have preferred but i could not let mr stoughtons securities be endangered and so they had to go philip cannot you forgive me when you think that it was through my folly the secret of the safe became known i forgive you he could not show his feelings but his eyes were eloquent so were fellowss so were those of the various officials you can prove these statements miss lee asked one easily she replied then they turned to fellows chapter xx a jewel of far greater value grace never got back her jewels the wily johnson was not caught though fellows turned states evidence and did all he could to have the professional netted in the same manner as himself but she did not suffer from this loss when mr stoughton learned the full particulars of this daring robbery he made good to her the value of those jewels and the prosperity of this young couple was secured he was even present at the wedding grace wore her mothers bracelet but on her breast was a jewel of far greater value on its back was engraved to brave g l from her grateful friend t s illustration he was even present at the wedding transcribers note changes have been made to the original publication as follows page which for some
