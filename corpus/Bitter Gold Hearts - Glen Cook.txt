 there was nothing to do after i wrapped up the case of the perilous pixies two weeks of living with the dead mans grumblings and mutterings would try the patience of a saint a saint im not worse tinnie was out of town indefinitely and the redhead refused to share me with anyone she didnt know it was a trying time to be alive nothing to do with my evenings but keep the breweries from going into receivership it was early and a devil was doing some blacksmithing in my skull so i wasnt at my best when somebody came pounding on the door of our battered old house on macunado street yeah i snapped when i yanked the door open it didnt matter that the woman was wearing a thousand marks worth of custom cloth or that the street was filled with guys in flashy livery ive seen too much of the rich to be impressed mr garrett thats me i lightened up a little id had a chance to give her the up and down and she was worth a second look and a third and a fourth there wasnt a lot of her though nothing was missing and what was there had been put together quite nicely a phantom smile crossed her lips as my gaze drew north again im half fairy she said and for a moment music broke through the gravity of her voice can you stop gaping long enough to let me in of course can i ask your name i dont recall you being on my appointment calendar though id love to jot you in as often as you want im here on business mr garrett save that for your bar girls she pushed past me a few steps then stopped and glanced back with mild surprise the outside is camouflage i told her we leave it looking like a dump so we dont strain the honesty of our neighbors it wasnt the best section of the city there was a war on and it was hot so there were plenty of jobs available but some of our neighbors hadnt yet given in to the silly notion of personal gain through honest employment we she repeated icily i wanted to consult with you on a matter that requires the greatest discretion dont they all they wouldnt come to me if they thought they could solve their problems through the usual channels you can trust him i replied nodding toward the other room his lips are sealed hes been dead for four hundred years i watched her face go through a series of changes hes loghyr the dead man so she wasnt such a lady after all anybody who knows the dead man has roots solidly anchored in the downhill end of tunfaire yes i think he ought to hear it i get around and hear a lot of things some of them true most of them not id recognized the livery of the stormwarden raver styx outside and thought i could guess what was eating her it would be fun springing her on the heap of motheaten blubber who had become my permanent houseguest no i started toward his room the routine is for me to wake him when i have a business caller not everyone who visits is friendly he can provide powerful backup when the mood hits him what did you say your name was miss i was fishing and she knew it she could have skipped right around it but she hesitated in an odd way before confessing amiranda crest mr garrett this is a critical matter they always are amiranda ill be with you in a minute she didnt walk out it was important enough that she would let herself be pushed he was indulging himself in what had become his favorite pastime trying to outguess the generals and warlords in the cantard no matter that the information he got was scanty out of date and mostly filtered through me he did as well as the geniuses who commanded the armies better than most of those stormwardens and warlords whose main claim to the right of command was heredity he was a mountain of rigid yellow flesh sprawled on a massive wooden chair the works had been moved several times but the flesh hadnt twitched since somebody stuck a knife in it four hundred years ago he was getting a little ragged loghyr flesh doesnt corrupt quickly but mice and whole species of insects consider it a delicacy the wall facing his chair had no doors or windows hed had an artist paint it with a largescale map of the war zone at that moment he had hosts of bugs trooping up and down the plaster landscape recreating recent campaigns trying to discover how the mercenary glory mooncalled had evaded not only the venageti out to destroy him but our own commanders who wanted to catch and leash him before his string of triumphs made them look more foolish and inept than they already did youre awake go away garrett whos winning the ants or the roaches better watch out for those spiders down in the corner theyre sneaking up on your silverfish quit pestering me garrett i have a visitor a prospective client we need a client i want you to hear her outpouring of woe you brought a woman into my house again garrett my good nature has limits wider than the ocean but it does have limits whose house do we have to go back to talking about whos the landlord and whos the squatter the bugs scattered some of them jumped on others thats life in the war zone almost had the pattern he does it with mirrors if there was a pattern the venageti war council would have spotted it months ago finding glory mooncalled isnt a hobby for them its life or death the mercenary was picking them off one by one he had an old score to settle i take it this one is not that redheaded witch of yours tinnie no this one works for the stormwarden raver styx she has fairy blood youll love her at first sight unlike you who loves them all at first sight i am no longer the victim of my flesh garrett there are some advantages to being dead one gains the ability to reason id heard this before several dozen times ill bring her in i stepped out returned to the front room miss crest if youll come with me she glowered even angry she was a gem but there was a quiet desperation in her stance that gave me all the handle i needed amiranda haunter of my dreams please she followed me i think she knew she had no choice ii amiranda crest started shaking when she saw the dead man im used to him and tend to forget the impact he has on those who never have seen a dead loghyr her cute little nose wrinkled she whispered it smells in here well yes it did but not much and i was used to that too ignored the remark this is amiranda crest who comes to us from the stormwarden raver styx please pardon me for not rising miss crest i am capable of mental prodigies but selflevitation is not among them meantime amiranda blurted oh no not from the stormwarden shes in the cantard her secretary the domina willa dount sent me im her assistant she wants you to see her about something she wants you to do mr garrett for the family discreetly then youre not going to tell me what it is i dont know what it is i was told to give you a hundred marks gold and tell you there is a thousand more if youll do the job but the hundred is yours if youll just come and see her she lies garrett she knows what it is about he wasnt paying the rent with that she had changed strategies while i was alerting the dead man thats all nothing to tell me why im sticking my neck out she had begun counting tenmark gold pieces into her left hand i was startled id never met anyone with fairy blood who was righthanded save yourself the trouble miss crest if thats it ill stay here and help my friend hustle cockroaches she thought was joking a man of my class turning his back on a hundred marks gold a man in my line i ought to be sprinting uptown to find out who they wanted killed chances were she had run uptown bartering her good looks for the pretty things she wore she asked couldnt you just take me on faith and for the gold the last time i trusted somebody from up the hill i got stuck in the marines i spent five years trying to kill venageti conscripts who didnt know any better than i did what we were fighting about i didnt figure that out till i came back home and then i liked your lords and ladies of the hill even less good day miss crest unless youd be interested in some more personal business i know a little place that serves seafood you could kill for i watched her think it over looking for angles she could use finally she said domina will be very angry with me if i dont bring you how sad but thats not my problem if you dont mind your boys out front are probably baking in the sun anyway she stomped out of the room snarling youre throwing away the easiest hundred marks of your life mr garrett i followed her to make sure she used the door for its intended purpose if your boss wants to see me so bad tell her to come down here she paused opened her mouth to say something then shook her head and slipped outside i caught a glimpse of the sweltering guards jumping to their feet before the door closed i went back to the dead man you were a little stubborn were you not shell be back know but what temper will possess her maybe shell be ready to lay it out straight without the games she is a female garrett why do you persist in such unreasonable optimism where that alien species is concerned this was one of our running arguments he was a misogynist to the marrow this time i refused to play he gave up are you interested in the job garrett my heart wont be broken if it doesnt develop you know i told the truth when i said i dont have much use for the lords of the hill and i particularly have no use for sorcerers we dont need the money anyway you always need money garrett the way you drink beer and chase skirts he exaggerated of course his envy was talking his single greatest regret about being dead was his inability to guzzle beer someone is hammering on the door i hear it its probably old dean early for work the dead man would not endure a female housekeeper and my tolerance for housework is minimal id only been able to find one old man who moved with the flash and style of a tortoise willing to come in pick up cook and clear the vermin from the dead mans room i was surprised to find amiranda back already quick trip come in i didnt know i was so irresistible she strode past me then turned hands on hips all right mr garrett you get it your way the reason domina wants you is because my because the stormwardens son karl has been kidnapped if you insist on getting more than that were both out of luck because thats all ive been told and you certainly are worried about it i thought she started for the door hold it i squinted at her give me the hundred she handed it over without a smirk of triumph one point for amiranda crest i decided she might be worth liking ill be back in a minute i took the gold to the dead man there was no safer place on earth you heard did what do you think kidnapping is your area of expertise i rejoined amiranda crest let us fair forth fair fairy lady that failed to put a smile on her face not everyone appreciates a great sense of humor iii we marched off like a parody of a military outfit amirandas companions were clad in uniforms that seemed to be the limit of their familiarity with the military concept at a guess i would have said their only use was to keep their livery from collapsing into the dust i tried a few conversational sallies amiranda was done talking i was one of the hired help now the dead man was right kidnapping was my area of expertise mostly by circumstance time and again i get stuck doing the inbetween each time i deliver the ransom and bring the body home alive the word gets around a little more both sides in a swap know where they stand with me i play it straight no tricks and heaven help the bad boys if they deliver damaged goods and my principals want their heads which they always do in that case i loathe kidnapping and kidnappers abduction is a major underground industry in tunfaire id as soon see all kidnappers sent down the river floating facedown but sound business practice makes me play the game by liveandletlive rules unless they cheat first the hill is a good deal more than a piece of high ground looking down its nose at the sprawl of tunfaire the beast upon whose back it rides it is a state of mind and one i dont like but their coin is as good as any down below and they have a lot more of it i register my disapproval by refusing jobs that might help the hill tribe close their grip even tighter on the rest of us usually when they try to hire me its because they want dirty work done i turn them down they find somebody less morally fastidious so it goes the stormwarden raver styxs place was typical of those on the high hill it was huge tall walled brooding dark and just a shade more friendly than death it was one of those places with an invisible abandon hope sign over the gateway maybe there were protective spells involved i got a strong case of nerves the last fifty feet the little watchman inside telling me i didnt want to go in there i went anyway one hundred marks gold can shout down the watchman any time the inside reminded me of a haunted castle there were cobwebs everywhere amiranda and i after shedding our escort were the only people tracking the shadowed halls cheerful little bungalow where is everybody the stormwarden took most of the household with her but she left her secretary behind yes which told me there was some truth in the things id heard about the stormwardens husband and son both named karl put charitably they needed a shepherd at first glance willa dount looked like a woman who could keep them in line her eyes could chill beer and she had the charm of a stone i knew a little about her from whispers in the shadows and alleys she arranged dirty deeds done for the stormwarden she was about five feet two early forties chunky without being fat her gray eyes matched her hair she dressed shall we say sensibly she smiled about twice as often as the man in the moon and then without sincerity amiranda said mr garrett domina the woman looked at me like i was either a potentially contagious disease or an especially curious specimen in the zoo one of the uglier ones like a thunder lizard there are times when i feel like i belong to one of the dying breeds thank you amiranda have a seat mr garrett the mister left her jaws aching she wasnt used to being nice to people like me i sat so did she amiranda hovered that will be all amiranda domina that will be all amiranda left furious and hurt i scanned the clutter on the secretarys desk while she glared the girl from the room what do you think of our amiranda mr garrett again she got a jaw ache i tried putting it delicately a man could dream dreams about a woman with her im sure she scowled at me i had failed some test i didnt care id decided i wouldnt like the domina willa dount very much you had a reason for asking me to come here how much did amiranda tell you enough to get me to listen she tried to stare me down i stared back i dont usually have much grief to spare for uptown folks when the fates want to stick them i say more power to them but to kidnapping i take exception she scowled i give the woman this her scowl was first rate any gorgon would have been proud to own it what else did she tell you that was it and getting it took some work maybe you can tell me more yes as amiranda told you the younger karl has been abducted from what ive heard there arent many more deserving guys around karl junior had a reputation for being twentythree going on a willful and very spoiled three there was no doubt which side of the family junior favored domina dount had been left to keep it civilized or to cover it up willa dounts mouth tightened until it was little more than a white point be that as it may we arent here to exercise your opinions of your betters mr garrett what are we here for the stormwarden will be returning soon i dont want her to walk into a situation like this i want to get it settled and forgotten before she arrives do you wish to take notes mr garrett she pushed writing materials my way i figured she supposed me illiterate and wanted to enjoy feeling superior when i confessed it not till theres something worth noting i take it youve heard from the kidnappers that you know junior hasnt just gone off on one of his adventures by way of answering me she lifted a ragwrapped bun die from behind the desk and pushed it across this was left with the gateman during the night i unwrapped a pair of silverbuckled shoes a folded piece of paper lay inside one his yes the messenger what you would expect a street urchin of seven or eight the gateman didnt bring me the bundle till after breakfast by then the child was too far ahead to catch so she had a sense of humor after all i gave the shoes the full eyeball treatment it never works out but you always look for that speck of rare purple mud or the weird yellow grass stain that will make you look like a genius i didnt find it this time either i unfolded the note we have yore karl if you want him back you do what yore told dont tell nobody about this you be told what to do later a snippet of hair had been folded into the paper i held it to the light falling through the window behind the secretarys desk it was the color i recalled juniors hair being the few times i had seen him nice touch this willa dount gave me another of her scowls i ignored her and examined the note the paper itself told me nothing except that it was a scrap torn from something else possibly a book i could go around town for a century trying to match it to torn pages but the handwriting was interesting it was small but loose confident the penmanship almost perfect not in keeping with the apparent education of the writer you dont recognize this hand of course not that neednt concern you anyway when did you see him last yesterday morning i sent him down to our warehouse on the waterfront to check reports of pilferage the foreman claimed it was brownies i had a feeling he was the brownie in the woodpile and he was selling the stormwardens supplies to somebody here on the hill possibly even to one of our neighbors its always reassuring to know the better classes stand above the sins and temptations of us common folks you werent concerned when he didnt come home i told you im not interested in your social attitudes or opinions save them for someone who agrees with you no i wasnt concerned he sometimes stays out for weeks hes a grown man but the stormwarden left you here to ride herd on him and his father and you must have done the job till now because there hasnt been a hint of scandal since the old girl left town one more scowl the door sprang open and a man stomped into the room willa has there been any more word about he spotted me and pulled up his eyebrows crawled halfway up his forehead a trick for which he was famous to hear some tell it that was his only talent who the hell is that he was renowned for being rude too though among people of his class that was a trait the rest of us expected iv willa dount spoke up there hasnt been anything yet i expect we wont be contacted for a while she looked at me her expression making that a question they like to let the anxiety level rise before they come after you it makes you more eager to cooperate this is mr garrett she said mr garrett is an expert on kidnappers and kidnappings my god willa are you mad they said dont tell anybody she ignored his outburst mr garrett this is the stormwardens consort the baronet dapena the father of the victim how he twitched and jerked without changing her tone or expression domina dount had hit him with a fat double shot calling him consort and mentioning his baronetcy she may even have gotten in a sly third shot there if as you sometimes heard whispered junior wasnt really a seed fallen from the senior how do you do lord he has a good question domina id been working up to it when he burst in why bring me in when the kidnappers said dont tell anybody a man with my reputation and you sent out what amounted to a platoon of clowns with the girl dressed flashy enough to catch a blind mans eye its not likely the kidnappers wont hear about it that was the point i want them to willa karl be quiet im explaining to mr garrett he turned white he was furious shed made it clear who stood where who was in charge in front of a lowlife from down the hill but he contained himself i pretended blindness it isnt smart to see things like thatwilla dount said i want them to know ive brought you in mr garrett why for young karls sake to improve his chances of getting through this alive would you say theyre less likely to harm him if they know about you if theyre professionals professionals know me if theyre not chances are theyll go the other way you may have moved too soon time will tell it seemed the best bet to me exactly what do you want me to do nothing she blindsided me there what youve done what i needed you to do youve been seen coming here to confer with me youve lent me your reputation hopefully karls chances have been improved thats it thats it mr garrett do you think a hundred marks adequate recompense for the loan of your reputation it was fine with me but i ignored the question what about the payoff usually they want me to handle that for them i believe i can handle that its basically a matter of following instructions isnt it explicitly the payoff is when theyre most nervous thats when youll have to be most careful for your own safety as well as the boys senior snorted and huffed and stamped wanting to get his hand into the action willa dount kept him quiet with an occasional touch of her icicle eyes i wondered what the stormwarden had left her in the way of leashes and whips she sure had the old boy buffaloed karl senior was still a handsome man though he was running away from forty if he had not already sneaked past fifty time had dealt him a few wrinkles but no extra pounds his hair was all there curly and slickly black the kind that might not start graying for another decade he was a little short i thought but that didnt hold him back he looked like a fancy man and word was that he did night work best age had apparently not slowed him down those looks a smooth tongue his toy title those magical eyebrows and soulful big blue eyes all conspired to drop into his lap the sort of soft morsels we ordinary mortals have to scheme and fight just to get near it was a certainty he was no use in a crisis he danced and twitched like a desperate kid awaiting his turn at the loo he would have panicked if domina dount would have let him he was a member of the royal house those wonderfully firm and decisive folks who had blessed the karentine people with their war against the venageti natural son or not karl junior was a seed that had not fallen far from the tree he was the image of karl senior in body and character and to that menace to feminine virtue he had added a generous helping of arrogance based on the fact that his mommy was the stormwarden raver styx and he was her precious one and only whose misdeeds would never be called to account senior didnt like my being there maybe he didnt like me if so the feeling was mutual ive been busting my butt since i was eight and i dont have any use for drones of any sort and those from the hill least of all their idleness got them into the kind of mischief that resulted in sending a whole generation south to fight over the silver mines of the cantard maybe glory mooncalled would turn on his karentine employers once he polished off the venageti warlords it wouldnt hurt i said if youve had your way with me then ill be running along best of luck getting the boy back her expression said she doubted my sincerity you can find your way to the street i learned scouting when i was in the marines good day then mr garrett karl senior exploded the second i closed the door it was a good door i couldnt decipher his yells even when i put my ear to the wood but he was having a good time working the panic and frustration out v amiranda caught me just before i reached the gate i caught my breath then chewed on my tongue a little so i could still fake being a gentleman shed changed from the show ensemble shed worn to fetch me and now in her every days looked like something i find only under the covers of midnight fantasies she looked good but she also looked worried i told myself this was no time for one of my routines my sometimeassociate morley dotes tells me im a sucker for a damsel in distress he tells me many things about myself most of them wrong and unwelcome but he has me on the damsels a goodlooking gal turns on the tears and garrett is a knight ready to tilt with dragons what did she say mr garrett what does she want you to do she said a lot of not much at all what she wants me to do is nothing i dont understand did she look disappointed i couldnt tell im not sure i do either she said she wanted the kidnappers to see me around the edges of the thing so my reputation will shade him and maybe give him a better chance oh maybe shes right she looked relieved i wondered what her stake was id formed a suspicion and didnt like it so do you think hell be all right mr garrett i dont know but domina dount is a formidable woman i wouldnt want her on my back trail a blackhaired looker of the late teens or early twenties variety left a doorway about thirty feet away caught sight of us gave me a onceover she followed up with a comeandgetit smile then walked off with a sway to still the tumult of battles who was that i asked you neednt pant mr garrett youd be wasting your time you dont dare touch her with your imagination thats the stormwardens daughter amber i see yes hmmm amiranda placed herself in front of me put your eyes back in mister you made a big show of wanting to see me outside of all this all right tonight at eight at the iron liar the iron liar im not from uptown how could i afford i had to put that excuse away this was the same little gem that had counted the hundred gold marks into my paw a couple hours ago eight then ill spend the rest of the day breathless with anticipation i smiled smugly after i hit the street i wandered down the hill wondering why id never heard of daughter amber when the stormwarden and her family played such a big part in tunfaires news and gossip we had obviously been missing the best part vi strange noises were coming from the dead mans room i went into the kitchen where old dean was cooking sausages over charcoal with one eye on an apple pie that was about ready to come out of the oven when he saw me he began hoisting a pony keg out of the cold well id had installed with the proceeds of the starke case by damn i was going to have cold brew whenever the whim hit while i could afford it dean asked a good day today mr garrett as he drew me a mug interesting i tipped my head back and swallowed a pint and profitable whats he up to in there ive never heard him make such a racket i dont know mr garrett he wouldnt let me in to clean well see about that after i wrap myself around another one of these i eyed the sausages and pie if he expected me to eat that much he was more optimistic than i thought did you invite a niece over again he reddened i just shook my head and said i have to go out this evening part of the job there was a little troll blood on all sides of his family i dont have any particular prejudices who was going out with a partfairy girl but those poor women had gotten a double dose of the troll ugly from their parents like they say personality plus but horses shied and dogs howled when they passed i wished old dean would stop matchmaking i had given up hope that he would run out of eligible female relatives to parade past me three sausages two pieces of the worlds best apple pie and several beers later i was ready to beard the loghyr in his den so to speak food fit for the gods as usual dean im going in after him if im not out by the weekend send saucer head tharpe to the rescue his skull is so thick hed never know old bones was thinking at him i thought about recommending saucer head to deans eligibles but no i couldnt i liked saucer head the dead man sensed me coming get away from here garrett i went on in it was war in the cantard again and this time the god of the wall had all the hordes of bug dom enlisted in his enterprise it was the combined racket of their creepy little feet and wings that i had been hearing caught him yet he ignored me that glory mooncalled is a tricky bastard isnt he i wondered if he meant to clean up the entire bug population of tunfaire for a service like that we should find some way to get paid he ignored me his bugs got busier i sat in the only chair available to me and watched the campaign for a while he was experimenting not recreating it was no campaign i recognized maybe he was even making war upon himself the loghyr can section up their brains into two or three discrete parts when they want had an interesting day today he didnt respond he was going to punish my impertinence by pretending i didnt exist but he was listening the only adventures he truly had were the ones lived for him i gave him all the details chronicling even the most trivial somewhere down the line i might have to call on his genius i finished and watched him play general for a while i got the feeling there was a hidden pattern that i was too dense to see it was nearing time to meet amiranda i pried myself from the chair and headed for the door see you when i see you old bones garrett if you get lucky dont you bring her back here i will not endure such foolishness in my house i seldom did though occasionally circumstances insisted it seemed too much like mocking his handicap in life the loghyr are as randy as a pack of seventeen yearold boys it was my suspicion that his misogyny was his way of compensating i was almost out the door when he sent garrett be careful i am careful always when im paying attention and when i figure i have something to worry about but how do you get into trouble just walking up the block to buy a bottle of stinkpretty from the neighborhood chemist believe me it can be done it was my lucky day in more ways than one i smelled weed smoke and that got me curious not many in the neighborhood use weed and this was less of a cloud than a minor storm i started looking for the source source was five breeds all with a lot of ogre in them ogres are not fast at the best of times and these boys had spent their take getting so high their pointy heads were bumping the belly of the sky their professional sins were legion they hadnt done their homework either one asked me your name garrett who wants to know i do its him lets do it i did it first i kicked the nearest in his daydreams spun and punched another in the throat then tripped over my own damned big feet the first guy bent over and started puking the second lost interest and wobbled away holding his throat and sucking air i rolled and legwhipped another one catching him by such surprise that he fell on his back without trying to break his fall his head bounced off the street lights out it was a good start i began thinking i might make it without getting hurt the other two stood around trying to get their muggy brains untangled i got in the finishing licks on the two i had hit already a crowd began gathering the last two decided to get on with the job they closed in they were more careful i was faster but they took advantage of superior numbers to keep me boxed we waltzed for a while i got in a few hits but its hard to hurt guys like that when you cant get in a sucker punch they got a few in on me too the third such blow murdered my optimism it left me seeing double and concentrating my considerable intellect on the ageold question which way is up one of them started saying something about me staying away from the stormwardens family while the other wound up to finish me off i grabbed a big gnarly walking stick from an old bystander and smacked the one between the eyes before he could unwind i went after the talker while the fighter was seeing stars and his hitting arm was flaccid yaketyyak did a good job holding me off stick and all until i got in a whack that broke his arm he was ready to call it quits so was i the bystanders were scattering i returned the old guys stick and scattered myself what passed for minions of law and order in tunfaire were coming i didnt want to get hauled in and charged with intent to commit selfdefense which is about the way the law worked when it worked at all i left the ogre boys trying to figure out what had happened my lucky day indeed the dead man was all enthusiasm when i told him about the incident he gave me a good mental grumble about wishing the ogres had been a little more competent but when i was about to leave to get washed up and changed he sent told you to be careful i know and im going to keep that a little more closely in mind watch the cockroaches theyre about to flank the silverfish at yellow dog mesa he detached a part of his attention from his war and used it to levitate and throw a small stone loghyr cult figure it smacked the other side of the door as i shut it i decided to ease up when he gets that irritable hes hot on the spoor of a solution to a problem that has been bugging him for a long time vii amiranda was waiting and looking uncomfortable when i got to the iron liar i wasnt late she was early in my experience a woman on time is a rarity to be treasured i didnt remark on it she asked what happened to you you look like you were in a fight first prize to the lady you should see the other guys she seemed excited by the idea of my getting into a fight point taken away from amiranda crest i tried the story on her just to see how she would react she appeared befuddled and frightened but got control quickly why would the kidnappers do that i dont know it doesnt make sense then i turned to more interesting subjects notably amiranda crest how did you get hooked up with the stormwarden i was born to it what my father was a friend of her father they worked together sometimes the brain had to run some numbers before i could say anything more the stormwardens father had died before i was born fairy folk lived a long time and aged slowly could this morsel be old enough to be my mother im twentyone garrett i gave her the famous garrett raised eyebrow ive gotten too damned many of those glassyeyed stares when human men suddenly realize theres a chance i might be older more knowledgeable and more experienced than they are sometimes it turns into panic or terror i apologized where i was guilty then told her you jump to too many conclusions i suspect the reactions you get dont have anything to do with how old you might be youre molahlu crests daughter even though hes gone his reputation lingers and its got to hang on you like a shroud people have to wonder if the wickedness is in the blood most people have never heard of molahlu crest i didnt answer that if she wanted to believe it which she did not for a moment let her it could be her way of coping with a difficult ancestry the stormwardens father and molahlu crest had clawed their ways up from the bottom of the hill the former riding a talent for sorcery the latter an absence of conscience or compassion a corduroy road of bodies was their route to the heart of the circles of power they had been takers and breakers and killers and the only good thing anyone ever said about either was that they had remained true friends from beginning to end neither greed nor hunger for power had come between them which is something how many friends do any of us have that we can count on forever molahlu crest they say had a small talent for sorcery himself and that had made him doubly deadly in the old days everyone in tunfaire was scared of him from the richest and most powerful to the least of the waterfront bums no one knows what happened to molahlu crest but the conventional wisdom is that the stormwarden raver styx got rid of him i wondered if amiranda knew differently after a while in my business professional curiosity becomes habitual curiosity then you have to watch yourself so you dont stick your nose in everywhere you can get it mashed and have nothing to show for your trouble but a cauliflower schnoz we talked of light things and she began to relax i splurged and ordered the tunfaire gold with our meal it helped its a cynical device but i have yet to encounter the woman who wont loosen up if you buy the gold the wines reputation is such that your buying it makes them feel theyre something special i like the gold better than any other wine but to me it is still spoiled grape juice with a winy taste im a beer man born i dont begin to pretend to understand wine snobs to me even the best is nasty when the mood was better i asked there been any more word from the kidnappers not when i left i think domina would have let us know that much why are they waiting so long to get everybody so worried theyll do whatever it takes to get junior back tell me about him is he really the kind of guy they say he is her expression became wary i dont know what they say about him his name is karl not junior i pecked at her from a couple directions she gave me nothing why are you asking so many questions garrett you did what you were paid for already didnt you sure just curiosity its an occupational hazard ill try not to be a nuisance i wondered about her she was a woman with troubles very much turned inward not my usual sort but i found myself interested in her for her own sake odd the meal ended she asked what now evil plans me never im one of the good guys i know a guy who runs a place you might find interesting since youre slumming you want to give it a try im game for anything but going back to that she was trying to be pleasant company and to have a good time but she was having to work at it thank heaven for tunfaire gold to support my naturally irresistible charm morleys place was jumping as much as it ever does which means it was packed with dwarfs elves trolls goblins pixies brownies and whatnot along with the curious specimens you get when you crossbreed the races the boys looked at amiranda with obvious approval and at me with equally obvious distaste but i forgave them i would be sullen and sour too if i was in a place where the drinks were nonalcoholic and the meals left out everything but the rabbit food i went straight to the bar where i was known and my presence was tolerated i asked the bartender wheres morley he indicated the stairs with a jerk of his head i went up amiranda followed wary again i pounded on morleys door and he told me to come in he knew it was me because there was a speaking tube running from the bar upstairs we stepped inside for a rarity morley did not have somebodys wife with him he was doing accounts he looked worried but his beady little eyes lit up when he saw amiranda down boy shes taken amiranda this is morley dotes he has three wives and nine kids all of them locked up in the bledsoe mad ward he owns this dump and sometimes he acts like hes a friend of mine morley dotes was a lot more to those who knew the underside of the city he was its top physical specialist meaning for enough money he broke heads and arms though he preferred ladies hearts he did that for free he was half human half dark elf with the natural slightness and good looks of the latter he wasnt what i would call a close friend he was too dangerous to get close to he had worked with and for me a few times dont you believe a word this thug tells you morley said he couldnt tell the truth if he got paid for it and hes a dangerously violent psychotic just this afternoon he whipped up on a bunch of ogres who were minding their own business hanging out on the street smoking weed you heard about that already news travels fast garrett know anything about it i figured youd be around i asked some questions i dont know who hired the ogres i know them theyre secondraters too lazy and stupid to do a job right you might keep a watch out over your shoulder you hurt a couple of them bad the others might not consider that a simple hazard of the business i have been watching you could pay back a favor when we leave by taking a look at the guy whos following us somebodys following us amirandas question squeaked she was frightened he was with us from the iron liar here he wasnt on me before that maybe he picked us up there but the implication is that he was on you all along she got pale get her a chair dope morley said you have the manners and sensitivity of a lizard i got her into a chair not without a glare for morley the man was bird dogging making his points for the time amiranda and i went our own ways not that i blamed him was developing the feeling that she was worth it on mainly intuitive evidence id decided she was a class act what are you into this time garrett morley retreated to his chair came up with a flash of brandy from somewhere behind his desk he held it up questioningly i nodded he produced a single cup he knew i preferred beer he didnt touch alcohol himself i was mildly surprised that he would have it in his place for his ladies i supposed i took the cup and passed it to amiranda she sipped im sorry im being silly i should have known it wouldnt be as simple as morley and i exchanged glances while pretending we hadnt heard her murmur morley asked is it a secret garrett i dont know is it a secret amiranda might be worth telling him it wont go any farther if thats what you want and he might do you some good down the line i raised a fist to morleys smirk silently cursing myself for that brilliant choice of words amiranda pulled herself together not a girl for the traditional waterworks i liked that i was liking amiranda more all the time damsels in distress were fine and good for business but i was tired of the kind who clung and whined much better the woman who got up on her hind legs and stood in there punching with you after she put you on the job though in this case i didnt have a job strictly speaking i had a dispute with somebody who sent ogres around to thump on me amiranda thought a bit and made a decision she told the kidnapping story she told it so damned good i smelled a rat she told morley exactly what i knew and not an iota more or less its not a pro job morley said have you gotten yourself into something political garrett amiranda looked startled why do you say that two reasons theres nothing shaking in the kidnapping business right now and the pros wouldnt touch that family raver styx may not look as nasty as her father and molahlu crest but she is in her own quiet way nobody who lives on the underside of tunfaire society would think the potential payoff worth the risk amateurs i said amateurs with enough money to hire head crackers and tails garrett that means uptown and when uptown does dirty deeds its always political maybe im not so sure it dont have that stink ill wait before i make up my mind theres something cockeyed in the whole mess but i cant see where the profit lies that would clear it up but im not on a job and looking im just trying to watch out for me and amiranda morley said ill peek in the closets and look under the beds and get back to you tomorrow least i can do after the stunt i pulled in that vampire business you still living with the dead man yeah youre weird let me get back to work he grabbed his end of the tube connecting with the bar wedge send alan and sarge and the puddle up here i shepherded amiranda toward the door see you we went down and out easing past three highclass bone crushers headed up i call them highclass because they looked smart enough to be trusted with work more intellectually demanding than skull busting my old buddy saucer head tharpe had come in downstairs while we were up he wanted me to join him for a pitcher of carrots blood and some yakking up old times but i begged off we had to keep moving if morley was going to do us any good i told amiranda you ever feel like you need protecting you come down here and hire saucer head tharpe hes the best there is what about the other one morley do you trust him with my money or my life but never with my woman its getting late id better get you home i dont think im going home garrett unless you insist all right i do like a woman who can make up her mind even though i may not understand what she is doing the dead man would have fits but that was all right what did he live for but to chew me out and to march his bugs around the walls only one thing further about that night needs to be reported when we were slipping into bed i noted the absence of a gewgaw worn by every woman who doesnt want to hear little voices piping mommy wheres your amulet youre a gentleman in your heart arent you garrett most men would have pretended not to notice i dont often get caught without something to say this was one of those rare times i kept my mouth shut she slipped in beside me warm and bare and whispered you dont have to worry i cant make you a father and of that night nothing more need be said she was gone when i awoke the next morning i never saw her again viii morley himself stopped by to let me know what hed learned old dean let him in and brought him to the overconfident closet i call an office i didnt rise and i didnt offer the usual banter dean went off to the kitchen to get morley some of the apple juice we keep in the cold well against those millennial moments when i dont feel like having beer you look glum garrett it happens the strain of being mr smiles catches up well you may have good reason even though you dont know it yet i showed him my eyebrow trick he wasnt impressed everyone knows what familiarity breeds i put out feelers that touched everybody in the snatch racket nobody has gone underground nobody is scoping out a job on the hill i got the personal guarantee of some of the best and the worst that theres nobody in this burg crazy enough to go for the stormwardens kid not for a million in gold gold dont do you any good when youre getting your toes roasted in the sorceresss basement thats whats supposed to give me a sour puss no you get that when i tell you about the guy who was tailing you last night or your lady actually you should have told me she was amiranda crest garrett i wouldnt have made remarks about her father shes used to it what about the tail he trotted right down here after you not even thinking somebody might be following him too fool he hung around watching the place for a couple of hours about the time even a moron would have figured out that she was spending the night he took off and headed dean stuck his head in through the doorway excuse me mr garrett theres a mr slauce here to see you representing somebody he calls the domina dount will you see him i can wait morley told me out that door i indicated the closets second exit which opened on a hallway leading past the dead mans room bring mr slauce in dean slauce was a blustery potbellied redfaced little man who was way out of his element i think he had me pegged for a professional killer he worked hard at being polite it was obvious he wasnt accustomed to that mr garrett i confessed that i was that very devil domina dount would like to see you again she said to tell you shes received another letter from her correspondent and would like further professional advice i assume you understand what she means she didnt explain to me i know what she meant she authorized me to offer you ten marks gold for your time i wondered what she really wanted she was throwing one hell of a lot of money around a laborer if he got paid in a lump for the time wouldnt draw ten marks gold for three months of his life and right now gold was strong because glory mooncalleds successes in the cantard had put several more silver mines into karentine hands meaning all their production came north willa dount might want to climb my leg about amiranda for ten marks i would take what she wanted to hand out there is never enough money around our place because of the endless fixups leave word at the gate that im on my way ill be there as soon as i take care of a few details and have lunch slauces ruddy face got redder the nerve of me i was supposed to frog when uptown said jump he wanted to drag me off by the heels but his instructions held very well im sure she would appreciate your taking as little time as possible she did seem distracted he counted five twomark pieces onto my desk i wont be more than a half hour behind you dean will you see mr slauce to the door we like to know that our guests are out when they head out some of them are so slow they might not remember which side of the door theyre supposed to be on when it shuts morley returned to the room better bite those things to see if theyre real garrett somebodys running a game how so thats the guy who was tailing your lady last night yeah he looked taller in the dark maybe he was wearing platforms i think its time you thought about getting out of this im not in it i know you garrett youre going to get into it up to your ears if you dont turn your back now morley is usually not much shakes as a prophet i paid him no mind thanking him and telling him the favor was a chunk off the account he owed from the vampire business i saw him out then let dean serve me lunch then i ambled off to earn my ten gold marks ix willa dount was piqued by my churlish failure to bounce when she hollered but she hid it well everybody but the dead man was hiding irritation with me i decided id best keep my hands covering my pockets thank you for coming mr garrett your man said youd heard from the kidnappers yes another letter delivered much like the first she passed it over the same hand with the same poor spelling told her that juniors market value was marks gold instructions for delivery would follow two hundred thou the kids in trouble isnt he the emperor himself might not go for that much the sum can be raised mr garrett it will be paid that isnt the problem what is i face a twofold dilemma part is that i wont be able to conceal an outlay of that magnitude from the stormwarden thats my problem and ill deal with her displeasure when the time comes she wont like the expense but she would like to lose her son far less i gather your own balance scale might not tilt the same way my opinions are of no moment mr garrett this is the stormwardens household and here the stormwardens will and whimsy alike are law what do you need me for advice on overcoming the mechanical difficulties of delivering that much gold youll need a big pocket to carry it im paying handsomely for your time mr garrett dont waste it on witticisms i have no sense of humor if you say so two hundred thousand marks in coined gold weighs four thousand pounds to move that much weight will require a heavy wagon and at least a fourhorse team can they possibly expect me to get that someplace where the payoff cant be seen with a payoff that big theyd set it somewhere way out in the country after running you along a route they could watch to make sure you arent being followed they will insist on coined gold wont they bar would be easier for me to get together and handle but harder for them to dispose of right probably i thought so ive already started exchanging our bar stock for coin what else should i know dont improvise do whatever they tell you when they tell you theyll be very nervous and likely to panic and do anything if they see one little thing going different from what they prescribed if youve got to get some paybacks wait till everybody is home safe that much money will leave tracks bloody ones probably ill worry about that when the time comes most probably itll have to wait till the stormwarden returns thank you mr garrett your expertise has confirmed the soundness of my own reasoning i would say that weve had an amicable and productive relationship but there is one thing you could do to make it perfect whats that stay away from amiranda crest its been twenty years since i let anybody pick my friends domina youre a sweetheart but if i make an exception for you im not accustomed to disobedience you ought to get out into the real world more youd get in practice real fast get out of here before i lose my temper i figured that was good advice i headed for the door stay away from amiranda i supposed amiranda had gotten similar advice regarding garrett i nearly trampled the stormwardens daughter amber i pulled the door shut behind me eavesdropping shes right about what her ears were sharper than mine if she could make out anything through that door you should forget ami im much more interesting in that instant i decided she was wrong amiranda crest was a woman this one wore a womans body but the creature inside was spoiled vain snobbish and probably not very bright at a snap judgment well have to talk about it sometime soon i hope i think i grunted let me know when persistent little devil the office door opened what are you doing here amber talking to mr garrett willa dount put on a fierce scowl and pointed it my way it was my fault that the women in the stormwardens house tracked me down go back to your apartment amber you know you arent permitted in this wing stick your elbow in your ear you old witch the domina was absolutely astonished i feared she would begin sputtering but her footwork was good if you wish to contest my authority in your mothers absence well refer the dispute to your father naturally hell say whatever you tell him to say wont he domina dount remained painfully aware of my presence amber how did you get a hold on him it cant be because youre a woman you freeze bathwater when you sit in it that will be quite enough amber excuse me ladies i never feel comfortable in these hen sessions ill just be running along if looks could kill domina dount wanted me deaf to her humiliation amber wanted my support i walked i watched for amiranda but there was no sign of her x the dead man remained engrossed in his war games he was feeble company at the best of times when he was like this with his genius totally committed he was no company at all i consoled myself with the suspicion that he was on to something overlooked by the commanders of the many armies in the cantard i was spared his irascibility too old dean was worse company each meal came with its pitch for some deprived and homely female relative who he hinted had just the touch the house really needed amiranda did not come to visit as id hoped after a few days of that i got to feeling wretchedly sorry for myself and decided to go spend my recent gains buying a few barrels of beer retail for onsite consumption i couldnt get my heart into it they ran me out of the first two places for doing nothing but taking up space while i nursed a single brew the kidnapping kept nagging me i should have been happy to have my hundredten marks for doing nothing but i wasnt there was a wrongness about the thing the ring of bad crystal look at it as i might though i couldnt root out the source of the bad odor there wasnt much i could do about it i didnt have a client nobody goes digging around on the hill just to satisfy a personal curiosity there was too much potential for pain and none at all for profit in the third bar nearer home they let me sit and brood id done well by them in the past and would again when the man sat down opposite me i presumed they were trying to make the best use of table space i didnt look at him till he growled your name garrett i looked he was a big one broad thirtyish with the air of a tough and clothes you dont find anywhere but on the hill but no livery a hired hand who did his work in the shadows nothing gave away who owned him who wants to know i do i got a feeling you and me arent going to get along i dont recall inviting you to sit i dont need an invite from a crumb like you he was off the hill for sure their heads swell when they get connected up there i know were not going to be pals break my heart smart boy i was thinking more along the line of an arm or leg what do you want bruno bruno is a derisive generic for a dumb pug a quick glance around told me he had a couple of buddies along but they were too far away to give him a hand quickly they were at the bar trying to blend in word is going around that you been hanging around raver styxs place you got a rep for mixing in where youre not wanted we want to know what youre up to who is we he was so rude he didnt answer so i suggested why dont you ask the stormwarden im asking you garrett youre wasting your time go away bruno youre interfering with my drinking he jabbed a hand out and got hold of my left wrist started to squeeze he had a good grip but my right hand fell on his i buried my thumb in the flesh just behind the root joints of his middle and forefingers i pressed hard his eyes got big and his face turned white i smiled a friendly smile all right bruno you were just going to tell me who you work for and why youre down here trying to convince people that youre somebody scary you go to hell you cheap unh youve got to learn to think before you speak with a mouth like yours its a miracle youve lived this long garrett youre going to be sorry you were ever unh they say pain is the fastest educator in your case it looks like even that wont help yes someone had come to the table approach unnoticed because i was watching brunos pals slowly develop the suspicion that all was not well with their buddy mr garrett the dapenas were a polite bunch junior have a seat bruno was just leaving i let go his hand he flexed it as he rose trying to leave me with his best deadly look he wanted to pop me one just to remember him by but when he went to cock it i let a foot fly under the table and got him in the shin his eyes got big again he made one little whimper of a sound and decided to go away while he was still fit to limp i see domina dount pulled it off and got you back in one piece yes congratulations on your good fortune so how come youre down here slumming the son was the image of the father without the marks of age and dissipation how had the question of paternity risen maybe when he was a baby he hadnt looked so much like his immediate male ancestor those notions hang on forever i wanted to thank you personally thank me for what i didnt do a damned thing the kid had one of those apologetic whiny voices that made you suspect he wanted to be excused for being alive but you did at least you appeared to the kidnappers i overheard them talking they had somebody watching our place when they saw you they talked it over and decided they had to play the whole thing as straight as they could because of your reputation so you see i owe you a debt of thanks i might not be here if you hadnt in addition to his other charms junior was a rocker whenever he spoke he jerked back and forth staring into space it must have been a joy growing up in the stormwardens household i got a strong feeling that he had much more on his mind that gratitude was just an excuse for seeking me out but you dont have much luck pressing guys like him when you dont have a hold on them they tend to break for cover so i leaned back and tried to look pleased with his praise and interested in anything else he might want to tell me in a moment it was obvious he was working himself up to something he started stammering but he never got the chance to open up here you are my lord and here he was the dominas florid flunky slauce wearing an ingratiating smile belied by eyes in which the humor had been extinct for years ive been looking everywhere i doubted that he had to have been following junior to pop up so quickly and inconveniently courter i was just telling mr garrett how grateful i am for his help he rocked his eyes gave him away he was terrified of this character courter who had used the name slauce when he had visited me the domina needs you right away my lord a command cautiously couched for my benefit junior flinched across the room bruno and the boys had been huddled together for a while apparently they decided the presence of junior and his keeper meant there was no more percentage for them there they went away though bruno left me a final dirty look junior got up and courter took hold of his arm not heavyhanded but definitely like he thought his man might try to run he passed close enough to trip i thought about giving it a shot to see what would happen but i left it as a thought see you later karl his look of despair brightened as he took the notion seriously courter looked at me for the only time during his visit he had visions of bloodshed echoing through his eyes i smiled and gave him a big friendly wink it did nothing for his ulcer i gave it the old try but i couldnt gel involved in my drinking i held a caucus with myself took a vole and decided to go home and purge my soul by either subjecting it to the torment of old deans recitation of the encyclopedia of his eligible relatives or simply dosing it with a generous helping of the dead mans poisonous humors they disappointed me both of them i think they had discussed it while i was gone dean was whistling when i walked in what happened your females ambush a troop of hussars and take them prisoners for life he was in too good a mood to take offense i couldnt get a pout from him i demanded whats going on around here why are you grinning like a fox with goose feathers in his whiskers its his nibs hes ebullient exultant positively ecstatic all that huh this ive got to see it is one for the books mr garrett whats that youre working on there a lamb roast lamb is mutton i dont like mutton i had more mutton than i ever wanted while i was in the marines we ate it every meal except when we had to make do with rocklike chunks of salt pork or circumstances forced us to eat our horses or worse we had to subsist on roots and berries youll like this youll see he talked cooking technique i walked grumbling mutton is mutton is mutton figuring i would have to eat the stuff with a big show of appreciation because whenever i get critical of deans cooking and he takes umbrage the next meal is sure to include green peppers there is no foodstuff in this or any other world quite so hideously nauseating as the green bell pepper a pig even a hungry pig has better sense than to eat green peppers but not people it positively astounds me what people will eat in such a humor i shoved into the dead mans room ah garrett good afternoon good of you to stop in how is that kidnapping business going the kid came home in one piece i stepped out of the room looked around stepped back inside congratulations a job well done you will have to tell me all about it what was that little dance step just making sure i was in the right house with the right dead man no congrats due i didnt have anything to do with it i went ahead and brought him up to date leaving out none of the details but amirandas overnight vacation from the household of the stormwarden an interesting situation infested with anomalies almost a pity you have no concern in it a challenge to crack its shell and lay open the meat within feeling our genius today are we indeed yes indeed the mystery of the magic of glory mooncalled is a mystery no more subject to observational confirmation of course you figured out how he does it when the venageti war council cant do better than stumble over their own feet indeed how ratiocination my boy my boy he was in a mood to crow cogitation induction deduction repeated experiment manipulating the possible course of events within the known parameters and from this came a hypothesis bearing the weight of near certainty i know how glory mooncalled did what he did and with just a bit more information i could predict with some degree of certainty what he will do next so how does he do it does he turn invisible does he run through secret tunnels to sneak up and sneak away have to reserve the how for now garrett the hypothesis is insufficiently tested based as it is on one assumption not yet validated a bit more observation should confirm it though and you will be the first to know no doubt he would crow like a herd of roosters watching three suns rising if he was not already why dont you mr garrett dean had his head in the doorway excuse me theres a young woman here to see you his nose was up and his choice of the word woman over lady told me he thought her a floozy and probably some playmate of mine not nearly as worthy of me as any one of a dozen of his nieces who is she she wouldnt say she seemed perfectly familiar with you though again with the nose up i excused myself and headed for the door expecting amiranda they just cant stay away from you garrett it was amber she gave me her big teasing smile as i let her in dean had instructions to let no one in without consulting me or the dead man first i scanned the street as amber brushed past i didnt see courter slauce but assumed he was out there watching amber did some posing showing off her best features of which she had several arent you dressed for the kill today whats the occasion i gave the street another scan nothing but women from the hill dont wander my end of town unchaperoned not unless theyre so severely unaware of personal danger that the bad guys shy off as if they were holy madmen a hunt of sorts she did have a promising smile i see how old are you amber twenty she lied my immediate guess was eighteen going on thirty uhn this way i stalled for time while i led her to my office there is a side of me that is very fond of women there is also a side thats wary of those who bring gifts without being asked when they stand near a center of power and are as changeable and spoiled as this one probably was i want to play it very carefully i thought i saw a way im a charming scamp i know hurt me to the quick though it does im old enough plain enough and poor enough to suspect that maybe my profession has more to do with you being here maybe she went on trying to flirt i had a bad feeling she might be one of those who couldnt deal with a man until she proved to herself she could lead him around by his hopes and fantasies that kind regards consummation as something to avoid at all costs she was young but she knew her men well enough to know actually giving in would dilute her power i assumed she was playing that game so i did my best to let her think she might get what she wanted without stretching her virtue she did appeal a whole damned lot but ill have to know a stormwardens daughter a lot better before i take the risks inherent in such a situation there is one thing you could do she admitted but that can wait dont you feel crowded in here isnt there somewhere else that old man could walk in anytime at which point i made the mistake of sitting down my sitter was barely in place when a hundred pounds of potential parked her sitter on my lap so much for garretts infallible estimates of members of the female species she had me going for a minute until she giggled i dont like my women to giggle it makes me doubt their maturity still when the culprit is sitting on your lap wagging her tail mr garrett it was that old man mr dotes is here he says its important saved damn it xi do you have to garrett you dont know morley dotes if he comes here its important i had amber about half pried loose when dotes blew in he stopped and gawked then that sparkle flashed in his eye im going to throw pepper in there someday just to get tears to wash it out down boy whats going on amber made a show of neatening herself up i guess she knew she had it and couldnt help flaunting it your pal saucer head hes in the bledsoe carved up bad enough to kill a mammoth bound to happen in his line of work which was pretty much the same as morleys less public line so he gave me a sour look when he could steal a second from appreciating amber how did it happen dont have much yet he staggered in from somewhere way the hell out in the country they say he shouldnt have made it but you know him too stubborn and stupid to die they dont think hell make it who does down there what the hell was he doing out in the boondocks morley gave me a funny look i thought youd know he left the place early last night because he had a job said you recommended him me i never oh damn id better get down there i had butterflies the size of horses amiranda had to be ill stroll along with you then i havent had my exercise today far be it from morley dotes to admit he had a friend anywhere in the known universe as he turned to leave amber whispered wait garrett the music was out of her voice is it critical to me it is wait for me at the front door morley so tell me my brother came home this morning they let him go good for him that means domina paid the ransom seems likely so so theres two hundred thousand gold marks out there somewhere that belong to my family that somebody couldnt yell about if it got taken away do you think you could find it maybe if i wanted to bad enough a chunk like that in the hands of amateurs would leave a trail like a rogue mammoth the trick would be getting to it before all the other sharpshooters in town help me find it garrett you can have half whoa girl thats asking for big trouble with no guarantee of any this may be my first last and only chance to make a hit big enough to get away from my mother if i could get that money before she comes home i could disappear so thoroughly she couldnt find me with an army you could do pretty good with a hundred thousand too that i could that i could she posed and there are ancillary benefits too yes yes indeed ill need some time to think about what id need and what id have to do in the meantime ive got a friend in the infirmary trying to die i want to see him before he goes sure she didnt sound thrilled to hear about obligations imposed by friendship ill come back tomorrow if i can get away from courter and his bullies next day for sure maybe you could give that old man the day off she turned on the smile maybe ill think about that too she giggled you do that i patted her fanny come on off with you my friend morley will be getting impatient i followed her to the front door there is nothing i can say to disparage the view from that perspective dean was waiting to bolt up after me which meant he had been eavesdropping again i shot him an ugly glare but it ricocheted like water off the proverbial duck morley was waiting outside while i stood listening to dean shoot the bolts we appreciated ambers departure where do you find them garrett i dont they find me bull feathers its true i just sit here like a big old trapdoor spider and nab them when they walk by then i turn on the garrett charm and they swoon into my arms that one is no swooner garrett the one the other night wasnt either high hill fluff both of them right off the hill i wouldnt call them fluff no probably not he sighed why doesnt something like that ever turn up at my place youre doing all right from what i see dont get your heart set on this one youd be asking for a visit from the whirlwind her mother is a stormwarden another dream shattered by bitter reality still its a pity a pity thats sweet lets go see saucer head and find out which way to lay our bets xii the bledsoe infirmary is an imperial charity meaning its supposed to provide medical care for the indigent if youre in the place though your chances improve a hell of a lot if you or a friend happen to come up with some cash human nature guess im not always the biggest fan of my own species they werent going to let me near saucer head at first he was supposedly in real bad shape and would be checking out very soon then somebody saw the flash of gold between my fingers and heard a hint or two about metal changing hands if the prognosis improved and first thing you knew the whole infirmary had a new attitude zip morley and i were in saucer heads ward watching a gang of physicians and healers do their stuff saucer head looked terrible when they started paper pale after losing what appeared to be several gallons of blood he didnt look much better when they finished but his breathing was steadier less inclined to the characteristic sighs i scattered a few marks and showed that i had a few more that might want to keep the others company saucer head didnt do anything but breathe for a couple of hours good enough by me that put us a few points up on death morley spoke only once the entire time we were waiting in a tiny whisper if i ever get so desperate i come in here you come cut my throat and put me out of my misery the remark illuminated the side of morley dotes with a morbid dread of sickness after this visit he would be on double rations stoking up on green leafies and whatnot for weeks not that the bledsoe was anybodys idea of heaven one look around was enough to curdle a vampires bones and this was just a ward to die in the insane wards are supposed to be ripped straight out of the dungeons of hell i couldnt figure why saucer head had picked the bledsoe he was no tycoon but he wasnt a pauper either we saw only one other vertical human being after the staff left a priest who was probably the only decent human being working the bledsoe i knew him vaguely he was one of the bigger names in one of the more obscure and bizarre of the several hundred cults hagriding tunfaire he came over and stared down at the huge slab of muscle that was saucer head tharpe there was a nobility about tharpe even in his extremity it recalled the nobility of the lion or the mammoth a good guy to have on your side a bad guy to have for an enemy simple trustworthy and as tough as they make them has he had his rites i dont know father what gods did he have i put temptation aside none that i know about but we dont need sacraments this is a life watch not a deathwatch hes going to make it the priest checked the name chalked on the wall above the head of saucer heads cot ill say a prayer for him small smile it never hurts even with a sure thing he went on to those who needed him more leaving me with the suspicion i had been oneupped saucer head must have been awake awhile before he let us know his first remark a hoarse croak was garrett remind me to stay the hell away from your women i grunted and waited getting that one out of the cantard got me half killed i thought this one did me all the way yeah what the hell did you come here for if you had gopower enough to make it this far you could have got yourself to somebody who could have done you some good i was born here garrett i had it in my head i was done for and it seemed right it should end up where it started i guess i wasnt thinking too good yeah you big dumb goof well youre going to make it in spite of yourself and these jackals you got enough energy to tell me what happened yeah his face darkened so what happened shes dead garrett they killed her i got five or six of them but they was too many and they got past me and cut her and he started by god getting up off that cot hold him down morley what the hell are you doing saucer head i got to go i never blowed a job like that before garrett never morley put him back down with one hand saucer head was running on spirit alone there were tears in his eyes she was just a little bit of a thing garrett sweet as a sugar bun and cute as a button they shouldnt ought to have done that to her youre right they shouldnt have part of me had known the worst all along but the part that wishes and hopes was just getting the word saucer head tried getting up again i got to garrett you got to heal up ill take care of the rest ive got an interest that came before yours after you give me everything youve got morley is going to get you out of here and take you wherever you want to stay and im going headhunting morley gave me a look he didnt say anything he didnt have to dont you start playing devils advocate morley dotes telling me theres no percentage in getting involved youd do the same damned thing even if you dressed it up as something else come on saucer head give it to me start from the beginning the first time you laid eyes on her saucer head may not be speedy mentally but his mind gets where it needs to go and he sees what goes on around him and remembers it the first time i seen her was with you at morleys place i thought to myself how come a runt like morley dotes or a homely geek like garrett always comes up with all the jewels he isnt dying i said a sick sense of humor is the first thing that comes back imagine calling me homely never mind that night saucer head when did you see her again yesterday afternoon she tracked me down at my place she found him there and told him that id recommended him for any body guarding she needed done she had a thing she wanted to do that night but she was nervous and scared and even though she was sure there would be no trouble she thought it wouldnt hurt to have somebody along just in case just to make her more comfortable after saucer head agreed to stick with her until she felt she didnt need him anymore she went away until shortly before dusk when she came back with a small open carriage she have anything with her bunch of cases in the back the kind women stuff with clothes and things she wasnt planning on coming back uhm she say anything about what she was doing that was the only time he was a little uncertain about what he ought to tell he decided i needed everything she never said what she was up to but she was going to meet somebody and she wasnt planning on coming back then if you hadnt been along she wouldve disappeared and nobody wouldve known what really happened gods i blind myself with my own brilliance sometimes yeah you going to let me tell it or should i catch a nap while youre jacking your jaw one more thing then you can get on your payment how and when up front i always make them pay up front well i almost made an exception for her i took every coin she had and then she was still half a mark short i forgave her that and told her she should hold out part of the fee so she wouldnt short herself but she said there was no problem and when we got where we were going id get my other half mark and maybe a nice bonus for being such a sweetheart yeah thats saucer head tharpe all over a real sweetheart all right go on they had moved out in the twilight saucer head on horseback behind the carriage he was lightly armed but that wasnt unusual he preferred to rely on his strength and speed i didnt have to ask if he had seen anyone watching or following he was looking for that and saw nothing they left the city after dark and headed north at a leisurely pace not doing any fancy switch backing not hurrying and not drawing any special attention because he rode behind the buggy most of the way they didnt talk much but there was a threequarter moon and a clear sky and he was able to tell she was getting more worried and nervous as the night wore on she was thoughtful of him and the animals pausing for several rests about three in the morning they came to a woodland crossroad a couple miles from the famous old battleground at litchfield where some say the old imperial bones still sometimes get up and stalk around in search of the man who betrayed their commander as is customary at important crossroads there was a central grass diamond with its tutelary obelisk amiranda stopped next to the obelisk where her team could crop grass she told saucer head they would wait there as soon as the person she was meeting showed he could head back to tunfaire saucer head dismounted after working the kinks out he just stood leaning against the buggy waiting amiranda had little to say an hour dragged past she became more worried by the minute saucer heads feeble attempts to reassure her foundered on his ignorance she believed her worst fears were coming true the moon was about to depart the heavens and the east was lightening when saucer head realized they were no longer alone an absence of the gossip of birds awakening tipped him off he just had time to warn amiranda before they charged out of the woods the moment he saw them he knew they werent just road agents there was at least fifteen of them garrett ogres some of them with the pure blood like you dont hardly never see no more they had knives and sharp sticks and clubs and big bones and you could tell they was bent on murder they was cussing in ogres on account of me being there they wasnt expecting me saucer head wasnt clear himself on how it went after that except that he got himself between the ogres and amiranda with his back against the buggy and went to work with a knife and club of his own and when he lost those with bare hands and brute strength i killed five or six but there just aint a whole lot any one man can do when hes outnumbered so bad they just kept piling on me and hitting and cutting me that girl she didnt have enough sense to run she tried to fight too but they dragged her down and cut on her i thought i whipped them for a minute cause they all ran off to the edge of the woods but then i went down and couldnt get up again couldnt even move they thought i was dead they dragged me over and dumped me in the brush then they dragged everyone else over then they started going through the girls stuff cussing cause there wasnt nothing worth nothing but they squabbled like sparrows over every piece anyway and not once even thinking about helping their buddies that was hurt then they heard someone coming they scurried around cleaning up after themselves then took off down the road with the buggy and saucer heads horse about that time saucer head got himself together enough to get on his feet he found amiranda scooped her up and headed out i wasnt thinking so good he said i didnt want her to be dead so i didnt believe it theres this witch i know that lives about three miles from there back in the woods i told myself if i could get the girl to her everything would be all right and you know me i get my mind set yeah i tried to picture it saucer head half dead still bleeding stumbling through the woods carrying a dead woman and after that he walked all the way back to tunfaire so hed be in the right place when he died asked a lot of questions then mostly about the ogres and what theyd said when theyd thought him dead he hadnt heard anything i could use i got directions to the witchs hut saucer head was getting weaker then but he was working himself up again i told him you just relax if i dont get it straightened out you can take over when youre well again morley i want you to get him out of here come on morley will be back to get you saucer head morley finally spoke when we hit the street nasty business you heard of anybody getting rich since yesterday no he gave me a look got any contacts in ogre town if you arent part ogre you cant get the time of day down there i had a couple of people i knew there but none i knew well enough to get any help on this a few but not anybody wholl tell me anything about a deal that has raver styx on the other end of it thats my problem you going out there to look around maybe tomorrow got some loose ends to knot up around here first use some company when you go im way behind on my exercise he pretended he was interested in anything but what interested him i dont think so and somebody has to stay here and keep reminding saucer head that hes hurt it got personal eh very you be careful out there damned right i will and you keep your ears open im interested in news about ogres and news about anybody with a sudden pocketful of gold we parted i went home and wrapped myself around a couple gallons of beer xiii the dead mans mood hadnt soured by the next morning i got worried were we getting to the beginning of the end i didnt know enough about the loghyr to be sure what sort of symptom persistent good humor might be i told him about saucer head leaving out none of the details that give you any ideas several but you have not given me enough information to form more than one definite opinion a definite one you what is it your little overnight treat was involved up to her cute little ears in the kidnapping of the stormwardens son if not a part of the conspiracy itself she did at least have guilty knowledge i didnt argue i had formed that suspicion myself it was good to know i had a mind nearly as agile as his if not so absolute in its decisions but him being a genius exempts him from the doubts plaguing us mere mortals would you care to run through your reasoning would appear simple and obvious enough for even one of your narrow intellectual focus to unravel gave him a big grin that was his way of zinging me for having dared entertain overnight in my own home he couldnt shake his good humor completely though he added troublesome as females are when they step out of their proper roles as connivers manipulators gossips backstabbers and bearers and nurturers of the young slaughtering them is not an acceptable form of chastisement i urge you to persist in your inquiries garrett with all due caution i would not care to see you share the womans fate how would i attend the funeral youre just a sentimental fool arent you too often too much so for my own welfare ha dirty truth gets caught with its nose sticking out if i get scrubbed you might have to get off your mental duff and do some honest geniusing in order to keep a roof over your head am an artist garrett i do not and im a frog prince under a witchs spell mr garrett i turned dean was at the door what that woman is here again the one who was here yesterday the same you would have thought he smelled spoiled onions in his pantry the way his face was puckered take her into the office dont let her touch you it might be communicable i let him get out of hearing before adding you might carry it to your nieces and suddenly have them all turn desirable you ride him too hard garrett he is a sensitive man with an abiding concern for his loved ones i let him get out of hearing didnt i would not want to lose him me neither id have to go back to cleaning up after you myself i got out then ignoring him trying to come up with the last word we could kill a whole day that way amber was looking her best and sensed that i saw and felt it she tried starting up where she left off i told her ive decided to find that money for you i think were going to have to stick to business and move damned fast if we want to catch the trail before its cold i did a lot of legwork yesterday poking under rocks i came up with a sack full of air im starting to think the whole thing was an outoftown operation garrett she wanted to play but she could accept two hundred thousand marks gold as a good reason for not for the moment i figured her for the type who could get hooked on the challenge that might be my next problem what do you mean outoftown operation like i said yesterday a thing involving two hundred thousand and snatching raver styxs kid is going to take big planning and leave big tracks even when the best pros are working the job one way to give the tracks a chance to disappear in the mud is to do your design work recruiting purchasing and rehearsal somewhere far away then you might take the gold somewhere else still in fact with so much gold involved you might want to tie up loose ends by erasing any connection between yourself and the kidnap victim you mean kill off the people who helped you yes thats horrible thats thats terrible its a terrible world with a lot of terrible people in it not to mention things like ogres and ghouls or vampires and wolf men who see the rest of us as prey though they used to be human themselves its horrible of course but its the kind of thing we may run into you still game were partners youre going to have to carry your half of the load me how can i help you can get me a chance to talk to your brother and amiranda she looked puzzled not too bright my amber but decorative definitely decorative i havent dug up but one clue yet and its not worth squat by itself what is it uhuh i keep my cards to my chest till i get a better picture why do you need to talk to karl and amiranda karl because hes the only one who had any direct contact with the kidnappers except maybe domina dount when she delivered the ransom amiranda because she works for the domina and might have picked up something useful i cant go grill willa dount shed want the gold back herself if she knew we were looking for it wouldnt she yeah but karl would want a cut if he knew what we were doing he wants out of that house as bad as i do amiranda the same way you get me a chance to talk to them ill think of some reason for it all right but youd better be careful especially with amiranda shes a little witch you dont like her not very much shes smarter than me and when she wants she can make herself almost as pretty even my own mother always treats her better than me but i dont think i hate her i just wish shed go away and she wants to get away as badly as you and your brother do when she gets better treatment better than awful is still bad garrett how soon can you fix it so i can see karl itll be hard he wont be able to sneak out right now domina has courter watching him every minute she says the kidnapping wont stay a secret and when the news gets out how much the ransom was somebody else might try it again would they that happens there are a lot of lazy stupid crooks who try to get by imitating success your family will be at risk till your mother takes some action to make it plain that folks who mess with her live short and awful lives she probably wouldnt even care she would care even if she had no use or love for her offspring but i had no inclination to illuminate amber about the symbols and trappings of power and what the powerful have to do to keep them polished and frightening the next step has to be your brother if he cant come to me ill go to him you arrange something ill follow you home about a half hour behind you ill hang around outside somewhere you give me a signal when its all right to come in might as well set it for me to see amiranda too what will the signal be i had chosen a conspiratorial tone it worked she got into the spirit of doings shadowed and sinister ill flash a mirror out my window give me five minutes after that then meet me at the postern which window while she explained i reflected that she had this gimmick too pat to have come up with it on the spur of the moment i hoped it was a device she used to sneak lovers inside if she had been getting away with that the notion might be marginally workable if she was setting me up but she had no reason that i could see it was plain that her only interest was laying hands on her mothers gold you get paranoid in this business but maybe paranoids get that way because of all the people out to get them better scoot along now i told her before they miss you up there and start wondering a half hour wouldnt make any difference would it a half hour might make all the difference i can get real stubborn when i really want something garrett ill bet you can i hope youre as stubborn about the gold if we find things getting tight i guided her toward the front door tight how could it get dangerous are you kidding not to be melodramatic like hell but it could get to be a long dark narrow valley between your mother and the kidnappers before we get that gold socked away she looked at me with big eyes while that sank in then she turned on the smile keep that golden carrot dangling out front and this mule wont even see the brooding hills so a little slow maybe but gutsy old dean was watching from down the hall exercising his disapproving scowl i patted amber on the fanny thats the spirit kid remember im half an hour behind you try not to leave me standing in the street too long she spun around and laid a kiss on me that must have curled deans hair and toes it did mine she backed off winked and scooted xiv i went back and got a big cold one to fortify myself for the coming campaign i had to draw it myself dean had been stricken blind and could hear nothing but ghosts he was exasperated with me i downed the long one drew another lowered the keg then went to tell the dead man the latest he growled and snarled a little just to make me feel at home i asked if he was ready to reveal glory mooncalleds secrets he told me no and get out and i left suspecting cracks had appeared in his hypothesis a cracked hypothesis can be lethal to the loghyr ego after depositing my empty mug in the kitchen i went upstairs and rooted through the closet that serves as the household arsenal selected a few inconspicuous pieces of steel and a leadweighted leatherwrapped truncheon that had served me well in the past with a warning to dean to lock up after the ghosts left i hit the street it was a nice day if one doesnt mind an inconsistent hovering between mist and drizzle comes with the time of year the grape growers like it except when they dont if they had their way every stormwarden in the business would be employed fulltime making fine adjustments in weather so they could maximize the premium of their vintages i was moist and crabby by the time i reached the hill and started looking for a place to lurk but the neighborhood had been designed with the inconsiderate notion that lurkers should not be welcome so i had to hoof it up and down and around hanging out in one small area trying to look like i belonged there i told myself i was a pavement inspector and went to work detecting every defect in the lay of those stones after fifteen minutes that lasted a day and a half i caught ambers signal a candle instead of a mirror and started drifting toward the postern a day later that opened and amber peeked out not a minute too soon sweetheart here come the dragoons the folks on the hill all tip into a community pot to hire a band of thugs whose task is to spare the hill folk the discomfitures and embarrassments of the banditry we who live closer to the river have to accept as a fact of life like dismal weather not fooled for a minute by my romance with the cobblestones a pair of those luggers were headed my way under full sail they had been on the job too long their beams were as broad as their heights but they meant business and i wasnt interested in getting into a headknocking contest with guys who had merely to blow a whistle to conjure up more arguments for their side i got through the postern and left them with their meat hooks clamped on nothing but a peel of ambers laughter thats meenie and mo theyre brothers eenie and minie must have been circling in on you from the other side we used to tease them terribly when we were kids a couple of remarks occurred to me but with manly fortitude i kept them behind my teeth amber led me through a maze of servants passages chattering brightly about how she and karl used the corridors to elude willa dounts vigilance again i restrained myself from commenting we had to go up a flight and this way and that part through passages no longer in use or at least immune to cleaning then amber shushed me while she peeked between hangings into a hallway for regular people with real blue blood in their veins nobody around hurry she dashed i trotted along behind dutifully appreciating the view ive never understood those cultures where they make the women walk three paces behind the man or maybe i do there are more of them around arranged like willa dount than there are like amber she swept me through a doorway into an empty room and rolled right around with her arms reaching i caught her by the waist tricked me eh no hell be here in a minute he has to get away meantime you know the old saying i live with a dead loghyr i hear a lot of old sayings some of them so hoary the hills blush with embarrassment at his flair for cliché which old saying did you have in mind the one about all work and no play makes garrett a dull boy i should have guessed she was determined to wear me down and she was getting the job done whump the edge of the door got me as i was bending forward contemplating yielding to temptation the story of my life i let my momentum carry me several steps out of orbit around amber she laughed karl came into the room spouting apologies and turning red he might have gone into a handwringing act if he had not had them loaded i smell brew i said the elixir of the gods i recalled you were drinking beer in that place the other day i thought it would be only courteous to provide refreshments and so i a chatterer i was amazed not only had he managed to come up with an idea of his own he had managed to carry it out by himself without so much as a servant to lug the tray maybe he did have a little of his grandfather in him after all a thimbleful or so he presented me with a capacious mug i went to work on it he nibbled the foam on a smaller one just to show me what a democratic fellow he was why did you want to talk to me mr garrett i couldnt make much sense out of what amber told me i want to satisfy my professional curiosity your kidnapping was the most unusual one ive ever encountered for my own benefit i want to study its ins and outs in case i ever get into a similar situation the success of the kidnappers might encourage somebody to pull the same stunt again karl looked very uncomfortable he planted himself on a chair and gripped his mug in both hands he pressed it into his lap in hopes of steadying it so i wouldnt notice it was shaking i let him think he had me fooled but what can i tell you that would be of any use mr garrett everything from the beginning where and how they laid hands on you all the way through to the end where and how they turned you loose ill try not to interrupt unless you lose me all right i took a long swig good stuff karl bobbed his head he took a swig of his own amber sidled to the tray and discovered that karl had brought wine too though he hadnt bothered to offer her any junior said it started five or six nights ago right amber dont look at me i still wouldnt know about it if i didnt eavesdrop six nights ago i guess i spent the evening with a friend he thought about it before telling me at a place called half the moon thats a house of ill repute amber said in case i didnt know ive heard of it go on they got you there as i was leaving going out the back way so nobody would see me that didnt sound like the behavior of the hellraiser he was supposed to be why the sneak i thought that wasnt your style so domina wouldnt hear about it i was supposed to be out working that puzzled me the word is that she has everyone on a tight leash while your mother is in the cantard yet you two seem to come and go when you want not when we want amber said when we can courter and domina cant be everywhere watching all the time i thought you said you wouldnt interrupt mr garrett so i did go on when last seen you were making a getaway out the back door of lettie farens place yes i stopped to say good night to someone right in the doorway with my back to the outside somebody put a leather sack over my head it must have had a drawstring sort of thing on it because before i could yell i was being strangled i was scared to death i knew i was being murdered and there wasnt any way i could stop it and then the lights went out he shivered i set my mug down who were you saying goodbye to i tried to keep it casual but he wasnt a complete dummy he didnt answer i stared him straight in the eye he looked away he doesnt want to believe it amber said whats that that his favorite little tidbit was in on it she had to be didnt she i mean she would have seen whoever it was over his shoulder wouldnt she and she would have had time to warn him if she wasnt part of it thats certainly worth a few questions does the lady have a name amber looked at karl he tried divining the future from the lees of his beer maybe he didnt like what he saw he grabbed the pitcher off the tray and poured himself a refill mumbling something as he did so i collected the pitcher and pursued his fine example what was that he said her name is donni pell put a point down for the kid if she had wanted she could have stuck it to him anytime but she held back until he was ready to surrender the name himself karl started working himself up a case of the miseries he said i cant believe donni was in on what ive known her for four years she just wouldnt i reserved my opinion of what people in donnis line would and would not do for money all right lets move on you were strangled unconscious when and where did you wake up im not sure it was nighttime and in the country i think from what sounds i could hear i was bound hand and foot and still had the bag over my head i think i was inside a closed coach of some kind but i cant be sure that would make sense though wouldnt it for them it would what else i had a bad headache that follows go on they got me where they were taking me which turned out to be an abandoned farmhouse of some sort i urged him to get very detailed it was in moments of transfer when kidnappers were most at risk of betraying themselves they lifted me out of the coach somebody cut the ropes around my ankles one got me by each arm and they walked me inside there were at least four of them maybe five or six after they got me inside somebody cut the rope on my wrists a door closed behind me after a long time standing there i finally got up the nerve to take the bag off my head he paused to unparch his throat he could pour it down once he got started being a naturally courteous fellow i matched him swallow for swallow though i hadnt been working my throat nearly so hard a farmhouse you say how did you discover that ill get to it anyway i took the bag off i was in a room about twelve feet by twelve feet that hadnt been cleaned in years there were some blankets to sleep on all old and dirty and smelly a chamber pot that never did get emptied a rickety homemade chair and a small table with one leg broken he had his eyes closed he was visualizing on the table was one of those earthenware pitcherandbowl sets with a rusty metal dipper to take a drink with the pitcher was cracked so it leaked a little into the bowl i drank about a quart of water right away then i went and looked out the window and tried to get myself together i was scared to death i didnt have any idea what was going on until i got back here and found out domina had ransomed me i had my mind made up that some of mothers political enemies had grabbed me so they could twist her arm tell me about that window that sounds like a big lapse on their part not really it was closed with a shutter and the shutter was nailed from outside but the place was old and there was a crack in the shutter big enough to see through as it turned out my seeing what was outside didnt matter how so the way they let me go they just walked off and left me there i figured it out when they stopped feeding me did you ever see any of them no how did they get food to you then they made me stand facing the wall when they brought the food in and took the old platter out then they talked to you one did but only from outside the door and then all he ever said was that it was time to get against the wall but sometimes i could hear them talking not very often they didnt have much to say to each other not even about how they were going to spend their shares of the money i never heard any mention of money at all that was one of the reasons i decided the whole thing was political that and the fact that after the strangling they treated me pretty gently that isnt what i would have expected of kidnappers for profit it isnt customary he had his eyes closed and his mind on the past i dont think he heard me the only thing i ever heard that might have had anything to do with the situation was the last afternoon before they vanished someone came running into the place and yelled hey skredli its coming through tonight i never heard what though skredli youre sure yes you think it was a name it sounded like one you think it might have been i knew damned well it was skred is the ogre equivalent of smith only it is twice as common skredli compares with smitty half the ogres in the world are called skredli it seems like so much for the lucky break we let it sit that way for a minute while we split the remaining contents of the pitcher it was a good brew i wish its like befell me more often but i usually cant afford the price of a sniff on my own hooks so were almost to the end what happened after skredli got yelled at basically nothing as far as i know for those guys that was the end of it i waited for him to expand upon that they didnt bring me any supper by midnight i was hungry enough to bang on the door and complain that didnt do any good i tried to sleep i did a little then when breakfast didnt come i got up and pitched a real fit i pounded the door so hard i broke it open then i got so scared they would beat me that i hid in my blankets but nothing happened eventually i worked up enough nerve to go look out the door then to slip out and explore they were gone long gone the ashes in the kitchen werent even warm i ate some scraps they left behind after those hit bottom i felt braver and decided to do some exploring karl paused to look into his mug and curse because he could see the bottom and there were no reserves to rush into the fray i waited karl told me thats why i know all about the farmhouse a pretty substantial place before it was abandoned he gave me an exhaustive description not a peasant hovel but not a manor house either after id looked around awhile i finally got up enough nerve to follow the coach tracks through the woods after a mile or so i came to a road a passing tinker told me it was the vorkutalichfield road a little over three miles west of the battlefield amazing karl had been sequestered within two miles of the place where amiranda had bought hers and saucer head almost took a slice too many i was so astonished i may have blinked so you just walked on home yes i think ill go fill this pitcher again this is taking longer than i thought no need im almost done just a couple questions more what do you think was it an unusual kidnapping in some ways but it went off smooth and you cant criticize success i dont know much about this kind of thing i was so damned scared while it was happening i didnt study it or think about it how was it remarkable he had a hook out and wanted to see if he could pull in the name of his friend donni pell amber had a similar notion she was alert for the first time in half an hour i disappointed them both because i had ideas of my own and wanted to save donni for myself two peculiarities pounce at you like ogres from ambush the one that bothers me the least is that they locked you in a room you could break out of without bothering to keep you tied or blindfolded but that could be explained several ways no the big croggle is the way willa dount handled her end she turned over a lot of gold to proven crooks without doing anything to make sure the merchandise she was buying was in good condition the custom is for the purchaser to insist on delivery at the point of sale otherwise theres nothing to keep the kidnappers honest karl mumbled something that sounded like i wondered about that too he was in a declining mood and getting restless i supposed it was time to attack i went after him hard about timing and movements and when i noticed amber looking at me odd and karl frowning angrily as he stumbled over his answers i decided id gotten too intense what the hell is this im doing a professional exercise and i get going like its the real thing thanks karl youve been a lot more patient than i would have been if the roles had been reversed youre done he considered the bottom of his mug yes thanks drink one for me and think a kind thought while youre at it sure he got up and out trailing one curious glance at his sister xv you got to pressing there at the end garrett were you on to something apparently not unless i missed something that was right under my nose your brother was a waste of time then why did you spend all that time on him because i didnt know what he could tell me because you never know what little thing will turn out to be the critical clue i went hard on the timing because i want to have it pat when we see what amiranda has to say so we can look at it from the dominas side i couldnt find amiranda what i couldnt find her she didnt answer her door when i asked around nobody had seen her i finally sneaked into her rooms she wasnt there and most of her stuff was gone i did me what i hoped was a convincing show of perplexity did she have a maid did you talk to her what did she say i talked to her she didnt know anything except that amiranda is gone or so she said damn that knocks hell out of everything i got up and stretched what are we going to do start somewhere else you just keep picking till you pull a thread loose youre the inside man here you find out what you can about willa dounts end of things the how the where and the when of the payoff in particular but anything that sounds unusual or interesting keep trying to get a line on amiranda and while youre doing all that try not to attract too much attention we dont want anybody knowing what were doing theres two hundred thousand marks gold at stake and the price is going up my resident genius says were about to hear from glory mooncalled again her eyes glittered each time glory mooncalled acted the venageti position in the cantard weakened the karentine flourished the price of silver plunged and that of gold soared were getting richer by the minute only in our imaginations we have to find the gold she started toward me with that look in her eye ready to celebrate what will you be doing the outside stuff picking at threads talking to this donni ill bet im much prettier than she is garrett and maybe just as talented then im going to have my supper consult the genius and get on the road so i can be at that farm tomorrow morning ill have a whole day to poke around and pick up the trail she had gotten in close enough to force a clinch my resistance was going the way of the dodo suddenly she stiffened and backed away what is it i just had an awful thought my mother is going to be home any day if we dont have the gold found and me out of here before she does she backed away we have to get to work poor little rich kid somehow i couldnt work up a lot of sympathy if she wasnt miserable enough to walk with nothing but the clothes on her back she wasnt miserable enough the sparkle came back to her eyes but once we do look out garrett there is a limit to how much you can kid people and still live with yourself but also a limit to how much you can kid yourself i admire your confidence if we find it when garrett all right when we find it look out amber we exchanged idiot grins do i go out the same way i got in that would be best dont let the servants see you and watch out for the dragoons i gave her a kiss meant to be a businesslike sealing of our compact she turned it into a promise of things to come i finally peeled her off and fled i was distracted the little witches do that to you i zipped around a corner and almost plowed into karl senior and domina dount fortunately they were distracted too very distracted if they noted a third presence at all they probably assumed it was a wayward servant i backed up to consider alternate routes amber had it wrong willa dount didnt freeze bathwater now i knew what hold she had on daddy if it turned out to matter reason didnt do me a bit of good trying to get out of there another way in two minutes i knew i would get lost if i kept on i found a place where i could look into the real peoples world between curtains i recognized the hallway nothing for it but to march and look like i was about honest business it worked fine until i started hiking across the front court headed for the main gate pudgy courter came in from the street he started to say something to the gateman then spotted me his eyes got big his face got red and he started to puff up like an old bullfrog about to sing what the hell are you doing in here hell i might ask the same of you little out of your class here arent you guy like you ought to be slicing vegetables i was close enough he took a swing im not sure why i dont think i trampled him hard enough to set him off i caught his wrist and kept on walking pulling him along in a stumble tsktsk we should be more friendly to our betters i let him go as i stepped outside he was past the flash point now he retreated cursing under his breath while i glanced around for the four clowns who had been stalking me before amber let me inside they were gone it was a piece of bad luck getting spotted like that i could only hope it would balance out and not get things all stirred up inside amber could deal with willa dount especially motivated by visions of gold but i had my doubts about junior he had no strong reason to hide having talked to me i figured id best get down to lettie farens place right away xvi i didnt get there as quickly as id planned though the delay lasted only a few seconds going down the hill i realized that id picked up a tail it didnt take long to discover it was my friend bruno from the tavern why was he on me five minutes later i knew he was alone it was personal i had hurt his feelings and now he felt a need to hurt mine i stepped into an areaway when i came to one i knew would suit my purpose i found a shadow and got into it he came charging in a few seconds later apparently wanting to take advantage of my stupidity but when he got there he saw nothing he started cursing but you mustnt blame the gods all is not lost bruno im right here i stepped out of the shadows he was too mad for preliminaries he tucked in his chin and came after me i was in no mood for ego games myself his first swing i tapped his wrist with my weighted stick then i whacked an elbow putting one arm out of commission then i let him set himself up and dropped a couple of good thumps on his noggin after he was down i put him in the shadows so the street kids wouldnt find and strip him before he woke up i doubted he would appreciate the courtesy i hoped he wasnt so stubbornly stupid one of us would have to get killed to end whatever was going on letties place was into the lull that comes between the businesslike gentlemen of the afternoon and the revelers of night got past the thug at the door without trouble he didnt know me i found lettie where you always find her in the back room counting the take she was a grotesquely obese female of mixed but uncertain antecedents who made the dead man look slim trim and able to run like a deer garrett you son of a bitch how the hell did you get in here the sorcery of feet i put on my magic boots and walked youre looking as lovely as ever lettie and youre just as full of camel guano what the hell do you want i tried to look hurt by her remarks all right she snarled out you go i clinked coins and showed the face of a dead king on a gold double mark i thought the motto of the house was no paying customer is ever turned away gold was talking big talk in tunfaire these days she eyed the coin what do you want not what who her name is donni pell letties eyes narrowed hardened shit you would you cant have her i know you dont like me and well never run off to become shopkeepers and raise babies together but when did you ever let personal feelings get in the way of making money when i was thirteen years old and in the middle of my first big love affair thats got nothing to do with it garrett i cant sell you merchandise that i dont have in stock shes not here you figured it out with a brain like yours why do you keep that heap of blubber in your front room sentiment and it keeps him off the streets where did donni go you want her bad dont you i want to see her dont try to hold me up lettie youve got employees wholl tell me for silver goddamned human nature you would wouldnt you give me one good reason why i shouldnt have leo come in here and twist your face around so youre looking out the back of your head this little crumb that fell from the sun i flashed the double mark all right you win garrett what do you want shes gone so the why the when the how and the where then tell me about donni pell the person the why is she got hold of a bunch of money and thats the how too she came in here three four nights ago and bought out her contract not that she was in very deep she said a rich uncle up north died and left her a fortune bull if you ask me she got her hooks into some halfwit off the hill she had the looks and manners and style for it she claimed she was off to take over managing the uncles manor more bull she couldnt survive without platoons of men around i raised the old eyebrow lettie liked me when i did my trick i used it as often as could that woman was a freak garrett ninetynine out of a hundred of them hate men she loved what she was doing if she hadnt been selling it she would have been giving as much away for free a working girl who enjoyed her work unusual she must have brought the clients in in herds i wish i had a hundred like her even if she was a pervert i gave her a glimpse at the other eyebrow you know in this business you got to be tolerant and understanding garrett but it stretches tolerance and surpasses understanding when a perfectly beautiful young human woman prefers ogres for playmates even ogre women dont want anything to do with those creeps id let a vampire or wolf man in this place before id open my door to an ogre she was going good so i let her rant using up her hostility on a target other than me just once throwing in well there are the sexual myths just to make sure she got all the venom spent bullshit thats all bullshit garrett youre talking to an expert garrett and on she raved she wound down i placed the double mark squarely in front of her that about the ogres was worth this come up with something more and you might get to see some of the old kings ancestors her eyes narrowed its murder isnt it garrett and a heavyweight client i know that look the paladin look youre after somebodys head you dumb boy you keep playing with the life takers im after a hooker named donni pell who might be able to tell me something i need to know you got the works already garrett all i can give you for your money now is a kiss for luck background her her people you know them all how long was she here where did she come from she dont have any people they died in the plague four years ago thats why i didnt believe the story about the uncle she was here for about three years sometimes more trouble than she was worth on account of stunts she pulled on her johns she didnt tell a lot about herself but lies like all the rest but i usually get their real stories out of them on the bad nights i know you do her people were country folk with a goodsized freehold up around litchfield somewhere i muttered ill bet i could go right to it without missing a turn what nothing that chip looks lonely sitting there by itself what more can you tell me about donni you got the load garrett she reached for the coin what about raver styxs men folk the two karls her eyes glazed somebody killed one of them not yet i saw she needed to see some color to keep her momentum i showed her another double the kid was one of donnis regulars she said she felt sorry for him i think she halfway liked him he treated her like a lady and he wasnt bashful about being seen with her the father visited her sometimes too but with him it was strictly business i dont think i want to talk about that family anymore garrett that woman is poison shes out of town lettie shell be back you got what you came for get out get out before i start remembering and yell for leo i put the second double mark down beside the first we wouldnt want to interrupt leos nap would we out garrett and dont show your ugly face around here anymore youll get it broke she loved me that fat old lettie xvii i went by playmates stable and smithy yard and told him to send a buggy to the house in a couple of hours and to load it down with one of every kind of tool he had he gave me a look but knew better than to ask i might tell him something he wouldnt want to know old dean thought he was going to bribe me he still wasnt talking but he laid on the best spread id seen in months i did right by it when i went in to see the dead man i was waddling i didnt expect another decent meal for days garrett dismiss that creature at once get him out of my house good to see you back to your normal cheerful self what creature why that dean the fiend brought not one not two but three women in here get rid of him garrett throw him out so a fantasy meal explained dean wanted me to see what i didnt have to be missing him and me we were going to have to have a little talk man to man and get things straight real soon now i settled in my visiting chair sipped some beer then cut loose the dead man sulked and pretended to ignore me but he took in every word he had to have something to distract himself while he waited for glory mooncalled to prove out his hypothesis i talked for two hours nonstop with good old dean keeping my mug topped he enjoyed a little vicarious adventure and his coming and going showed just how little depth there was to the dead mans animosity i finished my report having spared no detail there is something missing garrett i know that either that or i know too much and im getting distracted you are not getting distracted i keep thinking ive got the kidnap side figured out three different times ive decided that junior kidnapped himself then i find myself up to my ass in ogres again with them perfect for the villains and if the kid did kidnap himself why did he come home he and his sister want out of there so bad they can taste it the way it went down with no direct exchange all he had to do was take the gold and hike and leave his mommy wearing weeds the ransom money was paid willa dount scrounged two hundred thousand and delivered it to somebody junior came home next day amber is digging on that for me the deepdown root thing that bugs me can be tied up in one bow why did amiranda have to die real kidnapping or fake with her in on it or not why did she have to be killed am certain you will unmask the reason you have allowed yourself to become emotionally entangled again i saw him sizing up one of his favorite hobbyhorses getting ready to mount up and ride dean had gone to answer the door a minute before i got up my transportation is here you mull it over while youre killing time maybe youll spot a connection ive missed i didnt doubt that he had seen one or two already but didnt feel obligated to point them out neither of us had a real money interest here and he had no emotional investment so whether he saw something or not he would just let me exercise my own genius i visited the armory unlike saucer head i dont figure my hands are my best defense i tossed a bundle into the buggy under the seat and was about to flick the traces when dean came stumbling out of the house with a hamper mr garrett wait whats this provender victuals rations leftovers that too a man has to eat something what were you going to do out there hell im a city boy i dont think about food i was going to borrow a page from morley dotes and live off roots and bark but rather than injure your feelings ill just park that hamper up here beside me and suffer he smiled smugly as i pulled away for however long i subjected myself to this rustication every bite would remind me that i needed a feeder and a keeper and the fodder would for certain be the best of the best cooked up by his nieces the man was obsessed that is all i can say he had worked for me long enough to know i wasnt the kind of catch youd want your female relations stuck with but he persisted karenta is a kingdom at war youd expect some sort of watch to be kept on the entrepots to one of its most important cities in case some enterprising venageti commander decided to try something imaginative but the war has been going on since my generation were kids seldom spilling out of the cantard and the adjoining seas any guards who were awake when i left were too busy playing cards to step out and check my bona fides but our lords from the hill want the ordinary folk to seethe with fervor against the enemy its a lot easier to seethe against raver styx and her ilk they profit no matter how the fighting goes i used the route saucer head and amiranda had followed the moon was now full the team didnt mind night travel even with me at the traces and the nation of horses has been out to get me ever since i can remember it was a smooth quiet ride with very little to see the only traffic i encountered was the night coach from derry half an hour ahead of schedule and just lumping along with its two or three somnolent passengers and load of mail guard and driver tossed me friendly greetings which showed how worried they were about the night i suppose theoretically that i should have had one hand on a silver blade at all times there was a full moon but there hadnt been a confirmed wolfman incident this close to the city since before i went into the marines once i did unravel a murder that had been dressed up to look like a wolfmans work its a hell of a way to make sure your old man doesnt get the chance to write you out of the will i reached the dire crossroad about the same time saucer head had i gave it a look around as it stood considering the fact that there was more moon than there had been that night i didnt see or get a feel for anything so i loosened the horses harnesses made sure they couldnt run off climbed onto the buggys seat and napped i did a good job of snoozing too i thought first light would waken me but the honor went to a tenyearold who shook my shoulder and asked are you all right mister i counted my hands and feet and purse and discovered that i hadnt been murdered mutilated or robbed i am indeed son except maybe for a case of premature senility he looked at me funny and asked a few kidlike questions i tried giving reasonable answers and asked him a few in turn he was on his way somewhere to help somebody with farm chores but he let me buy him breakfast which goes to show how tame it really is around tunfaire these days for all we city people put down the country no city boy would have risked hanging around with a stranger the real monsters of today live in the citys shadows and cellars and drawing rooms he didnt tell me one thing even remotely useful acting on the premise that it is never wise to put temptation into the path of an honest man i led my team into the woods opposite the area i intended to explore i made sure the beasts wouldnt have the pleasure of deserting me returned to the diamond and checked to make sure they and the rig were invisible then went across and started looking through the bushes it wasnt hard to find where the dead and wounded had been thrown into hurried concealment the brush was torn and trampled the corpses had been cleared away but their drippings had been ignored at least by the cleanup crew the flies and ants had come and gone the bloodstains were now the province of a grayblack whiskery mold that described perfectly every spot and spill which didnt tell me anything except that a lot of people had done a lot of bleeding my woodcraft was no longer what it had been in my marine days but it took no forest genius to follow either of the trails leading deeper into the woods the first i tried split after about a third of a mile heavy traffic having turned eastward suddenly it looked like four or five ogres had been on saucer heads trail when they were recalled by their buddies the other trail ran down into the woods east of where i stood i didnt need to follow saucer head to know where hed gone i turned east five hundred yards along i paused planted the back of my lap on a fallen tree trunk and told my brain to get to work i knew what i would find if i went on a little farther i could hear the flies buzzing and the wild dogs bickering with the vultures much closer and i would smell it too did i have to look basically there was no getting out of it there was maybe one chance in a hundred that i was wrong and the centerpiece of that grisly feast was a woods bison if i was right chances were ten to one against me finding anything that would split things wide open but you cant skimp and take shortcuts the odds are always against you until you do stumble across that one in ten still dead people who have been lying around in the woods for days arent particularly appealing so i spent a few minutes considering a spider web with dew gems still on it before i put my dogs on the ground and started hoofing it toward a case of upturned stomach five years in the marines had brought me eyeball to eyeball with old death more times than i cared to remember and my life since has provided its grisly encounters but there are some things i cant get used to consciousness of my own mortality wont let me the conclave of death was being held at the downhill end of an open grassy area about twenty yards wide and fifty long patches of lichened granite peeked out of the soil i collected a dozen loose chunks of throwing size and cut loose at the wild dogs they snarled and growled but fled they have grown very cautious around humans because bounty hunters are after them constantly especially farm kids who want to pick up a little change for the fair or whatever the buzzards tried to bluff me i didnt bluff they got themselves airborne and began turning in patient circles looking down and thinking someday you too man in the pantheon of one of the minor cults of tunfaire the god of time is a vulture maybe thats why i hate the damned things or maybe thats because theyve become identified with my military service when i saw so many circling the fields of futility where young karentines died for their country so there i stood a great bull ape master of the land of the dead instead of pounding my chest and maybe forcing myself to inhale some tainted air i moved as upwind as i could and started looking at what id come to see there wasnt a woods bison in that mess i muttered i ought to remember saucer heads tendency to exaggerate i counted up enough parts to make at least seven bodies four or five he said hed taken even torn apart they remained ogre ugly theyd been buried shallow beneath loose dirt leaves and stones the lazy way i might call it but i look at comrades differently than ogres do they dont form bonds the way humans do for them a dead associate is a burden not an obligation no doubt they were in a hurry to quit the area too you do what you have to do i got in and used a stick to poke around looking for personals but it took only a minute to figure out that the living hadnt been in too big a hurry not to loot the dead even their boots had been taken that wasnt the behavior of a band expecting to be in the big money soon but with ogres you never know maybe their mothers had taught them the old saw waste not want not i circled the burial site three times but could find no sign of comings or goings other than by the route id followed and that the second group had taken down from the road in places the soil was very moist from groundwater seepage such places sometimes hold tracks i started looking those over trying to cut the trail of a guy on crutches or one who wore his feet backward something that would stick out if i happened to be hanging around with a bunch of ogres and one of the bad guys showed up i didnt expect to find anything but luck doesnt play for the other side all the time got to keep looking for that ten to one i found the nothing i expected though not exactly because there was nothing to be found it was one of those cases of suddenly deciding you ought to be investigating something somewhere else i heard a stir in the woods behind me not much of one thinking some of the dogs had gotten brave i turned with the stick i still carried holy shit a woolly mammoth stood at the edge of the woods and from where i was it looked about ninetythree hands high at the shoulder how the hell it had come up so quietly is beyond me i didnt ask when it cocked its head and made a curious grunting noise i put the heels and toes to work according to the gods design the beast threw a trumpet roar after me laughing i paused behind a twofootthick oak and gave it a stare a mammoth here no mammoth had come this close to tunfaire in the past dozen generations the nearest herds were four hundred miles north of us up along the borders of thunderlizard country the mammoth ambled out of the woods laughed at me again cropped some grass a couple of bales at a time while keeping one eye on me finally convinced that i was no fearless mammoth poacher it eyeballed the vultures checked the dead ogres snorted in disgust and marched off through the woods as quietly as it had come and last night id been unconcerned because no wolfman had been seen since i was a kid like i said luck is not always with the bad guys it was time to stop tempting it with the one out of ten and hike on back to my rig before the horses got wind of that monster and decided they would feel more comfortable back in the city too bad garrett had to ride shanks mare xviii i sat on the buggy seat beside the crossroads obelisk and watched a parade of farm families and donkey carts head up the derry road i didnt see them i was trying to pick between karl juniors farm prison and saucer heads witch the decision had actually been made i was putting the thumbscrews on myself trying to figure if i was going to the farm first just to delay the pain skulking around the other place no matter that i had to head the same direction to reach both and the farm was nearer you dont alter the past turn the tide or change yourself by brooding about your hidden motives you will surprise yourself every time anyway nobody ever figures out why hell with it get up one of the team looked over her shoulder she had that glint in her eye the tribe of horses was about to amuse itself at garretts expense why do they do this to me horses and women ill never understand either species dont even think about it horse i have friends in the glue business get up they got unlike women you can show horses who is boss the bout with introspection rekindled my desire to lay hands on the people responsible for the human equivalent of sending amiranda to the glue works the exit to the farm was up on a ridgeline where the ground was too dry to hold tracks and hidden by undergrowth i passed it twice the third time i got down and led the team giving the bushes a closer look and that did the trick two young mulberry trees which grow as fast as weeds leaned together over the track once past them the way was easy to follow though it hadnt been cleared since donnis departure i had to go through a half mile of woods not a mile it was dense in there dark quiet and humid the deerflies and horseflies were out at play and every few feet i got a faceful of spider silk i sweated and slapped and muttered and picked ticks off my pants why doesnt everybody live in the city i ran into a blackberry patch where the berries were fat and sweet and decided to lunch on the spot afterward i felt more disposed toward the country until the chiggers off the blackberry canes started gnawing the track through the woods showed evidence of recent use including that of the passage of at least one heavy vehicle i had a feeling that no matter what suspicions haunted me i wouldnt unearth one bit of physical evidence to impugn juniors version of what had happened i kicked up a doe and fawn near the edge of the wood i watched them bound across what once had constituted considerably more than a onefamily subsistence farm though now the acreage was wild and heavily spotted with wild roses and young cedars the grass was waist high and some of the weeds were taller a trampled path led down slope to what had been a substantial house there were no domestic animals in sight no dogs barking no smoke from either chimney nor any other sign that the place was occupied still i remained rooted giving the wildlife time to grow accustomed to my presence and return to business the boga hills loomed indigo in the distance the most famous karentine vineyards are up there this country was close enough to have some of the magic rub off but hadnt been turned into vineyards i wondered if someone hadnt gotten that idea and had abandoned the place when they found out why then i recalled donni pell a girl who came from some kind of money who went to work for lettie on contract supposedly because she liked the job a girl who now supposedly owned a place that a few years ago had been in satisfactory shape for a quick sale to tunfaires landhungry lords i doubted it was part of the problem at hand but it might be interesting to unravel the whys ten minutes of pretending i was scouting for the company left me impatient to get on with it i tied the horses got down low and started my downhill sneak the place was as empty as a dead shoe i went for the buggy turned the team loose to browse while i prowled juniors report was accurate down to the minutiae the only things he hadnt mentioned were that the well was still good and his captors had equipped it with a new rope and bucket the horses awarded me a temporary ceasefire after i drew them a few buckets there was no doubt that a band of ogres or a mob equally unfastidious had spent several days hanging around days during which they must have eaten nothing but chicken to judge by the feathers heads and hooves scattered around i wondered how they had managed to pilfer so many without arousing the ire of the entire countryside i did a modestly thorough onceover with special attention to karls lockup that room had the rickety furniture cracked pitcher filthy bedding overburdened chamber pot reported the chamber pot was significant i concluded that its very existence meant i must surrender my suspicions of junior or radically alter my estimate of his intelligence and acting ability if he had put together a fake he had done so with a marvelous eye for detail meaning he had anticipated a thorough investigation despite his getting home healthy and happy which meant i didnt know what the hell it meant except maybe that i had my hat on backward why the hell did amiranda have to die the answer to that would probably bust the whole thing open conscious that i had a passing duty to amber as a client i went over the place again with all due professional care to overlook nothing be that the tracks of a fourhundredpound ogre with a peg leg or two hundred thousand marks gold hidden by throwing it down the well yes i stripped down and shimmied down and floundered around in the icy water until i was sure there would be no gold strike my curses should have brought the water to a simmer but failed i guess i just dont have the knack four hours and the risk of pneumonia turned up just one thing worth taking along a silver tenth mark that had strayed in among the dust bunnies against the wall where juniors blankets were heaped and hadnt been able to find its way home it looked new but it was a temple coin and didnt use the royal dating id have to visit the temple where it had been struck to find out when it was minted but its very presence gave me an idea it also gave me a bit of indigestion for not having thought to ask a few more questions while id had junior on the griddle now i would have to get the answers the hard way on the trip home the hard way but the answers i got were likely to be square the sun was headed west it wasnt going to rebound off the hills out there i had a call to make and if i wanted to get it handled before the wolfmen came out to stalk the wily mammoth i had to get moving the horses let the armistice stand they didnt even play tag with me when i went to harness them up xix saucerheads directions to his witch friends place hadnt included the information that there was nothing resembling a road near her home in fact any resemblance to a trail was coincidental that was wickedwitchofthewoods territory and anybody who managed to stumble into her through that mess deserved whatever he got i had to do most of it on the ground leading the team the armistice survived only because they realized they would need me to scout the way back when we hit the road again all deals would be off the last few hundred yards werent bad the ground leveled out the undergrowth ceased to exist as though somebody manicured the woods every day the trees were big and old and the canopy above turned most of the remaining light lamplight pouring through an open doorway gave me my bearings a rosycheeked appledumplingplump little old lady was waiting for me she stood about fourfeeteight and was dressed like a peasant granny on a christening day right down to the embroidered apron she looked me over frankly i couldnt tell what she thought of what she saw are you garrett startled i confessed took you long enough to get here i suppose you might as well come on inside theres still a bit of water for tea and a scone or two if shaggoth hasnt got into them shaggoth you goodfornothing lout get out here and take care of the mans horses i started to ask how she knew i was coming but only managed to get the old flycatcher open before shaggoth came out and came out and came out that doorway was a good seven feet high and he had to crouch to get through he looked at me the way id look at a decomposing rat snorted and started unhitching the horses come inside the witch told me i sidled in behind her keeping one eye on friend shaggoth troll i squeaked yes hes got jaws like a sabertoothed tiger sabertoothed tiger the goddamned growly things with the fangs she chuckled shaggoth is of the pure blood hes been with me a long time she had me in the kitchen then and was dropping a tea egg into a giant mug that i wished was filled with beer the rest of his folk migrated because you pesky humans were overrunning everything but he stayed on loyalty before common sense i forbore observing that she was human herself theyre not a very bright race come by the by youll have noted that he isnt sensitive to sunlight no that hadnt registered teeth had registered how come you know my name great straight line to a witch how did you know i was co geek amiranda was seated beside a small fire hands folded in her lap staring at something beyond my right shoulder no not amiranda the essence of amiranda had fled that flesh that wasnt a person it was a thing the pain would be less if i thought that way excuse me i glanced at the witch i said waldo told me you would come i expected you sooner whos waldo another pet like shaggoth he can see the future waldo tharpe he told me you were friends waldo there must have been a little hysteria edging my giggle she gave me a frown i didnt know he had a name ive never heard him called anything but saucer head hes not enthusiastic about being waldo she admitted sit and lets talk i sat musing so saucer head jobbed us the big dope isnt as dumb as he lets on i kept getting drawn back to the corpse it did look very lifelike very undamaged any moment now the chest would heave the sparkle would come back to the eyes and she would laugh at me for being taken in the witch settled into a chair facing mine waldo said youd have questions her gaze followed mine i worked on her a little making her look a little better putting spells on to hold the corruption off till she can be given a decent funeral thank you questions garrett i went to a good deal of trouble on waldos behalf what will you need to know anything everything i want to know why she was killed and who ordered it done im not omniscient garrett i cant answer that sort of question though can surmise which may not stand scrutiny in the light of what you already know why she was about three months pregnant what thats impossible the child would have been male had it seen the light of day but she spent the last six months practically imprisoned in the house where she lived there were no men in that house hers was a miraculous conception i opened my mouth to protest but a question popped out instead who was the father im no necromancer garrett the name if she knew it at all expired with her she knew she wasnt the type who wouldnt id begun to get angry all over again you knew her waldo didnt nothing but her name and the fact that you sent her to him i knew her not well but i did tell me about her i talked it eased the pain a little bringing her to life in words i finished did you get anything out of that only that youre working in a tight place a stormwardens family yet did waldo tell you that the assassins were ogre breeds yes a curse on the beasts waldo hurt them but not nearly enough i sent shaggoth to find them he caught nothing but graves there was nothing on the bodies to betray them i know i saw them myself tell shaggoth to watch his step in the woods theres something out there thats bigger than he is youre making a joke sort of a mammoth did sneak up on me while i was looking at those ogre bodies a mammoth here in this day a wonder for certain she rose and went to a cabinet while i sipped tea she said ive been considering your situation since waldo left it seemed and does more so now that i know who she was that the best help i could offer would be a few charms you might use to surprise the villains i looked at amirandas remains i appreciate that i wonder why youd commit yourself that way though for waldo for the woman maybe for your sake laddie maybe for my own certainly for the sake of justice whatever the deed was cruel and should be repaid in coin equally vicious the man responsible should be but your tea is getting cold ill put another pot of water on to boil i got fresh tea this time with firehardened flour briquets that must have been the scones mentioned earlier i gave them a try one should show ones hostess the utmost in courtesy especially when she is a witch shaggoth stuck his head in and grumbled something in dialect that sounded suspiciously like where the hell did my scones go he gave me a narroweyed look when the witch replied dont you mind him she told me hes just being playful right like a mongoose teases a cobra she sat down and explained how i could use the tricks shed prepared for me when she finished i thanked her and rose if you can get shaggoth to help me without breaking any bones in his playfulness ill get out of your hair she looked scandalized at first then just amused youve heard too many stories about witches garrett youll be safer here than out in the moonlight shaggoth is the least malign of those creatures who havent yet emigrated consider the moon consider her ways those who survive in this business develop an intuition for when to argue and when not to argue smart guys have figured out that you dont talk back to stormwardens warlocks sorcerers and witches the place for reservations is tucked neatly behind the teeth all right where do i bed down here by the fire the nights get chilly in the woods i looked at what was left of amiranda crest she doesnt get up and walk at midnight garrett shes all through with that i have slept in the presence of corpses often enough especially while i was in the marines but ive never liked it and never before had i had to share my quarters with a dead lover that held no appeal at all shaggoth will waken you at first light and help you get her into your buggy i looked at the body and reflected that it would be a long hard road home and once i got there id have to face the question of what to do with the cadaver good night mr garrett the witch went around snuffing lights and collecting tea things which she took to the kitchen she started clattering around out there leaving me to my own devices i asked myself what the hell the point was of having nerve if i didnt use it rounded up a small herd of pillows and cushions and tried to convince myself they made a bed i tossed a couple logs on the fire and lay down i stared at the ceiling for a long time after the clatter in the kitchen died and the light went with it the flicker of the fire kept making amiranda appear to move there in the corner of my eye i went over everything from the beginning then went over it again somewhere there was some nagging little detail that added to the maverick coin from the farm had me feeling very suspicious about junior again sometimes intuition isnt intuition at all but rather unconscious memory i finally got it the shoes willa dount had shown me first time i went up the hill those shoes they deserved a lot of thought from several angles in the meantime i had to rest tomorrow was going to be another in a series of long days xx breakfast with shaggoth was an experience he could eat three of him could lay waste to nations no wonder the breed was so rare if there were as many of them as there are of us they would have to learn to eat rocks because there wouldnt be enough of anything else to go around he brought the buggy around front and put the horses into harness with an ease that awakened my envy those beasts trotted out docilely and cooperatively and stood there smirking because they knew i would be irked by their easy acquiescence damn the whole equine tribe anyway the witch came out with a lunch shed packed i thanked her for that for her hospitality and for everything else she ran through the instructions for using the spells shed given me those instructions were as complicated and difficult to recall as instructions for dropping a rock but specialists think the uninitiated incapable of falling without technical assistance i offered to pay for the help again dont start up garrett let me do my little piece for justice in an unjust world somewhere out there there is somebody with the soul of a crocodile somebody who ordered the murder of a pregnant woman find him balance the scales if you dont think you can handle him alone for whatever reason come see me again she was quietly furious about amiranda and she hadnt even known the woman it was curious that amiranda could find so many allies by getting herself murdered and a pity none of us had been around when she needed us most though saucer head had done everything he could i didnt argue anymore ill let you know how it comes out thanks for everything i exchanged glares with the horses putting on a good enough snarl to get my bluff in watch yourself garrett youre playing with rough people i know but so are they they probably know who you are and might know youre poking around you dont know who they are ive had plenty of practice being paranoid i swung up onto the seat glanced back at the bundle id be taking home and hollered at the horses to get going good old shaggoth trudged through the woods ahead of the horses showing them the easy way to get back to the road the way id completely missed coming in the beasts kept glancing back silently accusing me of being a moron i started with the first farm beyond the road to the place where junior had been held no nobody there had seen a young man on foot the day karl claimed to have started home certainly no one of any breed had come there looking to rent or buy a buggy or mount it was what i expected to hear he wouldnt have done it so close but the chance had to be covered it was donkeywork time grasping for straws i had nothing concrete to affirm or deny my suspicions i got the same response house after house some talked easily some not the way people will but the end was always the same nobody had begged bought borrowed rented or stolen transportation of any sort lunch time came and went and i began to consider restructuring my assumptions maybe karl junior had walked home barefoot or maybe hed hitched a ride or had flagged down one of the day coaches running into the city or the ogres might have left him some way to get home that seemed damned unlikely walking stealing flagging a coach presented difficulties too for reasons of character and obvious traceability coachmen remember people they pick up along the road hitching looked like the best and most logical alternative its the way id have gotten myself to town but i doubted that a resort to the charity of strangers would even occur to a spoiled child off the hill but had he gotten home that way my chances of discovering the people who had helped were even more remote than they were by my present mostfavored course so i stuck to what i was doing i reasoned that if he had hitched he would have mentioned it hed been careful to mention such details i now had a strong attachment to the assumption that junior had participated in his own kidnapping i had to caution myself not to get so attached that i began discarding contrary evidence the vision sent me back to wartime days the farmer and his sons and a dozen other men were advancing through the hayfield in echelon scythes rhythmically swinging they looked like skirmishers cautiously advancing i pulled up and watched for a few minutes they saw me but pretended otherwise the paterfamilias glanced at the sky which was overcast and decided to keep cutting all right i could play it their way i slid down walked to the edge of the field where the hay was down already just to show how thoughtful a fellow i am and approached the crowd from the flank the women and kids raking the hay into piles and getting it onto the backs of several pathetic donkeys were much more curious than their men folk i gave them a howdy as i passed and nothing more anything more would have been considered a heavy pass by many farm husbands i parked myself a cautious distance from the guy who looked like he was the boss ape in these parts and said howdy again he grunted and went on swinging which was all right by me i was trying to be accommodating you might be able to help me this time his grunt was filled with the gravest of doubts im looking for a man who passed this way four or five days back he might have been looking to rent or buy a horse why on account of what he did to my woman he turned his head in rhythm and gave me a look saying i had no business going around asking for help if i was not man enough to rule my woman he killed her i just found out yesterday got her over in the buggy taking her to her folks want to find that fellow when i get that done the farmer stopped swinging his scythe he stared at me with squinty eyes that had looked into too many sunrises and sunsets the other scythes came to rest and the men leaned upon them exactly like tired soldiers lean on their spears the women and kids stopped raking and loading everybody stared at me the boss farmer nodded once curtly put his scythe down gently hiked over to the buggy he leaned against the side lifted the cover off amiranda when he returned he stood beside me instead of facing me pretty little gal she was we had a young one coming too looked like wadlow come here one of the older farmers came to us he planted his scythe and leaned he looked even more laconic than the first one you sold that swayback mare to that smartass city boy what day the second farmer considered the sky as though he might find the answer written there five days ago today about noon he eyed me like he was suspicious i might want the money back i knew what i wanted to know but had to play the game out he say where he was headed wadlow looked to my companion who told him you tell him what he wants to know said he was going into the city said his horse got stole didnt say much of nothing else hope you took him good was he wearing shoes it was an offthewall question but about the only thing left i had to ask except was he alone wadlow said didnt have no shoes boots pretty richboy boots wouldnt last a week out here he was by his lonesome thats that then i said the older farmer asked that tell you what you need i reckon i know where to look now and that was true much obliged i checked the sky thank you then i turned to go luck to you she was a pretty little thing my shoulders tightened and i shuddered in a sudden wash of emotion i raised a hand and marched on i had a mans work to do those farmers understood better than anybody i knew except maybe saucer head tharpe by the time i settled on the buggy seat the skirmishers were on the move again and the women and children were back to work maybe they would find the time to talk about me over supper xxi it was late when i entered the city but a sliver of light still remained i had a brainstorm it was a long shot but it might stir something i had amirandas body propped up beside me the witchs spells were holding their own and the light helped with the illusion maybe somebody who knew she could not be alive would see her and think she was to that end i made a few cautious forays into the outskirts of ogre town then went up and circled lettie farens place because a lot of the bruno types from the hill came there to waste their wages the wages of sin is that you get cheated out of them then i headed home going around to the back so no one would see me take the body inside dean was there despite the hour he helped with the door and gawked whats the matter with her mr garrett i wasnt in one of my better humors shes dead thats whats the matter with her murdered he stammered apologized stammered some more so i apologized back and added i dont know why maybe because she was pregnant maybe because she knew too much lets take her in to his nibs he might be able to sort it out the dead man isnt always as hard and insensitive as he pretends he read my mood and saved the usual act that is the one who spent the night it was the first he admitted knowing about that the same let me tell it while im in the mood he let me run through it up to the moment i carried her in there dean ran me mug after mug and hovered solicitously in between i knew i was doing a good job reporting and had done a good one poking around because he didnt interrupt once and his only questions afterward were about the mammoth purely personal curiosity let me mull it garrett you go get drunk watch out for him dean watch out for me why you are working yourself up toward a quixotic gesture you are unreasonable and irrational when you fall into such moods i caution you to restraint the information you have gathered is mainly circumstantial and there is not enough to point an accusing finger accurately tomorrow i will suggest some courses that may possibly produce evidence more concrete more concrete its plenty hard enough for me you expect to tackle the favorite and only son of the stormwarden raver styx on the basis of a pair of shoes and a horse when you know there is a high probability that she would shield him even if he were caught cutting the hearts out of babies in the public streets further you may have chosen the wrong villain to be the target of your wrath who else that is what you will have to discover it is true i believe that there is a reasonable probability that the young dapena and the dead woman were involved in a contrived kidnapping but that is not a certainty one simple fact could explain away all the evidence you have adduced as indicting the younger karl here you go playing games with my mind again how are you going to explain everything away two hundred thousand marks gold a payoff of that magnitude could waken charity in the heart of a beast as foul as an ogre perhaps perhaps they saw no need to plunder their hostage of pocket money damn him he could be right the problem with this thing was that there were too many answers instead of not enough i dont believe it i insisted take this and reflect upon it in your cups then what became of the gold huh insofar as you know the gold was turned over correct by the woman ambers direct statement and by implication from others all the young people wanted out of the stormwardens household but the younger dapena returned would he have done so if it had been he who had received the gold or would he have run you may have to attack it through the money after all or possibly through the entertaining girl donni pell who looks like the candidate for the connection with the ogre community this time i said it aloud damn you he let me have a dose of the mental noise that passes as his chuckle come back in the morning garrett i will suggest an approach i started to go but there was the thing that used to be amiranda staring at me with empty eyes what about this leave it we will commune whats this are you a necromancer as well as a mental prodigy have you been hiding some of your lights under a bushel no i expressed myself figuratively only co away garrett even my boundless tolerance has its limits and you are pressing them i went off and got myself rather sloppily wrapped around a few gallons of beer faithful to his orders old dean hung around and shoveled the pieces into my bed when it was time damn the dead man anyhow why did he have to complicate things xxii old dean knew how to get me going on the morning after he bullied me into eating a good breakfast when he thought i was slackening he started banging pots and pans until i yielded to the lesser evil and resumed eating a good big breakfast with plenty of apple juice and sweets really knocks the edge off my hangover but food always looks and smells so ghastly i just cant believe it will do any good once id stoked up to deans satisfaction he presented me with a huge steaming mug of a smokyflavored herb tea that had come to us courtesy of morley dotes sometime back it had a mildly analgesic nature his nibs is ready anytime you are mr garrett you may take the mug along with you he was going to trust me carrying something out of the kitchen myself i gave him a look that he interpreted correctly he grumbled that room was creepy enough with one corpse in it he can clean up after himself if hes going to keep the other one in there with him i rose from the kitchen doorway i said maybe theyll get married feeble but it wasnt my best time of day dean gave me a black look and reached for the biggest pot he could find the dead man was trying to sleep when i stepped into his room he was long overdue for one of his threeweek naps but now wasnt the time wake it up old bones youre supposed to have some suggestions for me this morning he had several but none of the first few was fit to record i observed i take it youre sure enough of your glory mooncalled theory that you can indulge in a little smug snoozing the latest from the cantard contains nothing contradictory you going to break down and tell me not yet what about the suggested approach you promised me last night would have thought that you would have seen the best chance already you had the night to reflect on next moves i took the night off give you are allowing yourself to become dependent upon my genius you should be exercising your own garrett we human types are bone lazy come on pay the rent get the younger karl bring him to me he appears to be the weakest link in the chain of circumstance if there is a tumor of guilt in him i will open him up and expose it one glimpse of that poor child there should be shock enough to leave him pliable thats all i have to do eh just go drag him out of that fort he calls home and bully him into coming here where you can work him over cannot do your legwork for you garrett bah he was getting a sarky tone on him old bones was maybe hed stub a toe on his glory mooncalled theory and get dragged down from the heights of conceit oh how he loves to strut there was a foreign object just inside the front door dean he came at a run yes mr garrett what the hell is this actually i knew what this was it was my old pal bruno frozen in midstride two steps inside the front door and leaning against the wall his expression was one of terror and one hand grasped the air before him dean had used that to hang up the sweater and knit cap he wears when he comes in early mornings that showed me a side of him i hadnt suspected he came to the door while you were out in the country when i answered he just busted in past me his nibs must have heard the uproar better than a watchdog and nobody bothered to tell me you had things on your mind howd he get against the wall i pushed him out of the way i have to get in and out to do the marketing i stepped over in front of bruno what am i going to do with you you just keep coming back maybe drop you in the river to see how fast you swim ill have to think about it because youre getting to be a nuisance i turned to dean maybe we ought to get a chain so things like this dont happen dean admitted his nibs could have been asleep the problem of brunos ego slipped my mind as i trudged up the hill i had a bigger problem how the devil could i get to junior let alone pry him out considering the attitudes of some up there i might not get close to the stormwardens place the hired guards might be waiting for me they werent not obviously i tramped around the dapena place three times hoping maybe amber would spot me before eenie meenie meinie and moe started closing in and i had to show the hill the flash of departing heels it didnt work i had to go i decided to take a long walk sometimes getting the blood moving vanquishes the gloomier humors and the brain will come up with a thought the best i could manage in three hours of marching was the notion of sending junior a letter saying i knew where the gold was and if he would come down to my place we could talk it over the trouble with that was it might take a lot of time i didnt have he might dither a couple of days or he might not be able to slip his leash or the letter might not get to him at all with highly unpredictable results and amirandas body wasnt going to keep forever for want of something more constructive to do i went around to saucer heads place to see how he was mending a girlfriend i didnt know said he was keeping just fine and i should get the hell away before i got my eyes clawed out she was no bigger than a minute but she had her back up and looked like she would give it a damned good shot so much for saucer head maybe something had fallen into morleys lap besides somebodys wife or an eggplant steak dinner morley wasnt anxious to accept visitors that early in the day but he was awake so i was allowed to go upstairs he greeted me with a scowl and no banter i said you look like a guy who isnt getting enough fiber in his diet whats the matter was there a crop failure in the okra forests he grumbled something that sounded like goddim fraggle jigginitz would you want your virgin daughters to hear language like that snacken schtereograk aha he was cussing all right but in one of the low elvish dialects ive learned that when he goes to grumbling in elvish hes usually having money troubles been playing the water spiders again have we garrett are you a curse upon my house he actually used a dwarfish idiom equally capable of being translated as motherinlaw but im such a nice fellow nobody would ever accuse me of motherinlawing youre the reverse blackbird you know that the backward harbinger every time i have some bad luck i have some more because you turn up right afterward i can count on it you dont want me hanging around stop betting on the bugs theres a simple causeandeffect relationship there very much like the one between betting on the bugs and losing your boots he repeated his curseuponthehouse remark what do you want garrett i want to know if youve heard any news i might find useful no ogre town is as quiet as a crypt those guys came from somewhere else and they took the gold with them when they went back there hasnt been a whiff of gold around town if there was a hint of a pile that size you know the hard boys would be as busy as maggots saucer head is doing all right i know i found out the hard way hes got some little shedevil standing gate guard i thought i was going to get gutted before i got out of there who the hell is she he gave me the first flash of teeth of the visit his sister maybe horse pucky nobodys sister carries on like that he grinned actually i did hear one thing you might want to know but i dont see how it would be much use well a drunken sailor off a night boat staggered in here right before we closed this morning the gods know why he came here i was just thinking that myself only they know why anybody does night boat is a euphemism for smuggler smugglers account for a third of tunfaires river trade you want to hear this or do you want to wisecrack your way to ignorance speak to me oracle of the lettuce he mentioned that raver styxs ship entered the harbor at leifmold the afternoon they left for tunfaire shes on her way home garrett shell be here in a few days if that will make any difference in the way you do what you think you have to do it might i figure junior deserves special attention because of saucer head and amiranda having mom around might present difficulties thats the whole barrel then go away so i can feel sorry for myself right next time you got to bet on the bugs let me know so i can get down the other way and clean up there wont be a next time garrett good for you morley i left the room thinking i had heard it before he might hang in there awhile but sooner or later hed hear about a sure thing and the fever would get him i told the barman downstairs send him a couple of turnip tenderloins smothered in onions and a double shot of your highproof celery juice straight up on me he didnt crack a smile i headed home my head filled with visions of a steak so rare morley would die to look at it xxiii dean had the place sealed up tight good for him sometimes he forgets i pounded away he came and peeked through the peephole he made a production out of checking to see if i was there under duress then he started clinking and clunking as he unlatched latches he flung the door open am i glad youre finally here mr garrett he did sound glad he retreated i went in after him started to pull the door shut what the hell whats this we had gained another hall ornament this one went by the name courter slauce when it wasnt in the homefurnishings racket dean but he was headed for the kitchen at a highspeed shuffle and dared not battle the momentum he had developed he tossed an answer over his shoulder but it didnt have enough oomph behind it it fell on the floor before it got to me i paused beside slauce finances take a turn for the worse youll never make ends meet housebreaking funny he didnt answer he could hear well enough though and i could almost hear the nasty thoughts slithering round inside his head i told him youll make great company for bruno hes been dying for a shoulder to cry on i stepped past bruno such a quandary drop in on the dead man and let him know i hadnt yet found a way to lure junior into his lair or track dean down and find out why we had another statue in the hall dean won the toss he was closer to the beer as i pushed through the door i heard dean saying there there now itll be all right mr garrett is here now hell take care of everything sure he would he stepped on in to get a better idea of where to start dean had his arms around an amber who was shaking and looked like eighteen going on a terrified ten instead of thirty dean was patting her back and trying to still her tears the same dean who had stamped her with his scarlet seal of disapproval something had shaken her badly and the soft heart inside the old crabs shell had melted to her terror well i asked sidling to the cold well somebody want to give me an idea whats going on amber let out a growl tore herself away from dean charged into me opening the floodgates as she came so much for having a beer dean had the grace to look embarrassed as he drifted to the cold well i let amber get the tears out there is no point interrupting a woman when she is crying if you dont get it over in one big chunk you have to take it in a lot of little ones that come at unexpected and inopportune times meantime dean got me a mug when amber was down to the sniffs and quivers i set her in a chair and told dean to break out the brandy we keep for special occasions i settled opposite her in handtouching range and went to work on my mug the first half went down quick and easy when i thought she was ready i asked can you talk about it now she took a big bite out of her brandy before she nodded i have it under control it was just the circumstances i guess domina and my father having a screaming argument that had everybody running for cover then the news about karl then when i finally managed to sneak out so i could come talk to you courter caught up with me down the street and when i wouldnt go back home the look he got made me think he wanted to kill me too i went kind of crazy and ran away screaming but if the whole world has gone crazy dont i have the right to get a little crazy myself the words tumbled out of her tripping over one another in their haste to dance in the open air hold it halt stop good girl now take a deep breath hold it count to ten slowly good now tell me what happened start from the beginning so it makes sense dean took my mug which needed filling and at the same time interrupted if youll pardon me mr garrett the most important point comes out of order her brother is dead i stared at amber she shivered nodded she was counting well past ten how they say he committed suicide that caught me flatfooted i didnt know what to say before i got my mind in order my permanent motionless houseguest broke all precedent and reached out beyond the bounds of his demesne garrett bring them in here dean caught it too he looked to me for instructions do what he says i guess amber come with me my associate wants us to talk it over in his presence do i have to keep thinking two hundred thousand marks gold im not sure i want to keep on of course i do i want out of that place more than ever now ill never feel safe there again lets go then dont worry about him hes harmless to those who intend him no harm id forgotten one thing xxiv amber let out a squeal that was half pain half horror i thought she would faint but she was made of tougher stuff than i suspected she hung on to my arm a bit while she stared at amiranda then got hold of herself stepped back looked at me whats going on garrett thats what i found instead of the gold she stepped over to the corpse bring mr slauce garrett it may be helpful to present him with the same shock what about the other one dispose of him once we are done here he should have learned his lesson want to give me a hand dean i didnt doubt that i could manage slauce by myself if nothing else i could tip him over and roll him but why strain myself we dragged him inside and per instructions set him down facing amiranda amber seemed in control again she said you have some things to tell me ill tell you my story if youll tell me yours about then the dead man loosed his hold on courter slauce i went to the door to make sure he didnt use it before we were done with him he shook all over there wasnt much bluff in him when he looked around he didnt say anything that disappointed me id expected some bluster and the invocation of the stormwarden i want to know some things i told him i think miss dapena has a few questions too its even possible miss crest might want to know why she was killed his eyes darted to the corpse i dont know nothing about that were did that come from i thought she run off domina has been chewing my butt for days because she managed to get out of the house with her stuff never mind that i was halfway across town delivering a letter to one of the baronets girlfriends when she did it that wouldnt have done for an excuse anyway since i couldnt tell her he is telling the truth he believes garrett then he wasnt in on it not wittingly though i did not say that garrett all right slauce who kidnapped junior what the hell how should i know what the hell are you doing sticking your nose in anyway you got paid youre out of it that supposes nobody but willa dount would hire me slauce i think you know the answer to the question just in case though ill tell you the answer nobody kidnapped him unless a man can kidnap himself my main interest though is why did amiranda have to be killed and who said the word that made it happen amber opened her mouth i raised a hand cautioned her to silence slauce didnt need to know her angle you are getting ahead of yourself garrett no interrogation or manipulation of this man can be soundly founded until we have heard everything miss dapena has to tell us have you forgotten what brought her here or is her brothers demise too trivial for consideration i hadnt forgotten i was stalling having to deal with ambers grief and hysteria and hoping for a breakthrough with slauce that would give me the answer to my own dilemma but i wasnt thinking soundly not to hear amber out would be stupid since im one of the smartest guys around it wouldnt do for me to tarnish my image by doing something dumb you win old bones but upon your head be the rainfall it was not i who felt compelled to charge off to the rescue it is possible with great concentration to shut him out if he has other things on his minds he always has to have the last word there are times he has all the disadvantages of a wife with none of the advantages amber you feel up to telling me what you came to tell all settled down now slauce started snarling girl you dont talk to this guy about nothing you dont do nothing but march yourself straight home i scowled at the dead man and said you had to let him get his second wind amber told slauce shove your elbow up your nose courter you dont scare me anymore in a couple of days you and domina are going to be hanging out in the wind arent you maybe you could bullsmoke your way around karl but not karl and amiranda and im sure not going back there and give you guys a chance to explain to mother about karl and amiranda and me what kind of crazy talk is that girl your brother killed himself just like amiranda ran away give me credit for knowing my brother youre not going to sell me that my mother isnt going to buy it either and im not going anywhere near any of you people not when two out of the three family heirs suddenly turned up murdered three out of four i tossed in just to see how high the water would splash amiranda was pregnant three months the child would have been male that was a surprise to both amber and slauce it silenced them but if it wakened any suspicions they concealed them well i faced the dead man indicated slauce shut him off will you i dont need him shoving his oar in while the lady is talking what lady slauce went stiff as a corpse timely revelation garrett you have him rattled and reflective but you may have cost yourself your credibility with the girl she has begun to suspect that you have not been candid about your own motives yeah xxv i said i think the best way would be for you to start right after the last time we talked amber balked you arent interested in anything but ami oh i admitted an interest and i want whoever did this to her i dont like people who waste attractive young women but if you think im immune to the charms of a share of two hundred thousand marks gold then youre a lot sillier than i think you are listen here id be on this trail just as hot if that was you over there and amiranda was standing where you are i want the guy behind it and ill bet your mother will too once she gets here therell be hell to pay she is going to buy it garrett you slick talker i gave the dead man the look he deserved amber right now all i have to work with is what you can tell me she stalled long enough to satisfy her ego then got to it courter saw you when you were leaving he ran right to domina naturally and she flew into one of her rages only more so ive seen her angry before but i never ever saw her lose control she screamed and threatened and threw things and scared karl so bad he told her everything we said so its good we didnt say anything about the gold he would have told her about that too i didnt tell her anything that made her mad all over again so she had courter give me a beating and lock me in my room they didnt let me out till this morning she pirouetted pranced over to slauce slapped him and danced back there they it turned out had been karl who had come to her while the house was asleep unlocking her door he had seemed severely troubled but had refused to explain except to say that hed had all that he could take and was going away now and wouldnt be back but that didnt mean he was going to kill himself i didnt believe he was the type either not enough guts youd better go over what he said there might be some hint there try to recall his exact words and actions i dont know how i could get his words more exact except that he asked me to go with him i told him i wasnt miserable enough yet to give up and run without any prospects but he was really something had shaken him badly he was pale he couldnt stand still he was sweating in othere words he was scared terrified like he had seen a ghost thats funny what is thats exactly what i thought then that he must have seen a ghost maybe he did at least secondhand go on he left as soon as he knew i wasnt going with him any hint where a safe place with an old friend is what he told me when i asked donni pell maybe thats what i thought when he said it the way he said it donni pell or ami i just figured he knew where ami went why amiranda they grew up together they were close they always had their heads together if she ran away he had to know where she went she wouldnt go without leaving him a message somehow even if he was kidnapped when she went the more i saw of them the more the workings and relationships of the dapena family baffled me all right it could have been amiranda but it wasnt because she was dead we have to assume it was donni pell that might not be true but anything else seems unlikely given his nature it would have been a woman correct who else did he know no one you or i know about i guess ill have to go there and see this business was all legwork morley would approve of the exercise i was getting go on with the story your brother decamped headed for parts unknown frightened then what twenty minutes later courter came they knew karl was out they wanted me to tell them where he went they courter it wasnl really they till later but courter didnt come on his own they sent him i assume you gave him valuable advice on the placement of his elbow yes so my father took his place he was as pale and sweaty as karl had been and he had a wild look that scared me like he was so terrified he was capable of anything he didnt get anywhere either he did a lot of yelling my father yells a lot i mostly just stayed out of his reach till domina came in she tried to keep me from hearing what she said but i heard part of it shed heard from one of the staff that karl had heard that mother was in leif mold meaning mother could show up anytime because she could get to tunfaire almost as fast as the news that she was coming father really got excited then and amber seemed ashamed i want you to know i love my father even when he does irrational things i tried my raisedeyebrow trick i hadnt been practicing lately she wasnt impressed he screamed at domina to get courter theyd beat it out of me she couldnt calm him down so she went out i guess to get courter father came after me and he actually did hit me he never did that before not himself and i picked up a shoe and bopped him over the head he went away and he didnt come back a couple hours later i heard him and domina having a screaming match all the way from her side of the house but i couldnt tell what it was about i thought about sneaking over and eavesdropping but i didnt i was scared to go out of my room everybody was going crazy and then a little while after that i decided i had to get out of that house forever no matter what even if you cant find the gold why because one of the servants told me that karl had committed suicide when i heard that i knew i had to get away far away where nobody could find me or i might be dead too only i didnt run fast enough i guess because courter caught up with me just before i got here he even tried to come in and drag me back out when your man let me in i considered courter then the dead man he would be monitoring slauces reactions as closely as he could the man is a villain for certain garrett but he appears to have no guilty knowledge concerning the death of karl junior or his supposed kidnapping much of what he has heard here has been news to him he appears to be slow of wit and it could be that he is considered too stupid to be trusted i faced amber youre convinced your brother was incapable of taking his own life yes i told you that already all right that gives me a new line of attack where when and how did it happen i dont know you dont know you mean you just dont you start yelling at me too she lifted a foot snatched off a shoe and brandished it three seconds later we were shaking with laughter i got hold of myself gave slauce a look shifted it to the dead man he knows dean take miss dapena to the guest room and get her settled while youre at it you might as well fix yourself up for a few more nights were going to need you here yes sir he sounded excited at least he was in on this thing miss if youll come with me she went reluctantly xxvi i think i have to revise my strategy i said i was going to let slauce have the works so he could go home and get things stirred up assumed as much i believe it is time you approached mr dotes on a purely business basis instead of favor for favor you need more eyes right things are stirred up enough without me sticking my hand in can you make him forget what hes seen and heard here i think so then lets see what he has to tell about junior checking out the dead man released his hold on slauce friend courter was vulnerable when i asked he answered and didnt start toughening up for several minutes he gave me an address and an approximate time of death only two hours after karl had fled his home how did he do it i asked for courters sake going with the suicide fiction he slashed his wrists that was the clincher aw come on and you believed that you knew the kid if youd said hed hanged himself i might have thought it was just barely possible but even i knew him well enough to know he couldnt cut on himself he was probably the kind of guy who couldnt shave because he was afraid he might see a speck of blood do not press garrett you will get him to thinking for him that might prove to be a dangerous new experience he just wanted his own job made easier you go see mr dotes now by the time you return mr slauce will have forgotten this episode entirely he will be a bit intoxicated take that into consideration when you are planning how you will remove him from the premises and you might as well consider doing the other one while you are at it right grumble i left him to his fun morley rented me five thugs his discount to the trade left their price only semiusurious i assigned one man to keep an eye on my place just in case something happened that the dead man couldnt handle alone the world is filled with unpredictable people one man got the job of keeping track of courter slauce the remaining three got the unenviable task of trying to keep tabs on the denizens of the stormwardens house i told them they should report to morley dotes would have a better chance of tracking me down if there was something needed to know five men werent enough to do the job the way it ought to be done but this one was out of my own pocket the only client i had was one who had retained me on a contingency basis and while i was willing to grab off a chunk of that ransom i had a pessimistic view of my chances i made a mental note to quiz amber about what she had learned regarding domina dounts handling and delivery of all that gold disposing of bruno and slauce was an easy half hours work with a borrowed buggy an unconscious bruno got dumped into an alley where hed soon waken hungry enough to go into the cannibal business courter wasnt all the way out he was just roaring drunk i dont know how the dead man managed that he never said i just walked slauce into a tavern sat him down with a pitcher then look the buggy back where it belonged then it was time to go see what could be seen at the scene of juniors suicide xxvii the wooden tenements three and four stories tall leaned against one another like wounded soldiers after the battle but the war never ended down here time was the enemy never to be conquered and there were no reserves to help stay the tide it was night and the only light in the street fell from doors and windows open in hopes the days heat would sneak away that was a hope only slightly less vain than the hope that poverty would take to its heels the street was full of seriousfaced gaunt children and the tenements were filled with quarreling adults the corners though lacked their prides of narroweyed young men looking for a chance under the guise of cool indifference no dares issued or taken they were all in the cantard burning youths energy in futility and fear soldiering the war had that one positive spin off when you wanted to talk about your crime you had to go find senior citizens who remembered the good old days before the war i still had to watch my step for reasons evoking no romance at all there were as many dogs in the street as kids and at any moment the sky might open and spit out a cloudburst of refuse there were sanitary laws but who paid attention there was no one to enforce them the place i sought was one more crippled soldier in the host three stories that had seen their youth spent before the turn of the century i planted myself across the way and considered it assumption junior had run to his friend donni pell when he felt the heat assumption donni pell had been in on and had helped stage juniors kidnapping the nature of the place where young karl had died implied that there was something wrong with one or both assumptions having collected possibly the biggest ransom ever paid in tunfaire why would she hole up in such a dump if he hadnt run to donni then who no other name had come up junior didnt have friends not even one apparently death had sniffed out his hiding place in under two hours all the excitement was over and had been for many hours in that part of town even the most grotesque death was a wonder only until the blood dried i began to be an object of interest myself standing there doing nothing but look i moved there are no locks or bolts on the street doors of those places such would only inconvenience the comings and goings of the masses packed inside i went in stepped over a sleeping drunk sprawled on the battered floor the treads of the stair creaked and groaned as i went up there was no point in sneaking sneakery would have been useless anyway getting to the right room on the third floor took me past two others that had no doors families fell silent stared as i passed the death room had a door but not one that would close tightly it skidded against the floor as i pushed it was the sort of place i had pictured one room eightbytwelve no furnishings one window with a shutter but no glass a bunch of blankets were thrown against a wall for a bed and odds and ends were scattered around one corner had walls and floor spattered with patches and brown spots it had been messy but those things always are there is a lot of juice in the human fruit they must have fastened him down somehow you dont carve on someone without them putting up a fuss i kicked around the place but found no ropes or straps or anything that might have bound him i guess even ogre breeds have sense enough to pick up after themselves sometimes or did they mixed in with the tangle of bedding was a familiar item from karls description it was a doeskin bag with a heavy long drawstring just the thing to pop over a guys head and choke him unconscious it was stained with dried vomit i pictured some fastidious thug hurling it aside in disgust you might not need to tie a guy if you strangle him before you cut he could bleed to death before he woke up its a halfmark silver a week as is you want furnishings you bring your own i gave the woman in the doorway my innocent look what about the mess you want cleanup thats a mark right now you want fixup take care of it yourself come off the rent she looked at me like i was crazy you pay up front every week you show me youre reliable after a few months i might understand if youre one or two days late three days and out you go got that she was a charmer in every respect had she not possessed the winning personality of a lizard a guy might have been tempted to have her hair and clothes washed she couldnt have been much past thirty only the inside had gone completely to seed but the rest wouldnt be far behind youre staring like you think the place comes with entertainment she tried a cautious smile from which a few teeth were missing that costs you extra too i had a thought an inspiration perhaps what do hookers do when they get too old or too slovenly to compete not all can become lettie farens maybe this was someone donni had known before she had become a landlady im not so much interested in the room as i am in the tenant i palmed a gold piece let her see a flash her eyes popped then her face closed down became all suspicious frowns framed by wild filthy hair the tenant the tenant the person who lived in the room also the person who paid for it if they werent the same still the suspicious eyes who wants to know i looked at the coin dister greteke old dister was a dead king of which we in tunfaire are blessed with a lot we could use a live one if hed do something worthwhile a double looks like one to me it was a kid named donny pell i dont know where he went he paid his own rent she reached youre kidding donny pell eh did you meet him while you were still in the trade i put the coin on the windowsill drifted away she licked her lips took one step she wasnt stupid she saw the trap taking shape but she couldnt shake the greed and maybe she thought she could bluff me she took another step in moments she was at the window and i was at the door you going to tell me what do you need to know donni pell but female from lettie farens place came here to hide out maybe a week ago right she nodded she had a little shame left you knew her before i was there when she first came to the place she was different than the other girls ambitious but kind of decent then if you know what i mean maybe she got too ambitious the knuckles of her right hand whitened as she squeezed the coin shed been out of the trade awhile it had been awhile since shed seen that kind of money doubtless when it had been easy come she hadnt thought to put any aside her gaze strayed to the bloodstains she developed weird tastes in friends ogre breeds that surprised her yeah how did you i know some things some things i dont you know some things and you dont know what i dont know i borrowed a trick from morley dotes by getting my knife out and going to work on my nails so why dont you just tell me everything you do know about her and the people who visited her here her bluff was a feeble bolt and she knew it but she tried i yell and the whole place will be in here in half a minute ill bet the fellow in the corner thought the same thing she looked at the bloodstain again fair is fair i was just seeing if youd pay a little more all right what do you want to know i told you everything especially who else was here this morning and where she is now to forestall the next round of delays i added i dont mean her any harm im looking for some of her playmates shes gotten herself caught in the middle of a big and deadly game maybe very deadly for her if there was to be a next victim in this mess id put all my money on donni pell if i had any chance i wanted to find her before the villains eliminated the next link in their chain of vulnerability i dont know where she went i didnt know she was gone till somebody found the mess thats the gods honest truth mister she sounded like she was telling the truth i must have had a ferocious look in my eye she was getting nervous but with a hooker you never know their whole lives are lies and some of the falsehoods run so deep they dont know the difference look mister just keep talking sweetheart ill let you know when ive gotten my moneys worth only three people ever visited her here that i know about the one who killed himself here this morning if she wanted to keep up the pretense on that it was all right by me that was the only time he ever came that i know of another one came twice both times he was all covered up in one of them hooded cloaks rich guys wear when they go out at night i never saw his face i never heard his name inconvenient for me that but she was doing all right considering how tall shorter than you i think i never was very good judging how tall people are how old i told you he wore one of them cloaks what about his voice i never heard him talk when did he come here i was determined to get something last night was the first time he stayed about two hours i guess you can figure what they were doing then he came back this morning i was all over her then trying to pin down the order of events but she couldnt get straight who had come when i think the cloaked man was first maybe not maybe it was the one who killed himself the other one came last though im pretty sure two of them was here at the same time i think but i dont know which two she wasnt very bright this woman also she had been very scared donnis third visitor who it developed had visited almost every night had spooked her she was sure almost that the cloaked man had been the first to leave maybe tell me about this third man this regular visitor this guy who scared you so bad he sounds interesting he wasnt interesting to her she didnt want to talk about him at all he was bad mojo i took that as a good sign she knew something here with a little sweet talk im badder mojo lover im here a little deft work with the knife all right bruno all right you dont have to get mean he can take care of you himself the guys he ran with him called him gorgeous if you ever saw him youd know why he was meaner than a wolfman on weed ugly part ogre i thought what else there had to be an ogre in it somewhere ugly so ugly you couldnt tell if he was a breed or not he came with different guys different times some of them breeds some of them not but always with this one breed he called skredli my eyes must have lit up and not entirely with joy she backed away a step threw up a hand looked for some place to hide easy woman skredli now thats a name ive been wanting to hear are you sure sure im sure you told me only three men ever came here but now youve got this gorgeous visiting with a crowd the ones who came with him never came inside they were like bodyguards or something except that skredli guy did come inside this morning i think and maybe one other time yeah thats right i think he even come here one other time too by himself and stayed with her a couple hours i forgot about that ick she shuddered doing it with an ogre i want this skredli where do i find him she shrugged i dont know ogre town i guess but when you find him youre going to find gorgeous too and maybe the girl only shell probably be dressed like a boy again using donny pell why dont you get out of here why dont you leave me the hell alone do you know anything else no of course you do who came for the body what were they going to do with it i guess they were his family or from his family fancy people off the hill with their own private soldiers and no charity in them for poor people they talked like they were going to have him cremated i grunted that was the thing to do if you didnt want anybody getting too close a look at the stiff like say the woman who had given life to the flesh or maybe i was too suspicious this business can do that to you you have to remember to keep it simple you dont need to look for the great sinuous complicated schemes reeking of subterfuge and malice when a little stupidity followed by desperate coverup efforts will explain everything just as well and you have to remember to keep an eye out for who stands to gain that alone will flag your villain eight times out of ten that more than any other facet of the affair baffled me this time not the gold side of course however that worked out the gold was its own explanation but who could profit from the death of amiranda crest how and why i stared at the woman she wouldnt know i doubted that she knew anything more worth digging out step back into the corner please thats fine now sit yourself down she grew pale her hands clasped around her knees were bone white as she fought to keep them from shaking youll be all right i promised i just want to know where you are while i go over this place again i found exactly what i expected to find zip i took the doeskin bag and headed out as i passed through the doorway the woman called after me mister do you know anybody who wants to rent a room xxviii i found myself a syrupy shadow and installed myself across from the tenement the street was empty of people now and of the more honest cats and dogs the yelling and scuffling inside the buildings had died down the slum was gathering its strength for tomorrows frays i waited i waited some more then i waited a band of pubescent marauders swept past in search of trouble but they didnt spot me i waited after two hours i gave up either the woman had no intention of running to gorgeous and skredli or she had left the building another way i suspected she felt no need to take warning i set myself for a long night first home to let the dead man know what id learned then to morleys place to find out what his people had reported and to learn what he knew about a thug named gorgeous maybe more after that if anything interesting had turned up the interesting stuff started before i got to the house despite the hour there were a bunch of guys hanging around out front i held up and watched awhile that is all they were doing hanging around and not trying to hide the fact i moved a little closer i could then see that they wore livery closer still i saw that the livery belonged to the stormwarden raver styx not being inclined to cooperate if they were waiting around to do evil when i showed i slid away and approached the house from the rear we had no company back there i rapped and tapped till i got deans attention he let me in what have we got dean company from the hill i suspected that thats why im so good in this business when i see fifteen guys hanging around in the street i have a hunch that weve got company what about our guest upstairs buttoned up tight and keeping quiet she knows i warned her good where is the company in your office waiting impatiently shell have to keep on waiting im hungry and i want to let the old boy in on what i picked up and i wouldnt mind guzzling about a gallon of beer before i face that harpy that made two chances id given him to ask how id guessed that my company was domina dount and twice that hed ignored the bait he has his little ways of getting even wont do no good to bother his nibs hes gone to sleep with an outsider in the house i suppose he trusts you to handle it deans tone suggested he had a suspicion that the dead mans genius had lapsed that maybe hed rounded the last turn and was headed down that final stretch toward loghyr heaven it looked like i now had two of them who couldnt keep straight who owned the house and who was the guest or employee i wouldnt be surprised if dean wasnt thinking about moving in hed reached the occasional nagaboutmoney stage be nice dean or ill leave you standing at the altar and run off with willa dount he didnt find that amusing i might as well be married the way things are going around here he slapped a plate in front of me like an old wife in a snit but the food was up to par i permitted myself a satisfied smirk xxix up north along the edge of the thunderlizard country there is a region called hells reach its not wholly uninhabitable but nobody lives there by choice everywhere you turn there are hot geysers steaming sulfur pits and places where the raw earth lies there molten quivering occasionally humping up to belch out a big kabloop of gas the lava pools sprang to mind the instant i saw willa dount all her considerable will was bent toward restraining a hot fury she had an almost red glow about her but was determined to give it no vent good evening i said had i expected a caller i wouldnt have stayed out so late i settled myself and my mug i hope you havent been inconvenienced too much before id left the kitchen dean had reminded me about sugar vinegar and flies and id taken his advice to heart its not smart to go out of your way to make enemies of the hill anyway it has been a wait but my own fault she replied amazing that she would admit the possibility of fault in anything she did but had i sent someone to make an appointment i would have been delayed even longer if you would have been willing to see me at all im certain you would have refused to come to me again yes im aware that you dont hold me in high regard mr garrett certainly your contacts with my charges have done nothing to elevate your opinion even so that shouldnt interfere with a business relationship in our contacts thus far you have remained for the most part professionally detached thank you i try i do sometimes indeed and i need you in your professional capacity once more not just for show this time it was my turn to say indeed but i fooled her i showed her my talented eyebrow instead im desperate mr garrett my world is falling into ruin around me and i seem to be incapable of halting the decay i have come to my last resort no thats getting ahead of myself i told my face it was supposed to look enrapt with anything she might say i have spent my entire adult life in the stormwardens employ mr garrett beginning before her father died its seldom been pleasant there have been no holidays the rewards have been questionable perhaps by being privy to inside information ive managed to amass a small personal fortune perhaps ten thousand marks and ive developed an image of myself as a virtual partner in the stormwardens enterprises able to be trusted with anything and capable of carrying any task through to the desired conclusion in that spirit ive done things i wouldnt admit to my confessor but with pride that i could be trusted to get them done and trusted not to talk about them later do you understand i nodded no point slowing her down so a few months ago she was called to the cantard because the course of the war seemed to be swinging our way and it was time to put on all the pressure we could she left me to manage the household as she has done a dozen times and especially charged me with riding herd on her family all of whom had been showing an increasing tendency toward getting involved in scandals the two karls you mean theyre the ones the rumor mill loved i never heard of the daughter till the other day she was blind the stormwarden those girls were the ones who were deserving though amber had begun to show signs of getting wild just for the attention i nodded as my contribution she took a deep breath since shes been gone this time its been like ive been under a curse father and son were determined to circumvent me at every turn then that kidnapping business had to come i had to deplete the family treasury severely selling silver at a discount to get that much gold together it was a disaster but for a cause the stormwarden could respect once her temper cooled i might even have survived amirandas having taken flight during the confusion the girl was restless for some time before she took off the stormwarden herself had remarked that it was coming but putting out two hundred thousand marks gold to ransom karl only to have him take his own life thats insupportable was i supposed to know about junior or not instinct told me to play it cautious did you say that karl killed himself this morning he slashed his wrists and bled to death in a hole of a room in fishwifes close why the hell would he do that i dont know mr garrett and to be perfectly frank at this point i cant much care he destroyed me by doing it maybe that was his motive he was a strange boy and he hated me but karl isnt the reason i came here im doomed when the stormwarden returns which she will very shortly however my pride badly mauled but not yet dead insists i go on trying to salvage what i can on her behalf amber fled the house this morning this is where you come in i told my face to look interested amiranda and amber are at large and therefore at risk if i can salvage that much for the stormwarden i will im going to try i have gone into my own funds to do so i want you to find those girls if you can she plomped a sack down in front of me one hundred marks gold to retain you ill pay a fee of one thousand marks gold each if you can return either of those girls before the stormwarden comes home your man slauce cant handle courter slauce is an incompetent imbecile this morning i sent him after amber he turned up just before i left to come here too drunk to recall where hed been or what hed been doing i console myself with the certainty that hell starve to death after the stormwarden chucks the lot of us into the street will you look for my missing girls mr garrett give me a few minutes to think i had to smooth out some dents in my ethics and reach an accommodation with my conscience i considered myself to be working for three clients already myself saucer head and am her though amber wasnt getting the firstclass production and nobody was paying me willa dount would be paying though she wouldnt be getting her moneys worth still an experiment had occurred to me suppose i had a notion where i could find one of the girls right now do you take it as a supposition how can i be certain id get my fee she levered herself out of her chair straining like a woman decades older i came prepared for that possibility what might have been a smile tickled the corner of her mouth she started digging sacks out of her clothing in a minute there was a line of ten before me each a twin of the one offered me as a retainer i checked the contents of one at random it was good eleven hundred marks gold more than id ever had a chance at before with prospects for another thousand which i could collect easily certainly a temptation to test the dark side of a mans soul we all look for the big hit hope for it talk about it but i dont believe we think about it not seriously because when its suddenly there a lot of thinking has to be done amiranda was dead and what was amber to me morley always says the supply of women is inexhaustible and who would i have to explain to or make excuses to just to myself with maybe the dead man smirking over my shoulder still there was the possibility of a useful experiment i rose and collected the gold in one big bear hug come with me dean had turned down the lamps in the dead mans room i dont know why he thinks that makes any difference the dead man doesnt care about light one way or the other when he wants to sleep hell sleep through sun lightning or earthquake i hired me down and deposited the take beside his chair domina dount asked are you going to deliver something or not mr garrett turn around for a moment she was human she let out a little squeak and raised her hands to her cheeks but she asserted control taking a full minute to get the parts into the desired order then she murmured will the disasters never end she faced me i presume you can explain explain what she took ten seconds eyes closed i prodded you engaged me to find and deliver to you if possible amber dapena and amiranda crest ive done half the job already she stared at me and hated me through narrowed eyelids her voice remained neutral though as she remarked i had hoped that you would deliver them in better health she is dead not in a trance or ensorcelled yes amiranda has been in poor health for some time now your attempts at wit become tiresome garrett i suppose i can assume that you werent the agent of death i want to know the who what when where why and how so did i my experiment had flopped domina dount wasnt about to be flustered into giving anything away if there was anything in her that i didnt already have well she demanded why not i might still shake something loose the day you were supposed to make the ransom payoff amiranda hired a friend of mine as her bodyguard that night he accompanied her into the countryside north of tunfaire she took several travel cases with her she went to a crossroad near lichfield where she stopped my friend thought she expected to meet somebody there and that he was supposed to have been dismissed when that somebody showed who i dont know he she or it never came a band of ogre breeds did instead my friend killed some of them but he couldnt drive them off or keep them from killing amiranda he couldnt even save himself though the ogres thought he was dead enough to throw into the bushes with amiranda and the other casualties when they scattered to keep from being seen by travelers my friend found the strength to pick amiranda up and carry her three miles to someone he knew who he hoped could save her to no avail of course my friend isnt very smart hed failed he was outraged and his pride was hurt somehow he got back to tunfaire as far as the bledsoe infirmary where i got his story in the deathwatch ward willa dount frowned uncertain why id told her what i had youve left something out havent you yes why because you dont need to know because no one needs to know except my friends friends some of them are the kind of guys who eat ogres for breakfast who figure theres some balancing due for what got done you couldnt crack willa dount with a hammer she looked at me straight in the eye and said thats why youve been digging around and poking your nose in yes the storm warden resents people who pry into her familys affairs ill bet she resents people killing her kids even more me and my big damned mouth id blown a potful for free there but she didnt seem to notice maybe but those who stick their noses in often become victims of deteriorating health i chuckled ill keep that in mind im sure my friends friends will too they might even be so disturbed theyll give the problem enough attention to handle it before she gets home id abandoned the tactic of experimentation for the strategy of increasing the pressure on willa dount not that i had her fixed for anything but she knew things wanted to know maybe she would tell me some to get the heat off how about you tell me the how where and when of the ransom payment domina dount smiled a thin smile no mr garrett she thought she was covered if she had any need i shrugged so be it do you need a way to transport the body i could send my man i came in a coach that will do ill send my men in to get it no you wont you have the coach brought ill carry it out she smiled again very well as i looked away from the coach domina dount told me you will try to deliver amber in better condition wont you i took a count of five letting my irritation with her confidence in the power of her gold cool out i kept reminding myself that it was just business ill do my damnedest she climbed into her coach smiling sure shed taken the round by getting to me more than id gotten to her i wasnt so sure she was wrong i went inside to see what the dead man thought of her the fat dead son of a bitch had slept through the whole damned thing xxx i finished a long cold one and wiped my lips i feel like killing the keg but the night has only just begun tell miss dapena the domina has gone but if she has the least sense and regard for her life she wont even peek out a window we may have reached a stage where people are cleaning up loose ends real and imagined im going to see mr dotes ill slide out the back in case somebody is watching you lock up tight dont answer the door unless you look first and see that its me dean scowled but hed been around long enough to have seen tight times before he got out a meat cleaver and his favorite butcher knife both sharp enough to take your leg off without you noticing go on he said ill manage i went out thinking that someday id come home and find the house littered with dismembered burglars dean was the sort who would handle an invasion neither calmly nor with the minimum necessary force bruno and courter slauce were lucky that hed been surprised and unarmed i didnt realize that id collected a tail until i was threequarters of the way to morleys place it wasnt that i hadnt checked for one he was that good he was so good in fact that half a minute after id made him he knew it and didnt walk into either of the setups i laid to get a look at him i might as well have had a signed confession there are only three guys in tunfaire that good morley dotes and i are two of them and morley had no reason to skulk around behind me the other guys name is pokey pigotta and he might even be better than we are ive heard him accused of being half ghost pokey is in the same line as me had domina dount hired him to keep an eye on her hired hand that seemed unlikely who then by then pokey would have realized that id read his signature hed start trying to outguess me i resisted my impulse to play that game and call for him to join me silliness pokey pigotta had conservative views of what constituted his obligations to a client to hell with it i figured i headed for morleys place i went in the front door and straight around the bar the surprised night barman just gawked as i shoved through the door to the kitchen the rutabaga butchers stopped work and stared i strolled through like a royal prince assessing the provincials very good my man very good you lets have a little more thought to portion control that whateveritis is sliced too thick i made it to the storeroom before the peasants rose and lynched me the storeroom led me directly to the back door which i used i did a quick sprint down the alley and up the side lane to the corner in time to watch the front door swing shut behind pokey good he had decided that since i wasnt going to play games he wasnt going to either hed just trudge after me not bothering to sneak and that might suit his client fine since it would inhibit my more surreptitious ventures i watched the door close and grinned recapturing a view of the customers as i trotted through it couldnt have been choreographed more beautifully suckered you pokey i murmured and ran for the door he had scanned the lay and turned to leave he was a tall guy without much meat on him all bones and angles and skin so pale youd have thought the breed half of him was vampire he tended to make strangers very nervous sucked you in this time pokey i peeked over his shoulder saucer head tharpe was up and coming hiding his infirmities well i had no idea what the hell he was doing there but i was glad to see him pokey shrugged i blew one what you up to pokey you say something garrett i been having trouble with my ears saucer head arrived whats up garrett every eye in the place was on our gettogether me and pokey was just headed up to see morley i finally got a lead on those fellows you had the runin with the other day youre welcome to sit in i gestured pokey surrendered to the inevitable comfortably certain that i wanted nothing from him badly enough to make an enemy i would have seen it the same if our roles had been reversed i followed pokey saucer head followed me all eyes followed us up the stairs morley of course was expecting us so what do you want to do with him morley asked since he wont want to say why hes dogging me or whos paying him i dont know whether to let him tag along or not so better safe than sorry hes got to go into storage how long a day maybe pokey sitting or following it all pays the same morley thought for half a minute then told one of his boys blood you want to politely collect mr pigottas effects and put them on the table here pokey endured it i knew how he felt id been through it several times myself morley stirred through the take which included a lot of silver he examined one piece temple coinage i took one private mintage all right the same as the tenth mark i found on that farm tell you something morley asked yeah who he isnt working for domina dount never had anything but gold so who put him away i told morley theres things to talk about and decide and maybe do and its late already blood the root cellar gently and politely consider him a guest under restraint yes mr dotes xxxi morley removed his troops from the room with just two witnesses saucer head relaxed and betrayed how uncomfortable he really was i spent a minute or two telling him what a dope he was he didnt argue he didnt go home to bed either morley told me only thing my boys have told me that you probably dont know is that junior dapenas body got taken to the crematorium by the dount woman on her way over to your place i assume you know he did himself in i know only he didnt kill himself he had a lot of help from his friends you have that gleam in your eye garrett does that mean you know who did it yep and one of them was an ogre breed named skredli and it just happened that a skredli was involved in juniors socalled kidnapping and most likely in the attack on saucer head and amiranda and this skredli runs with a character named gorgeous who sounds like hes some doubleugly whats up morley gorgeous you did say gorgeous yeah you know him not personally i know of him i dont like that look in your eye then look at the wall or something while you tell us about it while i talked saucer head sat nodding to himself i pretty much opened the bag and dumped it morley got out paper and pen and ink and started doodling when i closed the sack up morley said the donni pell trick is like the hub of a wheel you have connections between her and everyone but the dount woman you cant tell about the crest woman but you can assume she knew who donni was since she was good friends with junior this donni is the key lets see if we cant lay hands on her i exchanged looks with saucer head the man is a genius isnt he think hes figured out that shes the next one wholl come floating belly up if the hard boys are nervous enough to cut the son of raver styx morley said i think the next casualty will be a guy called gorgeous though maybe im wrong he still had that look why saucer head asked always direct friend waldo tell me about gorgeous ive never heard of him you ought to keep up better garrett hes important im trying if youll get to it sure he hasnt been around long his real name is conrad staley he came from hasefbro after the kingpin checked out figuring it was a good time to cut himself a piece of the big city hes human but hes so damned mean and ugly he ranks with ogres he brought his own gang to start but i hear most have gone back since hes found local recruits keeping the old base secure there was a hot feud for a while with chodo contague but they sorted it out gorgeous got ogre town he pays a percentage to keep it in peace chodo doesnt want a war because hes having trouble keeping his own people in line chodo contague was the thug who had taken over as kingpin after the old kingpins demise he was more powerful than most of the lords of the hill though he lived in the shadows anything we do that involves gorgeous chodo is going to have to approve morley was moving toward the door now it could mean war you guys sit tight if you need anything tell them downstairs ill be back in a couple hours where the hell are you going i asked to talk to chodo he was out you wondering what im wondering garrett im not wondering saucer head i know chodo contague was boss of the tunfaire underworld in part because a certain morley dotes had presented the old kingpin with a coffin containing a hungry vampire the old kingpin had opened the box thinking the thing inside had been killed before delivery saucer head and i had been pallbearers in that shenanigan our buddy morley hadnt bothered to tell us what was going down beforehand his reason for the oversight was sound he had figured we wouldnt help if we knew the perceptive little bastard had been right i was going to collect favors on that scam for a long time hes in debt again saucer head the bug races again but i dont want to try ogre town alone so let him play his game im not going to sit around here waiting for him though if i have to kill a couple hours ill do it getting something useful done saucer head just looked at me a big tired guy who had been pushing himself too hard i knew that if we ended up going after gorgeous as i would do one way or another saucer head would go along if he had to drag himself you might as well get some sleep see you in a couple i got scowls downstairs but nobody stopped me xxxii i went to playmates and pounded around until he got out of bed he never stopped grumbling and cussing but he got out the wagon and hitched up a team he even managed the obligatory refusals when i tried to pay him though he did end up accepting the money as he always does he needs it no matter how much he pretends the larkin crematorium was one mile away i pushed though there was no real need juniors body had been delivered late if id heard morley right so it wouldnt have been sent to the oven yet that wasnt permitted at night religious and secular law both forbid cremation during the hours of darkness a soul freed during that time would be condemned to walk the night forever there are only three crematoriums in tunfaire i was sure junior was at the larkin place because it was convenient for anyone coming to my home from the stormwardens and the night porter wasnt an honest man the world is cancerous with people possessed some have to vent their sicknesses on the dead and others have to pander to them i pulled the wagon into an alley near the crematorium and left the team bound in a spell woven of the direst threats i could conjure at least i got their attention i did it the way id heard it was done going to the side entrance tapping a code and waiting while i was examined through some hidden peephole the door opened i had to grit my teeth to keep from laughing or groaning the night porter was a character straight out of graveyard spook stories a hunchback ratman so ugly i suspected his beauty would under shine that of the creature gorgeous hopefully before the night was done id have the opportunity to compare if there was a password i didnt know it and he didnt care i showed him a gold piece and he showed me the room where the bodies were laid out like the old joke people had been dying to get in seven of the ten slabs were occupied by the anxiously waiting dead ratman was a born salesman he lifted a sheet this heres the best we got and youre the only customer tonight he snickered the girl was about fourteen there was no obvious cause of death she might even be a virgin it was one of those times when you want to break bones but for business reasons you put your feelings on ice and smile i stepped past him and lifted a sheet at the head of a corpse that looked the right size not my man second time was the charm this one how much to take him with me ive never been looked at like that before and hope never to be again i saw he was going to argue so i laid a tenmark gold piece on an empty slab i doubt hed ever seen one before greed touched those hideous features but caution was just a step behind that one came off the hill mister you dont want to mess with it youre right i dont want to mess with it i want to buy it but why for a keepsake im going to have the head shrunk and wear it for an earring mister i told you that ones off the hill people are going to come for the ashes give them ashes how many of these are city projects tunfaire has a porkbarrel ordinance requiring unclaimed found and paupers corpses to be distributed in rotation among the dozen mortuary businesses paid for out of the public purse its a racket that accounts for the majority of each businesss income most families just bury their dead in the nearest churchyard four but id have to bring the boss in how much he wouldnt be doing his business without the silent approval of his employer without being greedy i could just take it and leave you in its place it was a definite temptation the ratman gulped twenty marks theres ten ten more when i have it loaded ill be back in a minute he might have taken his chances and locked me out but that was unlikely while ten more marks were afloat he gobbled some but i ignored him ten minutes later i had what was left of junior dapena installed in the wagon i faced the hunchback gold in hand the same people will bring another one today unless they insist on watching the job i want that one too itll be female the gods help you if its touched do you understand he gulped do you understand yes sir yes sir cautiously he reached for the gold i avoided his touch when i let him have it dean answered on the second knock he was dressed havent you been to bed couldnt sleep what is this are you collecting bodies now mr garrett just a few that might be useful im taking it into the dead mans room get the doors for me if he wakes up and wants to know about it tell him it was junior dapena and im saving him for his mother dean turned green but handled his part the corpse settled a little shaky i returned to the kitchen and put away a couple quarts of beer before leaving youre off again mr garrett the nights work isnt done wont be night all that much longer he was right the light would soon make its presence known xxxiii i beat morley back to his place but barely in time to waken saucer head then dotes came with his men blood sarge and the puddle he also had two other guys in tow i didnt know them personally and didnt care to get acquainted because i knew who they were crask and sadler chodo contagues firststring lifetakers they had been born human since then theyd been embalmed and turned into zombies without the nuisance of dying first what the hell are those guys doing here i snapped it didnt help that they seemed equally pleased to see me and saucer head morley was up to his old tricks calm down garrett unless you want to go after gorgeous by your lonesome i bit my tongue morley said this is the way its got to be garrett gorgeous holes up in ogre town hes got those people buffaloed down there but they wont lift a finger if he suddenly turns up missing him and his numberone boy skredli you want him chodo wants him chodo will back your play as long as youre the face out front but he wants first crack at them once theyre rounded up you give him a list of questions you want asked hell get the answers wonderful thoroughly wonderful morley i was hot so hot i didnt trust myself to say anything else morley met my gaze evenly shrugged i got the message but i didnt have to like it saucer head was steamed too but he covered it better he rose laced his fingers and bent them back until the knuckles cracked you got to live with what you got to live with lets do it while theyre still asleep he headed for the door wait morley said this isnt a stroll in the woods with your girlfriend he stepped behind his desk and fiddled with something part of the wall opened exposing the biggest damned collection of deadly instruments ive seen since i parted with the marines saucer head looked at the arsenal and shook his head it wasnt a shake of refusal but of astonishment he joined morleys thugs in stocking up crask and sadler had brought their own i had too and thought i was adequately outfitted morleys scowl told me he saw it otherwise i selected one knife long enough to be a baby sword and another prissy little thing of the sort ladies carry on their garters morley didnt stop scowling but didnt comment either i preferred my headknocker for all but the most desperate situations and for those i had what the witch had given me we trooped downstairs morleys boys in the lead chodos headhunters behind speculative eyes observed our descent and pursuit of the pathway id used on pokey earlier but at that hour there were few customers left and most of those were beholden to morley there should be no rumors born soon or messages run the barman beckoned morley as we passed dotes stopped to trade whispers he caught up at the door to the alley that was the latest from the river the stormwardens boat was spotted at dusk twenty miles down tying up for the night then shell be here tomorrow afternoon late id guess the winds are unfavorable it was something to think about i didnt have enough to ruminate already the alley was filled with the huge black hulk of a fourhorse closed coach and two gargantuan characters with shiny eyes and sparkly fangs grinned down from twenty feet hi guys they were grolls half troll half giant green by daylight all mean and tougher than a herd of thunderlizards i knew these two they were twothirds of triplets who had gone with me into the cantard to bring out a woman who had inherited a bundle despite what we had been through together i hadnt the slightest notion whether or not i dared trust them they had been cursed with unlikely names doris and marsha a little of what i call ally insurance morley told me you think im a raving moron for bringing chodo in no i think you think itll get you out from under your debts i hope youre right youre a cynical and suspicious character garrett its people like you who make me that way morleys troops were inside the coach and saucer head was clambering aboard crask and sadler were up on the guards and drivers seats donning the traditional tall hats and dark cloaks each man had immediate access to a pair of powerful ready crossbows such items are necessary on tunfaires night streets if youre rich enough to use a coach but not powerful enough to have its doors blazoned with the arms of someone like a stormwarden most highclass folk travel with outriders we made do with a pair of grolls toting their favorite toys headbashers twelve feet long and almost too heavy for a runt like me to lift morley followed me into the coach then leaned out and told crask to go the vehicle jerked into motion i suppose youve made a plan i said its all scoped out that was one of the reasons i brought chodo in his boys know gorgeouss place ive never seen it and neither have you i grunted the rest of the ride passed in silence xxxiv ogre town was quieter than death at that hour there seems to be a cultural imperative that sends them to bed very late and brings them out in the afternoon we were going in soon after most ogres had sacked out the streets werent entirely deserted but it made little difference those who were out were scavengers they made a point of being blind to our presence twelve hours earlier or later we might have been in trouble the streets would have featured a more treacherous cast we swung into a passage between buildings just wide enough for the coach then continued until we could open the doors crask told us to disembark we tumbled out he backed the coach into the passage again so we could gather in the shadows off the street thats the place morley indicated a fourstory vertical rectangle a hundred yards down the street the whole thing belongs to gorgeous he had the buildings on either side demolished so nobody could get to him that way were going after him that way wonderful light still shone in a couple windows on the top two floors youre a genius the buildings in ogre town are fifty to a hundred years older than the tenements in fishwifes close in many cases that showed but they had built in brick and stone in those days and gorgeouss citadel had been kept up it didnt need to lean on neighbors to remain standing there was a ghost of a promise of dawn morley said doris and marsha are going to climb the buildings on either side theyll drop ropes me crask blood and sarge will go up top the nearer one the rest up the other after we get our wind he droned on with the plan it sucks i told him you want to march in the front door and fight your way to the top no hell if i didnt have questions to ask id just go start a fire on the ground floor ought to go up that thing like smoke up a chimney but you do want to ask questions ready so lets go doris and marsha were already gone not bothering to wait out my protests we were halfway there when the man came out the front door his hands were shoved in his pockets and he was looking down he was human not ogre he walked fifty feet toward us before he realized he wasnt alone he halted looked at us and his eyes bugged bruno i hissed he whirled and headed for the building sadlers crossbow twanged it was a damned good try for a snap shot i think it clipped brunos left arm he veered right and headed up the street concentrating on speed let him go ill hunt him down later i said he has some answers i need while i talked crask sped a bolt that split brunos spine three inches below his neck sadler reached him seconds later and dragged the twitching body into the nearest shadows thanks a bunch i snarled crask didnt bother turning that embalmed face my way doris and marsha reached the roofs of their respective structures they anchored ropes and dropped them inside gorgeouss place the lights were dying saucer head and i stood at the foot of the rope you going to make it i asked you worry about yourself garrett aint nothing going to stop me now he started climbing i held the rope taut saucer head went up like he was seventeen and had never been hurt in his life sadler followed with not one but two crossbows slung on his back then the puddle lucky garrett got to do it with no one to tauten the rope when i reached the roof i found that marsha had already leaped to gorgeouss roof saucer head was tying off the rope the groll had tossed back sadler was leaning on the chimney that anchored both ropes sighting one crossbow on the topfloor window light still leaked through its shutters i wondered if marshas rooftop landing had been heard below i didnt see how gorgeous could help but be forewarned with nearly two tons of groll prancing over his head puddle joined marsha saucer head and i followed i pretended the void below was really just water a foot beneath my dangling toes the pretense didnt help sadler stayed where he was he untied the rope so marsha could haul it across and resumed his lethal posture marsha bent one end of the rope into a harness for me as i got into it i wondered what was wrong with gorgeous and his boys were they deaf or just chuckling as they got a little surprise ready for us i was going to find out all too quickly there was enough light now to see morley getting into a similar rig doris hoisted him and dangled him over the side the universe twisted an abyss appeared beneath me i turned at the end of the rope glimpsing sadler aiming too close for contentment marsha swung me in against the brick then over to peek through the cracks in the shutter at first i saw nothing no ambush evidence no excitement nobody just an empty room then an ugly someone opened a door and shoved his face into the room and said something i couldnt hear to someone i couldnt see the back of the other someone appeared momentarily as he followed the ugly someone out the door the set of his shoulders said he was aggravated i waved saucer head tied the rope to something they left me hanging evidently the report from the far side was favorable too marsha leaned over the edge and let go a mighty bash with his club a second later he lowered saucer head at the end of a mile of arm and flipped him through the window saucer head grabbed me and dragged me inside puddle came through an instant later the room was uninhabited except for the insect life infesting the stack of bunk beds saucer head and puddle headed for the door while i battled ropes like a moth in a spider web there was one hell of a racket going on somewhere else a guy came charging through the doorway just as saucer head got there his nose and saucer heads fist collided no contest the ogres eyes rolled up saucer head thumped him again as he went down just for spite i got loose and charged after saucer head and puddle into a narrow hallway that deadended to our left as we turned right a couple of breeds popped out of another bunkroom doorway they were no more fortunate than their predecessor saucer head was in one of those moods in the meantime heaven put on its dancing shoes and began hoofing it on the roof the grolls were pounding away with their clubs the racket elsewhere revealed itself as a lopsided battle between morleys crew and gorgeous and about ten breeds several more ogres were down with quarrels in them and as we came to the rescue yet another made the mistake of stepping in front of the window he squealed like a throatcut hog as he fell the bolt had gotten the meat of his thigh poisoned probably being a nice guy i just whapped a couple of heads with my stick instead of stabbing backs with puddle saucer head threw ogres around the way us ordinary mortals might work through a pack of house cats holes appeared in the ceiling as the grolls kept pounding away their blows so powerful they smashed through twobyten oak ceiling joists our rear attack turned the tide suddenly the numbers were ours gorgeous made a run for the stairs i flung a foot out and got enough of his ankle to unbalance him his momentum pitched him into the doorframe the fight seemed over but it wasnt yet won ogres are tough and stubborn a few were still upright morleys boys left them to us and went to work finishing the ones who were down i yelled a complaint that got ignored id gotten through the worst without a scratch the others had a few dings and small cuts except sarge who had collected a ribdeep slash across the chest and had taken himself out of the action to tend it not that one saucer head roared at puddle you save that one for me he slammed the last upright ogre into unconsciousness then explained thats the one that was in charge when they killed the girl panting i asked you see any others that were there just him he dragged his ogre out of the mess morley said thats the one called skredli id suspected as much for several minutes there had been considerable racket downstairs now gorgeous levered himself up and roared morley and i jumped on him too late to shut him up the stairs drummed to stamping feet an ogre stampede arrived there must have been twenty in the first rush they pushed us across the room into the far wall grolls hammering heads from above scarcely slowed them and more kept coming sarge couldnt defend himself adequately puddle went down i thought morley was a goner it looked grim for the rest of us gorgeous shrieked hysterical bloodthirsty orders it was time for something desperate xxxv i dropped the witchs gift and stomped on it the crystal shattered i followed instructions and covered my eyes taking several vicious blows as a result a thread of fire sliced the outside of my left upper arm hell called the proceedings to disorder i opened my eyes the mob bawled like cows in a panic flailed wildly purposelessly some howled and clung to the floor i danced away from the nearer crazies and unlimbered my headknocker according to the witch they were seeing three of everything and their universe was revolving but that didnt make them easy meat there were so many of them flailing around i watched gorgeous bang into the wall three times trying to get to the stairs i tried to reach him before he got away my luck ran its usual taunting course i was two ogres short of getting him when he made it out he went tumbling downstairs caterwauling in pain and fear i wanted that man bad but not bad enough to abandon friends to fate i returned to my harvest i took a few whacks myself getting the mob done but lay them low i did morley i saw had survived after all he leaned against a wall pale as death saucer head stood with feet widespread grinning a big goofy grin the grolls who had caught just the edge of the spell looked in through the ceiling and grinned too they had helped with the headknocking morleys man blood sat in a corner puking his guts up sarge and puddle were somewhere under the mess we all needed patching up i stumbled to the window it was light out now and there were sounds outside people sounds ogre town folks were awake and interested it was time to pick up our toys and get out shut your eyes you dopes i told everybody get your hands on the wall and follow it around to the door to the stairwell wait for me there what the hell did you have up your sleeve this time garrett morley asked in a voice pitched an octave too high he gagged as he fought to avoid upchucking from the vertigo none of your damned business just be glad i had it you tactical genius come on get over by the door while i find puddle and sarge and skredli an ogre groaned i gave him a tap on the noggin there would be plenty of headaches later i found skredli first dragged him over and gave him to saucer head sarge turned up next morley sarge checked out you want to take him home what for hurry up i smell smoke so did i i started digging for puddle oh hell morley said what would i tell my guys if i left somebody behind theyd tell me i was no better than these ogres he babbled to the grolls in their tongue they jabbered back he told me shove sarge up where doris can get a hold of him and hurry they say theres a mob shaping up crask and sadler have been shooting the boys down when they run out the front door i found puddle he was alive and would make it with help i got him to morley im going down first you guys come as fast as you can i bounded down the stairs noises rose to greet me it sounded like somebody dragging himself i overtook gorgeous on the secondfloor landing as he was getting ready to head down the last flight but to catch him i had to jump the fire he had started halfway to the third floor he had a broken leg he wasnt seeing more than double now and nearly stuck me before i bopped him i checked for other enemies the only ones left upright were down at the front door three or four just inside arguing about how they were going to get out that door was the only groundfloor exit anybody who used it ran into a crossbow bolt i hustled back to help the others past the fire it was growing but we managed only morley got singed i couldnt restrain a chuckle at his pathetic appearance hes one of those guys who spends hours on his appearance the problem of the ogres below solved itself i went after them behind a bloodthirsty shriek brandishing my knives and they flushed like a covey of quail hitting the street now wed learn the value of morleys ally insurance i stuck my head out no bolt greeted me i stepped out carefully looked around frowned what had become of the mob i saw no one but the flying ogres and the grolls who had clambered down the outside of the building the coach came pounding out of its alley swung in and stopped crask growled get them in here theres soldiers coming troops no wonder the streets were empty we tumbled inside piling on the coach floor crask and sadler took off before we sorted ourselves out the grolls loped ahead scouting i got myself seated this is weird morley they dont call out the troops for squabbles in ogre town the coach thundered through alleys that had to be too narrow around corners that had to be too tight whatever faults the boys up top had lack of guts was not among them morley grunted in response to my remark they only come out for riots and theres maybe only eight or ten people who can deploy them morley grunted again you figure it out garrett right now dont give a damn he was in pain if bruno hadnt gone down bruno was off the hill bruno had been visiting gorgeous it took a lord from the hill to order out the army maybe bruno worked for somebody who thought enough of gorgeous to call out the troops to save him the whole affair began to tilt in my head maybe bruno and a few facts id ignored needed reexamining ive got to find out who he worked for nobody bothered to ask what i was muttering about a frightening notion had crept into my mind perhaps junior dapena his family and his keeper were innocent of bloodletting the coach careened onto a major street scattering pedestrians drawing curses from the other drivers around another corner then a slowdown to become just another vehicle in the morning flow i never saw a soldier five minutes later we halted behind morleys place sadler growled at us to get the hell out i was exhausted and hurt and about as tired as i could get of someone else taking control of what i had started easy garrett morley said keep your mouth shut and get inside stuff it morley ive had it do what i tell you itll improve your longterm health picture he grabbed me and with help from saucer head got me through the back door i was more amenable once i noted that our ally insurance had vanished morley had saucer head help get his men inside sadler crawled into the coach to babysit gorgeous and skredli the coach rolled morley suggested why dont you go upstairs and make a list of questions you want asked ill have a messenger run it then go home and sleep youll feel more reasonable afterward i supposed if saucer head could endure not getting first crack at skredli i could live without an immediate shot at gorgeous all right but i had a feeling i wasnt going to get a lot of rest on the way upstairs i glanced out a window toward ogre town a pillar of smoke stood like a gravestone over a ferocious fire maybe most of our grim handiwork would be erased thanks to gorgeous the last thing i needed was to get labeled a tool of the kingpin i made my list pointless exercise that it was the tricky part was wording questions about two hundred thousand marks gold so that my standin would not realize what he was asking and gleefully begin interrogating in his own cause i solved the problem by mostly avoiding it and entering a plea for direct access to the boys and maybe even possession of that trifle skredli that done i went back downstairs where the survivors were getting patched up and trying to eat breakfast i was so far gone i didnt comment on the platter they brought me i just gulped a quart of fruit juice and stuffed my face i asked saucer head you got anything left ive got something i want you to do after i finished with him i cornered morley and talked him into turning the tables on pokey pigotta if we let him go and shadowed him he might lead us to some interesting places if he didnt lead us into deep trouble first xxxvi amber and dean were in the kitchen when i got home i went in and collapsed into a chair saucerhead thought my example so outstanding he copied it dean and amber stared at us was it a difficult night mr garrett dean asked you might say if you care to understate you look like hell amber said whatever it was i hope it was worth it maybe we caught up with the people who killed your brother and amiranda i watched her carefully she responded the way i had hoped with no sign of panic or guilt you got them what did you do did you find out anything about the ransom we got them you dont want to know anything more i didnt find out anything about the money but i didnt have a chance im still working on it how well could you manage if you had a thousand marks to start your new life pretty damn good my needs are simple youre up to something garrett spill it dean muttered been around him too long already starting to talk like him i love you too dean amber domina offered me a thousand marks if i could find you and turn you over to her before your mother gets home ive had word that shell get here this afternoon if you want the money ill take you home around noon and my friend here will stay with you till youre convinced youre safe she eyed me through narrowed lids whats your angle garrett the girl could think when she felt the urge willa dount she knows things she wont tell me there arent any sanctions i can threaten to pry them out of her all i can do is find ways to put the heat on and hope she does something interesting what about the ransom garrett thats what were supposed to be working on her eyes remained narrowed i dont think theres much chance of getting it do you really with your mother home probably not but you dont act like youre trying saucer head began working on a breakfast dean had offered him i gawked he was putting it away like he hadnt eaten in weeks despite having just eaten at morleys but rabbit food will do that domina offered you that money last night and you didnt grab it no dean was pouring apple juice i realized i was dry all the way down to my corns give me about a gallon nothing like a good tense situation to sweat you out saucer head grunted agreement around a mouthful it isnt the money is it garrett demanded amber saucer head tittered whats with you oaf she figured you out garrett he chuckled youre right little girl with garrett its almost never the money you want to talk waldo how rich do you figure on getting in this he gave the name a black look then shrugged theres just some things you got to make right amber knew we meant much more than we said she scowled if you can be noble so can i ill go home but cut it close all right all right what will you do now get some sleep its been awhile since ive had any sleep how can you sleep in the middle of everything easy i lie down and close my eyes if you want to stay busy and vent some nervous energy remember everything you can about karls friend donni pell why because she looks like the common denominator in every angle of whats been happening because i want to find her bad i had a notion adding donni pell might even explain the marvelous appearance of troops in ogre town my guess was that with gorgeous and skredli out of the equation she stood a chance of surviving long enough to be found and questioned i hoped she hadnt suffered a sudden and uncharacteristic seizure of smarts and wagged her manipulating tail out of town i drank apple juice until i was bloated then rose thats it im putting myself on the shelf wake me up at noon dean ive got to go rob a crypt before i sell miss dapena into fetters saucer head you can sack out in the room dean uses dean grumbled and muttered what sounded like threats to revive his interest in finding me a wife among his female kin i ignored him he wouldnt learn and i was too tired to fight xxxvii dean didnt wake me as instructed amber pirated that chore with a half hour head start the brief rest hadnt been enough to restore my resistance i fear i succumbed amber wasnt a disappointment when i ventured into the kitchen i realized dean had found his missing scowl mask it was as ferocious as ever he has pretensions to gentility though so he said nothing i devoured a few sausages and hit the street i listened to the talk around playmates place where the old men hang out they had a dozen theories about what had happened in ogre town some were as crazy as the truth but none were correct collecting amirandas corpse was cut and dried i paid they delivered i drove it home and dean helped me lug it into the dead mans room have you taken up a new hobby garrett he was awake id thought i might have to start a fire to get his attention or are you getting into a new line once in a while i like to have somebody around who doesnt get temperamental dean tells me you have been having adventures yes and if youd stay awake and do a little work id have a lot fewer i brought him up to date at last you have begun to understand that several things are happening at once i am proud of you garrett you have begun to think i wondered how long you would discount the repeated appearances of the bruno person particularly in view of your first collected fact having been that the younger karl left his house to investigate a pilferage problem that the dount woman suggested might have another hill family at its root you figured there might be a connection eh of course but you didnt bother to mention it you have become too dependent upon me you need to exercise your brain yourself the reason youre here at all is so i dont have to strain my brain we humans are born bone lazy remember with innate ambition and energy levels only slightly above those of a dead loghyr do not make a special effort to irritate me garrett you have done adequately with your collection of corpses and your parade of frenzied females if you have a question you cannot handle yourself spit it out otherwise relocate yourself in some demesne where the mentality is sufficiently naive to appreciate your wit all right genius answer me this who killed amiranda crest is that something else youve been holding back waiting for me to get my head bashed in while i tried to find out the hard way suppose you mean do i know who gave the order that resulted in miss crests death at the hand of the ogre breed skredli and his henchmen to be precise we must be precise garrett an intelligent mind is not ambiguous i could have talked about that for hours but i resisted do you know whos responsible no do you know why chances are if we knew that we would know who as well garrett i can render at least three plausibilitys immediately though i will discount the pregnancy as motive till such time as you produce evidence that she told someone she did not tell you except by the most ambiguous implication and young women empty the darkest corners of their souls into your ears you know with two marks and all the help youve given me i could buy a barrel of beer find donni pell bring her to me find out who brunos master was look for any connections with the dapena family look into the pilferage at the dapena warehouse it might open new avenues now be gone i cannot endure your vexatious importunities any longer right ill just conjure the pell woman out of thin air you will not learn anything sitting here drinking beer you have a point i admit but before i fare forth to keep my date with destiny how about you clue me in on how glory mooncalled manages his magic show or hasnt the hypothesis withstood the test of time the hypothesis has stood quite well garrett but not enough time has passed to set it in concrete i should not risk contradiction by events but i will present you with the key glory mooncalled has not found the secret of prolonged invisibility he has invented invisibility by treaty when you cannot escape the seeing eye you convince the eye that blindness is in its own best interest be gone take your tart back to her family you ready to go i asked saucer head i didnt have to ask amber because i knew she wasnt either emotionally or intellectually she was scared to death but for the thousand marks she would give it a shot saucer head grunted and got to his feet slowly his exertions of the night before were exacting their price i hoped he hadnt drawn too heavily on his reserves even the most stubborn will has its final limit lets do it garrett amber said xxxviii courter slauce himself was on the dapena gate he looked grim still showing the effects of his carouse i supposed he was being punished he stared at me with a mixture of anger and uncertainty i said tell domina dount im out here with the other package she ordered he eyed amber and saucer head frowned puzzledly as if a memory ghost were slithering around somewhere behind his eyes too elusive to catch you can go on in to her office she left standing orders to the gate uhnuh not that i dont thrust her but you know how it is theres a payment due and if she brings it down here chances are a lot better that ill actually get it that look again i had a feeling the dead man hadnt done as good a job as he thought some of slauces memories might return have it your way he called to somebody in the court told them to get willa dount and why when he turned to us again he was frowning straining after that fugitive memory i figured i could distract him and find out something at the same time i described bruno and asked if he knew the man slauce was more cooperative than i expected the guy sounds vaguely familiar but i cant pin a name on him why i thought he might be connected with that pilferage problem you people were having at your warehouse i dont know just something i heard i dont know who he is either except hes supposed to be from up here somewhere he had a job like yours they say slauce shook his head trying to clear the cobwebs amber and saucerhead both stared at me wondering what the hell i was up to just stirring the pot friends with the stormwarden on the horizon looming like a grandmother tornado anything was likely to panic somebody and break something loose but not from courter slauce he just stood there with a dumb look trying to get both oars in the water domina dount came stomping across the courtyard wearing that contrived and controlled face that had become so familiar garrett comes through again i told her she glared at amber so fiercely the girl stepped behind saucerhead its about time it took more doing than you think get in here amber go to your suite amber didnt come out of hiding i said theres a fee due yes of course youre a parasite garrett absolutely but unlike the rulingclass sort of parasite i relieve pain instead of creating it i winked grinned is the honeymoon over she almost smiled back in about a minute she produced several fat doeskin bags i let her plunk their weight into my folded arms then turned amber came out of hiding took a sack counted out saucerheads fee whispered you take care of this garrett ill pick it up as soon as i get away from my mother i lent her only enough ear to follow what she said i asked domina dount just as a matter of personal curiosity did you ever tie the knot on that warehouse trouble warehouse trouble back when you first called me out here you told me the younger karl disappeared after you sent him out to check on a pilferage problem i just wondered if youd put the wraps on that yet i havent had time to worry about it mr garrett amber and saucerhead pushed past us while we talked the domina realized that saucerhead was going inside hey you come back here you cant go in there saucerhead ignored her who the hell is he garrett what is he doing hes ambers bodyguard dapena youngsters have been dropping like flies the reason she ran away was she was afraid she might be next to get her to come back i had to fix her up with a bodyguard so mean and ugly and stubborn hed take on the gods themselves also one who has a lot of friends willing to get revenge if anything happens to him i dont like your tone garrett you sound like youre accusing me im accusing no one not yet but somebody had amiranda and junior murdered im just letting people know its going to get gruesome if its tried on amber karl took his own life mr garrett he was murdered domina by a man named gorgeous i think at the instigation of a third party im going to be talking to friend gorgeous later one of the questions im going to ask is who put him up to it thanks for this enjoy your day i left her looking flustered and maybe hopefully frightened the name of the game was garrett opens his bag of little horrors and lets out some of what he knows hoping that knowledge looks like a thick and deadly wall against which the onrushing stormwarden might crush the guilty maybe somebody would panic as i moved away looking around to see if any of morleys boys were lurking i heard footsteps behind me i looked back courter slauce was hurrying my way an odd expression on his fat face all the color was gone mr garrett wait up had my bolts pinked something in the bushes already he obviously had something on his mind courter where are you come here immediately domina dount sounded like a fishwife i couldnt see her so i assumed she couldnt see me slauce threw up his hands in despair and trotted back home what had he wanted to tell me morley was waiting at the house when i got there he hadnt been waiting long xxxix whats up morley chodo wants to see you right away now im not happy what brought this on morley shrugged im just relaying a message crask left with me ill say this he didnt look like he thought his boss was going to feed you to the fishes thats very reassuring morley chodo is an honorable man in his own way he wouldnt chop somebody down without warning like gorgeous gorgeous had plenty of warnings anyway he put himself on the bullseye then he stood there with his tongue out he begged for it garrett what do you think should i go only if you dont want the kingpin pissed at you a time might come when youd want him to give you a little leeway youre right lets go lock it up dean dean grumbled i told him it wouldnt last much longer chodo had set himself up in a manor house in the suburbs the place beggared the stormwardens in size and ostentation a commentary on the wages of sin if youre slick sadler was waiting at the gate a commentary on the confidence chodo had in the terror of his name i suppose he said nothing just let us follow him across the professionally barbered grounds having that kind of eye i couldnt help but study the security arrangements dont step off the path morley cautioned youre only safe inside the enchantment i then noticed that in addition to the expected and obvious armed guards and killer dogs there were thunderlizards lazing in the bushes they were not the tenement tall monsters we think of but little guys four or five feet tall bipedal all tail teeth and hind legs built for running they were the reason for the enchantment on the path unlike the dogs those things were too stupid to train all they understood was eating and mating nice pets i told sadler he didnt respond wonderful company the kingpins boys but the grimness ended at the front door chodo knew how to do it up royal ive been inside several places on the hill none could match chodos dont gawk garrett its impolite a platoon of nearly naked cuties were playing in and around a heated bath pool three times bigger than the ground area of my whole place we passed through i muttered business must be good looks like the man who had cautioned me not to gawk was looking back the gleam in his eyes a conflagration never saw them before he walked into a pillar the part of the house where we met the kingpin was less luxurious it was in fact your basic filthy miserable dungeon except it was located on the ground level the kingpin himself was a pallid doughy fat man in a wheelchair who didnt look like he could whip potatoes until you met his eyes i had seen eyes like those only a few times on some very old and hungry vampires they were the eyes of death mr garrett the voice went with the eyes deep and dank and cold with hints of awful things crawling around its underside yes i believe i owe you a considerable debt not at all i in your fumbling and poking after whatever it is youre seeking you presented me with an opportunity to rid myself of a vicious pest i seized the chance trampling your interests in my rush a presumption youll have found close to intolerable but youve been gracious about it you participated in the operation which delivered me despite having little hope you would get what you were after so i believe i am in your debt were it not for his voice from beyond the grave i might have been amused by his pedantic manner when i didnt respond he continued mr dotes didnt make much sense when he tried to explain what youre doing if you can satisfy me that your interests dont conflict with mine ill do what i can to help you i wanted to demur quietly still preferring to avoid any chance of becoming identified with him but morley gouged me gently and the fact was he had two of the people i most wanted to question i explained as concisely as i could carefully sliding around the matter of two hundred thousand marks gold floating free sadler continued one of gorgeouss enterprises was the fencing of goods stolen from the warehouses along the waterfront sir yes continue mr garrett basically i need to question gorgeous and skredli so i can define their sector of the web of intrigue does that top you you villainous slug i need to ask them who told them to kill amiranda crest and the younger karl dapena i knew molahlu crest when i was a young man you might say i was one of his protégés he crooked a finger sadler went to him bent down they whispered after sadler backed off chodo asked the questions you want answered are the ones raver styx will ask with a great deal less delicacy no doubt then not only must i pay my debt to you i must move to avert the attention of the mighty but i have erred and today i demonstrated my fallibility to myself in no uncertain fashion im able to give you only the lesser part of what you want overestimated mr staleys endurance and hes no longer with us he couldnt take it i sighed i should have expected the grave to slam another door in my face he wasnt in very good shape the last time i saw him perhaps his injuries were more extensive than they appeared whatever i learned very little of value but the other the ogre breed has survived and is amenable the trouble is he doesnt seem to know much he wouldnt morley gouged me donni pell garrett what chodo raised a plump almost white caterpillar of an eyebrow he was as good at it as i was you said the hooker was the key garrett and you dont even know where to start looking who is donni pell chodo asked the shespider in this web i gave morley a dirty look she used to work for lettie faren but ran out on her the day junior was snatched she could be related to lettie human but supposedly with a thing for ogres i ran through the whole thing how every way i turned the name donni pell popped up i finished she could be masquerading as a boy but using the same name chodo grunted he stared at the nails on one plump pink hand mr sadler yes sir find the whore deliver her to mr garretts residence yes sir sadler left us if shes in the city shell be found mr garrett chodo told me mr sadler and mr crask are nothing if not efficient ive noticed i suppose its time i took you to my ogrish houseguest come he spun his wheelchair and rolled morley and i followed xl the first thought that entered my mind when i walked in on skredli was drowned sparrow he looked very small very weak very bedraggled and like hed never been dangerous to anything bigger than a bug curiously i recognized him now i hadnt during the excitement in ogre town or later in the coach he was one of the gang who had waylaid me the afternoon of my date with amiranda while i was on my way to the chemist for some stinkpretty skredli was seated on a rumpled cot he glanced up but showed no real interest ogres tend toward fatalism morley held the door for chodo then stepped aside the kingpin backed his chair against the door i studied skredli wondering how to get to him a man has to have hope before hes vulnerable this one had no hope left he was deader than the dead man but his traitorous heart kept pumping and his battered flesh kept aching the good times always come to an end dont they skredli and the better the times are the bigger the fall when they end right he didnt respond i didnt expect him to the chance for the good times doesnt have to be gone forever his right cheek twitched once ogres and ogre breeds may be indifferent to the fates of their comrades but they arent indifferent to their own mr chodo has gotten what he wants from you he doesnt have any outstanding grievance mine isnt with you at all so theres no reason you shouldnt be let out of here if you give me what i need i didnt bother checking to see how chodo took me putting words into his mouth it didnt matter he would do what he wanted no matter what i said or promised skredli glanced up he didnt believe me but he wanted to the whole scheme is in the dump skredli and youre down at the bottom no way to go but up or out the choice is yours i had asked chodo only one question coming to the cell did skredli know gorgeous was out of it he did your boss is gone no reason to stay loyal to him or be afraid of him your fate is in your own hands morley shifted his weight against the wall gave me a look that said he thought i was laying it on too thick skredli grunted i had no way of telling what that meant i took it as a goahead im garrett we had a runin once before one bob of the head i had him for a moment though i feared it had been too easy then i reflected that it was the ogrish way when youve got nothing youve got nothing to lose you recall the circumstances grunt again who put you up to that gorgeous that in a drythroated croak why what for id never had anything to do with either of you business we had a thing going on in the dapena warehouse and they thought you were going to horn in and spoil it who is they gorgeous you said they gorgeous and who hed reached his next point of decision he decided to tell a warped truth a guy named donny something who set up the deal you mean a hooker named donni pell who worked for lettie faren and had a thing for ogres dont do that again skredli his shoulders sagged i took a moment to reflect there was a question of timing that deserved it skredli had been in town leading that pack after junior was snatched but then hed been at that farm the afternoon before junior walked away and the next morning hed led the crew that did in amiranda i tabled that for the moment im interested in that warehouse scheme all the petty little details id caught him on donni pell so now he was determined to spin me a good tale that was one of donnis ideas she was always bringing us things shed dreamed up from stuff her johns told her some of them we went with and she got a cut this one was real sweet raver styx had left town and donni had a foreman that would let us siphon off ten percent of everything that went through we took it on a fiftyfifty split with donni on account of she was the one keeping the dapena side in line but the foremans cut and expenses had to come out of her half we moved a lot of stuff as much as we were doing from the rest of the waterfront practically but then donni warned us that people were getting suspicious raver styxs woman dount sent the kid to nose around then there was you starting to snoop just when we had decided to close the thing out by cleaning out the warehouse in one hit so they had me try to discourage you interesting not worried about me and my reputation for getting into kidnap cases when we hit the place in ogre town we saw a guy leaving a bruno off the hill who was he i never heard his name a guy donni knew he worked for the guy who was taking the stuff from the warehouse the guy was worried he hired some other guy to keep track of you and you grabbed him he thought he wanted us to do something about you there was a big panic about covering tracks because raver styx had been seen in leifmold and could turn up anytime i turned to morley pokey probably what became of him i turned him loose he went home and sat tight he knew i was watching uhm skredli who did the bruno work for i dont know i dont even think gorgeous knew donni or the bruno delivered all the messages a cautious man and wisely so considering who he was stealing from but the goods had to be transferred somehow we had our own warehouse partly legit the bruno hired teamsters to pick up the stuff there there was an opportunity for some legwork if i decided i really wanted to know where the stormwardens goods had gone i wondered if i ought to ask what goods a stormwarden dealt in that were so attractive to thieves but decided ignorance might prove beneficial at a later date i needed whos and whys but not many whats lets talk about the younger karl dapena one night as he was going out the back door of lettie farens place somebody popped a bag over his head choked him and threw him into a carriage and after that the story gets confusing skredli had come around to where i wanted him he was able to volunteer information without upsetting whatever minuscule conscience resides in an ogrish heart that whole mess started out as a fake the kid wanted to run out on his old lady and rip her off at the same time he fixed it up with donni to make it look like a snatch and hed split the payoff with her and start traveling donni was going to split her half with us for making it look good it wasnt the kind of thing gorgeous usually got into but it looked like money for nothing so he sent for the old gang and we did it only it didnt come off that way what happened i dont know honest the same night after you and me go around in the street gorgeous calls me in and says theres a big change of plans i seen donni leaving so i know where the change came from anyway he told me had to go out where the kid was hid out and turn it into the real thing and when the payoff came through we was supposed to be a whole lot better off than with the old plan we was going to leave the kid twisting in the wind uhm i thought a moment what about donnis cut of the fatter pot we got that whole wad all the kids share something told me donni pell had gotten her share somewhere else so thats that you just went out got the money and headed north my tone warned him no you know that dont you you had to kill a girl to get that extra chunk gorgeous said it had to be done i didnt like it why i dont know look no matter what you do im going to tell you that a lot because i dont know i wasnt his partner gorgeous told me to do things and i did them and he paid me good and part of what he paid me for was not asking questions you want to know who wanted something done and why you got to find donni pell and ask her what you say is probably true but you have eyes and ears and a brain you saw things and heard things and you thought about them why do you think the girl had to die maybe she knew too much about something she knew the kidnap was a fake because she was supposed to run off with the kid and the money maybe she found out the fake turned real maybe she just did something to make donni want to get her maybe it was just because she was set to take the frame for the kidnapping and gorgeous didnt want her turning up saying it wasnt so i know we was supposed to make her disappear forever only when we showed up to do it she had some son of a bitch with her and he turned out to be a goddamned oneman army and by the time we got him down there was traffic coming and we had to throw them in the bushes and make it look like nothing happened when we got back we found out that big ape wasnt dead at all hed grabbed the girl and took off through the woods i never thought hed get far cut like he was and he left us with a lot of cleaning up to thats enough of that tell me about the payoff where when how on the chamberton old road four miles south of where it runs into the vokutalichfield road just north of the bridge over little cedar creek set for midnight the night before what we was just talking about but the delivery was two hours late i guess gorgeous wasnt pissed because he never complained i didnt know the place on the map the chamberton old coach road cuts up through woody hill country four miles west of the route id taken when id gone out to explore why that spot the road runs straight for a mile either way from the bridge theres never any traffic at night but if there was youd spot it coming in plenty of time and you can look off northeast and see the ridge the lichfield road runs on i was up there to watch in case there was any tricks i was supposed to light one signal flare if everything was all right and two if it wasnt did you expect trouble no we had them by the short hairs but you dont take chances with those people and the delivery was late yeah but i guess that was just because the damnfool woman didnt know what she was doing any idiot should know a covered wagon with a fourhorse team wont make time like a buggy or carriage oh you werent there for the actual payoff then no but gorgeous said it went down exactly the way it was supposed to which was the wagon came down and stopped in the road gorgeous and donni had their coaches off to the side gorgeous and donni had their drivers transfer the moneybags half and half the woman and her wagon headed on south donni stayed put for an hour then headed south too gorgeous came up where i was and gave me my cut and enough to pay off the boys so they could go home after the business in the morning we didnt want them coming to tunfaire getting drunk and shooting their mouths off they knew what was happening not the payoff but they were in on a killing there was no concern about just following the woman she wasnt told what to do about going back till she turned over the ransom i see not very bright this skredli she didnt have anything to say when she didnt get the kid after the payoff i dont know maybe she did gorgeous never said i guess you came out pretty good on the deal personally eh yeah look at me living like a lord yeah i got my usual ten percent of gorgeouss fifty percent a big hit to you maybe but i did better on the warehouse business even if it took longer to come in you stripped the warehouse then yeah i didnt think it was smart but gorgeous said we already had such a big investment we might as well finish it off uhm i began to pace to think wed been at it a long time hed given me a lot to think about we were almost there but i needed that moment to reflect to reorder my forces where is donni pell skredli i dont know she was there when we came after you wasnt she he nodded and she ran out behind us and went for help he shrugged its going to be interesting finding out who called out the troops that was a stupid mistake very stupid panic thinking raver styx will have his hide wheres donni pell how many times i got to tell you i dont know if shes got the sense of a cockroach shes done got her butt out of tunfaire if she had that much sense she would have headed out of town as soon as she had her share of the money she seems to have a certain low cunning an ability to manipulate men and complete confidence in her invulnerability but no brains ill take your word you dont know where she is but where might she run who would hide her skredli shrugged one of her johns maybe id had that thought already i suspected skredli was mined out on the subject and he was relaxed enough for the next stage why did the stormwardens kid have to be killed huh killed i heard he committed suicide were getting along fine skredli im starting to feel kindly toward you dont blow your chance i know you and gorgeous and donni and somebody were in and out of the room where he died and i knew him well enough to know he couldnt kill himself that way if he could ever find guts enough to kill himself at all i figure you used the choke sack on him and gorgeous cut him himself i think donni but what i think doesnt matter the thing i cant figure is why he went within a mile of that woman after what she did to him you dont know donni pell no but i intend to get acquainted go ahead tell me about that morning you arent going to spread it around are you i dont need no raver styx breathing down my neck none of us do but you dont worry about raver styx you worry about me im the only chance youve got to walk out of here youve got to make me happy he shrugged he wasnt counting on me but he did have new hopes that he hadnt had awhile ago all right what started it was you parading around with that dead woman somebody seen you by lettie farens place they told donni and donni must have told everybody in town she sent a messenger to us gorgeous had a fit but he believed me when i said she had to be dead and you was just trying to stir something up but you did get donni stirred like you said she aint too smart she thought she had her handle on the dapena kid she sent him a message that told him where to find her that she had to see him the dope went there i dont know what she thought she was going to get him to do he wasnt having none of her fingerwrapping no more hed figured some of it out and like a dummy she told him the girl was dead that did it he was going to hike out of there and blow the whole thing wide open and he would have too only me and gorgeous showed up on account of gorgeous was worried about donni maybe getting too excited and doing something really stupid it wasnt planned then i gotta be careful with that i dont think it was i wasnt in on no planning which i usually was because i was the guy who had to go out and do things but it did have a funny feel like maybe donni rigged it so it would come out the way it did you keep contradicting yourself is donni pell stupid or not shes good at coming up with schemes and playing them out long as shes got the reins in her hands you catch her by surprise she dont do so good she thinks slow she gets flustered she does dumb things so gorgeous figured we better get over there and sit on her till she calmed down and whatever was bugging her blew away and karl was there there and throwing a fit he figured some of it out and he was going to tell the world donni even tried to buy him off saying shed give him his share after all dumb after the way she screwed him over and him just about sure what was going on we didnt have no choice he wouldnt back down even with me and gorgeous there it was our asses or his i thought we made it look good you did you just didnt know he was so chicken nobody would believe he did it himself who was the other guy who was there what other guy a man in a hooded black cloak i never saw one uhm i paced there were more questions i wanted to ask but most had to do with the money i didnt want chodo getting interested in that and skredli had given me plenty to untangle anyway probably close to enough donni pell would put the cap on it she would throw some light into the hearts of some shadows she would cast the bones of doom for somebody i played it straight for you skredli said get me out of here ill have to talk mr chodo into it i replied what will you do head north as fast as i can run i dont want to be anywhere around when raver styx hits town and there aint nothing here for me anymore anyway youd keep your mouth shut are you kidding whose throat would the knife bite first good point i wagged a hand at morley indicating the door he moved to open it chodo rolled out of his way morley stepped aside chodo and i followed where do you stand i asked the kingpin indicating the door with a jerk of my head i got rid of the bloodsucker bothering me thats just a hired hand you can have him i dont know if i want him maybe he swung the knife but didnt give the order we walked for a while i said you know saucerhead tharpe ive heard the name i know the reputation ive never had the pleasure saucerhead tharpe has a grievance against skredli it supersedes mine i think he deserves first choice in deciding we traveled through that vast room where the naked ladies played again morley had trouble steering to chodo they were furniture he said tell tharpe to come out if he wants a piece and if i dont hear by this time tomorrow i turn him loose and at the front door sometimes you let one go so word gets around how it goes for those who dont get out sure morley and i stepped outside and waited for an escort we didnt speak until we were on the public road then i asked you think chodo will let him go no me neither what now garrett i dont know about you im going home to sleep i had a late night last night sounds good to me you let me know if anything comes of all this hows your financial position these days morley he gave me a dark look but replied im doing all right yeah i figured you would be listen knot head stay away from the damned waterspider races im not getting killed in one of your harebrained schemes for getting out from under hey garrett youve done it to me twice morley this time maybe not as hairy as last time but that crap down in ogre town was too damned close you hear what im saying he heard well enough to sulk xli i needed a sixteenhour nap but i devoured a roast chicken with trimmings and clowned a couple quarts of beer instead i went into the dead mans den being careful not to trample on the bodies and tiptoed over to the shelves on the short north wall among the clutter i found a fine collection of maps i dug out several and settled in my reserved chair see you had a productive day he startled me i hadnt known he was awake but thats the sort of game he likes to play sneak and scare near my heart i nurture a suspicion that malicious and capricious spirits are dead loghyr disembodied i didnt answer immediately a productive day indeed you are smugly certain you have a handle on everything and no longer need badger me to do your thinking for you just to be contrary though thats probably what he wanted i gave him a blowbyblow of everything that had happened since my last report he seemed amused by my having chewed morley out while i talked i ran my right forefinger along lines on one of the maps trying to visualize points of interest barely noticed in the real world looking for a place someone unfamiliar with the territory might have felt safe squirreling a pile of gold when pressed for time im thinking about going for a ride in the country tomorrow maybe stopping to go swimming under a few bridges an interesting notion though you may never get to put it to the test why not you still need me to explain to you the consequences of your actions the stormwarden raver styx was due home today she should in fact have been home for some hours now she should be howling at the moon and who has had his nose deep into the thing from several angles who is she going to drag in to answer questions right beside domina dount and the baronet dapena i suppose that had been lounging around in the back of my mind overshadowed by the puzzle and maybe by a touch of gold fever dean he looked a bit exasperated when he stuck his head in yes sir dont answer the door tonight ill do it in fact why dont you go on home and put yourself out of harms way you havent left for days maybe a few of your nieces have roped some men dean smiled you arent closing me out now sir ill stay its your funeral as if conjured by the conversation someone began pounding on the door i went and peeked through the peephole i didnt recognize any of the crowd but they wore raver styxs colors i shut the peephole and went for another beer her men the dead man asked when i returned yes turned to the maps again you ignore her at your peril yours too i thought i know what im doing you usually think you do occasionally you are correct i ignored him too it wasnt ten minutes before someone else knocked this time when i peeped i found sadler on the stoop chodo said tell you what we come up with he said when i opened the door making no move to come inside we asked around places somebody got word to her we were looking she took off out of town nobody knows where she landed we asked ill bet they did chodo says tell you he still owes you the favor tell him i said thank you very much i dont say much to civilians garrett but you done all right down in ogre town you maybe pulled us all out with your trick so ill tell you dont waste that favor on nothing silly right he turned away and hiked i shut the door and went back to the dead man good advice garrett a favor due from the kingpin is like a pound of gold squirreled away i dont like it anyway i just hope he stays alive long enough for me to collect kingpins have a habit of turning up dead almost as often as our kings do it was quiet for an hour so quiet i dozed off in my chair the maps sliding out of my lap the dead man awakened me with a sudden strong touch company again garrett i heard the knocking as i tried to get the body parts moving in unison when i peeked i saw morley on the stoop he was alone i opened up and he slipped inside i wake you sort of i thought you were going to crap out whats up i just heard something i thought you should know they found that guy courter slauce in an alley a couple streets from here somebody busted the back of his head in for him what i tried to shake the groggies hes dead like the proverbial wedge who did it how should i know this dont make sense i have to get some tea or something wash the cobwebs out for that youll need the high water of the decade sometimes i think the only substance inside your head is the dust on the cobwebs aint nothing will perk you up like a vote of confidence from your friends dean tea dean had water on he always does he favors tea the way i favor beer he brewed me a mug thick enough to slice in the meantime i asked morley did you keep anyone watching the stormwardens place for all the good it did till today and theres no way to do a decent job when you spend eighty percent of your time dodging security patrols they got nothing zippo zilch zero armies could have marched in and out and they would have missed them it was a long shot anyway what about pokey what about him why keep on him he might have trotted off to somebody interesting youre grasping garrett pokey pigotta youre kidding theres always a chance theres a chance the world will end tomorrow ill give you fiftytoone odds it does before pokey pigotta does something unprofessional i dont want to hear bet or odds from you he gave me a narroweyed look i laid off you and your poisonous diet garrett i laid off your selfdestructive knight errantry you lay off me ill go to hell in my own way i dont care how you go to hell morley thats your business but every time you head out you throw a rope on me and try to drag me along you feel that way about it quit pulling me into your quests i pay you to do a job thats all i want done somebody ought to profit if youre so damned lily pure youre willing to get paid off in selfsatisfaction for righting deadly wrongs dean interjected you kids want to whoop and holler and call each other names why dont you take it out in the alley or at least get it out of my kitchen i was about to patiently explain again who owned that kitchen and who just worked there when someone else came pounding on my door and hollering for me saucerhead i said and headed that way morley followed me i asked who killed slauce i told you i dont know i heard he was dead i came to tell you i didnt go turn out his pockets to see if he left a note naming his killer i peeked through the peephole just in case i was in one of those moods saucerhead all right and amber and several of the stormwardens men including a couple who had been around before i let morley peek you want to be here for this no im done with you with them with the whole damned mess have it your way i opened the door as saucerhead wound up to start pounding again morley shoved out grumbled a greeting i said you two can come inside the army stays where it is xlii whats a matter with morley saucerhead asked he had a glazed look but i suppose even a statue would be numb after an exposure to the storm warden raver styx he tried to take a bite out of something that bit him back or maybe it was the other way around whatre you two up to with your private army out there mother wants you amber said you should have seen mr tharpe stand up to domina and mother he was magnificent ive heard him called a lot of things but magnificent was never on the list i didnt do nothing but stand there and pretend i was deaf except when they absolutely had to have me say something then i just sounded stupid and said they had to talk to her on account of i was working for her and what was it all about i asked amber they wanted him out they really got mad because he wouldnt go and i wouldnt tell him to go itll do them good so your mother wants me to come running yes why did she send you because she sent courter and he didnt even come back then she sent dawson and you wouldnt open the door courter she sent him to gel me dean come here a minute he came in did anybody come to the door today before i told you i would answer it myself no just the boy who brought the letter what letter i put it on your desk i assumed youd seen it excuse me for a minute i went to the office the letter was there all right i gave it a read it was from my friend tinnie out of sight she had slipped out of mind anything important saucerhead asked when i returned nah reds headed for tunfaire he looked at amber sidelong smirked that ought to put some life back in this town amber does your mother think ill just hike out there because she crooked her finger shes the stormwarden raver styx garrett shes used to getting what she wants she isnt getting it this time im tired and ive been playing with thugs so much lately another one isnt going to bother me none tell her if she wants to see me she knows where to find me during normal business hours if she comes down now i wont answer the door amber said im not going to tell her anything garrett im not going back i forgot how bad it could get till she came storming in as far as im concerned she can take it out on father and domina from now on shes seen the last of her unbeloved daughter you did mean it when you let me have that gold didnt you i was tempted to say no just to see how quick she could turn in her tracks but forbore yes then im going upstairs you can go home mr tharpe just a minute girl youre going to declare your independence youre going to declare your independence you can stay tonight because its too late to do it now but tomorrow you go shopping for a place of your own for a moment she was stunned then she looked hurt i tried to soften it this is a dangerous place and im in a dangerous line and i have a dangerous family that too when you relay my message to the troops out there tell them to tell your mother that courter didnt run away after all somebody lured him into an alley and smashed his head in she can sleep on that amber gawked she opened and closed her mouth several times you look like a goldfish really courter was murdered too yes why would anyone do that i assume because he was coming to see me damn them as i hoped the anger id aroused now became a white righteous fury she stomped to the door i raised a hand delaying saucerhead chodo had me out to his place today he still has that character that killed amiranda he offered him to me i told him you had more claim he said if youre interested get your butt out there because tomorrow hes going to turn him loose saucerhead pursed his lips and touched himself a couple of places where he still hurt he grunted id also like you to come back tomorrow im figuring on taking a trip and i want you to keep on keeping an eye on amber he nodded yeah they aint getting this one garrett fine ill see you when you get ambers yell sent us hustling out front me unlimbering my skull buster saucerhead picked up a couple of the stormwardens men and cracked their heads together i thumped two behind the ears that left three and two of those had all they could handle with amber saucerhead peeled them off while i held their leader at bay what the hell you trying to do shithead take her home im not going to argue im just going to tell you she said she dont want to go shes old enough to make up her own mind pick up your buddies and leave he looked at me like he wanted to tell me what it meant to get into the stormwardens way then just shrugged saucerhead let go of the two he had the bunch began getting themselves together amber started to say something i told her to go inside we would talk after the crowd thinned out she went and raver styxs thugs did the same leaving me with a flock of promising black looks youre starting to catch on garrett talk after you kick ass theyre more inclined to hear what you have to say that was morley dotes talking from a perch on the stoop next door he got up and came down stood with us watching the stormwardens boys stumble off i said nothing not knowing what might set him off he offered me a folded piece of paper i looked him in the eye for a moment his expression remained bland there was nothing on that paper but a name lyman gameleon ive heard of him big bear on the hill and so forth whats the significance just thought id save you some trouble garrett thats the man who sent the soldiers into ogre town a man who coincidentally happens to be your stormwardens nextdoor neighbor and bitterest enemy politically and personally not to mention being her husbands older halfbrother hey very interesting thanks morley no big deal garrett he waved one hand as he marched away the tidbit was morleys way of extending the olive branch saucerhead said its time i was going too garrett take care of miss dapena i considered his broad back as he went had he said more than he had said with saucerhead its hard to tell if hes just being a dumb goof or a mild cynic i went inside and locked up i looked around for amber didnt see her amber in your office i went in she had parked herself in my chair and seemed to be sulking cheer up you were marvelous you manipulated me of course i did would you have stood up to those thugs if you werent mad probably not i settled on a corner of the desk one piece of news that might perk you up i think theres a small chance we can lay hands on some of the gold youre stringing me along again arent you no its a long shot but a real chance i didnt think there was one before it depends on how distracted your mother is by the emotional side of whats happened i think i know what happened to some of the gold but finding it is going to be like scratching through the proverbial haystack well need time you mean it dont you yes though i admit im riding a hunch dean brought beer and wine we thanked him i told amber i cant stay awake much longer im going to turn in ill see you in the morning she flashed me a wicked smile i understood the smile soon enough i didnt latch my door who does inside his own house amber took that as an invitation not only did i see her sooner than i expected i got less sleep than i hoped repeated clamors at the front door ignored by the entire household also interrupted my rest xliii i staggered out when the smell of breakfast overpowered my laziness as i descended the stairs another hurrah broke out at the front door i slipped over and peered through the peephole an ugly face bloated and red bobbed outside a mouth filled with bad teeth gaped and bellowed i closed the peephole and went to breakfast i leaned back and patted my belly dean of all the several geniuses infesting this place i think youre the most valuable where the hell did you find strawberries my niece may brought them theyve been in the cold well for three days nieces again at that rate of regression the dead man would soon be interested in glory mooncalled again id better see if his nibs is awake sooner or later that front door was going to have to open amber your mother is bound to come you going to want to be scarce i can face her as long as ive got a place to run when it gets gruesome youre all right then dean ill take a mug of tea while i rattle old bones dean scowled and grumbled not at all inclined to let me take matters into my own hands he prepared the tea with such care and deliberation i was ready to do without before he finished tea is tea making a religious ceremony of fixing it doesnt improve it a bit there are those who would consider me a barbarian the same ones who arent civilized enough to appreciate good beer the dead man was awake he wasnt in a mood to be interrupted he knew wed have company soon and was working himself up for it i believe he had visions of using the stormwarden who had been in the cantard for months as a chamois to buff up his glory mooncalled theory i followed ambers example and went to my room to groom myself for the hours ahead that done i settled at a window and watched the street it wasnt quiet out there the stormwardens men remained at their posts but werent watching the house their carrying on had drawn a crowd the lords of the hill can get away with a lot they usually remain above the laws that keep the rest of us from preying on each other but the invasion of a home without the prior approval of the judges is something people wont tolerate had the stormwardens men tried to break in during the night they might have gotten away with something had the dead man allowed it now it was too late if they tried the crowd would tear them apart our overlords have to exercise a delicate touch when they violate the sanctity of the home i hoped the uptown boys didnt get stupid i had worked myself into a tight enough place already they kept me there and company when it came did so from an unexpected quarter from the corner of my eye i caught a stir coming from downtown what to my wondering eye should appear but saucerhead tharpe in convoy with sadler and crask the bunch looked like they had breakfasted on bitterbark soup at morleys place i sighed i knew things were shaping up too damned well i ran into amber in the hallway she asked is she here not yet its saucerhead and a couple guys you dont even want to know by sight and im not going to be able to find out what they want if you dont let me get to the stairs oh she stepped aside grouch youre probably right you might warn dean so he can get something ready they look like theyll need it i was three steps from the door when saucerhead knocked glanced through the peephole and opened up as my guests entered i gave the stormwardens redfaced boy a glare and said dont even think about it he got redder but i didnt have to watch i shut the door on him i seated them in the small front room next to my office dean appeared with tea and sweetcakes just as though they were expected i said well what is it how bad is it saucerhead glanced at the other two they were willing to let him do the talking i couldnt quite tell what the threesome were up to there was no tension between them just a commonality of undirected disgust tharpe said skredli got away skredli got away what did he do sprout wings and fly was he some kind of werebuzzard id never heard of such a beast but nothing in this world surprises me anymore if a man can turn into a wolf why not an ogre into a buzzard both transformations seem singularly fitting perhaps even symbolic prejudiced who me the gods forefend no he didnt fly garrett he just took off running i started to express my incredulity but it struck me that i might learn a little more a lot faster with my mouth shut i admit i dont often have these epiphanies saucerhead explained it was just getting light when i went out there they took me up to the front porch and told me to wait then they went in and brought skredli out and all of a sudden like that was all he was waiting for he took off like a bat out of hell crask said it was chilly up there last night the lizards get sluggish when their blood cools down sadler added dogs wont run an ogre less theyre specially trained anyway chodos mutts are supposed to keep people from getting in not from getting out and saucerhead it happened so sudden and he was gone so fast nobody had time to do nothing but gawk no point in whining it wasnt my problem anyway or was it you didnt come down here just to let me in on that did you saucerhead hit me with the news chodo thinks youre going to stick on what youre after till you find donni pell he figures that when you find her youll find skredli again too that sounds plausible he wants sadler and crask to be there when you find them i see i cant say i was disappointed i foresaw any number of potentialities right down the path those three guys would be handy if the fur began to fly all right im expecting heavyweight company sometime today raver styx we know the game and the stakes garrett indeed had amber been running her mouth no saucerhead just thought he knew the stakes which alerted me to the fact that there would be no gold hunting until skredli and donni pell turned up unless i decided i didnt mind chodos thugs hanging around when i turned it up go about your routine sadler told me well stay out of your way sure they would as long as it wasnt in their interest to do otherwise xliv we killed time playing cards dean was in and out laying scowls on me i knew what he was thinking i ought to whip all these bodies into a rehabilitation frenzy and get some work done on the house he doesnt understand that characters like saucerhead sadler and crask get no thrill out of domestic triumphs amber popped in once decided she couldnt handle all the joviality and retreated upstairs the dead man remained alert in his quarters my neck prickled each time his touch passed through the room he would never admit he was nervous though amber came back awhile later shes coming garrett i thought shed at least send domina once first she hesitated for a split second i think ill stay upstairs i was sure youd want to suggest she learn to pick her nose with her elbow im not quite ready for that yet and if she insists on seeing you tell her im not here say i ran off somewhere you know she wont believe that shes a stormwarden shell know where you are amber shrugged if i have to face her i will otherwise just leave me out of it whatever you say the future began hammering on the door dean looked in to see if i wanted him to answer i nodded he headed out at a reluctant shuffle i rose and went after him amber scurried up the stairs saucerhead and the boys folded their hands and strolled into the hallway i was five feet behind dean when he swung the door inward the dead mans attention was so intense the air almost crackled i had one hand in my pocket gripping one of the potencies given me by saucerheads witch knowing that if i employed it raver styx would notice the spell about as much as she might notice the whine of a mosquito she had come to the door alone though shed been accompanied on the journey from the hill a coach and small army cluttered the street behind her my neighbors had made themselves scarce she was a short woman heavy and gnarly like a dwarf shed never had anything like ambers beauty even at sixteen when they all look good her face was grim and ugly she had bright blue eyes that seemed to blaze in contrast with her tanned leathery skin and graying hair if she was angry though she concealed it very well she seemed more relaxed than most people who come to my door dean had frozen i moved forward do come in stormwarden ive been expecting you she stepped past dean glancing at him as though she was puzzled by his rigidity could she be that naive close the door dean he finally moved i led the stormwarden into the room where wed been playing cards the office was not large enough for the crowd as i seated my guest i asked can dean get you anything tea brandy something of that sort and not by the thimbleful i want something to drink not something to sniff at her voice was gravelly and as deep as ever id heard from a woman it had a timbre that made her sound like she was used to being one of the boys that was the way they talked about her i had no direct knowledge id never crossed paths with her before dean bring a bottle from that bunch the bahgell brothers sent me yes sir i considered raver styx that i might have grateful clients of the baghell caliber didnt impress her mr garrett you are mr garrett she asked i am these others associates they represent the interests of a former protégé of molahlu crest if that news amazed or dismayed her or in any other way impressed her she didnt show it she said very well ive studied you briefly i understand you carry on your business your own way or you dont do business you get results so you cant be faulted for your ways i examined her again while dean delivered her bottle and glass i wasnt sure how to play her she was disappointing my expectations id been steeling myself for a storm of imperial rage i said i did say i was expecting you having been drawn into the periphery of your familys affairs but im not quite certain why dont be ingenuous mr garrett its wasted effort youve been nearer the heart than the periphery maybe nearer than you know my first question of you would be why representing a client or clients of course she waited a moment when i didnt add anything she asked who then no strike that you wont tell me if you think its to your advantage to reserve it let me think a moment after shed reflected a moment she continued disaster after disaster has trampled my family the past few weeks my son kidnapped to be redeemed for a ransom so huge the financial future of the family is in doubt and my adopted daughter decided she had to fly the nest and for her trouble got herself slaughtered by bandits i wagged a cautionary finger at saucerhead my son after being freed killed himself and my natural daughter despite your efforts and those of willa dount fled home not once but twice not to mention trivia like courter slauce getting himself killed on his way down to see me last night or the fact that thieves have stripped the dapena warehouse her face shaded with the faintest cloud of emotion the first shed shown is that true which about the warehouse yes i hadnt heard maybe domina has been too distracted to keep track of whats happening on the commercial side horse feathers domina is feeding me disasters in tidbits in hopes i wont have her flayed and use her hide for bookbinding it was a sour trite remark not meant to be taken seriously witches and sorcerers had stood the accusation so long it had become a joke of the trade having done my dance to show off i waited leaving the next play in her hand id suspected you possessed knowledge not at my command mr garrett now youve told me as much for whatever motives move you all right we both know i want the rest you want something for yourself can we arrive at a peaceful middle ground probably i doubt if our goals are too far apart indeed what do you want then the man or woman who gave the order that got amiranda crest murdered i guess when you play for stakes as high as she had for so long you learn to keep yourself controlled that face would have made her a deadly card player go on mr garrett i want the person no matter who it is thats what i want she surveyed my companions sadler and crask were blanks but saucerhead had leaned a little toward us its obvious you know a great deal that i dont saucerhead couldnt restrain himself skredli and donni pell garrett we get them too the stormwarden looked at me i said my friend was there when arniranda was murdered he tried to save her and failed he feels obligated to restore a balance he also has a personal score to settle show her saucerhead understood he started stripping the wounds he exposed still looked nasty the deeper cuts wouldnt lose their purplishred color for months i see the stormwarden said would you care to tell me how it happened saucerhead put his shirt back on i said nothing raver styx muttered so thats the way its going to be all the while i stared smoke and fire at saucerhead he had to mention donni pell in front of the wife id wanted to reserve donni pell for the moment of maximum impact she hadnt reacted to the name at all i suppose the thing to do is hire you mr garrett then you might be more responsive maybe maybe not i do my job my own way between the hiring and the results i dont put up with meddling from my principal im the specialist if i cant be trusted to do the job without interference i shouldnt be hired in the first place i dont think my voice squeaked i sure hoped it didnt what did you want to hire me for anyway she looked at me like i was a moron i dont mind having multiple clients but i dont take them on when their goals conflict she continued to stare serpents of temper had begun to stir beneath the surface of her calm no more pushing permitted before we go on theres something ive got to show you stormwarden i warn you up front youre not going to like it youre going to be upset but you need to see it so you dont walk into anything with the web of illusion across your eyes the dead man brushed me with a touch of approval the stormwarden rose her face carefully composed i said you ought to finish that glass and pour yourself another before we go if its that tough ill take the bottle along just one of the guys come on then i crossed the hall to the dead mans room stepped inside stepped aside the parade followed the stormwarden first the boys lined up against the wall beside the door crask and sadler stared at the dead man and went gray around the edges seeing is believing a dead loghyr the stormwarden enthused sounding like shed just spotted a cute fairy toddler peeking out of the bushes i didnt know there were any around anymore what do you want for it you wouldnt want this one hes a social parasite my personal charity project he does nothing but sleep and amuse himself by playing with bugs laziness is a loghyr racial characteristic but even the dead can be trained to harness when you use the right lash youll have to explain that to me sometime i cant get any work out of him what you need to see is over here dean get some decent damned lamps in here he was supposed to have done that already he came sidling in with the necessary and stammered apologies he was shaking all over and i didnt blame him this was the moment that could explode she stood there staring at the bodies not a hairline cracking her composure she raised a hand beckoned dean took the lamp knelt she studied karl for a long time taking him in inch by inch finished she took a long pull on the brandy bottle then did it all over again with amiranda amiranda didnt get a seconds less attention in fact she got a moment more the stormwarden grunted then set her bottle aside and rested the tips of two fingers on amirandas belly after a minute she muttered so and reclaimed the bottle she drew another healthy draft she rose i owe you a debt of gratitude mr garrett she returned the lamp to dean can we talk now seriously the two of us yes dean take these guys into the kitchen and feed them bring me a mug and a pitcher in the office yes sir gentlemen they didnt protest i guess chodo had given them orders to cooperate xlv i settled behind my desk the stormwarden sat opposite me devoting herself to her bottle and her inner landscape finally she said karl was murdered he was by a man named gorgeous and an ogre breed named skredli gorgeous is dead skredli is on the loose but we intend to find him he also led the gang that killed amiranda but he was just a hired hand someone paid for the blood you have a great deal to tell me if i take you as a client she thought for a while your task now is to find the person responsible for amirandas murder correct yes i have a great deal of power as youre aware but i dont know how to go about rooting out a killer suppose i hire you to find karls murderer that might work assuming we agree on precedence of claims if the same hand directed the blades in both murders therell be no problem of precedence if you meet one condition which is you may take precedence for yourself your friends and your client if youll permit me to be present when you handle your end of it it wont matter what you do not even death will be an escape for whoever did that in there i felt a surge of elation wondered why then realized that most of it came from the dead man he knew something or had something i think we can deal ill stay out of your way mr garrett ill give you whatever aid and assistance you require dean brought the beer in i poured my mug full damned near drained it the stormwarden did likewise with a second mug dean thoughtfully provided the stormwarden said i expect youre out of pocket considerably for the bodies you wouldnt have gotten them cheaply thats true add that to what you need for a deposit against your expenses and fee let me make sure we understand one another youre willing to take me on and turn me loose without shoving your hand in as long as youre there for the showdown yes and youll lend me your authority along the way if thats necessary it will be in a few cases i have one goal only mr garrett laying my hands on the person or persons responsible for what happened to my children cost is no obstacle neither is the emperor himself do you understand me those iceblue eyes were ablaze now you do what you have to do to deliver ill back you to the gates of hell itself pact you want a witchs oath written in blood the sworn word of the stormwarden raver styx will do she did the whole formal thing after allowing me to word the undertaking settled i said were on i owe you a story and i began telling it from the moment it intruded upon my life j gave her the crop reserving only my personal interactions with amber and amiranda i dont think she was fooled i reserved a couple thoughts about the gold too i did have a client after all it took several hours she didnt interrupt dean kept the pitcher full and brought in food when he felt it was time she didnt immediately comment when i finished i gave her a few minutes then asked am i still retained she gave me a dontbestupid look of course she thought awhile longer it doesnt make sense not from where we stand now it probably looked slick at the start before people started doing unto one an other and things started going wrong before the terror set in it doesnt make much sense from that perspective either not to me dont go closing your mind now she came into the real world for the first time in hours fixing me with a basilisks stare what youre ignoring the centerpiece at this hells feast the shadow that falls upon it all the stormwarden raver styx explain yourself mr garrett i will by example suppose everyone involved was exactly who he or she is but you instead of being the dread raver styx were the heiress to the gallard wine fortune that whatshername would anyone have done what they did if you were her and shed gone out of town for six months would anyone have been tempted donni pell and her gang maybe but they were motivated by greed going in who you were or werent didnt matter till the double crosses and foulups started and asses had to be covered she didnt like it a bit though id barely skimmed the edges but that woman had to be the most hardhearted damned realist ever to cross my trail she swallowed her ego i see she made willa dount look like a kitten she took time out for more reflection then what do you plan to do mr garrett id like to interview your husband and willa dount in circumstances where they cant evade questions or avoid answering them it can be arranged when the sooner the better today now that old man with the black sword has been busy enough lets not give him time to sniff out anybody else old death is supposed to be blind but ive noticed he never misses thats probably wisest how do you want to set it up we talked about it for fifteen minutes i said id play it by ear making sure she understood i wanted to be given my head then she rose ill have the bodies taken away now mr garrett out the back would be best theyre supposed to have been cremated already nobody outside this house knows they havent been i understand i followed her to the front door where she paused before she allowed me to let her out take very good care of my daughter mr garrett she may be all that i have left i intend to stormwarden we locked gazes for a moment we understood one another it is a pitiful truth that people like raver styx cannot express their love in any way that their beloved will find meaningful xlvi the door shut i leaned against it and let out a long heartfelt sigh of relief i shook for about a minute while the tension drained away i wanted to let out a big old war whoop saucerhead leaned out of the kitchen she finally go finally he counted my arms and legs guess you worked something out yeah well see how it stays together whats the game first thing is some of her boys are going to come to the back door to pick up those bodies you guys can hand them over im going to set a fire under the dead man saucerhead gave me a dirty look grumbling about them that puts on aristocratic airs but he went and got sadler and crask i waited while they removed the corpses there now that was not so bad after all was it garrett a snap so why the hell are you sweating that startled him i could almost see him checking to see if by some miracle some of lifes processes had resumed point for garrett you had some kind of epiphany while i was talking to her what was it realized that by taking a short trip upcountry you could probably put the cap on the affair he was all set to do some crowing about his genius you mean by going out to that farm and rounding up donni pell you reasoned it out youve been telling me i have to use my own head using yours is too much like work all the kingpins hounds and all the kingpins men couldnt catch more than a few whiffs of old back trails shed used up her friends here in town where else would she go very good though we do rely on the assumption that she has not taken the proceeds of her multifarious treacheries and gotten herself somewhere where she can become a new and possibly even respectable person i dont think she has the sense or character to make the clean break if she did she wouldve gotten out days ago you are going to return to that farm im still formulating strategy i fibbed meanwhile ill go up to the dapena place for a chat with the stormwardens old man and willa dount maybe even her staff if it looks like thatll do any good and in the back of my head ill be trying to decide if skredli is smart enough to have scoped it out himself had not thought of that because you dont think like a thug i guarantee you the first thing skredli did after he decided it was safe to stop running was start looking for somebody to blame for the fix hes in it would be easy for him to get all righteous about donni and look what a great target she makes shes got no friends left no protector or avenger and shes got buckets of money that can be taken without any comebacks and on top of that shes a woman you pity her not much shes the one who decided to play with the hard boys saucerhead was in the doorway waiting for me to stop talking i beckoned him inside they off gone you know what i was saying i heard your side you heard everything worth hearing i got the maps id studied after my talk with skredli and opened one you see this thats the crossroads where you and the girl had your runin with skredlis gang if you head west to about here you come to two young mulberry trees hiding the end of an old road about a half mile down that road is an abandoned farm the place where they took junior back when this mess was just a kidnapping i think thats where well find donni pell you want me to go drag her back here oh no i want her right where she sits im going to organize a family outing to convene out there but when i get there i want to know what im walking into you want me to go scout it out then can you handle it no problem when soon as you can dont come at the place down that road he snorted give me some credit garrett meet me at the crossroads tomorrow ill try to be there as close to noon as i can ill have some stops to make along the way tharpe jerked his head in the general direction of the kitchen what about those guys i dont care let them tag along if they want or they can stick with me if they decide to go with you make sure they dont start playing their own game ive got to head up the hill in a few minutes go find out what they want to do what are you planning garrett the dead man sounded suspicious i dont know im making it up as i go along it feels like youre setting something up i wish i was therere tags and threads thatre going to hang loose after thiss over and they could cause problems for instance a certain garrett getting caught in a collision between a young woman used to getting what she wants and a somewhat older nononsense redhead who feels she has a certain proprietary interest in the man that one hadnt occurred to me i was thinking more along the lines of the stormwarden wanting to get me for my presumptions and disrespect after she no longer has any use for me amber wont have any interest in me if she gets her meat hooks in that ransom money garrett you are for the most part an unusually soundthinking representative of your species but where members of the opposite sex are concerned you are often a fool a congenital weakness my father was subject to it too im working on it you will break your beer habit first i am certain speaking of amber i should let her know whats going on one piece of advice since you wish to avoid a prime position on the stormwardens geteven list whats that try to restrain that part of you which insists on being sarcastic abrasive and confrontational im working on that too i think ill clear that up right after i get straightened out about women i went to the kitchen doorway and stuck my head in saucerhead said they decided to stick with me his smirk said that was because they werent interested in doing anything that would bring them to the attention of raver styx i winked and headed upstairs xlvii i tapped on ambers door you there its not locked i went inside she was seated on the edge of her bed looking pale and tired is she gone i settled into the rooms sole chair she left we managed to work something out how heavily did she outbid me i dont like your mother amber what does that mean people i dont like never outbid people i do like though sometimes ill let them think they can thanks she didnt sound cheered whats the matter its almost over isnt it i expect to put the noose around somebodys neck tomorrow do you know who not for certain not yet its not going to make anybody happy is it no murder never does not for long then i wont be seeing you i had an impulse to trot down and give the dead man a swift kick he was listening in and snickering probably why is the old blubber boat always right who knows look im just about to go up to your mothers house to question your father and domina dount hows your nerve you want to go along and stand silent witness maybe pick up a change of clothes do i smell bad or something what never mind whats a silent witness somebody who just stands there and makes people stick to the truth because they know the silent witness can contradict them oh she frowned i dont know if im up to that my own father itd be a chance to see domina dount pick her nose with her elbow she rose immediately all right my god what enthusiasm i dont want to hurt my father garrett and i know youll back him into a corner where things will come out that my mother wont be able to forgive something in her tone suggested she was ready to spill family secrets maybe if i didnt ask certain questions your mother wouldnt have to know as long as the answers dont have any bearing on what i dont know there was agony in that and a plea for help tell me ami he has to the father of the baby she was carrying im not surprised to hear that amber i even suspect that your mother already entertains the possibility too i guess she would but even if she did she wouldnt understand it pure misery amber this was gnawing her good it isnt exactly incest it couldve been what how so ami she wasnt a willing partner he raped her i couldnt believe amiranda would have tolerated that from anybody yes no not the way youre thinking he didnt hold a knife at her throat he just coerced her i guess i dont know how he did it she never told me about it only karl but karl told me it started when she was thirteen when youre that young its hard its hard to know what to do not you too no but but he tried twice when i was fourteen almost fifteen it was hard garrett maybe a man wouldnt even understand the first time i just ran away when i realized what he wanted the second time he made sure i didnt have anywhere to run i he he wouldnt let me alone till i said i was going to tell mother and he went into a panic a psychotic panic thats why did he threaten you physically she nodded i see i settled back to ruminate i understood her fears this didnt do karl senior any good at all i already had him down as murder suspect number one but i was still a little nebulous on motive they were both dumb ami and father they had to realize it would happen sooner or later theres too much freefloating residual energy around any place used by someone like my mother not to interfere with the spells on a contraceptive amulet if she could see it coming dont start garrett you dont know what it was like you arent a woman you arent a daughter and youve never been in a squeeze anything like it youre right all right heres what ill do ill talk to him without your mother being there if its not germane she wont have to know she wont allow that ill insist ill also insist that you be there with us oh do i have to i want him in a corner so tight hes got to think his only way out is the truth he cant lie with you standing there ready to blurt remember the time when you i dont like it neither do i but you have to use the tools at hand he couldnt do something like youre thinking amiranda wouldve begun to show soon your mother is inquisitive and when she asks she gets answers how would she have reacted i know what youre going to say garrett hed panic hed go crazy out of fear but not that crazy maybe youre right if we get him deep enough into that corner maybe well find out for sure it seemed a good idea to forget that the stormwarden had discovered amirandas pregnancy on her own garrett do we have time i shook my head slowly its a pity really im sorry as we started down the stairs she said ill bet you he doesnt even know she was pregnant ami wouldnt have told anybody but karl i responded with a noncommittal grunt he knew now though i was willing to grant the possibility that he hadnt known then i paused to stick my head into the dead mans room were going now take care of yourself garrett and mind your manners with your betters the same to you chuckles want to tell me glory mooncalleds secret now just in case the worst happens id hate to check out still mystified with you entering a stormwardens lair no well consider it after this is done and the break is complete he had a point i gave dean some unnecessary instructions about locking up behind me then we left xlviii i decided to make a brief detour to lettie farens maybe it was wrong there are times when ignorance is bliss the man on the door knew me and knew my presence was considered undesirable but he made only a token effort to keep us out inside amber gawked and whispered that she wouldnt have believed it if she hadnt seen it i gawked myself but not for the same reasons the place wasnt open for business never to my knowledge had the house been closed before alarmed i pushed past a barman and a swamper who made halfhearted efforts to stop us i slammed into the pest hole lettie calls home it only took one look stay out there i instructed amber the mound of ruin that was lettie faren tried to glare with eyes blackened and swollen and failed she couldnt strike the spark what remained was a feeble mask for fear i asked chodos boys she croaked an affirmative you shouldve told me where to find donni when you knew before the hard boys decided they wanted her too she just looked at me chances were shed just looked at chodos boys too for a while she was damned near as tough as she thought im working for raver styx these days thats a tight crack to get caught in between the stormwarden and the kingpin i didnt have nothing to tell them and i dont got nothing to tell you garrett bring on the old witch if you want the wicked flee when no man pursueth ill wish you a speedy recovery goodbye as we headed for the exit amber asked why didnt you want me to go in there i gave it to her straight im not the only one looking for donni pell those other guys beat her up trying to find out where donni went bad very they arent nice people in fact im about convinced that youre the only nice person anywhere in this mess she laughed nervously and said you dont know me very well yet then conversationally youre not so bad yourself garrett perhaps she didnt know me very well yet either xlix the man at the stormwardens gate was a stranger he had a competent professional look how was the vacation in the sunny cantard it bounced off grim as usual mr garrett the stormwarden is expecting you and is waiting in her audience room miss dapena can show you the way yeah thanks you guys going to do anything for slauce say what you going in on flowers or anything i thought id kick in if i could it never wouldve happened if he hadnt been coming to see me we havent decided what to do yet well let you know all right sure thanks when we were out of earshot amber said see i told you you werent all bad a cynical manipulative gesture meant to incite a sympathetic attitude among the troops right garrett whatever you say raver styx sat alone in the gloom of an unlighted room about the size of the dead mans her eyes were closed she was so still and unresponsive i suffered a chill had we lost yet another dapena no those supposedly terrible eyes opened and fixed on me i saw nothing but a tired and beaten old lady please have a seat mr garrett like a wolfman under a full moon she began to change amber i believe youd do better to isolate yourself here in the house but if you feel more confident with mr garrett and his associates you have my blessing she was becoming the stormwarden raver styx with a measure of concerned mother amber was within reach and my feet were out of the stormwardens line of sight i nudged her ankle she started figured it out said thank you mother id feel better with mr garrett i think for now that wasnt so hard often all we need to be civil with one another is the presence of a referee we dont want thinking us fools as you wish where would you like to begin mr garrett with domina dount willa dount mr garrett loss of her position and title is a foregone penalty lets not extend any false hopes youre the boss whatever i want to do her first then your husband then the staff if that appears productive wouldnt it be a bit trifling maybe but a few trifles are all i need to fill the gaps in the picture i already have im tempted to invoke penalties on the lot and let the gods distinguish between the wicked and the merely incompetent sometimes i felt that way about our ruling class i observed the dead mans advice though and kept my opinion to myself i know what you mean how do you want to work it in my presence in ambers in willa dounts case with you present and amber absent to begin ive already told amber how long to stay away after she comes in i want you to find a reason to leave having dealt with willa dount i doubt the footwork will do any good but i want to try very well ill want to see all the documents she has especially the letters from the kidnappers have you seen those yes i have did you recognize the hand no it seemed feminine i thought so too so precise what i saw i feared the oneinathousand chance that amiranda had written them amiranda had the penmanship of a drunken troll there was no reading it but no mistaking or disguising it either good now with your husband id prefer to begin with you out of the room as for the staff ill ask you and amber person by person if the intimidation factor inherent in your presence is counterproductive i understand lets get to it where is willa dount now in her office doing the job that will be hers for a few more hours would you get her amber tell her she needs to bring the documents yes master she gave me a wink that her mother caught id appreciate it if youd hold off acting against willa dount or anyone else for another day stormwarden tomorrow i want to take everyone on a walkthrough of what happened the night of the ransom payoff and the morning of amirandas death is that necessary yes absolutely afterward therell be no lingering doubts she didnt press for details a courtesy i appreciated maybe she wasnt such a bad old gal after all we waited in silence l willa dount marched in with a stack of papers you sent for me madam she didnt seem surprised to see me and shouldnt have since she had her agents among the staff ive hired mr garrett to hunt down the person or people responsible for the deaths of amiranda karl and courter slauce he wants to ask you questions willa answer completely and truthfully i raised the eyebrow slauce too surprise surprise but certainly a point for her give those papers to mr garrett she did so with ill grace youre a vulture circling this family arent you you wont rest till youve picked its bones if you take a quick count of the number of noses on your face youll come up with more than the number of times ive approached the dapena family soliciting employment your wit hasnt suffered any improvement willa sit down and be quiet restrain your prejudices and speak only when youre spoken to yes madam did the whip crack there or did it crack willa dount planted herself in a chair face blank and cool if she was going to perch i was going to prowl i rose began moving shuffling the papers the kidnappers had gone to great lengths to make sure domina dount understood exactly what she was supposed to do slipped a finger behind the letters id met already looked willa dount in the eye and asked when did you first suspect that karls kidnapping was contrived when amiranda disappeared shed been odd for weeks and had her head together with karl for days before he vanished lie number one straight out of the chute willa dount should have been on the road to her payoff appointment before amiranda made her break unless unless shed known beforehand what amiranda planned when did you begin to suspect the game had become real when i reached the place where i was supposed to hand the gold over those people werent playing they were deadly real im afraid i almost lost my composure ive never been that afraid describe the people you met there she frowned i told her ive asked you before about the payoff you wouldnt talk it was your right at the time but not now so tell me about those people and about that night i thumbed the first letter i hadnt yet read there were two closed coaches and at least four people two coachmen of mixed parentage probably ogre and human the ugliest man ive ever seen and a fairly attractive young woman the ugly man was in charge you said at least four what does that mean was there somebody else there might have been someone inside the womans coach twice i thought i saw movement in there but they made me stay on the wagon i wasnt close enough to be sure uhm i picked a spot near a good light and adjusted a chair from the beginning of that night every trivial detail she began and soon i was hearing what i expected a tale with no significant deviations from the one skredli had told me i lent her both ears and one eye while i skimmed the letters then i went over a few again then again and finally i thought i saw what id half expected to see though im no expert on forgery willa dount reached her departure from the bridge over cedar creek i didnt figure anything interesting happened after that hold it there she stopped dead and dead is the way id describe the voice shed been using shed been under so much strain for so long she had very little fire left that payoff setup was as queer as a ninefoot pixie no swap on the spot though i admit there wasnt a lot you could do once you got there you couldnt run away but they let you see them and then they let you go without killing you knowing who you worked for at a time when at least one of them knew thered be a murder within a few hours i cant explain that mr garrett death is all expected when i realized that karl wasnt there unless you took out some kind of insurance i thought like maybe not delivering the whole ransom and maybe refusing to let the balance go until you and karl were safe maybe even not knowing where the rest was or saying you didnt so they wouldnt try anything rough there was something or you wouldnt be here now i thought it but didnt say it did you hear any names mentioned did you get a good look at any of them no names there was moonlight i saw all four well enough to recognize again though the woman and the ugly man stayed back i have excellent night vision maybe they didnt realize how clearly i saw them maybe it probably doesnt matter now anyway theyre all dead but the woman she just looked at me you couldnt crack her with a sledgehammer i had everything i wanted to get with the stormwarden watching i was wondering how could stall just as amber let herself in raver styx made no pretenses and no excuses she stood and left amber whispered i didnt find anything in her quarters she doesnt keep a journal or you dont have to talk behind my back in front of me amber spit it out i nodded the accounts didnt look jiggered the silver was sold for anywhere from seven to fifteen percent below market im not sure but id guess that would be reasonable in the circumstances whatever the price of silver has fallen enough that now the buyers are the losers that was my amber keeping up with the metals market despite everything who did the buying she handed me a list interesting the top name here lyman gameleon is down for a hundred twenty thousand at the maximum discount gameleon is one of our bigthree suspects even that didnt rock willa dount she said only it was an emergency and i went where i had to go to get enough gold the stormwarden has examined the accounts of these transactions and expressed no disapproval a thought maybe even an inspiration do you recall the dates and times of the transactions amber she had not noted those no should i go get them willa dount said that wont be necessary i remember she rattled off every deal as though she was reading from the record the timing made it conceivable that the deals themselves had initiated the chain of complications or at least could have led to intensive recomplication did gameleon know what the gold was for lord gameleon garrett domina scolded look i dont care if you call him pinky porker just answer the question yes he had to be told before hed deal id already established to my own satisfaction a link between gameleon and donni pell was that wise in retrospect probably not but at the time lord gameleon was a last resort hardly but lets not fight about it thats it for tonight tonight ill need you again tomorrow early were all going to walk this through she gave me a puzzled look as she rose what chicanery was i planning find the baronet and send him in i said id grown impatient and irritable by the time the door opened and that opening didnt make anything better willa dount and raver styx came in the stormwarden looking like one of the tempests she brewed will you want to question the staff mr garrett wheres your husband i dont doubt the answer to that question would be quite interesting he left the house shortly after you arrived when last seen he was entering the house of lord gameleon his halfbrother who lives across the street lord gameleon admits that he was there earlier but denies that he is now about the staff there was no juice left my candle had begun to gutter the hell with them i can tie the knot on it without them im going home to get some sleep meet me at my place at eight ready for a trek upcountry dont let anybody else wander off make a production of leaving so anyone interested will know something is up as you will mr garrett that will be all for tonight then willa i asked amber are you coming or staying staring at the floor she replied ill go with you but i need to get some things first i guess that was as close as she could come to telling her mother to pick her nose with her elbow the stormwarden developed a severe tick in her left cheek but she said nothing she understood battles lost as well as battles won the first thing i did when we got to the house was write a letter to morley dotes i had one of the neighbor kids deliver it then i brought the dead man up to date and feigned an effort to pry a few secrets out of him just to keep him feeling wanted i joined amber in the kitchen where we shared one of deans finer productions then i stashed myself away for the night my dreams which i usually dont recall werent the kind ill treasure forever li dean rousted me out in plenty of time to get ready we breakfasted well and packed our field rations i took a look at my arsenal and picked a couple of lethal engines suitable for a lady i made amber practice with them until her mothers cavalcade arrived a thoughtful woman the stormwarden she had somehow ascertained that i didnt have transportation of my own she rolled up with a coach a carriage and a spare horse she was in the coach willa dount was driving the carriage amber stepped up on the seat beside her what a lighthearted and friendly drive that would be i went around the front of the horse and looked him in the eye he looked back i saw none of the tribes usual malice he obviously hadnt heard of me the stormwarden had shown some sense in another direction i had expected to have to nag her into sending her army home but shed brought only the two men atop her coach i couldnt squawk about them i suppose when youre a stormwarden you only need guards for show you lead the way i told domina dount her face was old stone as she nodded and started her team amber settled facing backward when she saw that i would ride rearguard though most of the time the stormwardens coach obscured our views of one another willa dount set a brisk pace occasionally slowing so her boss could catch up i stayed fifty yards behind the coach in the city i watched the citizenry watch it in the country i watched farmers and as we moved upcountry i kept mentally reviewing my maps i didnt see a single place that looked suitable for what i suspected had happened i thought about moving up beside willa dount she might have given something away sure like stones flinch but i had a reason for lying back morley overtook me twothirds of the way to the deadly crossroads at that point the road passed among trees and travelers couldnt be watched from afar he dared rein in and talk theyre back there he told me gameleon and six men they wont be easy they trying to catch up no good well put everybody in the sack at once youre crazy garrett seven of them and no telling what up ahead and youre talking like youve got them by the shorthairs all theyve got is numbers ive got a stormwarden hustle on up and tell saucerhead morley resumed his lonerider act in a hurry it was coming together beautifully i just hoped i wouldnt be in the middle when it crunched i wasnt the most pleased of men when we reached the crossroads hadnt spotted one place that fulfilled the criteria for my concept of what had become of most of the ransom gold though id seen a few side roads and whatnot that would later bear further examination if there was a later if amber wasnt more defeatist than i was becoming i made the mistake for a short time of thinking i saw a chance for the big hit you dont want to fall into that trap it can shatter your perspective it can narrow your focus until the rest of the world slides out of touch hold up i yelled at willa dount she had turned west without pausing my fault i hadnt told her we would be stopping we got out of traffics way i dismounted where was saucerhead id expected him to be waiting he stepped out of the woods on the south side of the road from the corner of my eye noted willa dounts surprise i joined him what have we got you were right shes down there alone nope company and plenty of it one guy by himself showed up about midnight last night then a mob of ogre breeds got there just before i left skredli he nodded how many fifteen crask and sadler behaving they arent stupid garrett they know their limitations i suppose id better tell the stormwarden you scout out a workable approach sure what about those guys behind you they can take care of themselves i waited while a string of goat carts trundled past trotted to the stormwardens coach and invited myself inside why have we stopped mr garrett i explained i didnt expect it to turn into so large a party otherwise everythings come together any suggestions the man who arrived last night my husband probably my friend wouldnt know him by sight does lord gameleon know where hes going i dont know he may need someone to follow we cant sneak up on anybody going straight in i realize that mr garrett ive got a little help but not enough to handle fourtoone odds you have me what was that worth i didnt ask all right my friend and i will sneak up through the woods you be careful take amber and you be careful mr garrett i have to salvage something from this disaster shell be all right i left the coach amber you come with me the stormwarden left the coach on the other side she said something to the men on top the driver nodded the other descended he and raver styx boarded the carriage it rolled away as amber joined saucerhead and me what are we doing she asked going for a walk in the woods i tied my mounts reins to the coach we ducked into the trees just in time lord gameleon and his boys trotted past they werent in livery and made a big deal of ignoring the coach when they were gone saucerhead asked she s going straight in i guess well have to hurry wheres morley with crask and sadler right follow me miss dapena just lead mr tharpe ill keep up lii our timing was perfect we were near the edge of the clearing when morley appeared out of nowhere not bad for a city boy i told him crask and sadler popped up as suddenly if wed been unfriendly we would have been in big trouble anything happening over there lot of screaming what started right after i got here somebodys asking some questions somebody else isnt giving the answers they want to hear i wasnt surprised crask said somethings happening i joined him from where he stood the farmhouse could be seen plainly ogre breeds boiled out raced across the weedy field toward the gap where the road left the woods their lookout must have spotted the stormwarden someone grunted they been doing any patrols or just watching the road watching the road sadler said theyre ogres stupid the stormwarden may have overestimated herself they might kill first and ask questions later theyre distracted now saucerhead said be a good time to move up if we keep low along the downhill side of that swale there we can get pretty close maybe up to the foundation stones where the barn used to be i recalled a deer trail through the high grass that followed the route saucerhead recommended i looked but i couldnt see the stones youve been over there yeah i had to look in and make sure lets go saucerhead went first then crask then morley i told amber to keep down and sent her next i followed her sadler brought up the rear we were halfway across when the brouhaha broke out in the woods we stopped i said that doesnt sound like ogres running into surprise sorcery no lets move as we crouched among the stones thirty yards from the rear of the house skredlis gang emerged from the woods uphill they had five or six prisoners gameleon i said what happened to the stormwarden there are twelve breeds up there garrett morley said in a minute they wont be able to spot us behind the house why dont we make our move be waiting for them inside when they get there i didnt like it but the odds werent going to get any better i checked the others they all nodded amber stay put ill holler when its safe she had developed a case of deafness when we moved toward the back door she moved with us i cursed under my breath but there was nothing i could do short of bopping her and laying her out we reached the house unnoticed morley volunteered to lead nobody argued he was the best we moved inside there were three ogres one woman and karl dapena senior morley creamed two of the ogres before they knew they were in trouble the third tried to yell and only got out a bark before crask stuck a knife through his throat sadler finished the other two amber dumped her breakfast i told you to stay out i ground my teeth and examined our prizes neither seemed particularly pleased to see us frying pan into the fire eh baronet both were strapped into chairs dapena was gagged the woman wasnt but she was yelled out both had been tortured and with little finesse you must be the marvelous donni pell ive been anxious to meet you right now you dont look like something that men would kill for cut the sweet talk garrett morley said theyre coming i peeked that clown skredli must have raised an army we can take them they have to keep hold of their prisoners i like a man with a positive attitude why dont i slide out the back way and you holler when youve got them you going to mouth your way through the gates of hell or are you going to decide what to do crask sadler you guys get out of sight down that hall saucerhead wait behind the door let four or five get in then slam it and bolt it morley and i will jump out from the kitchen we ought to polish off the bunch before the rest bust in amber you get out back this time she did what i told her nothing like a good scare and you call me a tactical genius morley grumbled but he ducked into the kitchen without offering a suggestion of his own even tactical geniuses stumble when saucerhead went to slam the door skredli and two other breeds were on the transom he had the strength to bounce two of them back into the yard but the third got caught between the edge of the door and the frame he did a lot of yelling and flailing while saucerhead grunted and strained trying to shut the door right through him and tharpe did manage to hang on while we thumped the five hed let in morley chuckled seven to go let them in saucerhead tharpe jumped back skredli and the guys stomped in we did expect them to have their cutlery out ready for carving we didnt expect gameleons brunos to help them they did we been suckered garrett saucerhead said as he stumbled back past me long knife in one hand and headthumper in the other fending off two ogres and a man i fell past a window and shot a quick look to see if help was coming no stormwarden had the gang dealt with her already had they caught her in a pincer up in the woods i kicked one guy in the groin but not good enough to slow him much the three pushed me toward the kitchen keeping me too busy staying alive to keep track of what was happening to everybody else win or lose skredli and his bunch would get hurt they were up against the best tunfaire offered small consolation i got in a solid thump to an ogres head as i backed through the kitchen doorway he reeled stalling his companions i whirled and dove through a window i did not land well the breath went out of me and didnt want to come back but i got my feet under me in time to lay a whack on the skull of a guy trying to climb after me it was no headbreaker but it discouraged him i limped to the front door wound up and flung one of the witchs crystals then i held up a wall while my breath caught up with me and the crystal did its deed the uproar inside died when i went in everybody was folded up puking i shambled around thumping heads when i had the bad guys down i scrounged what i could and tied them up i got done just before the spell wore off sitting against a wall morley glared and croaked thanks a bloody bunch garrett im ruined ingrate youre alive i dont dare describe the looks the ingrates crask and sadler gave me it was a good thing they had stomachs and a few wounds to patch i heard sounds outside i went to the door the stormwarden was coming finally she left the carriage and strode toward me i stepped out of her way she entered scanned the battleground sniffed looked at me suspiciously i said were all here now ill get things sorted out and well start all right she marched over to the baronet his chair had overturned during the struggle she stared down at him briefly then turned to donni pell is this the infamous whore mr garrett i didnt ask yet i think so she doesnt look like much does she with females you never know she might be a whole different act cleaned up and set down where she thought she could work her magic that got me the darkest look shed given yet meanwhile domina dount just stood in the doorway for the first time in our acquaintance at a loss saucerhead why dont you get amber he gave me a look as loving as the stormwardens but nodded and went out back i said stormwarden i dont know if its within your expertise but if you can wed all appreciate a little healing magic here everyone who faces the warlords of venageta must learn elementary field medicinal spells mr garrett maybe everyone of a certain class amber came in her face went gray i thought she was going to upchuck again it gets rough sometimes amber gut it out you all right saucerhead ill live garrett why the hell dont you ever warn anybody when youre going to pull something out of your sleeve he winced and clapped one hand to his stomach i didnt bother explaining that if id warned him id have warned the bad guys too liii we dumped the ogres and brunos in the weeds live or dead the farmhouse was still as crowded as a rabbit warren we found seats for everybody only amber and i remained standing she leaned against the doorframe too nervous to sit though the stormwardens perch was no better than anyone elses her manner turned it into a throne she said proceed mr garrett lets start with my old buddy skredli skredli tell the nice people the story you told me at chodos place keep in mind that the lady there can make you hurt a lot worse than chodo ever did skredli got fatalistic again he told his story the same story donni pell was the villain of his piece she was a wonder to watch as she tried working on him so he would cast her in a better light gameleon and dapena were worth watching too and domina dount for that matter as she learned that some things shed heard but not gutbelieved were true when skredli finished i looked at gameleon you think you can talk your way out of here ill have your head morley asked you want me to knock him around a little to improve his attitude garrett i always wanted to see if blueblood bones sound different when they break i dont think well need to let me twist his arm a little how about you saucerhead we could hang him up by the ankles and break him like a wishbone i snapped knock it off raver styx lifted her left hand and extended it toward gameleon palm forward fingers spread her face was bland but lavender sparks danced between her fingers gameleon yelled no then he screamed a long chilly one i wouldnt believe anybody had that much breath in him he went slack so much for him for now baronet how about you want to sing your song hell no he didnt his old lady was sitting right there shed have his nachos on a platter she said karl whatever youre thinking the alternative will be worse she raised her left hand again a few sparks flew he flinched whimpered she dropped her hand into her lap smiled a cruel smile id do it too you know and she would i was convinced there were some bleak faces in that place i looked at gameleon at dapena at domina dount at amber who sincerely regretted having come poor old skredli was damning himself for not running instead of trying to make a last score donni pell well i concentrated on the spider woman for the first time i had avoided that because even i a bit was subject to whatever made her so dangerous she didnt look dangerous she was a small woman fair well into her twenties but with one of those marvelous faces and complexions that make some small fair women look adolescent for years beyond their time she was pretty without being beautiful even ragged filthy and abused she had a certain something that touched both the father and the lech in a man a something that made a man want to protect and possess i dont play with little girls but i know the feeling a man can get looking at a ripening fifteenyearold in my time i have encountered several donni pells they are conscious of what they do to men manipulate it like hell the sensual frenzy is balanced by manipulating the fatherly urge as well usually they come across as being empty between the ears too in desperate need of protection donni pell i suppose was an artist having turned an essentially patriarchal societys stereotype of a womans role into a bludgeon with which she worked her will upon the male race she was still trying to do it bound and gagged under it all she was tough as hard and heartless as a morley dotes who might qualify as the male counterpart of a donni pell skredli and his boys hadnt broken through the stormwarden said will you get on with it mr garrett im trying to decide where to poke the hornets nest right now these people have no incentives how about staying alive she rose and joined me somebody here had amiranda killed somebody here had my son killed somebody here is going to pay for that maybe a lot of somebodys if the innocent dont convince me of their lack of guilt hows that for motivation mr garrett excellent if you can convince a couple men who figure their place in the world entitles them to immunity from justice justice has nothing to do with it stark bloody screaming agonizing vengeance is what im talking about im not concerned about political repercussions i no longer care if i get pulled down her intensity convinced me i looked at her husband and gameleon dapena was convinced too but gameleon was holding his own softly i said courter slauce equally softly the stormwarden replied i havent forgotten him continue i scanned them all again then turned on domina dount you feel like modifying anything youve said before she looked blankly at me i dont think youre directly responsible for any deaths domina but you helped turn a scam into something deadly she shivered willa dount shivered she was ready to break the blood had reached her when shed had to see it firsthand amber sensed it too despite the state of her nerves she glared at me i winked nobody wants to kick in nobody volunteered to save himself all right ill reconstruct correct me if i get it wrong or if you want somebody else to get the shaft mr garrett right stormwarden so it started a long time ago in a house on the hill when a woman who shouldnt have had children did so mr garrett my contract is for a job done without interference stormwarden i was going to walk lightly but since youre impatient ill just spit it out you made life such hell for them that your whole family was ready to do anything to get away nobody worked up the guts to try till you went to the cantard though its unlikely anybody would have then if your husband hadnt in the course of continued unwanted attentions gotten amiranda pregnant amber glared daggers domina dount squeaked the stormwarden glared too but only because i was making public something she already suspected the baronet fainted as soon as she knew amiranda went to the only friend she had your son they cooked up a scheme to save her from shame and get them both away from a house they loathed junior would get kidnapped they would use the ransom to start a new life but they couldnt work it out by themselves they wanted it to look so real the stormwarden raver styx would believe that her son had been done in by dishonorable villains why because whatever else they felt the dapena brats loved their father and didnt want him crucified they wanted to cover for him mr garrett im going to do it my way stormwarden i faced donni pell they couldnt pull it off without help so junior went to his girlfriend she said shed arrange everything and things started going wrong right away because donni pell cant do anything straight she told the guys she hired what was happening figuring she could work it for a profit she told the baronet figuring she could get something out of him she told lord gameleon maybe or maybe he got it from another direction there are several ways he could have known donni planned to do the stunt using ogres who were stealing from the dapena warehouse and selling to gameleon that was a big screwup domina dount already had junior investigating shortages at the warehouse i spoke directly to donni and you knew it meanwhile karl senior let domina dount in on the news willa dount registered an inarticulate protest karl got grabbed on schedule and taken here where donni grew up then willa dount to keep it looking good at her erid asked me to put my stamp of approval on what she was doing to get him back the kidnappers thought id been hired to poke into the warehouse business they tried to convince me to keep out now it gets confusing as to who did what to who and why none of the principals understood what they were doing because they were all being pulled in several directions everybody at the stormwardens house thought they had a chance for a big hit and a break with raver styx everybody outside saw the big hit but the pregnancy and warehouse might come out if the kidnapping was investigated junior had to be sent home and kept quiet so the trails could get stale before the stormwarden got back but then i was suddenly in the middle of the thing nobody knew what i was doing and i wouldnt go away so the ransom demand was made the delivery was set domina raised the money and amiranda who sensed that it wasnt going according to plan headed for her rendezvous with junior but donni had gotten other folks involved and they fancied a hunk of ransom the hell with the kid what could he do go cry to his mother but karl senior who figured to get half of donnis half of the ransom warned her that ami was tough enough to blow the whole thing i glared at the baronet he was awake now and bone white so donni arranged for ami to do what she had planned disappear forever i guess junior was supposed to think it was ami who left him without his share donni pell made noise and shook her head the stormwarden stared at her with the intensity of a snake sizing up supper i didnt know if i had that part right amirandas death otherwise benefited no one but the baronet but i couldnt figure him for the order he wouldnt have done it for his piddling share of the ransom or maybe he never got it because he hadnt made tracks when he should have had cash in hand i glared into donnis eyes you going to tell us who wanted the girl killed or are you just going to tell us it wasnt you she had a very dry throat i dont think anybody heard her but me it was the kid he said i dont bash women often when i backhanded her i told myself it was because she wasnt one not in the lady sense with her talent she might have sold the idea to somebody but id been back and forth with it from the beginning and if there was one thing id learned from it all it was that the son wasnt guilty of that one his big crime was stupidity compounded by gutlessness better come up with a more likely sacrifice kid or youre it the trouble with donni pell was that she had no handles she knew exactly where she stood and exactly what her chances were she was the only person alive who really knew what had happened i could guess and spout and maybe come close but i couldnt get more than seventyfive percent the stormwarden said mr garrett im willing to be patient in the extreme but this approach isnt unmasking anything with what youve already given me ive reached several conclusions one that my brotherinlaw lord gameleon for reasons he considered adequate had my son killed in his instance my only interest is to determine the extent to which my husband had knowledge of that and was involved in the effort to financially weaken me by siphoning my sources of income she wasnt stupid and just because she wasnt in the trade didnt mean she had to be blind all right i wouldve gotten to that eventually i was hoping friend donni would nail it down when the flood started there wont be a flood with her mr garrett you know that the woman has the soul of a a at a loss for words i would have suggested stormwarden to fill her metaphor but she was already unhappy with me it was no time to press my luck she said im also certain that my husband killed courter slauce that much detecting i could manage myself he was away from the house when it happened he left on slauces heels in a panic according to the men on the gate the baronet tried to protest nobody listened i asked why slauce knew something karl was frightened enough to murder him to keep him from telling you courter would have been easy for him comparatively karl hated the man and slauce wouldnt have felt he was in any danger from such a coward that leaves amiranda liv who did kill amiranda crest it was the question of the case id begun to suspect wed never get an answer only one person knew maybe and he or she wasnt talking i have a suggestion mr garrett the stormwarden said in a tone that made it clear it was a command you take your friends and the ogre and amber and go back to tunfaire ill finish here when youve settled your accounts bring the ogre to my home from the corner of my eye i caught morley making a little jabbing motion with his thumb he thought it was time to go and he was probably right i said you were going to work on our wounds yes no sooner said than done crask and sadler were awed with saucerheads help they grabbed skredli and dragged him out the front door he hollered and carried on like he thought the stormwarden was going to save him into the carriage i told them morley raised an eyebrow and jerked his head toward the house her problem you get down i told the man who had driven down the the stormwarden and willa dount amber get up on the seat no dont argue just do it shut him up saucerhead the stormwardens man backed away from us looking at me like he was looking death in the eye he went around the side of the house instead of going inside sadler you drive crask keep the ogre under control they gave me dark looks i didnt care i wanted words with morley and saucerhead as we walked up the slope roll they rolled we trudged along behind i looked back once the stormwardens man was headed across the clearing evidently he understood what was going on and wanted to be far away morley spoke first i dont like the way she took over all of a sudden garrett and saucerhead you dont ever want to go to her place again shed hand me my head i know we walked until we reached the woods i told sadler to stop you guys understand what was happening down there what the old bitch was thinking crask knew shes going to rub them then shes going to arrange something for us because she dont want nobody around who knows she did it to guys like her old man and gameleon i looked up at amber she wanted to argue but she shivered after a moment she said i think i saw the change come over her before you did garrett what are you going to do if we took a vote none of us would go for letting her do what she wants morley said kill them all and let the gods sort them out saucerhead said it isnt like theyre innocent except maybe the dount woman amber where will willa dount stand i dont know shes been into things like this with mother before mother would trust her to keep her mouth shut but mother seemed a little crazy she might include willa with the others she had to be guilty of something even if she didnt kill anybody yeah she was guilty of a lot but not the killings i dont think friend skredli flopped in the back of the carriage a scream came from the farmhouse gameleon morley said i figured shed start with him shell stay with him for a long time amber do you see the position were in she didnt want to your mother plans to kill those people then kill us so we cant accuse her i reiterated right weakly yes i think so what options does that leave us she shrugged i let her stew it awhile you think she thinks were dumb enough not to see that nobody thought that skredli thumped around again nobody paid any attention does she think well go back to town and try to insure ourselves or does she figure well do something about it now how well does she know us morley asked i dont know she told me she checked me out when she hired me she expects us to move now garrett saucerhead said shell never be more vulnerable amber snapped wait a damned minute sweetheart you said yourself i know but you cant you think we should let her hunt us down instead you could get out of tunfaire you could so could she but she wont and neither will we tunfaire is home crask sadler what do you think they huddled and muttered for half a minute crask elected himself spokesman youre right were in it with you for whatever you have to do if it looks practical gameleon had stopped yelling hed probably passed out after a pause the baronet took up the song i moved downhill a little to where i could see the farmhouse i wish i knew more about her skills can she tell were up here does she know exactly where we are i looked at amber dont expect me to help you garrett even if she does plan murder i surveyed the others they were waiting on me i have a suggestion you take the carriage and go home or to my house if you want then you wont be involved you wont know anything ill know who came home but thats all youll know get along now saucerhead drag the ogre out before she leaves you can drive the damned thing cant you amber im not completely helpless garrett scoot then she scooted the baronet had stopped yelling donni pell was tuning up i said weve got to assume she knows were here it makes no sense to bet the other way crask asked so how you figure to get to her something will come to one of us morley gave me a hard look it said he knew i had something in mind already i did but the seed hadnt yet sprouted its going to be dark soon saucerhead predicted that what youre waiting for maybe lets have a chat with friend skredli we set him up against a tree the others stood behind me baffled as i squatted here we are again skredli me with an idea how you can get out of this with your butt still attached he didnt believe there was any such idea i wouldnt have in his place im going to give you a chance to bail me out of a jam you do it the worst off you can be is with a head start from here to the farmhouse i hear you can pick them up and put them down when you want a flicker of interest betrayed itself untie him while i explain i said hell need to get loosened up saucerhead did the honors not gently here it is skredli you go down in the field and get your buddies loose then you hit the stormwarden take her out then give a holler and light out i have business in that house so i wont be after you no promises about saucerhead but youll have your head start he looked at me hard what do you say i asked stonily i dont like it how does it stack up against your current chances i never knew an ogre with a sense of humor skredli stunned me when he said you talked me into it you smoothtalking son of a bitch good get up work the kinks out i took one of the witchs crystals from my pocket this one didnt need to be stomped for activation this little treasure here i said its from the same source as the spell that had everybody puking awhile ago and that had everybody spinning when we raided your place in ogre town just so you know its the real thing skredli i shoved it into his pocket said the proper word if you try to take it out or if you do anything that makes me want to repeat that word itll blow up itll tear you in half hey we made a goddamn deal it stands im just trying to make sure your side does the spell isnt good for more than an hour and the crystal wont activate if youre too far away for it to hear me yell i figure the farmhouse is barely in yelling distance you follow me yeah you human bastards never let up do you never give a guy a break thats the way you want to look at it skredli thats all right with me long as you whack the witch skredli drained a long putupon sigh from his longsuffering body when as soon as its dark minutes away i could distinguish the farmhouse only by looking to one side of it five minutes later i told skredli anytime you feel like getting started how about next new years he started down the slope lv skredli apparently had an honest streak if somebody had tried that stunt on me i would have tested the trick somehow unless they were better talkers than i you guys gather around close i said after id given the breed fifteen minutes to get started ive got two tricks left this one is the best i took out a crystal bigger than the others the witch had given me it gave off the minutest amount of soft orange light i suspect it had stretched her limits to create it if it did what she claimed it would when i break this well be invisible to the second sight or whatever you call it for about ten minutes well still be visible to regular eyes once i crack it dont waste any time you fibbed to skredli you bad boy saucerhead said sideways sort of maybe if he runs after he makes his diversion i wont chase him what about me i warned him you do what you want when we have the stormwarden wrapped up he grinned big enough to see in the dark everybody got it they said they did morley asked what else have you got what you said you had a couple of things i know you garrett what are they just one more a crystal from the same family i used before this one causes violent muscle cramps please yell or something this time garrett all right here goes i broke the glowing crystal skredli found half a dozen guys to back him and made his move when we were a hundredfifty yards from the farmhouse it wasnt a happy move for the most the attack was over before we were twothirds of the way to the house worms of blue light snapped and snarled around the place men yelled a couple staggered away ablaze but nothing reached us i watched skredli brush off a patch of fire and head for the woods beyond the house saucerhead saw him too he growled but stuck the stormwarden stepped out the front door we dropped down in the grass there was enough light cast by burning men to show her grinning she turned back into the darkened house i flung my last crystal i hit the dirt tinkle and a long scream i charged the others damn near stomped on my heels they knew as well as i that we had to get her wrapped up in the few seconds when the pain distracted her too much to protect herself she was fighting it when we arrived i tried to clap a hand over her mouth she ducked me morley let her have a fist in the temple that loosened her up then crask and sadler pinned her to the floor i got back around and clamped my hand over her mouth get the damned light going saucerhead the woman couldnt remain still the spasms racking her were as violent as convulsions a lamp came to life but morley had lighted it saucerhead was nowhere to be seen morley set the lamp down and brought a rag that i stuffed into the stormwardens mouth in seconds he returned with rope we bound her her spasms began to ease where did you come up with rope all of a sudden they didnt need it anymore i looked he was right gameleon and the baronet had checked out donni pell was alive but that was about all domina dount was unbound but standing in a corner her face a mask of horror eyes wide but unseeing skin as pale and cold as a humans can get i dont think she knew we were there not a very nice lady at all i said i sort of wished amber could be there to see what had happened to her father there wasnt a lot left of him or his halfbrother i understood why hed been scared enough to murder courter slauce had he foreseen this i could see him being scared enough to ice amiranda even sadler and crask were impressed and they werent the types one impresses with human messes the stormwarden was recovering her eyes were open hard unfriendly what now sadler asked our next move was obvious there was only one way to save our butts do unto others first but that was a hell of a giant step even after wed started taking it ive got no use for our masters from the hill and the others had none either but wed been conditioned to think them immune to our ire a wish came true a sound i thought it was saucerhead but sadler and crask nearer the door whipped out blades and got set for trouble amber walked in and right behind her was saucerheads witch i gawked shaggoth stuck his head in the door while morley muttered something elfish sniffed disgustedly and withdrew into the night morley finally managed what the hell was that a troll amber didnt react physically this time she looked at her fathers remains she looked at her mother she looked at gameleon and donni pell she looked at her mother again she looked at willa dount then she looked at me her lips were tight and white she shook her head took willa dount into her arms and began making soothing sounds what now sadler asked again i looked at the witch your stuff came in handy i guessed it might she looked like she might lose her most recent meal whatre you doing here shaggoth came upon this child on the road in hysterics he brought her to me i wheedled some of her story out of her and guessed some more and thought you might be in trouble weve been on the hill behind you for the past hour ran into amber just by chance eh she smiled we like to keep track she glanced around your associate has asked twice what you want to do now it isnt a matter of what i want to do its what have to do to stay healthy i was planning to dump them down the well and fill it by the time anyone digs them up they wont be identifiable you tend to think as grimly as those you oppose today garrett youre the knight in the knighted land remember a rage for justice thats what you brought with you when you visited me not kill or be killed show me the way my heads locked in its gotten too bloody and too brutal amber come here amber left willa dount who had begun to show some color yes explain to garrett what we discussed while we waited on the hillside discussed you told me garrett all we have to do now is get some people from the high council to come and see whats happened nobody else has to get killed we can just sit tight and keep things the way they are answer questions honestly my mother has overstepped her rights theyll take appropriate steps including making certain mother never hurts anybody again you and your friends included i thought about it i thought about it some more maybe they were too damned idealistic but if the right bunch came out some of the stormwardens enemies we might come up smelling like roses they could tie it in a knot and make a good show get what they wanted and come out looking like champions of justice themselves its worth a think lets take a walk i grabbed her hand and went outside what is it she asked the gold its gone isnt it anyway if it turns out the way the witch said it wont matter ill get everything that belonged to my mother and father and she wont be there to the gold isnt gone not most of it willa dount hid it somewhere skredlis bunch werent after two hundred thousand they asked for twenty thousand domina forged an extra cipher into all those letters oh i see you want your half not really i never counted on getting it i just want you to keep it in mind if you bring in a tribunal they get a sniff of that they could get itchy to grab its all right with you to do it this way its fine with me its you im asking about she said it would be the witch yes she knows you better than i do i guess lets go inside we went i told crask and sadler you guys got any reason to hang around crask was leaning against a wall watching the witch he said yeah he pointed her he meant donni pell chodo wants her when youre done with her if shes still breathing what for an ornament like the broads that hang around the pool he thinks shed be interesting all hes heard i see i liked an aspect of the idea i examined my conscience better than killing her maybe its all right with me take her now the witch gave me an unreadable look then she stepped over and did something to donni pell the girl began breathing easier saucerhead came strolling in he saw the witch and looked sheepish immediately i got the distinct impression the world would be plagued by an ogre breed named skredli no more morley said nothing in fact he did one of the fanciest fades ever i paid no attention while crask and sadler started out with donni pell on a crude stretcher and when i looked morley was nowhere in sight lvi the investigators came in a body of eight they were painfully thorough yet there was never any doubt of their ruling the final decision found lord gameleon baronet dapena and the stormwarden raver styx all guilty of murder amirandas death they ascribed to person or persons unknown on the hill they dont hang each other raver styx was sentenced to be stripped of her property and sorcerous powers and ejected from the hill to make her way alone in the world except she didnt exactly go alone willa dount vanished and the last i heard raver styx was trying to hunt her down one hundred eighty thousand marks gold i wonder if raver styx will have any luck i never managed to locate willa dount or the gold despite months of searching whenever i had free time i did figure out that she had kept it with her all the time she hadnt been late to the payoff meet because shed stopped on the way but as skredli had thought shed miscalculated the speed a heavily loaded wagon could make the cut shed forged for herself had been concealed under a false bottom i found the very wagon and the man who had modified it for her whatever she did with the gold she did it after the payoff i did all right though i found ways to recover most of the rest and amber made sure i got ten percent ive had no direct contact with amber since we got back to tunfaire shes been too busy muscling into her mothers place in the scheme of the hill to visit me i havent dared go there i looked like id spent six weeks in the wild islands when i got home dean took one look and rolled up his nose he said ill put some water on to heat mr garrett i heard a woman say something in the kitchen i was not up to coping with one of his nieces what have i told you about tinnie stepped into the hallway an angry redhaired vision im going to give you one chance to explain garrett she said and went back into the kitchen what the hell is that she saw you coming out of lettie farens place with a woman the afternoon she got back to town dean looked smug and you knowing who i was with and why didnt bother to explain because you figured it would serve me right to get on her shit list eh he refused to look abashed the rat tinnie took my word more or less after i explained everything six times and showed her that yes id even made money on this one but it took some doing and some of the money had to be spent in fancy eating places and whatnot before she decided to forgive me for whatever it was she imagined i might have done she finally relented when i started muttering about marrying one of deans nieces she wanted to save me from a fate worse than death a week had passed when crask came to the door i wasnt in a good mood dean and the dead man and tinnie were all riding me for one reason or another saucerhead was avoiding me because of what hed gone through during the investigation morleys boys wouldnt let me get anywhere near his place every time i left the house pokey pigotta followed me for no special reason just because he wanted to hone his skills to the point where he could do it without me getting wise i wasnt in a good mood yeah i saved my nastiest tone im not so stupid id lay that on one of chodo contagues headbreakers the next one that came around might not be somebody i recognized and he might play a few drum rolls on my skull with pieces of lead pipe chodo wants to see you wonderful i didnt want to see chodo not unless i got into a pinch so bad it was time to collect my favor social crask smiled you could say that i didnt like it i hadnt seen crask smile since hed turned up in my life he said he has a gift for you oh boy a gift from the kingpin the ways those boys operate that could mean anything with my imagination it couldnt mean anything good but what could i do id been summoned i have enough enemies without adding the kingpin just to snub him let me tell my man so he can lock up i told dean i glanced in on the dead man the fat son was still asleep hed dozed off while we were out at the damned farm he still hadnt told me how glory mooncalled was working his military magic i had a surprise for him lvii chodo could put on a show crask took me out there in a coach as fancy as anything off the hill maybe the same one we had used going into ogre town the kingpin met me by his pool he was in his wheelchair but they had just dragged him out of the water the girls finished setting him up and bounced off giggling what a good life they had until their knockers started to sag one cutie stayed i didnt recognize her at first when i did i was startled this wasnt the donni pell id known so briefly not the donni who had been so tough on that farm this donni had been broken down and rebuilt she looked as eager to please as a puppy chodo noticed my surprise he looked me in the eye and smiled his smile was like crasks that was like looking death in the face and having him grin a gift mr garrett not to be considered for the favor i owe just a token of my esteem shes quite tame now quite pliable have no more use for her i thought you might take her what could i do he was who he was i said thank you and told donni pell to get dressed then i let crask take us back to my place what the hell was i going to do with her what had he done to her she wasnt really donni pell anymore she spoke only when spoken to i took her into the dead mans room sat her down woke him up garrett you pustule on the nose of heavens not another one you have had that redhaired trollop in and out for how would you know youve been snoring you truly believe i can sleep through can it chuckles this one is the famous donni pell a few weeks with the kingpin has given her a whole new attitude yes he seemed mildly distressed maybe even pitying though the gods knew the woman didnt deserve that i think shell give me answers if i ask questions she will yes does that mean you have not unraveled the last few for yourself sort of it meant id been trying to put the mess out of mind with a little help from tinnie it had begun to recede you going to claim you figured out who killed amiranda yes and why you never cease to amaze me garrett it is quite obvious actually illuminate me illuminate yourself you have all the information or ask that tortured child he meant tormented only tormented really described donni pell i tried running it right through from the beginning i didnt get it maybe i was just lazy because the answer was there for the asking donni who killed amiranda crest the domina willa dount mr garrett what no but wait why because amiranda helped karl make up the ransom notes i wrote out and sent because amiranda knew we were going to ask for twenty thousand marks gold and when she saw the notes they said two hundred thousand because as soon as she met karl she was going to find out that it wasnt because hed gotten greedy or id made a mistake right and i had to believe the dead man had come to that conclusion because id given him the details of my interview with willa dount with the stormwarden standing by when id gotten an indication that the dominad had prior knowledge that amiranda was going to run but id had my mind made up another way damn me id had her and id let her get away shed pulled it off she had all that gold now id closed my mind and she was home free nothing to worry about the rest of her life except staying a step ahead of raver styx i felt like a moron the dead man was greatly amused at my expense he was even more amused because now i was stuck with donni pell i had no idea what the hell to do with her i couldnt keep her i couldnt kick her out in the street in her condition i sure as hell wasnt going to give her back to lettie faren all right old bones before you doze off you tell me how glory mooncalled is getting away with all these amazing triumphs because hes worked some kind of deal with the centaur tribes i can figure some things out given a few hints i grinned id stolen his big thunder both sides in the cantard use centaur auxiliaries for almost all their scouting they are almost entirely dependent upon them if the centaurs decided not to see something the warlords would be blind i wondered what the deal was and if maybe someday it might not embarrass karenta as much as it was embarrassing the venageti right now it cant be too long before the venageti war council gets a handle on it even when you have your mind made up you cant stay blind to reality forever i left the dead man fuming and took donni pell to the kitchen so dean could feed her if garrett is a sucker for a damsel in distress old dean is a sucker for one who is hurting he never did tell me where but he got her a good position as housekeeper and companion to an older handicapped woman they were supposedly very good for one another sometimes i think about changing my line of work nobody emerged happy from this one except the worst villain of the piece maybe i should just thank the gods that i got out of it alive with a few friends and a profit thats why you do a job isnt it to survive
