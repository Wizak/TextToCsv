the damnation game by clive barker copyright nor yet exempt though ruling them like slaves from chance and death and mutability shelly prometheus unbound part one terra incognita hell is the place of those who have denied they find there what they planted and what dug a lake of spaces and a wood of nothing and wander there and drift and never cease wailing for substance wb yeats the hour glass the air was electric the day the thief crossed the city certain that tonight after so many weeks of frustration he would finally locate the cardplayer it was not an easy journey eightyfive percent of warsaw had been leveled either by the months of mortar bombardment that had preceded the russian liberation of the city or by the program of demolition the nazis had undertaken before their retreat several sectors were virtually impassable by vehicle mountains of rubblestill nurturing the dead like bulbs ready to sprout as the spring weather warmedclogged the streets even in the more accessible districts the onceelegant facades swooned dangerously their foundations growling but after almost three months of plying his trade here the thief had become used to navigating this urban wilderness indeed he took pleasure in its desolate splendor its perspectives tinged lilac by the dust that still settled from the stratosphere its squares and parkways so unnaturally silent the sense he had trespassing here that this was what the end of the world would be like by day there were even a few landmarks remainingforlorn signposts that would be dismantled in timeby which the traveler could chart his route the gas works beside the poniatowski bridge was still recognizable as was the zoo on the other side of the river the clocktower of central station showed its head though the clock had long since disappeared these and a handful of other pockmarked tributes to warsaws civic beauty survived their trembling presence poignant even to the thief this wasnt his home he had no home nor had for a decade he was a nomad and a scavenger and for a short space warsaw offered sufficient pickings to keep him here soon when hed recovered energies depleted in his recent wanderings it would be time to move on but while the first signs of spring murmured in the air he lingered here enjoying the freedom of the city there were hazards certainly but then where were there not for a man of his profession and the war years had polished his powers of selfpreservation to such brilliance that little intimidated him he was safer here than the true citizens of warsaw the few bewildered survivors of the holocaust who were gradually beginning to filter back into the city looking for lost homes lost faces they scrabbled in the wreckage or stood on street corners listening to the dirge of the river and waited for the russians to round them up in the name of karl marx new barricades were being established every day the military were slowly but systematically reclaiming some order from the confusion dividing and subdividing the city as they would in time the entire country the curfews and the checkpoints did little to hobble the thief however in the lining of his wellcut coat he kept identification papers of every kindsome forged most stolenone of which would be suitable for whatever situation arose what they lacked in credibility he made up for with repartee and cigarettes both of which he possessed in abundance they were all a man neededin that city in that yearto feet like the lord of creation and such creation no need here for either appetite or curiosity to go unsatisfied the profoundest secrets of body and spirit were available to anyone with the itch to see games were made of them only the previous week the thief had heard tell of a young man who played the ancient game of cups and ball but substituted with insanitys wit three buckets and a babys head that was the least of it the infant was dead and the dead dont suffer there were however other pastimes available for hire in the city delights that used the living as their raw material for those with the craving and the price of entry a traffic in human flesh had begun the occupying army no longer distracted by battle had discovered sex again and there was profit in it half a loaf of bread could purchase one of the refugee girlsmany so young they scarcely had breasts to kneadto be used and reused in the covering darkness their complaints unheard or silenced by a bayonet when they lost their charm such casual homicide was overlooked in a city where tens of thousands had died for a few weeksbetween one regime and the nextanything was possible no act found culpable no depravity taboo a boys brothel had been opened in the zoliborz district here in an underground salon hung with salvaged paintings one could choose from chicks of six or seven up all fetchingly slimmed by malnutrition and tight as any connoisseur could wish it was very popular with the officer class but too expensive the thief had heard it muttered for the noncommissioned ranks lenins tenets of equal choice for all did not stretch it seemed to pederasty sport of a kind was more cheaply available dogfights were a particularly popular attraction that season homeless curs returning to the city to pick at the meat of their masters were trapped fed to fighting strength and then pitted against each other to the death it was an appalling spectacle but a love of betting took the thief to the fights again and again hed made a tidy profit one night by putting his money on a runty but cunning terrier whod bested a dog three times its size by chewing off its opponents testicles and if after a time your taste for dogs or boys or women palled there were more esoteric entertainments available in a crude amphitheater dug from the debris of the bastion of holy mary the thief had seen an anonymous actor singlehandedly perform goethes faust parts one and two though the thiefs german was far from perfect the performance had made a lasting impression the story was familiar enough for him to follow the actionthe pact with mephisto the debates the conjuring tricks and then as the promised damnation approached despair and terrors much of the argument was indecipherable but the actors possession by his twin rolesone moment tempter the next temptedwas so impressive the thief left with his belly churning two days later he had gone back to see the play again or at least to speak to the actor but there were to be no encores the performers enthusiasm for goethe had been interpreted as pronazi propaganda the thief found him hanging joy decayed from a telegraph pole he was naked his bare feet had been eaten at and his eyes taken out by birds his torso was riddled with bullet holes the sight pacified the thief he saw it as proof that the confused feelings the actor had aroused were iniquitous if this was the state to which his art had brought him the man had clearly been a scoundrel and a sham his mouth gaped but the birds had taken his tongue as well as his eyes no loss besides there were far more rewarding diversions the women the thief could take or leave and the boys were not to his taste but the gambling he loved and always had so it was back to the dogfights to chance his fortunes on a mongrel if not there then to some barrackroom dice game orin desperationbetting with a bored sentry on the speed of a passing cloud the method and the circumstance scarcely concerned him he cared only to gamble since his adolescence it had been his one true vice it was the indulgence he had become a thief to fund before the war hed played in casinos across europe chemin de fer was his game though he was not averse to roulette now he looked back at those years through the veil war had drawn across them and remembered the contests as he remembered dreams on waking as something irretrievable and slipping further away with every breath that sense of loss changed however when he heard about the cardplayermamoulian they called himwho it was said never lost a game and who came and went in this deceitful city like a creature who was not perhaps even real but then after mamoulian everything changed so much was rumor and so much of that rumor not even rooted in truth simply lies told by bored soldiers the military mind the thief had discovered was capable of inventions more baroque than a poets and more lethal so when he heard tell of a master cardsharp who appeared out of no where and challenged every wouldbe gambler to a game and unfailingly won he suspected the story to be just that a story but something about the way this apocryphal tale lingered confounded expectation it didnt fade away to be replaced by some yet more ludicrous romance it appeared repeatedlyin the conversation of the men at the dogfights in gossip in graffiti what was more though the names changed the salient facts were the same from one account to the next the thief began to suspect there was truth in the story after all perhaps there was a brilliant gambler operating somewhere in the city not perfectly invulnerable of course no one was that but the man if he existed was certainly something special talk of him was always conducted with a caution that was like reverence soldiers who claimed to have seen him play spoke of his elegance his almost hypnotic calm when they talked of mamoulian they were peasants speaking of nobility and the thiefnever one to concede the superiority of any manadded a zeal to unseat this king to his reasons for seeking the cardplayer out but beyond the general picture he garnered from the grapevine there were few specifics he knew that he would have to find and interrogate a man who had actually faced this paragon across a gaming table before he could really begin to separate truth from speculation it took two weeks to find such a man his name was konstantin vasiliev a second lieutenant who it was said had lost everything he had playing against mamoulian the russian was broad as a bull the thief felt dwarfed by him but while some big men nurture spirits expansive enough to fill their anatomies vasiliev seemed almost empty if he had ever possessed such virility it was now gone left in the husk was a frail and fidgety child it took an hour of coaxing the best part of a bottle of blackmarket vodka and half a pack of cigarettes to get vasiliev to answer with more than a monosyllable but when the disclosures came they came gushingly the confessions of a man on the verge of total breakdown there was selfpity in his talk and anger too but mostly there was the stench of dread vasiliev was a man in mortal terror the thief was mightily impressed not by the tears or the desperation but by the fact that mamoulian this faceless cardplayer had broken the giant sitting across the floor from him under the guise of consolation and friendly advice he proceeded to pump the russian for every sliver of information he could provide looking all the time for some significant detail to make flesh and blood of the chimera he was investigating you say he wins without fail always so whats his method how does he cheat vasiliev looked up from his contemplation of the bare boards of the floor cheat he said incredulously he doesnt cheat ive played cards all my life with the best and the worst ive seen every trick a man can pull and i tell you now he was clean the luckiest player gets defeated once in a while the laws of chance a look of innocent amusement crossed vasilievs face and for a moment the thief glimpsed the man whod occupied this fortress before his fall from sanity the laws of chance are nothing to him dont you see he isnt like you or me how could a man always win without having some power over the cards you believe that vasiliev shrugged and slumped again to him he said almost contemplative in his utter dismay winning is beauty it is like life itself the vacant eyes returned to tracing the rough grain of the floorboards as the thief somersaulted the words over in his head winning is beauty it is like life itself it was strange talk and made him uneasy before he could work his way into its meaning however vasiliev was leaning closer to him his breath fearful his vast hand catching hold of the thiefs sleeve as he spoke ive put in for a transfer did they tell you that ill be away from here in a few days and nobodyll be any the wiser im getting medals when i get home thats why theyre transferring me because im a hero and heroes get what they ask for then ill be gone and hell never find me why would he want to the hand on the sleeve fisted vasiliev pulled the thief in toward him i owe him the shirt off my back he said if i stay hell have me killed hes killed others him and his comrades hes not alone said the thief he had pictured the cardplayer as being a man without associates made him in fact in his own image vasiliev blew his nose into his hand and leaned back in the chair it creaked under his bulk who knows whats true or false in this place eh he said eyes swimming i mean if i told you he had dead men with him would you believe me he answered his own question with a shake of his head no youd think i was mad once the thief thought this man had been capable of certainty of action perhaps even of heroism now all that noble stuff had been siphoned off the champion was reduced to a sniveling rag blabbering nonsense he inwardly applauded the brilliance of mamoulians victory he had always hated heroes one last question he began you want to know where you can find him yes the russian stared at the ball of his thumb sighing deeply this was all so wearisome what do you gain if you play him he asked and again returned his own answer only humiliation perhaps death the thief stood up then you dont know where he is he said making to pocket the halfempty packet of cigarettes that lay on the table between them wait vasiliev reached for the pack before it slid out of sight wait the thief placed the cigarettes back on the table and vasiliev covered them with one proprietorial hand he looked up at his interrogator as he spoke the last time i heard he was north of here up by muranowski square you know it the thief nodded it was not a region he relished visiting but he knew it and how do i find him once i get there he asked the russian looked perplexed by the question i dont even know what he looks like the thief said trying to make vasiliev understand you wont need to find him vasiliev replied understanding all too well if he wants you to play hell find you the next night the first of many such nights the thief had gone looking for the cardplayer though it was by now april the weather was still bitter that year hed come back to his room in the partially demolished hotel he occupied numb with cold frustration andthough he scarcely admitted it even to himselffear the region around muranowski square was a hell within a hell many of the bomb craters here let on to the sewers the stench out of them was unmistakable others used as fire pits to cremate executed citizens still flared intermittently when a flame found a belly swollen with gas or a pool of human fat every step taken in this newfound land was an adventure even to the thief death its forms multitudinous waited everywhere sitting on the edge of a crater warming its feet in the flames standing lunatic amongst the refuse at laughing play in a garden of bone and shrapnel fear notwithstanding hed returned to the district on several occasions but the cardplayer eluded him and with every failed attempt with every journey that ended in defeat the thief became more preoccupied with the pursuit in his mind this faceless gambler began to take on something of the force of legend just to see the man in the flesh to verify his physical existence in the same world that he the thief occupied became an article of faith a means god help him by which he could ratify his own existence after a week and a half of fruitless searching he went back to find vasiliev the russian was dead his body throat slit from ear to ear had been found the previous day floating facedown in one of the sewers the army was clearing in wola he was not alone there had been three other bodies with him all slaughtered in a similar fashion all set alight and burning like fire ships as they drifted down the tunnel on a river of excrement one of the soldiers who had been in the sewer when the flotilla appeared told the thief that the bodies had seemed to float in the darkness for a breathless moment it had been like the steady approach of angels then of course the horror extinguishing the burning corpses their hair their backs then turning them over and the face of vasiliev caught in the beam of a flashlight carrying a look of wonder like a child in awe of some lethal conjuror his transfer papers had arrived that same afternoon in fact the papers seemed to have been the cause of an administrative error that had closed vasilievs tragedy on a comic note the bodies once identified had been buried in warsaw except for second lieutenant vasiliev whose war record demanded less cursory treatment plans were afoot to transport the body back to mother russia where he would be buried with state honors in his hometown but somebody alighting upon the transfer papers had taken them to apply to vasiliev dead not vasiliev living mysteriously the body disappeared nobody would admit responsibility the corpse had simply been shipped out to some new posting vasilievs death merely served to intensify the thiefs curiosity mamoulians arrogance fascinated him here was a scavenger a man who made a living off the weakness of others who had yet grown so insolent with success that he dared to murderor have murdered on his behalfthose who crossed him the thief became jittery with anticipation in his dreams when he was able to sleep he wandered in muranowski square it was filled with a fog like a living thing which promised at any moment to divide and reveal the cardplayer he was like a man in love tonight the ceiling of squalid cloud above europe had broken blue albeit pale had spread over his head wider and wider now toward evening the sky was absolutely clear above him in the southwest vast cumulus their cauliflower heads tinted ocher and gold were fattening with thunder but the thought of their anger only excited him tonight the air was electric and he would find the cardplayer he was sure he had been sure since he woke that morning as evening began to fall he went north toward the square scarcely thinking of where he was going the route was so familiar to him he walked through two checkpoints without being challenged the confidence in his step password enough tonight he was inevitable his place here breathing the scented lilac air stars glimmering at his zenith was unassailable he felt static run in the hairs on the back of his hand and smiled he saw a man something unrecognizable in his arms screaming at a window and smiled not far away the vistula gross with rain and meltwater roared toward the sea he was no less irresistible the gold went out of the cumulus the lucid blue darkened toward night as he was about to come into muranowski square something flickered in front of him a twist of wind scooted past him and the air was suddenly full of white confetti impossible surely that there was a wedding taking place here one of the whirling fragments lodged on his eyelash and he plucked it off it wasnt confetti at all it was a petal he pressed it between thumb and forefinger its scented oil spilled from the fractured tissue in search of the source he walked on a little way and rounding the corner into the square itself discovered the ghost of a tree prodigious with blossom hanging in the air it seemed unrooted its snowhead lit by starlight its trunk shadowy he held his breath shocked by this beauty and walked toward it as he might have approached a wild animal cautious in case it took fright something turned his stomach over it wasnt awe of the blossom or even the remnants of the joy hed felt walking here that was slipping away a different sensation gripped him here in the square he was a man so used to atrocities that he had long counted himself unblanchable so why did he stand now a few feet away from the tree his fingernails meticulously kept pressed into his palms with anxiety defying the umbrella of flowers to unveil its worst there was nothing to fear here just petals in the air shadow on the ground and still he breathed shallowly hoping against hope that his fright was baseless come on he thought if youve got something to show me im waiting at his silent invitation two things happened behind him a guttural voice asked who are you in polish distracted for the merest heartbeat by surprise his eyes lost focus on the tree and in that instant a figure dislodged itself from beneath the blossomweighed branches and slouched momentarily into the starlight in the cheating murk the thief wasnt certain what he saw a discarded face looking blankly in his direction perhaps hair seared off a scabby carcass wide as a bulls vasilievs vast hands all or nothing of this and already the figure was retiring into hiding beyond the tree its wounded head brushing the branches as it went a drizzle of petals fluttered onto its charcoal shoulders did you hear me said the voice at his back the thief didnt turn he went on staring at the tree narrowing his eyes attempting to separate substance from illusion but the man whoever he was had gone it could not have been the russian of course reason proclaimed against it vasiliev was dead found with his face down in the filth of a sewer his body was probably already on its way to some farflung outpost of the russian empire he wasnt here he couldnt be here but the thief felt an urgent need to pursue the stranger nevertheless just to tap his shoulder to have him turn round to look into his face and verify that it was not konstantin too late already the questioner behind him had taken fierce hold of his arm and was demanding an answer the branches of the tree had stopped shaking the petals had stopped falling the man was away sighing the thief turned to his interrogator the figure in front of him was smiling a welcome it was a woman despite the rasp of the voice dressed in oversized trousers tied with a rope but otherwise naked her head was shaved her toenails lacquered all this he took in with senses heightened from the shock of the tree and from the pleasure of her nudity the sheened globes of her breasts were perfect he felt his fists opening the palms tingling to touch them but perhaps his appraisal of the body was too frank he glanced back up at her face to see if she was still smiling she was but his gaze lingered on her face this time and he realized that what hed taken to be a smile was a permanent fixture her lips had been sliced off exposing gums and teeth there were ghastly scars on her cheeks the remains of wounds that had severed the tendons and induced a rictus that teased her mouth open her look appalled him you want she began want he thought his eyes flicking back to the breasts her casual nudity aroused him despite the mutilation of her face he was disgusted with the idea of taking herto kiss that lipless mouth was more than orgasm was worthand yet if she offered hed accept and damn the disgust you want she began again in that slurred hybrid of a voice neither male nor female it was difficult for her to shape and expel words without the aid of lips she got the rest of the question out however you want the cards hed missed the point entirely she had no interest in him sexual or otherwise she was simply a messenger mamoulian was here within spitting distance probably perhaps watching him even now but the confusion of emotions in him blurred the elation he should have felt at this moment instead of triumph he grappled with a headful of contrary images blossom breasts darkness the burned mans face turning too briefly toward him lust fear a single star appearing from a flank of cloud hardly thinking of what he was saying he replied yes i want the cards she nodded turned away from him and started past the tree its branches still rocking where the man who was not vasiliev had touched them and crossed the square he followed it was possible to forget this gobetweens face while looking at the grace of her barefooted steps she didnt seem to care what she trod on not once did she falter despite the glass brick and shrapnel underfoot she led him across to the remains of a large house on the opposite side of the square its ravaged exterior once impressive still stood there was even a doorway in it though no door through it the light of a bonfire flickered rubble from the interior spilled through the doorway and blocked the lower half obliging both woman and thief to duck down and scramble up into the house itself in the gloom the sleeve of his coat snagged on something the cloth tore she didnt turn to see if he was hurt though he cursed audibly she simply led on over the mounds of brick and fallen roof timbers while he stumbled after her feeling ridiculously clumsy by the light of the bonfire he could see the size of the interior this had once been a fine house there was little time for study however the woman was past the fire now and climbing toward a staircase he followed sweating the fire spat he glanced around at it and glimpsed somebody on the far side keeping out of sight behind the flames even as he watched the fire keeper threw more tinder down and a constellation of livid specks was thrown up against the sky the woman was climbing the stairs he hurried after her his shadowthrown by the firehuge on the wall she was at the top of the stairs when he was halfway up and now she was slipping through a second doorway and gone he followed on as quickly as he could and turned through the doorway after her the firelight only found its way fitfully into the room hed stepped into and he could scarcely make anything out at first close the door somebody asked it took him a few beats to realize that the request was being made of him he halfturned fumbled for the handle found that there was none and pushed the door closed on aching hinges that done he looked back into the room the woman was standing two or three yards in front of him her perpetually amused face looking at him the smile a gray sickle your coat she said and stretched out her hands to help him shoulder it off once done she stepped out of his eyeline and the object of his long search came into view it was not mamoulian however that took his eye at first it was the carved wooden altar piece set against the wall behind him a gothic masterwork which blazed even in the gloom with gold and scarlet and blue spoils of war the thief thought so thats what the bastard does with his fortune now he looked at the figure in front of the triptych a single wick immersed in oil guttered smokily on the table at which he sat the illumination it threw up on to the cardplayers face was bright but unstable so pilgrim the man said you found me finally you found me surely the thief replied it had been as vasiliev had predicted you fancy a game or two i hear is that right why not he tried to sound as nonchalant as possible though his heart was beating a double tattoo in his chest coming into the cardplayers presence he felt pitifully unprepared sweat glued his hair to his forehead there was brick dust on his hands and muck under his nails i must look he squirmed like the thief i am by contrast mamoulian was a picture of propriety there was nothing in the sober clothesthe black tie the gray suitthat suggested a profiteer he appeared this legend like a stockbroker his face like his dress was unrepentantly plain its taut and finely etched skin waxen by the charmless oil flame he looked sixty or thereabouts cheeks slightly hollowed nose large aristocratic brow wide and high his hair had receded to the back of his skull what remained was feathery and white but there was neither frailty nor fatigue in his posture he sat upright in his chair and his agile hands fanned and gathered a pack of cards with loving familiarity only his eyes belonged to the thiefs dream of him no stockbroker ever had such naked eyes such glacial unforgiving eyes i hoped youd come pilgrim sooner or later he said his english was without inflection am i late the thief asked halfjoking mamoulian laid the cards down he seemed to take the inquiry quite seriously well see he paused before saying you know of course that i play for very high stakes i heard if you wish to withdraw now before we go any further i would perfectly understand the little speech was made without a trace of irony dont you want me to play mamoulian pressed his thin dry lips together and frowned on the contrary he said i very much want you to play there was a flickerwas there notof pathos there the thief wasnt sure if it was a slip of the tongue or the subtlest of theatrics but i am not sympathetic he went on to those who do not pay their debts you mean the lieutenant the thief chanced mamoulian stared at him i know no lieutenant he said flatly i know only gamblers like myself a few are good most are not they all come here to test their mettle as you have he had picked up the pack again and it was moving in his hands as if the cards were alive fiftytwo moths fluttering in the queasy light each one marked a little differently from the last they were almost indecently beautiful their glossy faces the most unflawed thing the thief had set eyes on in months i want to play he said defying the hypnotic passage of cards then sit down pilgrim mamoulian said as though the question had never been at issue almost soundlessly the woman had set a chair behind him as he sat down the thief met mamoulians gaze was there anything in those joyless eyes that intended him harm no nothing there was nothing there to fear murmuring his thanks for the invitation he unbuttoned the cuffs of his shirt and folded the sleeves back in preparation for play after a time the game began part two asylum the devil is by no means the worst that there is i would rather have dealings with him than with many a human being he honours his agreements much more promptly than many a swindler on earth to be true when payment is due he comes on the dot just as twelve strikes fetches his soul and goes off home to hell like a good devil hes just a businessman as is right and proper jn nestroy hollenangst i providence after serving six years of his sentence at wandsworth marty strauss was used to waiting he waited to wash and shave himself every morning he waited to eat he waited to defecate he waited for freedom so much waiting it was all part of the punishment of course as was the interview hed been summoned to this dreary afternoon but while the waiting had come to seem easy the interviews never had he loathed the bureaucratic spotlight the parole file bulging with the discipline reports the home circumstance reports the psychiatric evaluations the way every few months you stood stripped in front of some uncivil servant while he told you what a foul thing you were it hurt him so much he knew hed never be healed of it never forget the hot rooms filled with insinuation and dashed hopes hed dream them forever come in strauss the room hadnt changed since hed last been here only become staler the man on the opposite side of the table hadnt changed either his name was somervale and there were any number of prisoners in wandsworth who nightly said prayers for his pulverization today he was not alone behind the plastictopped table sit down strauss marty glanced across at somervales associate he was no prison officer his suit was too tasteful his fingernails too wellmanicured he looked to be in late middleage solidly built and his nose was slightly crooked as if it had once been broken and then imperfectly reset somervale offered the introduction strauss this is mr toy hello marty said the tanned face returned his gaze it was a look of frank appraisal im pleased to meet you toy said his scrutiny was more than casual curiosity though whatthought martywas there to see a man with time on his hands and on his face a body grown sluggish with too much bad food and too little exercise an ineptly trimmed mustache a pair of eyes glazed with boredom marty knew every dull detail of his own appearance he wasnt worth a second glance any longer and yet the bright blue eyes stared on apparently fascinated i think we should get down to business toy said to somervale he put his hands palm down on the tabletop how much have you told mr strauss mr strauss the prefix was an almost forgotten courtesy ive told him nothing somervale replied then we should begin at the beginning toy said he leaned back in his chair hands still on the table as you like said somervale clearly gearing himself up for a substantial speech mr toy he began but he got no further before his guest broke in if i may said toy perhaps i can best summarize the situation whatever suits said somervale he fumbled in his jacket pocket for a cigarette barely masking his chagrin toy ignored him the offcenter face continued to look across at marty my employer toy began is a man by the name of joseph whitehead i dont know if that means anything to you he didnt wait for a reply but went on if you havent heard of him youre doubtless familiar with the whitehead corporation which he founded its one of the largest pharmaceutical empires in europe the name rang a faint bell in martys head and it had some scandalous association but it was tantalizingly vague and he had no time to puzzle it through because toy was in full flight although mr whitehead is now in his late sixties he still keeps control of the corporation hes a selfmade man you understand and hes dedicated his life to its creation he chooses however not to be as visible as he once was a frontpage photograph suddenly developed in strauss head a man with his hand up against the glare of a flashbulb a private moment snatched by some lurking paparazzo for public consumption he shuns publicity almost completely and since his wifes death he has little taste for the social arena sharing the unwelcome attention strauss remembered a woman whose beauty astonished even by the unflattering light the wife of whom toy spoke perhaps instead he chooses to mastermind his corporation out of the spotlight concerning himself in his leisure hours with social issues among them overcrowding in prisons and the deterioration of the prison service generally the last remark was undoubtedly barbed and found somervale with deadly accuracy he ground out his halfsmoked cigarette in the tinfoil ashtray throwing the other man a sour glance when the time came to engage a new personal bodyguard toy continued it was mr whiteheads decision to seek a suitable candidate amongst men coming up for parole rather than going through the usual agencies he cant mean me strauss thought the idea was too fine to tease himself with and too ludicrous and yet if that wasnt it why was toy here why all the palaver hes looking for a man who is nearing the end of his sentence one who deserves in both his and my own estimation to have an opportunity to be reintroduced into society with a job behind him and some selfesteem to go with it your case was drawn to my attention martin i may call you martin usually its marty fine marty it is frankly i dont want to raise your hopes im interviewing several other candidates in addition to yourself and of course at the end of the day i may find that none are suitable at this juncture i simply want to ascertain whether you would be interested in such an option were it to be made available to you marty began to smile not outwardly but inside where somervale couldnt get at it do you understand what im asking yes i understand joe mr whitehead needs somebody who will be completely devoted to his wellbeing who would indeed be prepared to put his life at risk rather than have harm come to his employer now i realize thats a lot to ask martys brow furrowed it was a lot especially after the sixandahalf year lesson in selfreliance hed had at wandsworth toy was swift to sense martys hesitation that bothers you he said marty shrugged gently yes and no i mean ive never been asked to do that before i dont want to give you some shit about me being really keen to get killed for somebody because im not id be lying through my teeth if i said i was toys nods encouraged marty to go on thats it really he said are you married toy asked separated may i ask are there divorce proceedings in the offing marty grimaced he loathed talking about this it was his wound his to tend and fret over no fellow prisoner had ever wrung the story out of him even in those threeinthemorning confessionals that hed endured with his previous cellmate before feaver who never talked of anything but food and paper women had arrived but he would have to say something now they surely had the details filed away somehow anyway toy probably knew more about what charmaine was doing and with whom than he did charmaine and me he tried to summon words for this knot of feelings but nothing emerged but a blunt statement i dont think theres much chance of us getting back together if thats what youre after toy sensed the raw edge in martys voice so did somervale for the first time since toy had entered the arena the officer began to show some interest in the exchange he wants to watch me talk my way out of a job marty thought he could see the anticipation written all over somervales face well damn him he wasnt going to have the satisfaction its not a problem marty said flatly or if it is its mine im still getting used to the fact that she wont be there when i get out thats all it is really toy was smiling now an amiable smile really marty he said i dont want to pry im only concerned that we understand the full facts of the situation were you to be employed by mr whitehead you would be required to live on his estate with him and it would be a necessary condition of your employment that you could not leave without the express permission of either mr whitehead or myself in other words you would not be stepping into unconditional freedom far from it you might wish to consider the estate as a sort of open prison its important for me to know of any ties you have that might make such constraints temptingly easy to break yes i see furthermore if for any reason your relationship with mr whitehead was not satisfactory if you or he felt that the job was not suitable then im afraid id be back here to finish my sentence yes there was an awkward pause in which toy sighed quietly it took him only a moment to recover his equilibrium then he took off in a new direction theres just a few more questions id like to ask youve done some boxing am i right some a while back toy looked disappointed you gave it up yes marty replied i kept on with the weight training for a while do you have any selfdefense training of any kind judo karate marty contemplated lying but what would be the use of that all toy had to do was consult the screws at wandsworth no he said pity martys belly shrank im healthy though he said and strong i can learn he was aware that an unwelcome tremor had slipped into his voice from somewhere we dont want a learner im afraid somervale pointed out barely able to suppress the triumph in his tone marty leaned forward across the table trying to blot out somervales leechlike presence i can do this job mr toy he insisted i know i can do this job just give me a chance the tremor was growing his belly was an acrobat better stop now before he said or did something he regretted but the words and the feelings just kept on coming give me an opportunity to prove i can do it thats not much to ask is it and if i fuck it up its my fault see just a chance thats all im asking toy looked up at him with something like condolence in his face was it all over then had he made up his mind alreadyone wrong answer and the whole thing goes sourwas he already mentally packing up his briefcase and returning the strauss m file into somervales clammy hands to be slotted back between one forgotten con and another marty bit his tongue and sat back in the uncomfortable chair fixing his gaze on his trembling hands he couldnt bear to look at the bruised elegance of toys face not now that hed opened himself up so wide toy would see in oh yes to all the hurt and the wanting and he couldnt bear that at your trial toy said what now why was he prolonging the agony all marty wanted was to go to his cell where feaver would be sitting on the bunk and playing with his dolls where there was a familiar dullness that he could take refuge n but toy wasnt finished he wanted the truth the whole truth and nothing but at your trial you testified that your prime motivation for involvement in the robbery was to pay off substantial gambling debts am i correct marty had moved his attention from his hands to his shoes the laces were undone and though they were long enough to be doubleknotted he never had the patience to work at complicated knots he liked a simple bow when you needed to untie a bow you pulled and beholdlike magicit was gone is that right toy asked again yes thats right marty told him hed got so far why not finish the story there were four of us and two guns we tried to take a security van things got out of hand he glanced up from his shoes toy was watching intently the driver was shot in the stomach he died later its all in the file isnt it toy nodded and about the van is that in the file too toy didnt reply it was empty marty said we had it wrong from the beginning the fucking thing was empty and the debts huh your debts to macnamara theyre still outstanding the man was really beginning to get on martys nerves what did toy care if he owed a few grand here and there this was just sympathetic camouflage so that he could make a dignified exit answer mr toy strauss somervale said whats it to you interest said toy frankly i see sod his interest marty thought he could choke on it theyd had as much of a confessional as they were going to get can i go now he said he looked up not at toy but at somervale who was smirking behind his cigarette smoke well satisfied that the interview had been a disaster i think so strauss he said as long as mr toy doesnt have any more questions no said toy the voice dead no im well satisfied marty stood up still avoiding toys eyes the small room was full of ugly sounds the chairs heels scraping on the floor the rasp of somervales smokers cough toy was shunting away his notes it was all over somervale said you can go ive enjoyed meeting you mr strauss toy said to martys back as he reached the door and marty turned around without thinking to see the other man smiling at him his hand extended to be shaken ive enjoyed meeting you mr strauss marty nodded and shook hands thank you for your time toy said marty closed the door behind him and made his way back to his cell escorted by priestley the landing officer they said nothing marty watched the birds swooping in the roof of the building alighting on the landing rails for tidbits they came and they went when it suited them finding niches to nest in taking their sovereignty for granted he envied them nothing or if he did now wasnt the time to admit to it thirteen days passed and there was no further word from either toy or somervale not that marty was truly expecting any the chance had been lost hed almost stagemanaged its final moments with his refusal to talk about macnamara that way he had expected to nip any trial by hope in the bud in that hed failed no matter how he tried to forget the interview with toy he couldnt the encounter had thrown him badly offbalance and his instability was as distressing as its cause he thought he had learned the art of indifference by now the same way that children learned that hot water scalds by painful experience hed had plenty of that during the first twelve months of his sentence hed fought against everything and everyone hed encountered hed made no friends that year nor the least impression on the system all hed earned for his troubles were bruises and bad times in the second year chastened by defeat hed gone underground with his private war hed taken up weight training and boxing and concentrated on the challenge of building and maintaining a body that would serve him when the time for retribution came round but in the middle of the third year loneliness had intervened an ache that no amount of selfinflicted punishment could disguise he made a truce that year with himself and his incarceration it was an uneasy peace but things began to improve from then on he even began to feel at home in the echoing corridors and in his cell and in the shrinking enclave of his head where most pleasurable experience was now a distant memory the fourth year had brought new terrors he was twentynine that year thirty loomed and he remembered all too accurately how his younger self with time to burn had dismissed men his age as spent it was a painful realization and the old claustrophobia returned more forcibly than ever and with it a new foolhardiness hed gained his tattoos that year a scarlet and blue lightning bolt on his upper left arm and usa on his right forearm just before christmas charmaine had written to him to suggest that a divorce might be best and hed thought nothing of it what was the use indifference was the best remedy once you conceded defeat life was a feather bed in the light of that wisdom the fifth year was a breeze he had access to dope he had the clout that came with being an experienced con he had every damned thing but his freedom and that he could wait for and then toy had come along and try as hard as he could to forget hed ever heard the mans name he found himself turning the halfhour of the interview over and over in his head examining every exchange in the minutest detail as though he might turn up a nugget of prophecy it was a fruitless exercise of course but it didnt stop the rehearsals going on and the process became almost comforting in its way he told nobody not even feaver it was his secret the room toy somervales defeat on the second sunday after the meeting with toy charmaine came to visit the interview was the usual mess like a transatlantic telephone callall the timing spoiled by the second delay between question and response it wasnt the babble of other conversations in the room that soured things things were simply sour no avoiding that fact now his early attempts at salvage had long since been abandoned after the cool inquiries about the health of relatives and friends it was down to the nittygritty of dissolution hed written to her in the early letters youre beautiful charmaine i think of you at night i dream about you all the time but then her looks had seemed to lose their edgeand anyway his dreams of her face and body under him had stoppedand though he kept up the pretense in the letters for a while his loving sentences had begun to sound patently fake and hed stopped writing about such intimacies it felt adolescent to tell her he thought of her face what would she imagine him doing but sweating in the dark and playing with himself like a twelveyearold he didnt want her thinking that maybe on reflection that had been a mistake perhaps the deterioration of their marriage had begun there with him feeling ridiculous and giving up writing love letters but hadnt she changed too her eyes looked at him even now with such naked suspicion flynn sends his regards oh good you see him do you once in a while hows he doing shed taken to looking at the clock rather than at him which he was glad of it gave him a chance to study her without feeling intrusive when she allowed her features to relax he still found her attractive but he had he believed perfect control over his response to her now he could look at herat the translucent lobes of her ears at the sweep of her neckand view her quite dispassionately that at least prison had taught him not to want what he could not have oh hes fine she replied it took him a moment to reorientate himself who was she talking about oh yes flynn there was a man whod never got his fingers dirty flynn the wise flynn the flash he sends his best she said you told me he reminded her another pause the conversation was more crucifying every time she came not for him so much as for her she seemed to go through a trauma every time she spat a single word out i went to see the solicitors again oh yes its all going ahead apparently they said the papers would be through next month what do i do just sign them well he said we needed to talk about the house and all the stuff weve got together you have it but its ours isnt it i mean it belongs to both of us and when you come out youre going to need somewhere to live and furniture and everything do you want to sell the house another wretched pause as though she was trembling on the edge of saying something far more important than the banalities that would surely surface im sorry marty she said what for she shook her head a tiny shake her hair shimmered dont know she said this isnt your fault none of this is your fault i cant help she stopped and looked up at him suddenly more alive in the urgency of her frightwas that what it was frightthan shed been in a dozen other wooden exchanges theyd endured in one chilling room or another her eyes were liquefying swelling up with tears whats wrong she stared at him the tears brimmed char whats wrong its all over marty she said as though this fact had hit her for the first time over finished fare thee well he nodded yes i dont want you she stopped paused then tried again you mustnt blame me i dont blame you ive never blamed you christ youve been here havent you all this time i hate seeing you in this place you know but you came when i needed you you were there i thought it would be all right she said talking on as though hed not even spoken i really did i thought youd be coming out soonand maybe wed make it work you know we still had the house and all but these last couple of years everything just started falling apart he watched her suffering thinking ill never be able to forget this because i caused it and im the most miserable shit on gods earth because look what i did thered been tears at the beginning of course and letters from her full of hurt and halfburied accusations but this wracking distress she was showing now went so much deeper it wasnt from a twentytwoyearold for one thing it was coming from a grown woman and it shamed him deeply to think hed caused it shamed him in a way he thought hed put behind him she blew her nose on a tissue teased from a packet everythings a mess she said yes i just want to sort it out she gave a cursory glance at her watch too fast to register the time and stood up id better go marty appointment no she replied a transparent lie which she made no real effort to carry off might do some shopping later on always makes me feel better you know me no he thought no i dont know you if i once did and im not even sure of that it was a different you and god i miss her he stopped himself this was not the way to part with her he knew that from past encounters the trick was to be cold to finish on a note of formality so that he could go back to his cell and forget her until the next time i wanted you to understand she said but i dont think i explained it very well its just such a bloody mess she didnt say goodbye tears were beginning again and he was certain that she was frightened under the talk of solicitors that she would recant at the last momentout of weakness or love or bothand by walking out without turning around she was keeping the possibility at bay defeated he went back to the cell feaver was asleep hed stuck a vulva torn from one of his magazines onto his forehead with spit a favorite routine of his it gapeda third eyeabove his closed lids staring and staring without hope of sleep strauss priestley was at the open door staring into the cell beside him on the wall some wit had scrawled if you feel horny kick the door a cunt will appear it was a familiar jokehed seen the same gag or similar on a number of cell wallsbut now looking at priestleys thick face the association of ideasthe enemy and a womans sexstruck him as obscene strauss yes sir mr somervale wants to see you about threefifteen ill come and collect you be ready at ten past yes sir priestley turned to go can you tell me what its about sir how the fuck should i know somervale was waiting in the interview room at threefifteen martys file was on the table in front of him its drawstrings still knotted beside it a buff envelope unmarked somervale himself was standing by the reinforced glass window smoking come in he said there was no invitation to sit down nor did he turn from the window marty closed the door behind him and waited somervale exhaled smoke through his nostrils noisily what do you suppose strauss he said i beg your pardon sir i said what do you suppose eh imagine marty followed none of this so far and wondered if the confusion was his or somervales after an age somervale said my wife died marty wondered what he was expected to say as it was somervale didnt give him time to formulate a response he followed the first three words with five more theyre letting you out strauss he placed the bald facts side by side as if they belonged together as if the entire world was in collusion against him am i going with mr toy marty asked he and the board believe you are a suitable candidate for the job at whiteheads estate somervale said imagine he made a low sound in his throat which could have been laughter youll be under close scrutiny of course not by me but by whoever follows me and if you once step out of line i understand i wonder if you do somervale drew on his cigarette still not turning around i wonder if you understand just what kind of freedom youve chosen marty wasnt about to let this kind of talk spoil his escalating euphoria somervale was defeated let him talk joseph whitehead may be one of the richest men in europe but hes also one of the most eccentric i hear god knows what youre letting yourself in for but i tell you i think you may find life in here a good deal more palatable somervales words evaporated his sour grapes fell on deaf ears either through exhaustion or because he sensed that hed lost his audience he gave up his disparaging monologue almost as soon as it began and turned from the window to finish this distasteful business as expeditiously as he could marty was shocked to see the change in the man in the weeks since theyd last met somervale had aged years he looked as though hed survived the intervening time on cigarettes and grief his skin was like stale bread mr toy will pick you up from the gates next friday afternoon thats february thirteenth are you superstitious no somervale handed the envelope across to marty all the details are in there in the next couple of days youll have a medical and somebody will be here to go through your position visаvis the parole board rules are being bent on your behalf strauss god knows why theres a dozen more worthy candidates in your wing alone marty opened the envelope quickly scanned the tightly typed pages and pocketed them you wont be seeing me again somervale was saying for which im sure youre suitably grateful marty let not a flicker of response cross his face his feigned indifference seemed to ignite a pocket of unused loathing in somervales fatigued frame his bad teeth showed as he said if i were you id thank god strauss id thank god from the bottom of my heart what for sir but then i dont suppose youve got much room for god have you the words contained pain and contempt in equal measure marty couldnt help thinking of somervale alone in a double bed a husband without a wife and without the faith to believe in seeing her again incapable of tears and another thought came fast upon the first that somervales stone heart which had been broken at one terrible stroke was not so dissimilar from his own both hard men both keeping the world at bay while they waged private wars in their guts both ending up with the very weapons theyd forged to defeat their enemies turned on themselves it was a vile realization and had marty not been buoyant with the news of his release he might not have dared think it but there it was he and somervale like two lizards lying in the same stinking mud suddenly seemed very like twins what are you thinking strauss somervale asked marty shrugged nothing he said liar said the other picking up the file he walked out of the interview room leaving the door open behind him marty telephoned charmaine the following day and told her what had happened she seemed pleased which was gratifying when he came off the phone he was shaking but he felt good he lived the last few days at wandsworth with stolen eyes or thats how it seemed everything about prison life that he had become so used tothe casual cruelty the endless jeering the power games the sex gamesall seemed new to him again as they had been six years before they were wasted years of course nothing could bring them back nothing could fill them up with useful experience the thought depressed him he had so little to go out into the world with two tattoos a body that had seen better days memories of anger and despair in the journey ahead he was going to be traveling light the night before he left wandsworth he had a dream his nightlife had not been much to shout about during the years of his sentence wet dreams about charmaine had soon stopped as had his more exotic flights of fancy as though his subconscious sympathetic to confinement wanted to avoid taunting him with dreams of freedom once in a while hed wake in the middle of the night with his head swimming in glories but most of his dreams were as pointless and as repetitive as his waking life but this was a different experience altogether he dreamed a cathedral of sorts an unfinished perhaps unfinishable masterpiece of towers and spires and soaring buttresses too vast to exist in the physical worldgravity denied itbut here in his head an awesome reality it was night as he walked toward it the gravel crunching underfoot the air smelling of honeysuckle and from inside he could hear singing ecstatic voices a boys choir he thought rising and falling wordlessly there were no people visible in the silken darkness around him no fellow tourists to gape at this wonder just him and the voices and then miraculously he flew he was weightless and the wind had him and he was ascending the steep side of the cathedral with breathsnatching velocity he flew it seemed not like a bird but paradoxically like some airborne fish like a dolphinyes thats what he washis arms close by his side sometimes sometimes plowing the blue air as he rose a smooth naked thing that skimmed the slates and looped the spires fingertips grazing the dew on the stonework flicking raindrops off the gutter pipes if hed ever dreamed anything so sweet he couldnt remember it the intensity of his joy was almost too much and it startled him awake he was back wideeyed in the forced heat of the cell with feaver on the bunk below masturbating the bunk rocked rhythmically speed increasing and feaver climaxed with a stifled grunt marty tried to block reality and concentrate on recapturing his dream he closed his eyes again willing the image back to him saying come on come on to the dark for one shattering moment the dream returned only this time it wasnt triumph it was terror and he was pitching out of the sky from a hundred miles high and the cathedral was rushing toward him its spires sharpening themselves on the wind in preparation for his arrival he shook himself awake canceling the plunge before it could be finished and lay the rest of the night staring at the ceiling until a wretched gloom the first light of dawn spilled through the window to announce the day no profligate sky greeted his release just a commonplace friday afternoon with business as usual on trinity road toy had been waiting for him in the reception wing when marty was brought down from his landing he had longer yet to wait while the officers went through a dozen bureaucratic rituals belongings to be checked and returned release papers to be signed and countersigned it took almost an hour of such formalities before they unlocked the doors and let them both out into the open air with little more than a handshake of welcome toy led him across the forecourt of the prison to where a dark red daimler was parked the drivers seat occupied come on marty he said opening the door too cold to linger it was cold the wind was vicious but the chill couldnt freeze his joy he was a free man for gods sake free within carefully prescribed limits perhaps but it was a beginning he was at least putting behind him all the paraphernalia of prison the bucket in the corner of the cell the keys the numbers now he had to be the equal of the choices and opportunities that would lead from here toy had already taken refuge in the back of the car marty he summoned again his suedegloved hand beckoning we should hurry or well get snarled up getting out of the city yes im here marty got in the interior of the car smelled of polish stale cigar smoke and leather luxuriant scents should i put the case in the boot marty said the driver turned from the wheel you got room back there he said a west indian dressed not in chauffeurs livery but in a battered leather flying jacket looked marty up and down he offered no welcoming smile luther said toy this is marty put the case over the front seat the driver replied he leaned across and opened the front passenger door marty got out and slid his case and plastic bag of belongings onto the front seat beside a litter of newspapers and a thumbed copy of playboy then got into the back with toy and slammed the door no need to slam said luther but marty scarcely heard the remark not many cons get picked up from the gates of wandsworth in a daimler he was thinking maybe this time ive fallen on my feet the car purred away from the gates and made a left onto trinity road luthers been with the estate for two years toy said three the other man corrected him is it toy replied three then he drives me around takes mr whitehead when he goes down to london dont do that no more marty caught the drivers eye in the mirror you been in that shithouse long the man asked pouncing without a flicker of hesitation long enough marty repliedhe wasnt going to try to hide anything there was no sense in that he waited for the next inevitable question what were you in for but it didnt come luther turned his attention back to the business of the road apparently satisfied marty was happy to let the conversation drop all he wanted to do was watch this brave new world go by and drink it all in the people the shopfronts the advertisements he had a hunger for all the details no matter how trivial he glued his eyes to the window there was so much to see and yet he had the distinct impression that it was all artificial as though the people in the street in the other cars were actors all cast to type and playing their parts immaculately his mind struggling to accommodate the welter of informationon every side a new vista at every corner a different parade passingsimply rejected their reality it was all stagemanaged his brain told him all a fiction because look these people behaved as though theyd lived without him as though the world had gone on while hed been locked away and some childlike part of himthe part that hiding its eyes believes itself hiddencould not conceive of a life for anyone without him to see it his common sense told him otherwise of course whatever his confused senses might suspect the world was older and more weary probably since he and it had last met he would have to renew his acquaintance with it learn how its nature had changed learn again its etiquette its touchiness its potential for pleasure they crossed the river via the wandsworth bridge and drove through earls court and shepherds bush onto westway it was the middle of a friday afternoon and the traffic was heavy commuters eager to be home for the weekend he stared blatantly at the faces of the drivers in the cars they overtook guessing occupations or trying to catch the eyes of the women mile by mile the strangeness hed felt initially began to wear off and by the time they reached the m he was starting to tire of the spectacle toy had nodded off in his corner of the back seat his hands in his lap luther was occupied with leapfrogging down the highway only one event stowed their progress twenty miles short of oxford blue lights flashed on the road up ahead and the sound of a siren speeding toward them from behind announced an accident the procession of cars slowed like a line of mourners pausing to glance into a coffin a car had slewed across the eastbound lanes crossed the divide and met headon a van coming in the opposite direction all of the westbound lanes were blocked either by wreckage or by police cars and the travelers were obliged to use the shoulder to skirt the scattered wreckage whats happened can you see luther asked his attention too occupied by navigating past the signaling policeman for him to see for himself marty described the scene as best he could a man with blood streaming down his face as if somebody had cracked a bloodyolked egg on his head was standing in the middle of the chaos hypnotized by shock behind him a grouppolice and rescued passengers alikegathered around the concertinaed front section of the car to speak to somebody trapped in the drivers seat the figure was slumped motionless as they crept past one of these comforters her coat soaked either with her own blood or that of the driver turned away from the vehicle and began to applaud at least that was how marty interpreted the slapping together of her hands as applause it was as if she were suffering the same delusion hed tasted so recentlythat this was all some meticulous but distasteful illusionand at any moment it would all come to a welcome end he wanted to lean out of the car window and tell her that she was wrong that this was the real worldlonglegged women crystal sky and all but shed know that tomorrow wouldnt she plenty of time for grief then but for now she clapped and she was still clapping when the accident slid out of sight behind them ii the fox asylum whitehead knew was a traitorous word in one breath it meant a sanctuary a place of refuge of safety in another its meaning twisted on itself asylum came to mean a madhouse a hole for broken minds to bury themselves in it was he reminded himself a semantic trick no more why then did the ambiguity run in his head so often he sat in that toocomfortable chair beside the window where he had sat now for a season of evenings watching the night begin to skulk across the lawn and thinking without much shape to his ruminations about how one thing became another about how difficult it was to hold on to anything life was a random business whitehead had learned that lesson years ago at the hands of a master and he had never forgotten it whether you were rewarded for your good works or skinned alive it was all down to chance no use to cleave to some system of numbers or divinities they all crumbled in the end fortune belonged to the man who was willing to risk everything on a single throw hed done that not once but many times at the beginning of his career when he was still laying the foundations of his empire and thanks to that extraordinary sixth sense he possessed the ability to preempt the roll of the dice the risks had almost always paid off other corporations had their virtuosi computers that calculated the odds to the tenth place advisers who kept their ears pressed to the stock markets of tokyo london and new york but they were all overshadowed by whiteheads instinct when it came to knowing the moment for sensing the collision of time and opportunity that made a good decision into a great one a commonplace takeover into a coup nobody was old man whiteheads superior and all the smart young men in the corporations boardrooms knew that joes oracular advice still had to be sought before any significant expansion was undertaken or contract signed he guessed this authority which remained absolute was resented in some circles no doubt there were those who thought he should let go his hold completely and leave the university men and their computers to get on with business but whitehead had won these skills these unique powers of secondguessing at some hazard foolish then that they lie forgotten when they could be used to lay a finger on the wheel besides the old man had an argument the young turks could never gainsay his methods worked hed never been properly schooled his life before fame wasmuch to the journalists dismaya blank but he had made the whitehead corporation out of nothing its fate for better or worse was still his passionate concern there was no room for passion tonight however sitting in that chair beside the window tonight there was only unease that old mans complaint how he loathed age it was hardly bearable to be so reduced not that he was infirm just that a dozen minor ailments conspired against his comfort so that seldom a day passed without some irritationan ulcerous mouth or a chafing between the buttocks that itched furiouslyfixing his attentions in the body when the urge to selfpreservation called them elsewhere the curse of age hed decided was distraction and he couldnt afford the luxury of negligent thinking there was danger in contemplating itch and ulcer as soon as his mind was turned something would take out his throat that was what the unease was telling him dont look away for a moment dont think youre safe because old man ive a message for you the worst is yet to come toy knocked once before entering the study bill whitehead momentarily forgot the lawn and the advancing darkness as he turned to face his friend you got here of course we got here joe are we late no no no problems things are fine good strauss is downstairs in the diminishing light whitehead crossed to the table and poured himself a sparing glass of vodka he had been holding off from drinking until now a shot to celebrate toys safe arrival you want one it was a ritual question with a ritual response no thanks youre going back to town then when youve seen strauss its too late for the theater why dont you stay bill go back tomorrow morning when its light ive got business toy said allowing himself the gentlest of smiles on the final word this was another ritual one of many between the two men toys business in london which the old man knew had nothing to do with the corporation went unquestioned it always had and whats your impression of strauss much as i thought at the interview i think hell be fine and if he isnt theres plenty more where he came from i need someone who isnt going to scare easily things could get very unpleasant toy offered a noncommittal grunt and hoped that the talk on this matter wouldnt go any further he was tired after a day of waiting and traveling and he wanted to look forward to the evening this was no time to talk over that business again whitehead had put down his drained glass on the tray and gone back to the window it was darkening in the room quite rapidly now and when the old man stood with his back to toy he was welded by shadow into something monolithic after thirty years in whiteheads employthree decades with scarcely a cross word spoken between themtoy was still as much in awe of whitehead as of some potentate with the power of life and death over him he still took a pause to find his equilibrium before entering into whiteheads presence he still found traces of the stammer hed had when theyd met returning on occasion it was a legitimate response he felt the man was power more power than he could ever hope or indeed would ever want to possess and it sat with deceptive lightness on joe whiteheads substantial shoulders in all their years of association in conference or boardroom he had never seen whitehead want for the appropriate gesture or remark he was simply the most confident man toy had ever met certain to his marrow of his own supreme worth his skills honed to such an edge that a man could be undone by a word gutted for life his selfesteem drained and his career tattered toy had seen it done countless times and often to men he considered his betters which begged the question why did the great man pass the time of day with him perhaps it was simply history was that it history and sentiment im thinking of filling in the outdoor pool toy thanked god whitehead had changed the subject no talk of the past for tonight at least i dont swim out there any longer even in the summer put some fishes in whitehead turned his head slightly to see if there was a smile on toys face he never signaled a joke in the tone of his voice and it was easy whitehead knew to offend the mans sensibilities if one laughed when no joke was intended or the other way about toy wasnt smiling fishes said whitehead ornamental carp perhaps arent they called koi exquisite things toy liked the pool at night it was lit from below and the surface moved in mesmerizing eddies the turquoise enchanting if there was a chill in the air the heated water gave off a wispy breath that melted away six inches from the surface in fact though hed hated swimming the pool was a favorite place of his he wasnt certain if whitehead knew this he probably did papa knew most things hed found whether theyd been voiced or not you like the pool whitehead stated there proof yes i do then well keep it well not just whitehead raised his hand to ward off further debate pleased to be giving this gift well keep it he said and you can fill it with koi he sat back down in the chair shall i put the lawn lights on toy asked no said whitehead the dying light from the window cast his head in bronze a latterday medici perhaps with his wearylidded pitset eyes the white beard and mustache cropped nickingly close to his skin the whole construction seemingly too weighty for the column supporting it aware that his eyes were boring into the old mans back and that joe would surely sense it toy sloughed off the lethargy of the room and pressed himself back into action well shall i fetch strauss joe do you want to see him or not the words took an age to cross the room in the thickening darkness for several heartbeats toy wasnt even certain that whitehead had heard him then the oracle spoke not a prophecy but a question will we survive bill the words were spoken so quietly they only just carried hooked on motes of dust and wafted from his lips toys heart sank it was the old theme again the same paranoid song i hear more and more rumors bill they cant all be groundless he was still looking out the window rooks circled above the wood half a mile or so across the lawn was he watching them toy doubted it hed seen whitehead like this often of late sunk down into himself scanning the past with his minds eye it wasnt a vision toy had access to but he could guess at joes present fearshed been there after all in the early daysand he knew too that however much he loved the old man there were some burdens he would never be capable or willing to share he wasnt strong enough he was at heart still the boxer whitehead had employed as a bodyguard three decades before now of course he wore a fourhundredpound suit and his nails were as immaculately kept as his manners but his mind was the same as ever superstitious and fragile the dreams the great dreamed were not for him nor were their nightmares again whitehead posed the haunted question will we survive this time toy felt obliged to reply everythings fine joe you know it is profits up in most sectors but evasion wasnt what the old man wanted and toy knew it he let the words falter leaving a silence after the faltering more wretched than ever toys stare now fixed on whitehead again was unblinking and at the corners of his eyes the murk that had taken over the room began to flicker and crawl he dropped his lids they almost grated across his eyeballs patterns danced in his head and when he opened his eyes again the night finally had a stranglehold on the interior the bronze head remained unmoved but it spoke and the words seemed to come from whiteheads bowels dirtied with fear im afraid willy he said all my life ive never been as frightened as i am now he spoke slowly without the least emphasis as if he despised the melodrama of his words and was refusing to magnify it further all these years living without fear id forgotten what it was like how crippling it is how it drains your willpower i just sit here day in day out locked up in this place with the alarms the fences the dogs i watch the lawn and the trees he was watching and sooner or later the light begins to fade he paused a long deep hush except for the distant crows i can bear the night itself its not pleasant but its unambiguous its twilight i cant deal with thats when the bad sweats come over me when the lights going and nothings quite real anymore quite solid just forms things that once had shapes it had been a winter of such evenings colorless drizzles that eroded distance and killed sound weeks on end of uncertain light when troubled dawn became troubled dusk with no day intervening there had been too few hardfrosted days like today just one discouraging month upon another i sit here every evening now the old man was saying its a test i set myself just to sit and watch everything eroded defying it all toy could taste the profundity of papas despair he hadnt been like this ever before not even after evangelines death it was almost completely dark outside and in without the lawn lights on the grounds were pitch but whitehead still sat facing the black window watching its all there of course he said what is the trees the lawn when dawn comes tomorrow theyll be waiting yes of course you know as a child i thought somebody came and took the world away in the night and then came back and unrolled it all again the following morning he stirred in his seat his hand moved to his head impossible to see what he was doing the things we believe as children they never leave us do they theyre just waiting for time to roll around and us to start believing in them all over again its the same old patch bill you know i mean we think we move on we get stronger we get wiser but all the time were standing on the same patch he sighed and looked around at toy light from the hallway fawned through the door which toy had left slightly ajar by it even across the room whiteheads eyes and cheeks glittered with tears youd better put on the light bill he said yes and bring up strauss there was no sign of his distress apparent in his voice but then joe was an expert at disguising his feelings toy knew that of old he could close down the hoods of his eyes and seal up his mouth and not even a mindreader could work out what he was thinking it was a skill hed used to devastating effect in the boardroom nobody ever knew which way the old fox would jump hed learned the technique playing cards presumably that and how to wait they had driven through the electric gates of whiteheads estate and into another world lawns laid out immaculately on either side of the sepiagraveled driveway a distant aspect of woodland off to the right which disappeared behind a line of cypresses as they bore around toward the house itself it was late afternoon by the time they arrived but the mellowing light only enhanced the charm of the place its formality offset by a rising mist that blurred the scalpel edge of grass and tree the main building was less spectacular than marty had anticipated just a large georgian country house solid but plain with modern extensions sprawling away from the main structure they drove past the front door with its white pillared porch to a side entrance and toy invited him through into the kitchen put your bags down and help yourself to some coffee he said im just going up to see the boss man make yourself comfortable alone for the first time since leaving wandsworth marty felt uncomfortable the door was open at his back there were no locks on the windows no officers patrolling the corridors beyond the kitchen it was paradoxical but he felt unprotected almost vulnerable after a few minutes he got up from the table switched on the fluorescent light and poured himself a mug of black coffee from the percolator it was heavy and slightly bitter brewed and rebrewed he guessed not like the insipid stuff he was used to it was twentyfive minutes before toy came back in apologized for the delay and told him that mr whitehead would see him now leave your bags he said luther will see to them toy led the way from the kitchen which was part of the extension into the main house the corridors were gloomy but everywhere martys eye was amazed the building was a museum paintings covered the walls from floor to ceiling on the tables and shelves were vases and ceramic figurines whose enamels gleamed there was no time to linger however they wove through the maze of halls martys sense of direction more confounded with every turn until they reached the study toy knocked opened the door and ushered marty in with little but a badly remembered photograph of whitehead to build upon martys portrait of his new employer had been chiefly inventionand totally wrong where hed imagined frailty he found robustness where hed expected the eccentricity of a recluse he found a furrowed subtle face that scanned him even as he entered the study with efficiency and humor mr strauss said whitehead welcome behind whitehead the curtains were still open and through the window the floodlights suddenly came on illuminating the piercing green of the lawns for a good two hundred yards it was like a conjurers trick the sudden appearance of this sward but whitehead ignored it he walked toward marty though he was a large man and much of his bulk had turned to fat the weight sat on his frame quite easily there was no sense of awkwardness the grace of his gait the almost oiled smoothness of his arm as he extended it to marty the suppleness of the proffered fingers all suggested a man at peace with his physique they shook hands either marty was hot or the other man cold marty immediately took the error to be his a man like whitehead was surely never too hot or too cold he controlled his temperature with the same ease he controlled his finances hadnt toy dropped into their few exchanges in the car the fact that whitehead had never been seriously ill in his life now marty was facetoface with the paragon he could believe it not a whisper of flatulence would dare this mans bowels im joseph whitehead he said welcome to the sanctuary thank you youll have a drink celebrate yes please what will it be martys mind suddenly went blank and he found himself gaping like a stranded fish it was toy god save him who suggested scotch thatd be fine the usual for me said whitehead come and sit down mr strauss they sat the chairs were comfortable not antiques like the tables in the corridors but functional modern pieces the entire room shared this style it was a working environment not a museum the few pictures on the dark blue walls looked to martys uneducated eye as recent as the furniture they were large and slapdash the most prominently placed and the most representational was signed matisse and pictured a bilious pink woman sprawled on a bilious yellow chaise tongue your whisky marty accepted the glass toy was offering we had luther buy you a selection of new clothes theyre up in your room whitehead was telling marty just a couple of suits shirts and so on to start with later on well maybe send you out shopping for yourself he drained his glass of neat vodka before continuing do they still issue suits to prisoners or did they discontinue that smacks of the poorhouse i suppose wouldnt be too tactful in these enlightened times people might begin to think you were criminals by necessity marty wasnt at all sure about this line of chat was whitehead making fun of him the monologue went on its tenor quite friendly while marty tried to sort out irony from straightforward opinion it was difficult he was reminded in the space of a few minutes listening to whitehead talk of how much subtler things were on the outside by comparison with this mans shifting richly inflected talk the cleverest conversationalist in wandsworth was an amateur toy slipped a second large whisky into martys hand but he scarcely noticed whiteheads voice was hypnotic and strangely soothing toy has explained your duties to you has he yes i think so i want you to make this house your home strauss become familiar with it there are one or two places that will be outofbounds to you toy will tell you where please observe those constraints the rest of the place is at your disposal marty nodded and downed his whisky it ran down his gullet like quicksilver tomorrow whitehead stood up the thought unfinished and returned to the window the grass shone as though freshly painted well take a walk around the place you and i fine see whats to be seen introduce you to bella and the others there was more staff toy hadnt mentioned them but inevitably there would be others here guards cooks gardeners the place probably swarmed with functionaries come talk to me tomorrow eh marty drained the rest of his scotch and toy gestured that he should stand up whitehead seemed suddenly to have lost interest in them both his assessment was over at least for today his thoughts were already elsewhere his stare directed out of the window at the gleaming lawn yes sir tomorrow but before you come whitehead said glancing around at marty yes sir shave off your mustache anybody would think youd got something to hide toy gave marty a perfunctory tour of the house before taking him upstairs promising a more thorough walkabout when time wasnt so pressing then he delivered marty to a long airy room on the top story and at the side of the house this is yours he said luther had left the suitcase and the plastic bag on the bed their tattiness looked out of place in the sleek utility of the room it had like the study contemporary fittings its a bit bare at the moment said toy so do whatever you want with it if youve got photographs not really well we ought to get something on the walls there are some bookshe nodded to the far end of the room where several shelves groaned under a weight of volumesbut the library downstairs is at your disposal ill show you the layout sometime next week when youve settled in theres a video up here too and another downstairs again joe doesnt really have much interest in it so help yourself sounds good theres a small dressing room through to the left as joe said youll find some fresh clothes in there your bathroom is through the other door shower and so on and i think thats it i hope its adequate its fine marty said toy glanced at his watch and turned to leave just before you go problem no problem marty said jesus no problem at all i just want you to know im grateful no need but i am marty insisted hed been trying to find a cue for this speech since trinity road im very grateful i dont know how or why you chose mebut i appreciate it toy was mildly discomforted by this show of feeling but marty was glad to have it said believe me marty i wouldnt have chosen you if i didnt think you could do the job youre here now its up to you to make the best of it im going to be around of course but after this youre more or less your own man yes i realize that ill leave you then see you at the beginning of the week pearls left food out for you in the kitchen by the way goodnight goodnight toy left him alone he sat down on the bed and opened his suitcase the badly packed clothes smelled of prison detergent and he didnt want to take them out instead he dug down to the bottom of the case until his hands found his razor and shaving foam then he undressed slung his stale clothes on the floor and went into the bathroom it was spacious mirrored and seductively lit freshly laundered towels hung on a heated rack there was a shower as well as a bath and a bidet an embarrassment of waterworks whatever else happened to him here hed be clean he switched on the mirror light and set the shaving implements down on the glass shelf above the sink he neednt have bothered with his search toy or perhaps luther had laid a complete shaving kit out for him razor preshave foam cologne all unopened pristine waiting for him he looked at himself in the mirrorthat intimate selfscrutiny which was expected of women but which men seldom practiced except in locked bathrooms the anxieties of the day showed on his face his skin was anemic and the bags under his eyes full like a man searching for some treasure he plundered his face for clues was his past written here he wondered in all its grubby detail etched perhaps too deeply to be erased he needed some sun no doubt of that and decent exercise out in the open air from tomorrow he thought a new regime hed run every day till he was so fit he was unrecognizable get himself to a proper dentist too his gums bled worryingly often and in one or two places they were receding from the tooth he was proud of his teeth they were even and strong like his mothers he tried his smile on the mirror but it had lost some of its former sparkle hed have to exercise that too he was in the big wide world again and maybe in time thered be women to woo with that smile his surveillance shifted from face to body a wedge of fat was sitting on the muscle of his abdomen he was easily a stone overweight hed have to work at that watch his diet and keep the exercise up until he was back to the twelve stone three hed been when he first went to wandsworth the extra weight apart he felt quite good about himself maybe the warm light flattered him but prison didnt seem to have changed him radically he still had all his hair he wasnt scarredexcept for the tattoos and a small crescent to the left of his mouth he wasnt doped up to the eyeballs maybe he was a survivor after all his hand had crept to his groin as he perused himself and hed idly teased himself semierect he hadnt been thinking of charmaine if there was any lust in his arousal it was narcissistic many of the cons hed lived with had found it easy to slake their sexual thirst with their cellmates but marty had never been comfortable with the idea not simply out of distaste for the actsthough he felt that acutelybut because that unnaturalness was forced upon him it was just another way that prison humiliated a man instead hed locked his sexuality away and used his cock for pissing and little else now toying with it like a vain adolescent he wondered if he could still use the damn thing he ran the shower lukewarm and stepped in slicking himself down from head to foot with lemonscented soap in a day of pleasures this was perhaps the best the water was stimulating like standing in a spring rain his body began to wake yes that was it he thought ive been dead and im coming back to life hed been buried in the asshole of the world a hole so deep he thought hed never scramble out of it but he had damn it he was out he rinsed and then indulged himself with a repeat of the ritual this time running the water considerably hotter and harder the bathroom filled with steam and the slap of the water on the shower tiles when he stepped out and turned the flow off his head buzzed with heat whisky and fatigue he moved to the mirror and cleared an oval in the condensation with the ball of his fist the water had brought new color to his cheeks his hair was plastered to his head like a brownblond skullcap hed let it grow he thought as long as whitehead didnt object get it styled perhaps but there was more pressing business now the removal of the condemned mustache he wasnt particularly hirsute the mustache had taken him several weeks to grow and hed had to tolerate the usual run of witless remarks while he was doing it but if the boss man wanted him barefaced who was he to argue whiteheads opinion on the matter had sounded more like an order than a suggestion despite the wellsupplied cabinet in the bathroom there were no scissors and he had to soap the hairs thoroughly to soften them and then go at them directly with the razor the blade protested and so did his skin but stroke by stroke his upper lip came back into view the hardearned mustache hitting the sink in a slop of suds only to be sucked away down the drain it took him half an hour to do the job to his satisfaction he nicked himself in two or three places and sealed the cuts as best he could with spit by the time hed finished the steam had cleared from the bathroom and only patches of mist marred his reflection he looked at his face in the mirror his naked upper lip was pink and vulnerable and the groove at its center curiously overperfect in its formation but his sudden nudity wasnt such a bad sight content he sluiced the remains of his mustache from the sides of the sink wrapped a towel about his middle and sauntered back into the bedroom in the centrally heated warmth of the house he was practically dry no need for toweling weariness and hunger fought in him as he sat on the edge of the bed there was food downstairs for him or so toy had said well maybe hed just lie back on this virginal sheet head on the scented pillow and close his eyes for half an hour then get up and wander down to eat supper he slung off the towel and lay on the bed halfpulling the duvet over him and in the act of doing so fell asleep there were no dreams or if there were he slept too securely to remember them it was morning in moments if he had forgotten the geography of the house from his brief tour the previous night it took only a sense of smell to lead him back to the kitchen bacon was frying fresh coffee was being perked at the stove stood a redhaired woman she turned from her work and nodded you must be martin she said her voice carried a faint irish inflection youre up late he looked at the clock on the wall it was a few minutes past seven youve got a fine morning to start the back door was open he crossed the expanse of the kitchen to survey the day it was fine another clear sky frost sugared the lawn in the misted distance he could see what looked like tennis courts and beyond them a stand of trees im pearl by the way the woman announced i cook for mr whitehead hungry are you i am now im down here we believe in breakfast here something to set you up for the day she was busy transferring bacon from the frying pan on the stove to the oven the work surface beside the hob was littered with food tomatoes sausages slices of black pudding theres coffee on the side there help yourself the percolator burped and fizzed as he poured himself a mug of coffee the same dark but fragrant roast hed tasted the night before youll have to get used to using the kitchen when im not here i dont live in i just come and go who cooks for mr whitehead when youre away he likes to do it himself on occasion but youll have to put in a hand i can scarcely boil water youll learn she turned to look at him egg in hand she was older than hed at first thought maybe fifty dont fret yourself about it she said how hungry ravenous i left a cold spread out last night i fell asleep she broke one egg into the frying pan and then a second as she said mr whitehead doesnt have fancy tastes except for his strawberries he wont be expecting soufflйs dont worry most of the stuffs in the freezer next door all you have to do is unwrap it and put it in the microwave marty scanned the kitchen taking in all the equipment food processor microwave oven electric carving knife behind him mounted on the wall was a row of television screens he hadnt noticed them last night before he could inquire about them however pearl was offering further gastronomic details he often gets hungry in the middle of the night or so nick used to say he keeps such funny hours you see whos nick your predecessor he left just before christmas i quite liked him but bill said he got a little lightfingered i see she shrugged still you cant tell can you i mean he she halted in midsentence quietly cursing her tongue and covered her embarrassment by coaxing the eggs out of the pan and onto the plate to join the food shed already assembled there marty finished her thought out loud for her he didnt look like a thief is that what you were going to say i didnt mean it like that she insisted transferring the plate from stove to table careful the plates hot her face had gone the color of her hair its all right marty told her i liked nick she reiterated really i did ive broken one of the eggs im sorry marty looked down at the full plate one of the yolks had indeed broken and was pooling around a fried tomato looks fine to me he said with genuine appetite and set to eating pearl refilled his mug found a cup for herself filled that and sat down with him bill speaks very highly of you she said i wasnt sure hed taken to me at first oh yes she said very much partly because of your boxing of course he used to be a professional boxer himself really i thought hed have told you this is thirty years ago before he worked for mr whitehead you want some toast if theres some going she got up and cut two slices of white bread then slipped them into the toaster she hesitated a moment before returning to the table i really am sorry she said about the egg about mentioning nick and thieving i asked marty replied besides youve every right to be cautious im an excon not even ex really i could go back if i put a foot wronghe loathed saying this as if the mere speaking of the words made the possibility more realbut im not going to let mr toy down or myself ok she nodded clearly relieved that nothing had been soured between them and sat down again to finish her coffee youre not like nick she said i can tell that already was he odd marty said glass eye or something well he wasnt she seemed to regret this fresh line of conversation before it was begun its no matter she said dismissing it no go on well for what its worth i think he had debts marty tried not to register anything but the mildest interest but something must have showed in his eyes a flicker of panic perhaps pearl frowned what sort of debts he asked lightly the toast popped up claiming pearls attention she crossed to fetch the slices and brought them back to the table excuse fingers she said thanks i dont know how much he owed no i dont mean how big i meant where did they come from was he making this sound like an idle inquiry he wondered or was she able to see from the way he clutched his fork or his sudden loss of appetite that this was a significant question he had to ask it however it might seem to her she thought for a moment before answering when she did there was something of the streetcorner gossip in her slightly lowered voice whatever came next was to be a secret between them he used to come down here at all times of the day and make telephone calls he told me he was calling people in the businesshe was a stuntman you see or had beenbut i soon cottoned on that he was making bets its my guess thats where the debts came from gambling somehow marty had known the answer before it came it begged of course another question was it just coincidence that whitehead had employed two bodyguards both at some point in their lives gamblers bothit now appearedthieves for their hobby toy had never shown much interest in that aspect of martys life but then maybe all the salient facts were in the file that somervale had always carried the psychologists reports the trial transcripts everything toy would ever need to know about the compulsion that had driven marty to theft he tried to shrug off the discomfort he felt about all this what the hell did it matter it was old news he was healthy now you finished with your plate yes thanks more coffee ill get it pearl took the plate from in front of marty scraped the uneaten food onto a second platefor the birds she saidand started to load plates cutlery and pans alike into the dishwasher marty refilled his mug and watched her at work she was an attractive woman middleage suited her how many staff does whitehead have altogether mr whitehead she said gently correcting him staff well theres me i come and go like i said and theres mr toy of course he doesnt live here either right he stays overnight when they have conferences here is that regular oh yes theres a lot of meetings go on in the house people in and out all the time thats why mr whiteheads so security conscious does he ever go down to london not now she said he used to jet around quite a bit off to new york or hamburg or some such place but not now now he just stays here all year round and makes the rest of the world come to him where was i staff oh yes the place used to swarm with people security staff servants upstairs maids but then he went through a very suspicious patch thought one of them might poison him or murder him in his bath so he sacked them all just like that said he was happier with just a few of us the ones he trusted that way he wasnt surrounded by people he didnt know he doesnt know me maybe not yet but hes canny like nobody ive ever met the telephone rang she picked it up he knew it must be whitehead on the other end pearl looked caught in the act oh yes its my fault i kept him talking right away the receiver was quickly replaced mr whiteheads waiting for you youd better hurry hes with the dogs the kennels were located behind a group of outhousesonce stables perhapstwo hundred yards to the back of the main house a sprawling collection of breezeblock sheds and wiremesh enclosures they had been built simply to fulfill their function with no thought for architectural felicities they were an eyesore it was chilly out in the open air and crossing the crusty grass toward the kennels marty had rapidly regretted his shirtsleeves but thered been an urgency in pearls voice as she sent him on his way and he didnt want to leave whiteheadno he must learn to think of the man as mr whiteheadwaiting longer than he already had as it was the great man seemed unruffled by his late arrival i thought wed take a look at the dogs this morning then maybe well make a tour of the grounds yes yes sir he was dressed in a heavy black coat the thick fur collar of which cradled his head you like dogs you asking me honestly sir of course not much was your mother bitten or were you there was a twitch of a smile in the bloodshot eyes neither of us that i can remember sir whitehead grunted well youre about to meet the tribe strauss whether you like them or not its important they get to recognize you theyre trained to tear intruders apart we dont want them making any mistakes a figure had emerged from one of the larger sheds carrying a choke chain it took two glances for marty to work out whether the newcomer was male or female the cropped hair the shabby anorak and the boots all suggested masculinity but there was something in the molding of the face that betrayed the illusion this is lillian she looks after the dogs the woman nodded a greeting without even glancing at marty at her appearance several dogslarge shaggy alsatianshad emerged from the kennels into the concrete run and were sniffing at her through the wire whining a welcome she shushed them unsuccessfully the welcome escalated into barks and now one or two were standing on their hind legs manheight against the mesh their tails wagging furiously the din worsened be quiet she snapped across to them and almost all were chastened into silence one male however larger than the rest still stood against the wire demanding attention until lillian drew off her leather glove and put her fingers through the mesh to scratch his deepfurred throat martin here has taken over in nicks stead said whitehead hell be here all the time from now on i thought he should meet the dogs and have the dogs meet him makes sense lillian replied without enthusiasm how many are there marty inquired fully grown nine five males four females this is saul she said speaking of the dog she was still stroking hes the oldest and the biggest the male over in the corner is job hes one of sauls sons hes not too well at the moment job had halflain down in the corner of the enclosure and was licking his testicles with some enthusiasm he seemed to know he had become the center of conversation because he looked up from his toilet for a moment in the look he gave them there was everything marty hated about the species the threat the shiftiness the barely subdued resentment of its masters the bitches are over there there were two dogs trotting up and down the length of the enclosure the lighter ones dido and the darkers zoe it was odd to hear these brutes called by such names it seemed wholly inappropriate and surely they resented the womans christenings mocked her probably behind her back come over here lillian said summoning marty as she might one of her pack like them he came said she said to the animal behind the wire this is a friend come closer she told marty he cant smell you from over there the dog had dropped down onto all fours marty approached the wire cautiously dont be afraid go right up to him let him get a good sniff of you they dont like fear said whitehead isnt that right lillian thats right if they smell it on you they know theyve got you then theyre merciless you have to stand up to them marty approached the dog it looked up at him testily he stared back dont try and outstare him lillian advised it makes the dog aggressive just let him get your scent so he knows you saul sniffed at martys legs and crotch through the mesh much to martys discomfort then apparently satisfied he wandered away good enough said lillian next time no wire and in a while youll be handling him she was taking some pleasure in martys unease he was sure of it but he said nothing just let her lead the way into the largest of the sheds now you must meet bella she said inside the kennels the smell of disinfectant stale urine and dogs was overpowering lillians entrance was greeted with another sustained round of barking and wirepawing the shed had a walkway down the center with cages off to the right and left two of these held a single dog both bitches one considerably smaller than the other lillian rolled off the details as they passed each cagethe dogs names and their place on the incestuous family tree marty attended to all she was saying and immediately forgot it again his mind was otherwise occupied it wasnt just the intimate presence of the dogs that unnerved him but the suffocating familiarity of this interior the walkway the cells with their concrete floors their blankets their bare bulbs it was like home from home and now he began to see the dogs in a new light saw another meaning in jobs baleful glance as he looked up from his ablutions understood better than lillian or whitehead ever could how these prisoners must view him and his species he stopped to look into one of the cages not out of any particular interest but to focus on something other than the anxiety he felt in this claustrophobic hut whats this one called he asked the dog in the cage was at the door another sizable male though not on the scale of saul thats laurousse lillian replied the dog looked friendlier than the others and marty overcame his nerves and went down on his haunches in the narrow corridor extending a tentative hand toward the cage hell be fine with you she said marty put his fingers to the mesh laurousse sniffed them inquisitively his nose was damp and cold good dog marty said laurousse the dog began to wag its tail happy to be named by this sweating stranger good dog down here closer to the blankets and the straw the smell of excrement and fur was even stronger but the dog was delighted that marty had come down to its level and was attempting to lick his fingers through the wire marty felt the fear in him dispelled by the dogs enthusiasm far from meaning him harm it showed unalloyed pleasure only now did he become aware of whiteheads scrutiny the old man was standing a few feet off to his left his bulk entirely blocking the narrow passage between the cages watching intently marty stood up selfconsciously leaving the dog to whine and wag below him and followed lillian further down the line of cages the dogkeeper was singing the praises of another member of the tribe marty tuned in to her conversation and this is bella she announced her voice had softened there was a dreamy quality in it that he hadnt caught before when marty reached the cage into which she was pointing he saw why bella halflay and halfsat in the mesh shadows at the end of her cage arranged like a blacksnouted madonna on a bed of blankets and straw with blind pups suckling at her teats setting eyes on her martys reservations about the dogs evaporated six pups lillian announced as proudly as if they were her own all strong and healthy more than strong and healthy they were beautiful fat balls of contentment nestling against each other in the luxury of their mothers lap it seemed inconceivable that creatures so vulnerable could grow into irongray lords like saul or suspicious rebels like job bella sensing a newcomer among her congregation pricked up her ears her head was superbly proportioned tones of sable and gold mingling in her coat to glamorous effect her brown eyes vigilant but soft in the halflight she was so finished so completely herself the only response to her presenceand one that marty willingly grantedwas awe lillian peered though the wire introducing marty to this mother of mothers this is mr strauss bella she said youll see him now and again hes a friend there was no babytalk condescension in lillians voice she spoke to the dog as to an equal and despite martys initial uncertainty about the woman he found himself warming to her love wasnt an easy thing to come by he knew that to his cost whatever shape it came in it made sense to respect it lillian loved this dogher grace her dignity it was a love he could approve of if not entirely understand bella sniffed the air and seemed satisfied that she had the measure of marty lillian reluctantly turned from the cage to strauss she might even take to you given time shes a great seductress you know a great seductress behind them whitehead grunted at this sentimental nonsense shall we look over the grounds he suggested impatiently i think were done here come back when youve settled in lillian said her manner had defrosted noticeably since marty had shown some appreciation of her charges and ill put them through their paces for you thanks i will i wanted you to see the dogs whitehead said as they left the enclosures behind and started at a brisk pace across the lawn to the perimeter fence that was only part of the reason for the visit though marty knew that damn well whitehead had intended the experience as a salutary reminder of what marty had left behind him there but for the grace of joseph whitehead he would go again well the lesson was learned hed jump through hoops of fire for the old man rather than go back into the custody of corridors and cells there wasnt even a bella there no sublime and secret mother locked away in the heart of wandsworth just lost men like himself the day was warming the sun was up a pale lemon balloon drifting above the rookery and the frost was melting from the lawns for the first time marty began to get some sense of the scale of the estate distances opened up to either side of them he could see water a lake or river perhaps shining beyond a bank of trees on the west side of the house there were rows of cypresses suggesting walkways fountains perhaps to the other side a banked garden surrounded by a low stone wall it would take him weeks to get the layout of the place they had reached the double fence that ran right around the estate a good ten feet high both fences were topped by sharpened steel struts that curved out toward the wouldbe intruder these were in turn crowned with spirals of barbed wire the whole construction hummed almost imperceptibly with an electric charge whitehead regarded it with evident satisfaction impressive eh marty nodded again the sight woke echoes it offers a measure of security whitehead said he turned left at the fence and began to walk its length the conversationif that it could be calledcoming from him in the form of a series of non sequiturs as if he were too impatient with the elliptical structure of normal exchanges to bear with it he simply threw statements or clusters of remarks down and expected marty to make whatever sense he could of them its not a perfect system fences dogs cameras you saw the screens in the kitchen yes ive got the same upstairs the cameras offer total surveillance day and night he jerked a thumb up at one of the cameras floodlights mounted beside them there was one set on every tenth upright they swiveled back and forth slowly like the heads of mechanical birds lutherll show you how to run through them in sequence cost a small fortune to install and im not sure its more than cosmetic these people arent fools youve had breakins not here at the london house it used to happen all the time of course that was when i was more visible the unrepentant tycoon evangeline and me in every scandal sheet the open sewer of fleet street it never fails to appall me i thought you owned a newspaper been reading up on me not exactly i dont believe the biographies or the gossip columns or even whos who they lie i liehe finished the declension entertained by his own cynicismhe she or it lies scribblers dirt peddlers contemptible the lot of them was that what he was keeping out with these lethal fences dirt peddlers a fortress against a tide of scandal and shit if so it was an elaborate lay to go about it marty wondered if this wasnt simply monstrous egotism was the hemisphere that interested in the private life of joseph whitehead what are you thinking mr strauss about the fences marty lied proving whiteheads earlier point no strauss whitehead corrected him youre thinking what have i got myself into locked up with a lunatic marty sensed any further denial would sound like guilt he said nothing isnt that the conventional wisdom where im concerned the failing plutocrat festering in solitude dont they say that about me something like that marty finally replied and still you came yes of course you came you thought that however offbeat i am nothing could be as bad as another stretch behind locked doors isnt that right and you wanted out at any cost you were desperate of course i wanted out anybody would im glad you admit to that because your wanting gives me considerable power over you dont you think you darent cheat me you must cleave to me the way the dogs cleave to lillian not because she represents their next meal but because shes their world you must make me your world mr strauss my preservation my sanity my smallest comfort must be uppermost in your mind every waking moment if it is i promise you freedoms you never dreamed of experiencing the kind of freedoms that are only in the gift of very wealthy men if not i will put you back in prison with your record book irredeemably spoiled understand me i understand whitehead nodded come then he said walk beside me he turned and walked on the fence swung around behind the back of the woods at this point and rather than plunging into the undergrowth whitehead suggested they truncate their journey by heading toward the pool one tree looks much like the next to me he commented you can come here and trudge around to your hearts content later on they skirted the edge of the woods long enough for marty to get an impression of their density however the trees hadnt been systematically planted this was no regimented forestry commission reserve they stood close to each other their limbs intertwined a mixture of deciduous varieties and pines all fighting for growing space only occasionally where an oak or a lime stood barebranched this early in the year did light bless the undergrowth he promised himself a return here before spring prettified it whitehead summoned martys thoughts back into focus from now on i expect you to be within summoning distance most of the time i dont want you with me every moment of the day just need you in the vicinity on occasion and only with my permission youll be permitted to leave on your own you can drive yes well theres no shortage of cars so well sort something out for you this isnt strictly within the guidelines set out by the parole board their recommendation was that you remain as it were in custody here for six probationary months but i frankly see no reason to prevent you visiting your loved onesat least when there are other people around to look after my welfare thank you i appreciate it im afraid i cant allow you any time just at the moment your presence here is vital problems my life is constantly threatened strauss i or rather my offices receive hate mail all the time the difficulty is in separating the crank who spends his time writing filth to public figures from the genuine assassin why should anyone want to assassinate you im one of the wealthiest men outside america i own companies that employ tens of thousands of people i own tracts of land so large i could not walk them in the years remaining to me if i began now i own ships art horseflesh its easy to make an icon of me to think that if i and my life were brought down thered be peace on earth and goodwill to men i see sweet dreams he said bitterly the pace of their march had begun to slow the great mans breath was rather shorter now than it had been half an hour before listening to him talk it was easy to forget his advanced years his opinions had all the absolutism of youth no room here for the mellowness of advancing years for ambiguity or doubt i think its time we headed back he said the monologue had finally lapsed and marty had no taste for further talk no energy either whiteheads stylewith its unsignaled swerves and bendshad exhausted him hed have to get used to the pose of the attentive listener find a face to use when these lectures began and put it on learn to nod knowingly in the right places to murmur platitudes at the appropriate breaks in the flow it would take a while but hed get the trick of handling whitehead in time this is my fortress mr strauss the old man announced as they approached the house it didnt look particularly garrisoned the brick was too warm to be stern its sole function is to keep me from harm like me like you mr strauss behind the house one of the dogs had started barking the solo rapidly became a chorus feeding time whitehead said it took several weeks living on the estate for marty to understand fully the rhythm of the whitehead household like the benign dictatorship it was the shape of each day was defined absolutely by whiteheads plans and whims as the old man had told marty that first day the house was a shrine to him his worshipers came daily to touch the hem of his opinion some of their faces he recognized captains of industry two or three government ministers pundits guardians of public moralitymany people marty knew by sight but couldnt name even more he didnt know at all he was introduced to none of them once or twice a week he might be asked to remain in the room while the meetings were held but more often than not he was required only to be within hailing distance wherever he was he was invisible as far as most of the guests were concerned ignored treated at best as part of the furniture at first it was irritating everyone in the house had a name but him it seemed as time passed however he grew to be glad of his anonymity he wasnt required to give an opinion on everything so he could let his mind drift with no danger of being called into the conversation it was good too to be dislocated from the concerns of these almighty people their lies seemed he thought fraught and artificial he saw in many of their faces looks he recognized from his years in wandsworth the constant fretting over minor gibes over their place in the hierarchy the rules might be more civil in this circle than in wandsworth but the struggles he began to understand were fundamentally the same all power games of one kind or another he was pleased to have no part in them besides his mind had more important issues to mull over for one thing there was charmaine more out of curiosity than passion perhaps he had begun to think about her a good deal he found himself wondering how her body looked seven years on did she still shave the thin line of hair that ran down from her navel to her pubes did her fresh sweat still smell so pungent he wondered too if she still loved love the way she had she had shown more unreserved appetite for the physical act than any woman hed known it was one of the reasons hed married her was it still so and if it was with whom did she slake her thirst he turned these and a dozen other questions about her over and over in his head and promised himself that at the first opportunity hed go and see her the weeks saw his physique improve the strict regime of exercise hed set for himself that first night began as a torment but after a few days of punished and complaining muscles the exertion began to bear fruit he got up at fivethirty each morning and took an hourlong run around the grounds after a week of following the same circuit he altered the route which allowed him to explore the estate at the same time as exercising there was a great deal to see spring hadnt arrived in force yet but there were stirrings crocuses were beginning to show themselves as were the spears of daffodils on the trees fat buds were starting to split leaves were unfurling it had taken him almost a week to cover the estate fully and to work out the relation of one part of it to another now he more or less had a grasp of the arrangement he knew the lake the dovecote the swimming pool the tennis courts the kennels the woods and the gardens one morning when the sky was exceptionally clear he had circuited the entire grounds hugging the fence all the way around the estate even when it threaded its way along the back of the woods he now reckoned he had as thorough a knowledge of the place as anyone including its owner it was a joy not just the exploration and the freedom of running miles without someone looking over your shoulder all the time but the reacquaintance with a dozen natural spectacles he loved being up to watch the sun rise and it was almost as though he was running to meet it as though dawn was for him and him alone a promise of light and warmth and life to come he soon lost the ring of flab around his middle the divide of his abdominals showed again the washboard stomach hed always been so proud of as a younger man and thought hed lost forever muscles hed forgotten he had came back into play at first to make their presence felt in aching then to simply live a glowing ruddy life he was sweating out years of frustration and showering it away and he was lighter for it he was aware once more of his body as a system its parts correspondents its health dependent on balance and respectful usage if whitehead noted any change in his manner or physique no comment was made but toy on one of his trips up to the house from london immediately registered the change in him marty noted an alteration in toy too but for the worse it wasnt plausible to comment on how weary he looked marty felt their relationship wouldnt yet allow for such familiarity he just hoped toy wasnt suffering from something serious the sudden wasting of his wide face suggested a devouring somewhere in the mans innards the nimbleness in his step which marty put down to toys years in the ring had also gone there were other mysteries here besides toys decline for one thing there was the collection the works of the great masters that lined the corridors of the sanctuary they were neglected nobody had dusted their surfaces in months perhaps years and in addition to the yellowing varnish that dimmed their fineness they were further spoiled by a layer of grime marty had never had much taste for art but given time to look at these pictures he found his appetite for it good many of them the portraits and the religious works he didnt really like they werent of people he knew or events he understood but in a small hallway on the first floor that led to the extension that had been evangelines suite and was now the sauna and solarium he found two paintings that caught his imagination they were both landscapes by the same anonymous hand and to judge by their poky location they were not great works but their curious amalgam of real scenerytrees and winding roads under blue and yellow skieswith totally fanciful detailsa dragon with speckled wings devouring a man on that road a flight of women levitating above the forest a distant city burningthis marriage of real and unreal was so persuasively painted that marty found himself going back and back again to these two haunted canvases finding more fantastical detail hidden in thicket or heathaze each time he went the paintings werent the only things that whetted his curiosity the upper floor of the main house where whitehead had a suite of rooms was entirely outofbounds to him and he was more than once tempted to slip up when he knew the old man was otherwise engaged to nose around the forbidden territory he suspected whitehead used the top story as a vantage point from which to spy on his acolytes comings and goings that went some way to explaining the other mystery the sense he had running his circuits that he was being watched but he resisted the temptation to investigate it was perhaps more than his job was worth when he wasnt working he spent much of his time in the library there if he felt curious about the outside world were current issues of time magazine the washington post the times and several other journalsle monde frankfurter algemeine zeitung the new york times which luther brought in he would flick through them looking for tidbits sometimes taking them down to the sauna and reading them there when he tired of newspapers there were thousands of books to choose from not to his delight all intimidating tomes there were plenty of those the assembled classics of world literature but beside them on the shelves were tattered wellthumbed paperback editions of science fiction books their covers lurid the copy on them paradigms of excess marty began to read them picking those with the most suggestive covers first there was also the video toy had supplied him with a dozen tapes of boxing highlights which marty was systematically viewing rerunning favorite victories to his hearts content he could sit all evening watching the matches awed by the economy and the grace of the great fighters toy ever thoughtful had also supplied a couple of pornographic tapes handing them across to marty with a conspiratorial smile and some comment about not eating them all at once the tapes were copies of storyless loops anonymous couples and trios who threw off their clothes in the first thirty seconds and got down to the nittygritty inside a minute nothing sophisticated but they served a useful purpose and as toy had obviously guessed good air exercise and optimism were doing wonders for martys libido there was going to come a time when selfabuse in front of a video screen was not going to be satisfaction enough increasingly marty dreamed of charmaine unambiguous dreams set in the bedroom of number twentysix frustration gave him courage and the next time he saw toy he asked to be allowed to go and see her toy promised to ask the boss about it but nothing had come of it in the meanwhile he had to be content with tapes and their stagemanaged gasps and grunts systematically he began to put names to the faces that appeared most regularly at the house whiteheads most trusted advisers toy of course was regularly in evidence there was also a lawyer called ottaway a thin welldressed man of forty of so whom marty took a dislike to when he first overheard the mans conversation ottaway spoke with that air of the legal fandancer all tease and coverups that marty had experienced first hand it brought back sour memories there was another called curtsinger a sobersuited individual with an excruciating taste in ties and a worse one in colognes who though often in ottaways company seemed far more benign he was one of the few who actually acknowledged martys presence in a roomusually with a small sharp nod on one occasion celebrating some deal that had just been made curtsinger had slipped a large cigar into the pocket of martys jacket after that marty would have forgiven him anything the third face that seemed to be in regular attendance at whiteheads side was the most enigmatic of the three a swarthy troll of a man called dwoskin here was a cassius to toys brutus his immaculate pale gray suits his meticulously folded handkerchiefs the precision of his every gestureall spoke of an obsessive whose rituals of tidiness were designed to counter the excess of his physicality but there was more an undercurrent of danger about the man that martys years in wandsworth had taught him to be alive to in fact it was there in the others too beneath ottoways frigid exterior and curtsingers sugar coating there were men who were notit was somervales phraseentirely savory at first marty dismissed the feeling as lowerclass prejudice a nobody mistrusting the rich and influential on principle but the more meetings he sat in on the more heated debates he was peripheral to the more certain he became that there was in their dealings a scarcely concealed subtext of deceit even of criminality much of their talk he scarcely understood the subtleties of the stock market were a closed book to himbut the civilized vocabulary could not completely sanitize the essential drift they were interested in the mechanics of deception how to manipulate the law and the market alike their exchanges were littered with talk of tax avoidance of selling between subsidiaries to inflate prices artificially of packaging placebos as panaceas there was no apology implicit in their stance on the contrary the talk of illicit maneuvers of political allegiances bought and sold were positively applauded and among these manipulators whitehead was the kingpin in his presence they were reverential out of it as they jockeyed for position closest to his feet they were ruthless he could and did silence them with a halflifted hand his every word was venerated as if it fell from the lips of a messiah the charade amused marty mightily but applying the rule of thumb he had learned in prison he knew that in order to earn such devotion whitehead must have sinned more deeply than his admirers in cunning he didnt doubt whiteheads skills hed experienced his powers of persuasion already but as time went by the other question burned more brightly was he also a thief and if not that what was his crime ease she came to understand as she watched the runner from her window is all if not all it was the best part of what she delighted in watching him she didnt know his name though she could have inquired it pleased her more to have him anonymous an angel dressed in a gray track suit his breath a flux of mist at his lips as he ran shed heard pearl talk of the new bodyguard and presumed this was he did it really matter what his name was such details could only weigh down her mythmaking it was a bad time for her for many reasons and on those defeated mornings sitting at her window having scarcely slept the night before the sight of the angel running across the lawn or flickering between the cypress trees was a sign she clung to a portent of better times to come the regularity of his appearance was something she came to count on and when sleep was good and she missed him in the morning she felt an undeniable sense of loss for the rest of the day and would make a special point of keeping her rendezvous with him the next morning but she couldnt bring herself to leave the sunshine island to cross so many dangerous reefs to get to where he was even to signal her existence in the house to him risked too much she wondered if he was much of a detective if he was perhaps he had discovered her presence in the house by some witty means seen her cigarette stubs in the kitchen sink or smelled the scent of her in a room she had left scant minutes before or perhaps angels being divinities needed no such devices perhaps he simply knew without the clues that she was there standing behind the sky at a window or pressed behind a locked door when he went whistling down the corridor there was no use in reaching for him though even if she could have found the courage what would she have to say to him nothing and when inevitably he sighed his irritation with her and turned his back she would be lost in a nomansland isolated from the one place she felt secure that sunshine island that came to her out of a pure white cloud that place that poppies bled to give her youve eaten nothing today pearl chided it was a familar complaint youll waste away leave me be will you ill have to tell him you know no pearl carys gave pearl a pleading look dont say anything please you know how he gets ill hate you if you say anything pearl stood at the door with the tray disapproval on her face she wasnt about to crumble at the appeal or at the blackmail are you trying to starve yourself again she asked unsympathetically no i just dont have much appetite thats all pearl shrugged i dont understand you she said half the time you look suicidal today carys smiled radiantly its your life the woman said before you go pearl what tell me about the runner pearl looked bemused it wasnt like the girl to show any interest in goingson in the house she stayed up here behind locked doors and dreamed but today she was insistent the one who races himself every morning in the track suit who is he where was the harm in telling her curiosity was a sign of health and she had too little of either his names marty marty carys tried the name in her head and it fitted him fine the angels name was marty many what i cant remember carys stood up the smile had gone she had that hard look that she got when she really wanted something the corners of her mouth pulled down it was a look she shared with mr whitehead and it intimidated pearl carys knew that you know my memory pearl said apologetically i dont remember his surname well who is he your fathers bodyguard hes taken over from nick pearl replied hes an exprisoner apparently robbery with violence really and rather lacking in social graces marty strauss pearl said with a note of triumph martin strauss thats it there he was named carys thought there was a primitive power in naming someone it gave you a handle on a person martin strauss thank you she said genuinely pleased why do you want to know just wondered who he was people come and go well i think hes staying pearl said and left the room as she closed the door carys said does he have a middle name but pearl didnt hear it was strange to think the runner had been a prisoner still was a prisoner in a way racing around and around the grounds breathing in clear air breathing out clouds frowning as he ran perhaps hed understand more than the old man or toy or pearl what it felt like to be on the sunshine island and not know how to get off or worse to know how but never to dare it for fear of never getting back to safety now that she knew his name and his crimes the romance of his morning run wasnt spoiled by the information he still trailed glory but now she saw the weight in his body when previously shed seen only the lightness of his step she decided after an age of indecision that watching was not going to be enough as marty became fitter so he demanded more of himself during his morning run the circuit he made grew bigger though by now he was covering the larger distance in the same time as he had the shorter sometimes to add spice to the exercise hed plunge into the woods careless of the undergrowth and the low branches his even stride degenerating into an ad hoc collection of leaps and dashes on the other side of the wood was the weir and here if he was in the mood he might halt for a few minutes there were herons here three that hed seen it would soon be nesting time and they would presumably pair off he wondered what would happen to the third bird then would it fly off in search of its own mate or linger thinking adulterous thoughts the weeks ahead would tell some days fascinated by the way whitehead watched him from the top of the house hed slow as he passed by hoping to catch his face but the watcher was too careful to be caught and then one morning she was waiting at the dovecote for him as he made the long curve back toward the house and he knew at once that hed been wrong about it being the old man whod been spying this was the cautious observer at the upper window it was barely a quarter to seven in the morning and still chilly shed been waiting a while to judge by the flush on her cheeks and nose her eyes were shining with cold he stopped puffing out steam like a traction engine hello marty she said hello you dont know me no she hugged her duffle coat more tightly around her she was skinny and looked twenty at the most her eyes so dark a brown they looked black at three paces were in him like claws the ruddy face was wide and without makeup she looked he thought hungry he looked she thought ravenous youre the one from upstairs he ventured yes you didnt mind me spying did you she inquired guilelessly why should i she extended a slim gloveless hand to the stone of the dovecote its beautiful isnt it she said the building had never struck marty as even interesting before simply as a landmark by which to pace his run its one of the biggest dovecotes in england she said did you know that no ever been in he shook his head its a bizarre place she said and led the way around the barrelshaped building to the door she had some difficulty pushing it open the damp weather had swelled the wood marty had to double up to follow her inside it was even chillier there than out and he shivered the sweat on his brow and sternum cooling now hed stopped running but it was as she had promised bizarre just a single round room with a hole in the roof to allow the birds access and egress the walls were lined with square holes nesting niches presumably set in perfect rowslike tenement windowsfrom floor to roof all were empty judging by the absence of excrement or feathers on the floor the building had not been used in many years its forsakenness gave it a melancholy air its unique architecture rendered it useless for any function but that for which it had been built the girl had crossed the impacted earth floor and was counting the nesting niches around from the door seventeen eighteen he watched her back her hair was unevenly cropped at the nape of her neck the coat she wore was too big for her it wasnt even hers he guessed who was she pearls daughter shed stopped counting now she put her hand into one of the holes making a little noise of discovery as her fingers located something it was a hiding place he realized she was about to trust him with a secret she turned and showed him her treasure id forgotten till i came back in she said what i used to hide here it was a fossil or rather the fragment of one a spiral shell that had lain at the bottom of some precambrian sea before the world was green in its flutes which she was stroking motes of dust gathered it crossed martys mind watching the intensity of her involvement with this piece of stone that the girl was not entirely sane but the thought vanished when she looked up at him her eyes were too clear and too willful if she had any insanity in her it was invited a streak of lunacy she was pleased to entertain she grinned at him as if shed known what he was thinking cunning and charm were mixed in her face in equal parts are there no doves then he said no there havent been as long as ive been here not even a few if you just have a few they die in winter if you keep a full dovecote they all keep each other warm but when theres only a handful they dont generate enough heat and they freeze to death he nodded it seemed regrettable to leave the building empty they should fill it up again i dont know she said i like it like this she slipped the fossil back into her hideyhole now you know my special place she said and the cunning had gone it was all charm he was entranced i dont know your name carys she said then after a moment added its welsh oh he couldnt help staring at her she suddenly seemed embarrassed and she went back to the door quickly ducking out into the open air it had begun to rain a soft midmarch drizzle she put up the hood of her duffle coat he put up his tracksuit hood maybe youll show me the rest of the grounds he said not certain that this was the appropriate question but more certain that he didnt want this conversation to end here without some possibility of them meeting again she made a noncommittal noise by way of reply the corners of her mouth were tucked down tomorrow he said this time she didnt answer at all instead she started to walk toward the house he tagged along knowing their exchange would falter entirely if he didnt find some way to keep it alive its strange being in the house with no one to talk to he said that seemed to strike a chord its papas house she said simply we just live in it papa so she was his daughter now he recognized the old mans mouth on her those pincheddown corners that on him seemed so stoical and on her simply sad dont tell anyone she said he presumed she meant about their meeting but he didnt press her there were more important questions to ask if she didnt race away he wanted to signal his interest in her but he could think of nothing to say the sudden change in her tempo from gentle elliptical conversation to this staccato confounded him are you all right he asked she looked around at him and beneath her hood she seemed almost to be in mourning i have to hurry she said im wanted she picked up the pace of her step signaling only in the hunch of her shoulders a desire to leave him behind he obliged and slowed leaving her to go back to the house without a glance or a wave rather than return to the kitchen where hed have to endure pearls banter while he breakfasted he started back across the field giving the dovecote a wide berth until he reached the perimeter fence and punished himself with another complete circuit when he ran into the woods he found himself involuntarily scanning the ground underfoot looking for fossils two days later about eleventhirty at night he got a summons from whitehead im in the study he said on the phone id like a word with you the study though it boasted half a dozen lamps was almost in darkness only the cranenecked lamp on the desk burned and that threw its light onto a heap of papers rather than into the room whitehead was sitting in the leather chair beside the window on the table beside him was a bottle of vodka and an almost empty glass he didnt turn when marty knocked and entered but simply addressed marty from his vantage point in front of the floodlit lawn i think its time i gave you more leash strauss he said youve done a fine job so far im pleased thank you sir bill toy will be up here overnight tomorrow and so will luther so this might be an opportunity for you to go down to london it was eight weeks almost to the day since hed arrived at the estate and here at last was a tentative signal that his place was secure ive had luther sort out a vehicle for you speak to him about it when he arrives and theres some money on the desk for you marty glanced across at the desktop there was indeed a pile of notes there go on take it martys fingers fairly itched but he kept control of his enthusiasm itll cover petrol and a night in the city marty didnt count the notes simply folded them and pocketed them thank you sir theres an address there too yes sir take it the shop belongs to a man called halifax he supplies me with strawberries out of season will you pick up my order please of course thats the only errand i want you to run as long as youre back by midmorning saturday the rest of the times your own thank you whiteheads hand reached out for the glass of vodka and marty thought he was going to turn and look at him he didnt this interview was apparently over is that all sir all yes i think so dont you it was many months since whitehead had gone to bed sober hed started to use vodka as a soporific when the night terrors began at first just a glass or two to dull the edge of his fear then gradually increasing the dosage as with time his body became immune to it he took no pleasure in drunkenness he loathed putting his spinning head down on the pillow and hearing his thoughts whine in his ears but he feared the fear more now as he sat watching the lawn a fox stepped across the threshold of the floodlights blanched by the brilliant illumination and stared at the house its stillness lent it perfection its eyes catching the light gleamed in its pricked head it waited a moment only suddenly it seemed to sense dangerthe dogs perhapsand it turned tail and was gone whitehead still watched the spot it had disappeared from long after it had loped away hoping against hope that it would come back and share his solitude for a space but it had other business in the night there was a time when hed been a fox thin and sharp a night wanderer but things had changed providence had been bountiful dreams had come true and the fox always a shapechanger had grown fat and easy the world had changed too it had become a geography of profit and loss distances had shrunk to the length of his command he had forgotten with time his previous life but of late he remembered it more and more it came back in brilliant but reproachful detail when the events of the day before were a fog but he knew in his heart of hearts there was no way back to that blessed state and forward from here that was a journey into a hopeless place where no signpost would point him right or leftall directions being equal therenor would there be hill or tree or habitation to mark the way such a place such a terrible place but he wouldnt be alone there in that nowhere he would have a companion and when in the fullness of time he set his eyes on that land and its tenant he would wish oh christ how he would wish that he had stayed a fox iii the last european anthony breer the razoreater returned to his tiny flat in the late afternoon made himself instant coffee in his favorite cup then sat at the table in the failing light and started to tie himself a noose hed known from early morning that today was the day no need to go down to the library if in time they noticed his absence and wrote to him demanding to know where he was he wouldnt be answering besides the sky had looked as grubby as his sheets at dawn and being a rational man hed thought why bother to wash the sheets when the worlds so dirty and im so dirty and theres no chance of ever getting any of it clean the best thing is to put an end to this squalid existence once and for all hed seen hanged people aplenty only photographs of course in a book hed stolen from work about war crimes marked not for the open shelves to be issued only on request the warning had really got his imagination working here was a book people werent really meant to see hed slipped it into his bag unopened knowing from the very titlesoviet documents on nazi atrocitiesthat this was a volume almost as sweet in the anticipation as in the reading but in that hed been wrong mouthwatering as that day had been knowing that his bag contained this taboo treasure that delight was nothing compared to the revelations of the book itself there were pictures of the burnedout ruins of chekhovs cottage in istra and others of the desecration of the tchaikovsky residence but mostlyand more importantlythere were photographs of the dead some of them heaped in piles others lying in bloody snow frozen solid children with their skulls broken open people lying in trenches shot in the face others with swastikas carved into their chests and buttocks but to the razoreaters greedy eyes the best photographs were of people being hanged there was one breer looked at very often it pictured a handsome young man being strung up from a makeshift gallows the photographer had caught him in his last moments staring directly at the camera a wan and beatific smile on his face that was the look breer wanted them to find on his face when they broke down the door of this very room and found him suspended up here pirouetting in the breeze from the hallway he thought about how they would stare at him coo at him shake their heads in wonder at his pale white feet and his courage in doing this tremendous thing and while he thought he knotted and unknotted the noose determined to make as professional a job of it as he possibly could his only anxiety was the confession despite his working with books day in day out words werent his strongest point they slipped away for him like beauty from his fat hands but he wanted to say something about the children just so theyd know the people who found him and photographed him that this wasnt a nobody they were staring at but a man whod done the worst things in the world for the best possible reasons that was vital that they knew who he was because maybe in time theyd make sense of him in a way that hed never been able to they had methods of interrogation he knew even with dead people theyd lay him in an ice room and examine him minutely and when theyd studied him from the outside theyd start looking at his inside and oh what things theyd find theyd saw off the top of his skull and take out his brain examine it for tumors slice it thinly like expensive ham probe at it in a hundred ways to find out the why and how of him but that wouldnt work would it he of all people should know that you cut up a thing thats alive and beautiful to find out how its alive and why its beautiful and before you know it its neither of those things and youre standing there with blood on your face and tears in your sight and only the terrible ache of guilt to show for it no theyd get nothing from his brain theyd have to look further than that theyd have to unzip him from neck to pubis snip his ribs and fold them back only then could they unravel his guts and rummage in his stomach and juggle his liver and lights there oh yes there theyd find plenty to feast their eyes on maybe that was the best confession then he mused as he retied the noose one final time no use to try to find the right words because what were words anyway trash useless for the hot heart of things no theyd find all they needed to know if they just looked inside him find the story of the lost children find the glory of his martyrdom and theyd know once and for all that he was of the tribe of the razoreaters he finished the noose made himself a second cup of coffee and started work on getting the rope secure first he removed the lamp that hung from the middle of the ceiling then he tied the noose up there in its place it was strong he swung from it for a few moments to make certain of it and though the beams grunted a little and there was a patter of plaster on his head it bore his weight by now it was early evening and he was tired the fatigue making him more clumsy than usual he shunted around the room tidying it up his pigfat body wracked with sighs as he bundled up the stained sheets and tucked them out of sight rinsed his coffee cup and carefully poured away the milk so that it wouldnt curdle before they came he turned on the radio as he worked it would help to cover the sound of the chair being kicked over when the time came there were others in the house and he didnt want any lastminute reprieve the usual banalities from the radio station filled the room songs of love and loss and love found again vicious and painful lies all of them there was little strength left in the day once hed finished preparing the room he heard feet in the hallway and doors being opened elsewhere in the house as the occupants of the other rooms came home from work they like him lived alone he knew none of them by name none of them seeing him taken out escorted by police would know his he undressed completely and washed himself at the sink his testicles small as walnuts tight to his body his belly flabthe fat of his breasts and upper armsquivering as the cold convulsed him once satisfied with his cleanliness he sat on the mattress edge and cut his toenails then he dressed in freshly laundered clothes the blue shirt the gray trousers he wore no shoes or socks of the physique that shamed him his feet were his only pride it was almost dark by the time he finished and the night was black and rainy time to go he thought he positioned the chair carefully stepped up onto it and reached for the rope the noose was if anything an inch or two too high and he had to go on tiptoe to fit it snugly around his neck but he fitted it securely with a little maneuvering once he had the knot pulled tight against his skin he said his prayers and kicked the chair over panic began immediately and his hands which hed always trusted betrayed him at this vital juncture springing up from his sides and tearing at the rope as it tightened the initial drop had not broken his neck but his spine felt like a vast centipede sewn into his back writhing now every way it could causing his legs to spasm the pain was the least of it the real anguish came from being out of control smelling his bowels giving out into his clean trousers without his sayso his penis stiffening without a lustful thought in his popping head his heels digging the air looking for purchase fingers still scrabbling at the rope all suddenly not his own all too hot for their own preservation to hold still and die but their efforts were in vain hed planned this too carefully for it to go awry the rope was tightening still the cavortings of the centipede weakening life this unwelcome visitor would leave very soon there was a lot of noise in his head almost as though he was underground and hearing all the sounds of the earth rushing noises the roar of great hidden weirs the bubbling of molten stone breer the great razoreater knew the earth very well hed buried dead beauties in it all too often and filled his mouth with soil as penitence for the intrusion chewing on it as he covered over their pastel bodies now the earth noises had blotted out everythinghis gasps the music from the radio and the traffic outside the window sight was going too lace darkness crept over the room its patterns pulsing he knew he was turningthere was the bed now the wardrobe now the sinkbut the forms he fitfully saw were decaying his body had given up the good fight his tongue flapped perhaps or maybe he imagined the motion just as surely as he imagined the sound of somebody calling his name quite abruptly sight went out completely and death was on him no flood of regrets attended the ending no lightning regurgitation of a life history encrusted with guilt just a dark and a deeper dark and now a dark so deep night was luminous by comparison with it and it was over easily no not over not quite over a cluster of unwelcome sensations swarmed over him intruding on the privacy of his death a breeze warmed his face assaulting his nerve endings an ungracious breath choked him pressing into his flaccid lungs without the least invitation he fought the resurrection but his savior was insistent the room began to reassemble itself around him first light then form now color albeit drained and grimy the noisesfiery rivers and liquid stone alikewere gone he was hearing himself cough and smelling his own vomit despair mocked him could he not even kill himself successfully somebody said his name he shook his head but the voice came again and this time his upturned eyes found a face and oh it was not over far from it he had not been delivered into heaven or hell neither would dare boast the face he was now staring up into i thought id lost you anthony said the last european he had righted the chair breer had used to stand on for his suicide attempt and was sitting on it looking as unsullied as ever breer tried to say something but his tongue felt too fat for his mouth and when he felt it his fingers came back bloody you bit your tongue in your enthusiasm said the european you wont be able to eat or speak too well for a while but itll heal anthony everything heals given time breer had no energy to get up off the floor all he could do was lie there the noose still tight around his neck staring up at the severed rope that still depended from the light fixture the european had obviously just cut him down and let him fall his body had begun to shake his teeth were chattering like a mad monkeys youre in shock said the european you lie there ill make some tea shall i sweet tea is just the thing it took some effort but breer managed to haul himself off the floor and onto the bed his trousers were soiled front and back he felt disgusting but the european didnt mind he forgave all breer knew that no other man breer had ever met was quite so capable of forgiveness it humbled him to be in the company and the care of such easy humanity here was a man who knew the secret heart of his corruption and never once spoke a word of censure propped up on the bed feeling the signs of life reappearing in his wracked body breer watched the european making the tea they were very different people breer had always felt awed by this man yet hadnt the european told him once i am the last of my tribe anthony just as you are the last of yours we are in so many ways the same breer hadnt understood the significance of the remark when hed first heard it but hed come to understand in time i am the last true european you are the last of the razoreaters we should try to help each other and the european had gone on to do just that keeping breer from capture on two or three occasions celebrating his trespasses teaching him that to be a razoreater was a worthy estate in return for this education hed asked scarcely anything a few minor services no more but breer wasnt so trusting that he didnt suspect a time would come when the last europeanplease call me mr mamoulian he used to say but breer had never really got his tongue around that comical namewhen this strange companion would ask for help in his turn it wouldnt be an odd job or two hed ask either it would be something terrible breer knew that and feared it in dying he had hoped to escape the debt ever being called in the longer hed been away from mr mamoulianand it was six years since theyd last metthe more the memory of the man had come to frighten breer the europeans image had not faded with time quite the contrary his eyes his hands the caress of his voice had stayed crystalclear when yesterdays events had become a blur it was as if mamoulian had never quite gone as though hed left a sliver of himself in breers head to polish up his picture when time dirtied it to keep a watch on his servants every deed no surprise then that the man had come in when he had interrupting the death scene before it could be played out no surprise either that he was talking to breer now as though theyd never been parted as though he was the loving husband to breers devoted wife and the years had never intervened breer watched mamoulian move from sink to table as he prepared the tea locating the pot setting out the cups performing each domestic act with hypnotic economy the debt would have to be paid he knew that now there would be no darkness until it was paid at the thought breer began to sob quietly dont cry said mamoulian not turning from the sink i wanted to die breer murmured the words came out as though through a mouthful of pebbles you cant perish yet anthony you owe me a little time surely you must see that i wanted to die was all breer could repeat in response he was trying not to hate the european because the man would know hed feel it for certain and maybe lose his temper but it was so difficult resentment bubbled up through the sobbing has life been treating you badly the european asked breer sniffed he didnt want a father confessor he wanted the dark couldnt mamoulian understand that he was past explanations past healing he was shit on the shoe of a mongol the most worthless irredeemable thing in creation the image of himself as a razoreater as the last representative of a onceterrible tribe had kept his selfesteem intact for a few perilous years but the fantasy had long since lost its power to sanctify his vileness there was no possibility of working the same trick twice and it was a trick just a trick breer knew that and hated mamoulian all the more for his manipulations i want to be dead was all he could think did he say the words out loud he hadnt heard himself speak but mamoulian answered him as though he had of course you do i understand i really do you think its all an illusion tribes and dreams of salvation but take it from me it isnt theres purpose in the world yet for both of us breer drew the back of his hand across his swollen eyes and tried to control his sobs his teeth no longer chattered that was something have the years been so cruel the european inquired yes breer said sullenly the other nodded looking across at the razoreater with compassion in his eyes or at least an adequate impersonation of same at least they didnt lock you away he said youve been careful you taught me how breer conceded i showed you only what you already knew but were too confused by other people to see if youve forgotten i can show you again breer looked down at the cup of sweet milkless tea the european had set on the bedside table or do you no longer trust me things have changed breer mumbled with his thick mouth now it was mamoulians turn to sigh he sat on the chair again and sipped at his own tea before replying yes im afraid youre right theres less and less place for us here but does that mean we should throw up our hands and die looking at the sober aristocratic face at the haunted hollows of his eyes breer began to remember why hed trusted this man the fear hed felt was dwindling the anger too there was a calm in the air and it was seeping into breers system drink your tea anthony thank you then i think you should change your trousers breer blushed he couldnt help himself your body responded quite naturally theres nothing to be ashamed of semen and shit make the world go round the european laughed softly into his teacup and breer not feeling the joke to be at his expense joined in i never forgot you mamoulian said i told you id come back for you and i meant what i said breer nursed his cup in hands that still trembled and met mamoulians gaze the look was as unfathomable as hed remembered but he felt warm toward the man as the european said he hadnt forgotten he hadnt gone away never to return maybe he had his own reasons for being here now maybe hed come to squeeze payment out of a longstanding debtor but that was better wasnt it than being forgotten entirely why come back now he asked putting down his cup i have business mamoulian replied and you need my help thats right breer nodded the tears had stopped entirely the tea had done him good he felt strong enough to ask an insolent question or two what about me came the reply the european frowned at the inquiry the lamp beside the bed flickered as though the bulb was at crisis point and about to go out what about you he asked breer was aware that he was on tricky ground but he was determined not to be weak if mamoulian wanted help then he should be prepared to deliver something in exchange whats in it for me he asked you can be with me again the european said breer grunted the offer was less than tempting is that not enough mamoulian wanted to know the lamplight was more fitful by the moment and breer had suddenly lost his taste for impertinence answer me anthony the european insisted if youve got an objection voice it the flickering was worsening and breer knew hed made an error pressing mamoulian for a covenant why hadnt he remembered that the european loathed bargains and bargainers alike instinctively he fingered the noose groove around his neck it was deep and permanent im sorry he said rather lamely just before the lamp bulb gave out completely he saw mamoulian shake his head a tiny shake like a tick then the room was drowned in darkness are you with me anthony the last european murmured the voice normally so even was twisted out of true yes breer replied his lazy eyes werent becoming accustomed to the dark with their usual speed he squinted trying to sort out the europeans form in the surrounding gloom he neednt have troubled himself scant seconds later something across the room from him seemed to ignite and suddenly awesomely the european was providing his own illumination now with this lurid lantern show to set his sanity reeling tea and apologies were forgotten the dark life itself were forgotten and there was only time in a room turned inside out with terrors and petals to stare and stare and maybe if one had a sense of the ridiculous to say a little prayer alone in breers sordid oneroom flat the last european sat himself down and played solitaire with his favorite pack of cards the razoreater had dressed himself up and gone out to taste the night if he concentrated mamoulian could find the parasite with his mind and taste vicariously whatever experiences the other man was enjoying but he had no appetite for such games besides he knew all to well what the razoreater would be doing and it frankly revolted him all pursuits of the flesh whether conventional or perverse appalled him and as he grew older the disgust deepened on some days he could barely stand to look at the human animal without the roving gloss of its eye or the pinkness of its tongue awaking nausea in him but breer would be useful in the struggle to come and his bizarre desires gave him an insight albeit crude into mamoulians tragedy an insight that made him a more compliant attendant than the usual companions the european had tolerated in his long long life most of the men and women in whom mamoulian had placed his trust had betrayed him the pattern had repeated itself so often down the decades that he was sure he would one day become hardened to the pain such betrayals caused but he never achieved such precious indifference the cruelty of other peopletheir callous usage of himnever failed to wound him and though he had extended his charitable hand to all manner of crippled psyches such ingratitude was unforgivable perhaps he mused when this endgame was all over and done withwhen hed collected his debts in blood dread and nightthen maybe hed lose the terrible itch that tormented him day and night that drove him on without hope of peace to new ambitions and new betrayals maybe when all this was over he would be able to lie down and die the pack in his hand was pornographic he played with it only when he was feeling strong and only then alone handling the images of extreme sensuality was a test he set himself one that if he failed he would fail in private today the filth on the cards was after all just human depravity he could turn the designs over and not be distressed by them he even appreciated their wit the way each of the suits detailed a different area of sexual activity the spots incorporated into each intricately rendered picture hearts represented malefemale congress though by no means limited to the missionary position spades were oralist depicting simple fellatio and its mare elaborate variations clubs were analist the spot cards portraying homosexual and heterosexual buggery the court cards anal sex with animals diamonds the most exquisitely drawn of the suits were sadomasochistic and here the artists imagination had known no bounds on these cards men and women suffered all manner of humiliation their wracked bodies bearing diamondshaped wounds to designate each card but the grossest image in the pack was that of the joker he was a coprophiliac and sat down before a plateful of steaming excrement his eyes vast with greed while a scabby monkey its bald face horribly human bared its puckered backside to the viewer mamoulian picked up the card and studied the picture the leering face of the shiteating fool brought the bitterest of smiles to his bloodless lips this was surely the definitive human portrait the other pictures on the cards with their pretensions to love and physical pleasure only hid this terrible truth away for a while sooner or later however ripe the body however glorious the face whatever wealth or power or faith could promise a man was escorted to a table groaning under the weight of his own excrement and obliged even though his instincts might revolt to eat that was what he was here for to make a man eat shit he dropped the card onto the table and spat a barking laugh from his throat there would be such torment soon such terrible scenes no pit is deep enough he promised the room the cards and cups the whole dirty world no pit is deep enough iv skeleton dance the man in the underground train was naming constellations andromeda ursa the bear cygnus the swan his monologue was for the most part ignored though when a couple of young men told him to shut his trap he replied barely altering the rhythm of his naming with a smile and a youll die for that slipped between one star and the next the reply silenced the heckler and the lunatic went back to his skywatching toy took it as a good sign he was much preoccupied by signs these days though hed never really thought of himself as a superstitious man perhaps it was his mothers catholicism which hed rejected at an early age at last finding an outlet in place of the myths of virgin birth and transubstantiation he was finding significance in small coincidencesavoiding standing ladders and performing halfremembered rituals with spilled salt all this was quite recentonly the last year or twoand it had started with the woman he was even now going to meet yvonne it wasnt that she was a godfearing woman she wasnt but the consolation shed brought into his life brought with it the danger of its disappearance that was what made him cautious with ladders and respectful to salt the fear of losing her with yvonne in his life he had new reason to keep the fates friendly he had met her six years ago shed been a secretary then working with the uk branch of a german chemical corporation a sprightly goodlooking woman in her middle thirties whose formality hed guessed disguised humor and warmth in abundance hed been attracted to her from the beginning but his natural hesitancy in such matters and the considerable difference in their ages kept him from making any overtures eventually it was yvonne who broke the ice between them commenting on small things about his appearancea recent haircut a new tieand so making her interest in him perfectly plain once the signal had been given toy had proposed dinner and shed accepted it had been the beginning of the most rewarding months of toys life he was not an overly emotional man the very lack of extremes in his nature had made him a useful part of whiteheads entourage and he had nurtured his reserve as the salable commodity it was until by the time he met yvonne hed almost come to believe his own publicity she it was who first called him a cold fish she who taught him the importance of showing weakness if not to the world at large at least to intimates it had taken him time he was fiftythree when they met and this new way of thinking went against the grain but she persisted and slowly the melt began once it did he wondered how he had ever lived the life he had for the previous twenty years a life of servitude to a man whose compassion was negligible and ego monstrous he saw through yvonnes eyes the cruelty in whitehead the arrogance the mythmaking and though he showed he hoped no change in his superficial attitudes to his employer beneath the conciliation and the humility there increasingly simmered a resentment that approached hatred only now after six years could toy contemplate his own contradictory feelings about the old man and even now he found himself forgetting the worst at least when he was out of yvonnes sphere of influence it was so difficult when he was in the house subject to whiteheads whim to keep the perspective shed given him to see the sacred monster for what he was monstrous but far from sacred after twelve months toy had moved yvonne into the house whitehead had purchased for him in pimlico a retreat from the world of the whitehead corporation that the old man never inquired about a place where he and yvonne could talkor be silenttogether where he could indulge his passion for schubert and she could write letters to her family which was spread across half the globe that night when he got back he told her about the man on the train the constellation namer she found the whole story pointless couldnt see the romance of it at all i just thought it was strange he said i suppose it is she replied unimpressed and went back to her dinner preparations a few words on she stopped whats wrong billy why should something be wrong everythings fine yes really she was always quick to ferret out his secrets he gave up before she really began on him it wasnt worth the effort of deception he stroked the ridge of his broken nose a familiar trick when he was nervous then he said its all going to come down everything his voice trembled and fell away when it was clear he wasnt going to elaborate she put down the dinner plates and crossed to his chair he looked up almost startled when she touched his ear what are you thinking about she asked more gently than before he took hold of her hand there might come a time not so far away when id ask you to leave with me he said leave just up and go where i havent thought that through yet wed just go he halted and looked at her fingers which were now dovetailed with his would you come with me he asked at last of course ask no questions what is this billy i said ask no questions just go just go she looked long and hard at him he was washed out poor love too much of that wretched old fart in oxford how she hated whitehead though shed never met him yes of course id go she replied he nodded she thought he might cry when she said i dont know he tried to smile but it looked misbegotten perhaps it wont even be necessary but i think its all going to come down and when it does i dont want us to be there you make it sound like the end of the world he didnt reply she didnt feel able to chisel at him for answers he was too delicate just one question she ventured its important to me one did you do something billy i mean something illegal is that what it is his adams apple bobbed as he swallowed his grief there was so much more she had to teach him yet about allowing those feelings out he wanted to she could see so much bubbling away behind his eyes but there for now it would stay she knew better than to press him hed only withdraw and he needed her undemanding presence more than she needed answers its all right she said theres no need to tell me if you dont want to his hand was gripping hers so tightly she thought theyd never unknot them oh billy nothings that terrible she murmured again he made no reply the old haunts were much the same as marty had remembered them but he felt like a ghost there along the rubbishstrewn back alleys where hed fought and run as a boy there were new combatants and he suspected far more serious games they were glue sniffers these grubby tenyearolds according to the pages of the sunday tabloids they would grow up disenfranchised into needle freaks and pill pushers they cared for nothing and nobody least of all themselves hed been an adolescent criminal of course theft was a rite of passage here but it had usually been that lazy almost passive form of thieving sidling up to something and walking or driving away with it if the theft looked too problematic forget it plenty of other shiny things to be fingered it wasnt crime in the way hed come to understand the word later it was the magpie instinct at work taking whatever opportunity offered never intending much harm by it or working up a sweat if things didnt quite fall your way but these kidsthere was a group of them lounging on the corner of knox streetthey looked like a more lethal breed altogether though theyd grown up in the same lusterless environment he and they with its few wretched attempts at tree planting its barbed wire and glasstopped walls its relentless concretethough they shared all that he knew theyd have nothing to say to one another their desperation and their lassitude intimidated him he felt nothing was beyond them not a place to grow up in this street or any of them along the row in a way he was glad his mother had died before the worst of the changes disfigured the neighborhood he got to number twentysix it had been repainted on one of her visits charmaine had told him terry one of her brothersinlaw had done it for her a couple of years back but marty had forgotten and the change of color after so many years of imagining it green and white was a slap in the face it was a bad job purely cosmetic and the paint on the windowsills was lifting and peeling already through the window the lace curtains that hed always loathed so much had been replaced with a blind which was down on the window ledge inside a collection of porcelain figures wedding presents gathered dust trapped in the forsaken space between blind and glass he still had his keys but he couldnt bring himself to use them besides shed probably changed the lock instead he pressed the bell it didnt ring in the house and he knew it was audible from the street so it clearly no longer worked he rapped his knuckles on the door for half a minute there was no sound from inside then eventually he heard dragging footsteps and charmaine opened the door her face was not madeup and its nakedness made even plainer response to his standing there she was unpleasantly surprised marty was all she managed to say no welcoming smile no tears i came on the offchance he said attempting nonchalance but it was obvious that hed made a tactical error from the moment she sighted him i thought you werent allowed outshe said then corrected herself i mean you know i thought you werent allowed off the estate i asked for special dispensation he said can i come in or do we talk on the doorstep oh oh yes of course he stepped inside and she closed the door behind him there was an uncomfortable moment in the narrow hallway their proximity seemed to demand an embrace yet he felt unable and she unwilling to make the gesture she compromised with a patently artificial smile followed by a light kiss on the cheek im sorry she said apologizing for nothing in particular she led him down the hallway to the kitchen i just didnt expect you thats all come on in the place is in chaos im afraid the house smelled stale as though it needed a good airing washing drying on the radiators made the atmosphere muggy like the sauna back at the sanctuary take a seat she said lifting a bag of unsorted groceries off one of the kitchen chairs ill just finish here there was a second load of dirty washing on the kitchen tablehygienic as everwhich she began to load into the washing machine her chatter nervous her eyes never meeting his as she concentrated on the matter in hand the towels the underwear the blouses he recognized none of the clothes and found himself ferreting through the soiled items looking for something he had seen her in before if not six years before then in visits to the prison but it was all new stuff i just didnt expect you she was saying closing the machine and loading powder into it i was sure youd call first and look at me i look like a wet rag god it would be today ive got so much to do she finished with the machine pushed the sleeves of her sweater back up said coffee and turned to the kettle to make some without waiting for an answer you look well marty you really do how did she know shed scarcely taken two glances at him in her whirlwind of activity whereas he he couldnt take his eyes off her he sat watching her at the sink wringing out a cloth to swab down the counter and nothing had changed in six yearsnot reallyjust a few lines on their faces he had a feeling in him that was like panic something to be held down for fear it make a fool of him she made him coffee talked about the way the neighborhood had changed about terry and the saga of choosing the paint for the front of the house about how much it cost on the subway from mile end to wandsworth about how well he lookedyou really do marty im not just saying thatshe talked about everything but something it wasnt charmaine talking and that hurt hurt her too he knew she was marking time with him that was all it was filling the minutes with vacuous chat until he gave up in despair and left look she said i really must change going out yes oh if youd said marty i would have cleared a space why didnt you ring me maybe we could go out for a meal sometime he suggested maybe she was viciously noncommittal things are a bit hectic just at the moment id like a chance to talk you know properly she was getting edgy he knew the signs well and she was aware of his scrutiny she picked up the coffee mugs and took them to the sink i really must dash she said make yourself some more coffee if you want stuffs in thewell you know where it is theres a lot of things of yours here you know motorcycle magazines and stuff ill sort them out for you excuse me i have to change she hurriedpositively raced he thoughtinto the hallway and went upstairs he heard her moving about heavily she was never lightfooted water was running in the bathroom the toilet flushed he wandered through from the kitchen into the back room it smelled of old cigarettes and the ashtray balanced on the arm of the new sofa was brimming he stood in the doorway and stared at the objects in the room rather as he had at the dirty washing searching for something familiar there was very little the clock on the wall was a wedding present and still in the same place the stereo in the corner was new a flashy model that terry had probably acquired for her judging by the dust on the lid it was seldom used and the collection of records haphazardly stacked alongside was as small as ever among those records was there still a copy of buddy holly singing true love ways theyd played that so often it must have been worn thin theyd danced to it together in this very roomnot danced exactly but used the music as an excuse to hold each other as if excuses were needed it was one of those love songs that made him feel romantic and unhappy simultaneouslyas though every phrase of it was charged with loss of the very love it celebrated those were the best kind of love songs and the truest unable to bear the room any longer he went upstairs she was still in the bathroom there was no lock on the door shed been locked in a bathroom as a small child and had such a terror of the same thing happening again shed always insisted there be no locks on any of the internal doors in the house you had to whistle on the toilet if you wanted to stop people walking in on you he pushed the door open she was dressed only in her panties arm raised shaving her armpit she caught his eye in the mirror then went back to what she was doing i didnt want any more coffee he said lamely got used to the expensive stuff have you she said her body was a few feet from him and he felt the pull of it he knew every mole on her back knew the places a touch would make her laugh such familiarity was a kind of ownership he felt she owned him for the same reasons if she would just exercise her right he crossed to her and put his fingertips on her lower back and ran them up her spine charmaine she looked at him in the mirror againthe first unswerving look shed granted him since hed arrived at the houseand he knew that any hope of physicality between them was a lost cause im not available marty she said plainly were still married i dont want you to stay im sorry thats how shed begun this meeting with im sorry now she wanted to finish it in the same way no genuine apology intended just a polite brushoff ive thought about this so often he said so have i she replied but i stopped thinking about it five years ago it wont do any good you know that as well as i do his fingers were now on her shoulder he was sure there was a charge in their contact a buzz of excitement exchanged between her flesh and his her nipples had hardened perhaps the draft from the landing perhaps his touch id like you to go she said very quietly looking down into the sink there was a tremor in her voice that could easily become tears he wanted tears from her shameful as it was if she wept hed kiss her to console her and his consolation would harden as she softened and theyd finish up in bed he knew it that was why she was fighting so hard to show nothing knowing the scenario as well as he did and determined not to leave herself open to his affection please she said again with indisputable finality his hand dropped from her shoulder there was no spark between them it was all in his mind all ancient history maybe some other time he muttered the clichй as if it were poisoned yes she said pleased to sound a note of conciliation however lame ring me first though ill let myself out he wandered around for an hour dodging hordes of schoolchildren returning home picking fights and noses as they went there were signs of spring even here nature could scarcely be bountiful in such restraining circumstances but it did its best in tiny front gardens and in window boxes flowers blossomed the few saplings that had survived vandalism showed sweet green leaves if they survived a few more seasons of frost and malice they might grow large enough for birds to nest in nothing exotic brawling starlings at best probably but theyd offer shade in high summer and places for the moon to sit if you looked out your bedroom window one night he found himself full of such inappropriate thoughtsmoon and starlingslike an adolescent first in love coming back here had been a mistake it had been a selfinflicted cruelty that had hurt charmaine too useless to go back and apologize that would only make matters messier hed ring her as shed suggested and ask her out to one farewell dinner then hed tell her whether it was true or not that he was ready for them to part permanently and he hoped hed see her once in a while and theyd say goodbye in a civilized fashion without enmity and shed go back to whatever life she was making for herself and hed go to his to whitehead to carys yes to carys and suddenly tears were on him like a fury tearing him to pieces and he was standing in the middle of some street he didnt recognize blinded by them schoolchildren buffeted him as they ran past some turning some seeing his anguish and yelling obscenities at him as they went this is ridiculous he told himself but no amount of namecalling would halt the flow so he wandered hand to face into an alley and stayed there till the bout passed part of him felt quite removed from this burst of emotion it looked down this untouched part on his sobbing self and shook its head in contempt for his weakness and confusion he hated to see men cry it embarrassed him but there was no gainsaying it he was lost that was all there was to it lost and afraid that was worth crying for when the flow stopped he felt better but shaky he wiped his face and stayed in the backwater of the alley until hed regained his composure it was fourforty hed already been to holborn and picked up the strawberries that was his first duty when he drove into town now with that done and charmaine seen the rest of the night sprawled in front of him waiting to be pleasured but hed lost a lot of his enthusiasm for a night of adventure in a while the pubs would open and he could get a couple of whiskies inside him that would help rid him of the twitches in his stomach maybe it would also whet his appetite again but he doubted it to occupy the time before opening he wandered down to the shopping precinct it had been opened two years before he was put inside a soulless warren of white tiles plastic palms and flashy upmarket shops now almost a decade after it was built it looked about ready for demolition it was scarred with graffiti its tunnels and stairways filthy many of its shops closed up others so bereft of charm or custom surely the only option open to the owners was to fire them one of these nights collect the insurance and run for the hills he found a small newsstand manned by a forlorn pakistani bought a packet of cigarettes and retraced his steps to the eclipse it was just past opening time and the pub was almost deserted a couple of skinheads were playing darts in the lounge bar somebody was celebrating an offkey chorus of happy birthday dear maureen drifted through the television had been turned up for the earlyevening news but he couldnt catch much of it over the noise of the celebrants and wasnt that interested anyway collecting a whisky from the bar he went to sit down and began to smoke his way through the pack of cigarettes hed bought he felt drained the liquor instead of putting some spark into him only made his limbs more leaden his thoughts drifted free association of ideas brought images into peculiar communion carys and him and buddy holly that song true love ways playing in the dovecote while he danced with the girl in the chilly air when he shook the pictures from his head there were new customers at the bar a group of young men making enough noise braying laughter mostly to blank out both the sound of the television and the birthday party one of them was clearly the hub of the entertainment a lanky rubberjointed individual with a smile wide enough to play chopin on it took marty several seconds to register that he knew this clown it was flynn of all the people hed thought he might run into on this turf flynn was just about the last marty halfstood as flynns glancean almost magical coincidenceroved the room and fell on him marty froze like an actor whod forgotten his next move unable to advance or retreat he wasnt sure he was ready for a dose of flynn then the comedians face lit up with recognition and it was too late for retreat jesus fucking christ said flynn the grin faded to be replaced momentarily with a look of total bewilderment before returningmore radiant than ever look whos here will you and now he was coming toward marty arms outspread in welcome the loudest shirt man had ever created revealed beneath the wellcut jacket fucking hell marty marty they halfembraced halfshook hands it was a difficult reunion but flynn blustered over the cracks with a salesmans efficiency what do you know of all people of all people hello flynn marty felt like a dowdy cousin in front of this instant joy machine all quips and color flynns smile was immovably in place now and he was escorting marty across to the bar introducing the circle of his audience then it was a double brandy for everyone to celebrate martys homecoming didnt know you were out so soon flynn said toasting his victim heres to time off for good behavior the rest of the party made no attempt to interrupt the masters flow and took instead to talking among themselves leaving marty at flynns mercy hed changed very little the style of the clothes of course that was different he was dressed as ever as last years fashions demanded he was losing hair too receding at quite a rate but apart from that he was the same wisecracking faker hed always been laying out a sparkling collection of fabrications for marty to inspect his involvement with the music business his contacts in la his plans to open a recording studio in the neighborhood done a lot of thinking about you he said wondered how you were getting on meant to visit but i didnt think youd thank me for it he was right besides im never here you know so tell me old son what are you doing back i came to see charmaine oh he seemed almost to have forgotten who she was she ok soso you sound as if youre doing well ive had my hassles you know but then who hasnt im all right though you know he lowered his voice to the barely audible the big moneys in dope these days not grass the hard stuff i handle cocaine mostly occasionally the big h i dont like to touch it but ive got expensive tastes he pulled a what a world this is face turned to the bar to order more drinks then talked on a seamless train of selfinflation and offcolor remarks after some initial resistance marty found himself succumbing to him his tide of invention was as irresistible as ever only occasionally did he pause to ask a question of his audience which was fine by marty he had little he wanted to tell it had always been that way flynn the rude boy fast and smooth marty the quiet one the one with all the doubts like alter egos simply being with flynn again marty could feel himself flung into sharper relief the evening passed very quickly people joined flynn drank with him and wandered off again having been entertained by the court jester for a while there were some individuals marty knew among the traffic of drinkers and a few uncomfortable encounters but it was all easier than hed expected smoothed on its way by flynns bonhomie about tenfifteen he ducked out for a quarter of an hourjust got to sort out a little businessand came back with a wad of money in his inside pocket which he immediately began to spend what you need he told marty when they were both awash with drink what you need is a good woman no he giggled no no no what you need is a bad woman marty nodded his head felt unstable on his neck you got it in one he said lets go find us a lady eh shall we do that suits me i mean you need company man and so do i and i do a bit of that on the side you know ive got a few ladies available ill see you all right marty was too drunk to argue besides the thought of a womanbought or seduced what the hell did it matterwas the best idea hed heard in a long while flynn went away made a telephone call and came back leering no trouble he said no trouble at all one more drink then well hit the road lamblike marty followed his lead they had one more drink together then staggered out of the eclipse and around the corner to flynns car a volvo that had seen better days they drove for five minutes to a house on the estate the door was opened by a goodlooking black woman ursula this is my friend marty marty say hello to ursula hello ursula wheres the glasses honey daddy bought a bottle they drank some more together and then went upstairs it was only then that marty realized flynn wasnt going to leave this was intended to be mйnage а trois like the old days his initial disquiet vanished when the girl began to undress for them the drink had taken the edge off his inhibitions and he sat on the bed encouraging her in her strip dimly aware that flynn was probably as much entertained by his evident craving as he was by the girl let him watch marty thought its his party in the small badly lit bedroom ursulas body looked sculpted from black butter in between her full breasts a small gold cross lay glistening her skin glistened too each pore was marked with a pinprick of sweat flynn had started to undress as well and marty followed suit stumbling as he pulled off his jeans unwilling to relinquish the sight of the girl as she sat up on the bed and put her hands to her groin what followed was a swift reeducation in the craft of sex like a swimmer who returns to water after years of absence he soon remembered the strokes in the next two hours he gathered fistfuls of memories to take back with him looking around from ursulas amused face to see flynn kneeling at the bottom of the bed sucking her toes ursula cooing like a black dove over his erection before devouring it to the root flynn licking his hands and grinning and licking and grinning and finally the two of them sharing ursula flynn buried in her backside making true what as an elevenyearold he had claimed you did with women afterward they dozed together sometime in the middle of the night marty stirred to see flynn dressing and shrinking away home presumably wherever home was these days and nights he woke just before dawn disoriented for several seconds until he heard ursulas steady exhalations at his side he said goodbye to her as she dozed and found a cab to take him back to his car he was back at the sanctuary by eightthirty exhaustion would hit him eventually and a hangover too but he knew his body clock well thered be a few hours grace before the debt had to be paid pearl was in the kitchen tidying up after breakfast they exchanged a few pleasantries and he sat down to drink three cups of black coffee one after the other his mouth tasted foul and ursulas perfume which had smelled ambrosial the previous night was oversweet this morning it lingered on his hands and in his hair good night pearl asked he nodded without answering youd better get a good breakfast inside you i wont be able to get you any lunch today why not too busy with the dinner party what dinner party bill will tell you he wants to see you hes in the library toy looked weary but not as ill as he had when last theyd met maybe hed seen a doctor in the interim or taken a holiday you wanted to speak to me yes marty yes you enjoy your night on the town very much thank you for making it possible it wasnt my doing it was joe youre well liked marty lillian tells me even the dogs have taken to you toy crossed to the table opened the cigarette box and selected a cigarette marty had not seen him smoke before you wont be seeing mr whitehead today theres going to be a little gettogether tonight yes pearl told me its nothing special mr whitehead has dinners for a select few every now and then the point is he likes them to be private gatherings so you wont be required this pleased marty at least he could go lie down catch up on some sleep obviously wed like you to be in the house should you be needed for any reason but i think its unlikely thank you sir i think you can call me bill in private marty i dont see any need for formality any longer ok i mean he stopped to light the cigarette were all servants here arent we in one way or another by the time hed showered thought about a run and discounted the idea as masochistic then lain down to doze the first signs of the inevitable hangover were on the way there was no cure that he knew of the only option was to sleep it off he didnt wake until the middle of the afternoon and only then roused by hunger there was no sound in the house downstairs the kitchen was empty only the buzz of a fly at the windowthe first marty had seen this seasoninterrupted the glacial calm pearl had obviously finished whatever preparations were required for this evenings dinner party and gone perhaps to come back later he went to the refrigerator and rifled it for something to quieten his growling belly the sandwich he constructed looked like an unmade bed with sheets of ham tumbling out from its bread blankets but it did the job he put on the coffee percolator and went in search of company it was as though everyone had gone from the face of the earth wandering through the deserted house the pit of the afternoon swallowed him the stillness and the remains of his headache conspired to make him jittery he found himself glancing behind him like a man on an illlit street upstairs was even quieter than down his footsteps on the carpeted landing were so hushed he might not have had weight at all even so he found himself creeping halfway along the landingwhiteheads landingcame the cutoff point beyond which he had been instructed not to go the old mans private suite was this end of the house as was carys bedroom which room was it most likely to be he tried to recreate the outside of the house to locate the room by a process of elimination but he lacked the imaginative skill to correlate the exterior with the closed doors of the corridor ahead not all were closed the third along on his right was slightly ajar and from inside now his ears were attuned to the lowest level of audibility he could hear the sound of movement surely it was her he crossed the invisible threshold into forbidden territory not thinking of what the punishment for trespass might be too eager to see her face maybe to speak to her he reached the door and peered through carys was there she was semirecumbent on the bed staring into middle distance marty was just about to step in to speak to her when somebody else moved in the room hidden from him by the door he didnt have to wait for the voice to know that it was whitehead why do you treat me so badly he was asking her his voice hushed you know how it hurts me when youre like this she said nothing if she even heard him she made no sign of it i dont ask so much of you do i he appealed her eyes flickered in his direction well do i eventually she deigned to reply when she did her voice was so quiet marty could barely catch the words arent you ashamed she asked him there are worse things carys than having somebody need you believe me i know she replied taking her eyes off him there was such pain and such submission in the face of that pain in those two words i know it made marty suddenly sick with longing for her to touch her to try to heal the anonymous hurt whitehead crossed the room and came to sit beside her on the edge of the bed marty stepped back from the door fearful of being spotted but whiteheads attention was concentrated on the enigma in front of him what do you know he asked her the former gentility had suddenly evaporated are you keeping something from me just dreams she replied more and more of what you know the same your mother carys nodded almost invisibly and others she said who they never show themselves the old man sighed and looked away from her and in the dreams he asked what happens she tries to speak to me she tries to tell me something whitehead didnt inquire further he seemed to be out of questions his shoulders had slumped carys looked at him sensing his defeat where is she papa she asked him leaning forward for the first time and putting an arm around his neck it was a blatantly manipulative gesture she offered this intimacy only to get what she wanted from him how much had she offered or he taken in their time together her face came close to his the lateafternoon light enchanted it tell me papa she asked again where do you think she is and this time marty grasped the taunt that lay beneath the apparently innocent question what it signified he didnt know what this whole scene with its talk of coldness and shame meant was far from clear he was glad in a way not to know but this question that she asked him so mocklovingly had been askedand he had to wait a moment longer until the old man had answered it where is she papa in dreams he replied his face averted from her just in dreams she dropped her arm from his shoulder never lie to me she charged him icily its all i can tell you he replied his tone was almost pitiable if you know more than i do he turned and looked at her his voice urgent do you know something oh papa she murmured reproachfully more conspiracies how many feints and counterfeints were there in this exchange marty puzzled you dont suspect me now surely whitehead frowned no never you darling he said never you he raised his hand to her face and leaned forward to put his dry lips to hers before they touched marty left the door and slipped away there were some things he couldnt bring himself to watch cars began to arrive at the house in the early evening there were voices marty recognized in the hallway it would be the usual crowd he guessed among them the fandancer and his comrades ottaway curtsinger and dwoskin he heard womens voices too theyd brought their wives or their mistresses he wondered what kind of women they were once beautiful now sour and lovelorn bored with their husbands no doubt who thought more of moneymaking than of them he caught whiffs of their laughter and later of their perfume in the hallway hed always had a good sense of smell saul would be proud of him about eightfifteen he went into the kitchen and heated up the plate of ravioli pearl had left for him then retired into the library to watch a few boxing videos the events of the afternoon still niggled him try as he might he couldnt remove carys from his head and his emotional state over which he had so little control irritated him why couldnt he be like flynn who bought a woman for the night then walked away the next morning why did his feelings always become blurred so that he couldnt sort one from the other on the television set the match was getting bloodier but he scarcely registered the punishment or the victory his mind was conjuring carys sealed face as she lay on the bed probing it looking for explanations leaving the fight commentator to babble on he went through to the kitchen to fetch another couple of beers from the refrigerator at this end of the house there was not even a hint of noise from the partygoers besides such a civilized gathering would be hushed wouldnt it just the clink of cut glass and talk of rich mens pleasures well fuck them all he thought whitehead and carys and all of them it wasnt his world and he wanted no part of it or them or her he could get all the women he wanted anytimejust pick up the phone and call flynn no trouble let them play their damnfool games he wasnt interested he drained the first can of beer standing in the kitchen then got out two more cans and took them through to the lounge he was going to get really blind tonight oh yes he was going to get so drunk nothing would matter especially not her because he didnt care he didnt care the tape had finished and the screen had gone blank it buzzed with a squirming pattern of dots white noise wasnt that what they called it it was a portrait of chaos that hissing those writhing dots the universe humming to itself empty airwaves were never really empty he turned the set off he didnt want to watch any more matches his head buzzed like the box white noise in there too he slumped down in the chair and downed the second can of beer in two throatfuls the image of carys with whitehead swam into focus again go away he told it aloud but it lingered did he want her was that it would this unease be pacified if he took her to the dovecote one of these afternoons and humped her till she begged him never to stop the wretched thought only disgusted him he couldnt defuse these ambiguities with pornography as he opened the third beer he found his hands were sweating a clammy sweat he associated with sickness like the first signs of flu he wiped his palms on his jeans and put the beer down there was more than infatuation fueling his nervousness something was wrong he got up and went to the lounge window he was staring into the pitch darkness beyond the glass when it struck him what the wrongness might be the lights on the lawn and perimeter fence had not been put on tonight he would have to do it for the first time since hed arrived at the house it was real night outside a night more black than any hed experienced in many years in wandsworth there was always light floods on the walls burned from twilight to dawn but here without streetlamps there was just night outside night and white noise though marty had imagined otherwise carys wasnt at the dinner party there were very few freedoms left to her refusing her fathers invitations to dinner was one of them she had endured an afternoon of his sudden tears his just as sudden accusations she was weary of his kisses and his doubts so tonight shed given herself a larger fix than usual greedy for forgetfulness now all she wanted to do was lie down and bask in not being even as she lay her head on the pillow something or someone touched her she came around again startled the bedroom was empty the lamps were on and the curtains drawn there was nobody there it was a trick of the senses no more yet she could still feel the nerve endings at the nape of her neck tingle where the touch had seemed to come responding anemonelike to the intrusion she put her fingers there and massaged the place the jolt had snatched lethargy away for a while there was no chance of putting her head back down until her heart had stopped hammering sitting up she wondered where her runner was probably at the dinner party with the rest of papas court theyd like that to have him among them to condescend to she didnt think of him as an angel any longer after all he had a name now and a history hed long lost his divinity he was who he wasmartin francis straussa man with greengray eyes with a scar on his cheek and hands that were eloquent like an actors hands except that she didnt think hed be very good at professional deceit his eyes betrayed him too easily then the touch came again and this time she distinctly felt fingers catching her nape as though the bone of her spine had been pinched so so lightly between somebodys forefinger and thumb it was absurd illusion but too persuasive to be dismissed she sat down at her dressing table and felt tremors moving out through her body from her jittering stomach was this just the result of a bad fix shed never had any problems before the h that luther bought from his stratford suppliers was always of the highest quality papa could afford it go back and lie down she told herself even if you cant sleep lie down but the bed as she stood and turned to walk back to it receded from her all the contents of the room withdrawing into a corner as though they were painted on linen and had been plucked away from her by some hidden hand then the fingers seemed to be back on her neck again more insistent this time as if working their way into her she reached around and rubbed the back of her neck vigorously cursing luther loudly for bringing her bad stuff he was probably buying cut heroin instead of the pure and pocketing the difference her anger cleansed her head for a few moments or so it seemed for nothing else happened she walked steadily across to the bed orientating herself by putting her hand on the flowerpatterned wall as she went things began to right themselves the room found its proper perspective again sighing with relief she lay down without pulling back the covers and closed her eyes something danced on the inside of her lids shapes formed dispersed and reformed none of them made the least sense they were splashes and sprawls a lunatics graffiti she watched them with her minds eye mesmerized by their fluent transformations scarcely aware in her fascination that the invisible fingers had found her neck again and were insinuating themselves into her substance with all the subtle efficiency of a good masseur and then sleep she didnt hear the dogs begin to bark marty did at first just a solitary barking somewhere off to the southeast of the house but the alarm call was almost immediately taken up by a volley of other voices he got up boozily from in front of the dead television and went back to the window a wind had got up it had probably blown some dead branch down which had disturbed the dogs hed noticed several dead elms that needed felling in the corner of the estate probably one of those was the culprit still hed better look he went through to the kitchen and turned on the video screens flicking from camera to camera along the perimeter fence there was nothing to see as he flipped to the cameras just east of the woods however the pictures disappeared white noise replaced the sight of floodlit grass three cameras were out of action in all shit he said if a tree were down and that became a likelier option than ever if the cameras werent working hed have a clearingup job on his hands it was odd that the alarms hadnt started though any fall that had incapacitated three cameras must have breached the fences systems yet no bells rang no sirens wailed he took his anorak off the hook beside the back door picked up a flashlight and went outside the fence lights glimmered at the periphery of his vision scanning them quickly he could see none that were out he set off toward the racket of dogs it was a balmy night despite the wind the first confident warmth of spring he was glad to be going on a walkabout even if it was a fools errand it might not even be a tree at all simply an electrical fault nothing was infallible the house fell away behind him the lit windows diminished now all around him darkness he was isolated for two hundred yards between the lights of the fence and those of the house a strip of nomansland over which he stumbled flashlight inefficiently lighting the turf a few strides ahead of him in the woods the wind found an occasional voice otherwise there was silence eventually he reached the fence where he approximated the noise of the dogs to have come from all the lights in either direction were working there was no visible sign of disturbance despite the reassuring correctness of the scene something about it about the night and the balmy wind felt odd maybe the dark wasnt so benign after all the warmth in the air not entirely natural for the season a tick had begun in his stomach and his bladder was heavy with beer it was vexing that there were no dogs to be seen or heard either hed made an error of judgment in approximating their position or theyd moved from the spot pursuing or the absurd thought came pursued the lamps in the uprights of the fence rocked their hooded heads in a fresh gust of wind the scene danced giddily in the pitching light he decided he could go no further without relieving his aching bladder he turned off the flashlight pocketed it and unzipped back to the fence and the light it was a great relief to piss into the grass the physical satisfaction made him whoop halfway through the lights behind him flickered at first he thought it was simply a trick of the wind but no they were actually dimming even as they faded along the perimeter to his right the dogs began again anger and panic in their voices he couldnt stop pissing once hed started and for valuable seconds he cursed his lack of bladder control when he was done he zipped up and started to run in the direction of the din as he went the lights came back on again falteringly their circuits buzzing as they did so but they were set too infrequently along the line of the fence to offer much reassurance between them patches of darkness sprawled so that for one pace out of every ten all was clarity for the other nine night despite the fear clutching at his gut he ran allout the fence flickering past him light darkness light darkness ahead a tableau resolved itself an intruder was standing on the far side of a light pool thrown down by one of the lamps the dogs were everywhere at his heels at his chest snapping and tearing at him the man was still standing upright legs apart while they milled around him marty now realized how close he was to witnessing a massacre the dogs were berserk tearing at the intruder with all the fury they could muster curiously despite the venom in their attack their tails were between their legs and their low growls as they circled looking for another opening were unmistakably fearful job he saw was not even attempting to pounce he slunk around his eyes closed to slits watching the heroics of the rest marty started calling them off by name using the strong simple commands lillian had taught him stand saul stand dido the dogs were immaculately tutored hed seen them put through these exercises a dozen times now despite the intensity of their anger they relinquished their victim when they heard the command reluctantly they fell back ears flattened teeth exposed eyes clamped on the man marty started to walk steadily toward the intruder who was left standing in a ring of watchful dogs reeling and bloody he carried no visible weapon indeed he looked more like a derelict than a wouldbe assassin his plain dark jacket was torn in a dozen places by the attack and where his skin was exposed blood shone keep them off me he said his voice wounded there were bites all over his body in some places particularly his legs pieces of his flesh had been ripped away the middle finger of his left hand had been bitten through at the second joint and was depending by a thread of sinew blood splashed on the grass it amazed marty that the man was even standing upright the dogs still circled him ready to renew the assault if and when the order were granted one or two of them glanced at marty impatiently they were itching to finish their wounded victim off but the derelict wouldnt grant them a sign of his fear he only had eyes for marty and those eyes were pinpricks in livid white dont move marty said if you want to remain alive if you try to run theyll bring you down do you understand i havent got that much control over them the other said nothing simply stared his agony marty knew must be acute he wasnt even a young man his uneven growth of stubble showed more gray than black the skull behind the lax and waxen flesh was severe the features set on it used and weary tragic even his suffering was only apparent in the greasy sheen of his skin and the fixedness of his facial muscles his stare had the stillness of a hurricanes eye and its menace how did you get in marty asked get them away the man said he spoke as if he expected to be obeyed come back to the house with me the other shook his head unwilling even to debate the possibility get them away he said again marty conceded to the others authority though not certain why he called the dogs to him by name they came to heel with rebuking looks unhappy to surrender their prize now come back to the house marty said no need youll bleed to death for gods sake i loathe dogs the man said still not taking his eyes off marty we both do marty hadnt time to think clearly about what the man was saying he just wanted to stop the situation from escalating again blood loss had surely weakened the man if he fell down marty wasnt certain he could prevent the dogs from going in for the kill they were around his legs glancing up at him irritably their breath was hot on him if you dont come on your own accord ill take you no the intruder raised his injured hand to chest height and glanced down at it i dont need your kindnesses thank you he said he bit down on the sinew of the mutilated finger as a seamstress might through a thread the discarded joints fell to the grass then he clenched his seeping hand into a fist and thrust it into his ravaged jacket marty said christ almighty suddenly the lights along the fence were flickering again only this time they went out altogether in the sudden pitch saul whined marty knew the dogs voice and shared his apprehension whats happening boy he asked the dog wishing to god it could reply and then the dark broke something lit the scene that was neither electricity nor starlight the intruder was the source hed begun to burn with a faint luminescence light was dripping from his fingertips and oozing from the bloody holes in his coat it enveloped his head in a flickering gray halo that consumed neither flesh nor bone the light licking out of mouth and eyes and nostrils now it began to take on shapes or seemed to it was all seems phantoms sprang from the flux of light marty glimpsed dogs then a woman then a face all and yet perhaps none of these a flurry of apparitions that transformed before they congealed and in the center of these momentary phenomena the intruders eyes stared on at marty clear and cold then without a comprehensible cue the entertainment took on a different tone altogether a look of anguish slid across the fabricators face a drool of bloody darkness spilled from his eyes extinguishing whatever played in the vapor leaving only bright worms of fire to trace his skull then they too went out and just as suddenly as the illusions had appeared they were gone and there was just a torn man standing beside the humming fence the lights were coming back on again their illumination so flat it drained any last vestige of magic marty looked at the bland flesh the empty eyes the sheer drabness of the figure in front of him and believed none of it tell joseph said the intruder it had all been trickery of some kind tell him what that i was here but if it was just trickery why didnt he step forward and apprehend the man who are you he asked just tell him marty nodded he had no courage left in him then go home home away from here the intruder said out of harms way he turned from marty and the dogs and as he did so the lights faltered and failed for several dozen yards in either direction when they came back on again the magician had gone is that all he said as ever whitehead had his back to marty as he spoke and it was impossible to gauge his response to the account of the nights events marty had offered a carefully doctored description of what had actually happened hed told whitehead about his hearing the dogs and about the chase and the brief conversation hed had with the intruder what hed left out was the part that he couldnt explain the images the man had seemingly conjured from his body that he made no attempt to describe or even report hed simply told the old man that the lights along the fence had failed and that under the cover of darkness the intruder had made off it made a lame finale to the encounter but he had no powers to improve on his story his mind still juggling the visions of the previous night was too uncertain of objective truth to contemplate a more elaborate lie he hadnt slept for over twentyfour hours now hed spent the bulk of the night checking the perimeter scouring the fence for the place the intruder had breached there was no break in the wire however either the man had slipped into the grounds when the gates were opened for one of the guests cars which was plausible or else he had scaled the fence disregarding an electric charge that would have struck most men dead having seen the tricks the man was capable of marty was not about to discount this second scenario after all this same man had rendered the alarms inoperativeand somehow drained the lights of power along the stretch of fence how hed achieved these feats was anybodys guess certainly scant minutes after the mans disappearance the entire system was fully operational again the alarms working and the cameras functioning all around the boundary once hed checked the fences thoroughly hed gone back into the house and sat in the kitchen to reconstruct every detail of what hed just experienced about four in the morning hed heard the dinner party break up laughter the slamming of car doors hed made no move to report the breakin then and there there was he reasoned no use in souring whiteheads evening he just sat and listened to the noise of people at the other end of the house their voices were incoherent smears as if he were underground and they above and while he listened drained after his adrenaline high memories of the man at the fence flickered in front of him he told none of this to whitehead just the plainest outline of events and those few words tell him that i was here it was enough was he badly hurt whitehead said not turning from the window he lost a finger as i said and he was bleeding pretty badly in pain would you say marty hesitated before replying pain was not the word he wanted to employ not pain as he understood it but if he used some other word like anguishsomething that hinted at the gulfs behind the glacial eyeshe risked trespass into areas he was not prepared to go especially not with whitehead he was certain that if he once let the old man sense any ambivalence the knives would be out so he replied yes he was in pain and you say he bit the finger off yes maybe youd look for it later i have i think one of the dogs must have taken it did whitehead chuckle to himself it sounded so dont you believe me marty said taking the laughter to be at his expense of course i believe you it was only a matter of time before he came you know who he is yes then you can have him arrested the private amusement had stopped the words that followed were colorless this is no conventional trespasser strauss as im sure youre aware the man is a professional assassin of the first rank he came here with the express purpose of killing me with your intervention and that of the dogs he was prevented but he will try again all the more reason to have him found sir no police force in europe could locate him if hes a known assassin marty said pressing the point his refusal to let this bone go until he had the marrow from it had begun to irritate the old man he growled his reply hes known to me perhaps to a few others who have encountered him down the years but thats all whitehead crossed from the window to his desk unlocked it and brought out something wrapped in cloth he laid it on the polished desktop and unwrapped it it was a gun youll carry this with you at all times in future he told marty pick it up it wont bite marty took the gun from the desk it was cold and heavy have no hesitation strauss this man is lethal marty passed the gun from hand to hand it felt ugly problem whitehead inquired marty chewed on his words before speaking them its only well im on parole sir im supposed to be obeying the letter of the law now you give me a gun and tell me to shoot on sight i mean im sure youre right about him being an assassin but i dont think he was even armed whiteheads expression hitherto impartial changed as marty spoke his teeth showed yellow as he snapped his reply youre my property strauss you concern yourself with me or you get to hell out of here tomorrow morning me he jabbed finger at his own chest not yourself forget yourself marty swallowed a throatful of possible retorts none were polite you want to go back to wandsworth the old man said all signs of anger had disappeared the yellow teeth were sheathed do you no of course not you can go if you want just say the word i said no sir then you listen the old man said the man you met last night means me harm he came here to kill me if he comes againand he willi want you to return the compliment then well see wont we boythe teeth showed again a foxs smile oh yes well see carys woke feeling seedy at first she remembered nothing of the previous night but she gradually began to recall the bad trip that shed undergone the room like a living thing the phantom fingertips that had pluckedoh so gentlyat the hairs on the nape of her neck she couldnt remember what had happened when the fingers had delved too deep had she lain down was that it yes now she remembered she had lain down it was only then when her head hit the pillow and sleep claimed her that the bad times had really begun not dreams at least not like shed had before thered been no theatrics no symbols no fugitive memories weaving between the horrors there had been nothing at all and that had been the terror she had been delivered into a void void it was just a dead word when she spoke it aloud it didnt begin to describe the place shed discovered its emptiness more immaculate the terrors it awoke more atrocious the hope of salvation in its deeps more fragile than in any place she had ever guessed at it was a legendary nowhere beside which every other dark was blindingly bright every other despair she had endured a mere flirtation with the pit not the pit itself its architect had been there too she remembered something of his mild physiognomy which had convinced her not a jot see how extraordinary this emptiness is he had boasted how pure how absolute a world of marvels cant compare can never hope to compare with such sublime nothingness and when she awoke the boasts remained it was as if the vision were true while the reality she now occupied was a fiction as if color and shape and substance were pretty distractions designed to paste over the fact of this emptiness he had shown her now she waited scarcely aware of time passing occasionally stroking the sheet or feeling the weave of the carpet under her bare feet waiting in despair for the moment it all peeled back and the void appeared again to devour her well she thought ill go to the sunshine island if ever she deserved to play there awhile she deserved it now having suffered so much but something soured the thought wasnt the island a fiction too if she went there now wasnt she weaker next time the architect came void in hand her heart started to beat very loudly in her ears who was there to help her nobody who understood just pearl with her accusing eyes and her sly contempt and whitehead content to feed her h as long as it kept her compliant and marty her runner sweet in his way but so naively pragmatic she could never begin to explain the complexities of the dimensions she lived in he was a oneworld man he would look at her bewildered trying to understand and failing no she had no guides no signposts it would be better if she went back the way she knew back to the island it was a chemical lie and it killed with time but life killed in time didnt it and if dying was all there was didnt it make sense to go to it happy rather than fester in a dirty hole of a world where the void whispered at every corner so when pearl came upstairs with her h she took it thanked her politely and went to the island dancing fear could make the world go round if its wheels were efficiently oiled marty had seen the system in practice at wandsworth a hierarchy built upon fear it was violent unstable and unjust but perfectly workable seeing whitehead the calm still center of his universe so changed by fear so sweaty so full of panic had come as an unwelcome shock marty had no personal feelings for the old manor none that he was aware ofbut hed seen whiteheads species of integrity at work and had profited by it now he felt the stability he had come to enjoy was threatened with extinction already the old man was clearly withholding informationperhaps pivotal to martys understanding of the situationabout the intruder and his motives in place of whiteheads previous plain talking there was innuendo and threats that was his prerogative of course but it left marty with a guessing game on his hands one point was unarguable whatever whitehead claimed the man at the fence had been no conventional hired killer several inexplicable things had happened at the fence the lights had waxed and waned as if on cue the cameras had mysteriously failed when the man had appeared the dogs had registered this riddle too why else had they shown such a confusion of anger and apprehension and there remained the illusionsthose airburning pictures no sleight of hand however elaborate could explain them satisfactorily if whitehead knew this assassin as well as he claimed then he must know the mans skills too he was simply too afraid to talk about them marty spent the day asking the discreetest of questions around the house but it rapidly became apparent that whitehead had said nothing of the events to pearl lillian or luther this was odd surely now was the very time to make everyone more vigilant the only person to suggest he had any knowledge of the nights events was bill toy but when marty raised the subject he was evasive i realize youve been put in a difficult situation marty but so are we all at the moment i just feel i could do the job better if you knew the facts yes well i think you have to concede that joe knows best he made a rueful face we should all have that tattooed on our hands dont you think joe knows best i wish i could tell more i wish i knew more i think its probably easiest for all concerned if you let the matter drop he gave me a gun bill i know and he told me to use it toy nodded he looked pained by all of this even regretful these are bad times marty were all all having to do a lot of things we dont want to believe me marty did believe him he trusted toy sufficiently to know that if thered been anything he could say on the subject it would have been said it was entirely possible that toy didnt even know who had broken the seal on the sanctuary if it was some private confrontation between whitehead and the stranger then maybe a full explanation could only come from the old man himself and that would clearly not be forthcoming marty had one final interviewee carys he hadnt seen her since hed trespassed on the upper landing the day before what hed seen between carys and her father had unsettled him and there was he knew a childish urge in him to punish her by withholding his company now he felt obliged to seek her out however uncomfortable the meeting might prove he found her that afternoon loitering in the vicinity of the dovecote she was wrapped up in a fur coat that looked as if it had been bought at a thrift shop it was several sizes too big for her and motheaten as it was she seemed overdressed the weather was warm even if the wind was gusty and the clouds that passed across a wedgwoodblue sky carried little threat too small too white they were april clouds containing at worst a light shower carys she fixed him with eyes so ringed with tiredness his first thought was that they were bruised in her hand she had a bundle rather than a bunch of flowers many still buds smell she said proffering them he sniffed at them they were practically scentless they just smelled of eagerness and earth cant smell much good she said i thought i was losing my senses she let the bundle drop to the ground impatient with them you dont mind if i interrupt do you she shook her head interrupt all you like she replied the strangeness of her manner struck him more forcibly than ever she always spoke as though she had some private joke on her mind he longed to join in the game to learn her secret language but she seemed so sealed up an anchorite behind a wall of sly smiles i suppose you heard the dogs last night he said i dont remember she replied frowning maybe did anybody say anything to you about it why should they i dont know i just thought she put him out of his discomfort with a fierce little nod of her head yes if you want to know pearl told me theres been an intruder and you scared him off is that right you and the dogs me and the dogs and which of you bit off his finger had pearl told her about the finger too or was it the old man whod vouchsafed that vicious detail had they been together today in her room he canceled the scene before it flared up in his head did pearl tell you that he said i havent seen the old man she replied if thats what youre driving at his thought encapsulated it was eerie she even used his phraseology the old man she called him not papa shall we walk down to the lake she suggested not really seeming to care one way or the other sure you were right about the dovecote you know she said its ugly when its empty like this i never thought of it like that before the image of the deserted dovecote genuinely seemed to unnerve her she shivered even in the thick coat did you run today she asked no i was too tired was it that bad was what that bad last night he didnt know how to begin to answer yes of course it had been bad but even if he trusted her enough to describe the illusion hed seenand he was by no means sure he didhis vocabulary was woefully inadequate carys paused as they came in sight of the lake small white flowers starred the grass beneath their feet marty didnt know their names she studied them as she said is it just another prison marty what being here she had her fathers skill with non sequiturs he hadnt anticipated the question at all and it threw him nobody had really asked him how hed felt since arriving certainly not beyond a superficial inquiry as to his comfort perhaps consequently he hadnt really bothered to ask himself his answerwhen it camecame haltingly yes i suppose its still a prison i hadnt really thought i mean i cant just up and leave anytime i want to can i but it doesnt compare with wandsworthagain his vocabulary failed himthis is just another world he wanted to say he loved the trees the size of the sky the white florets they stepped through as they walked but he knew such utterances would sound leaden out of his mouth he hadnt got the knack of that kind of talk not like flynn who could babble instant poetry as though it were a second tongue irish blood he used to claim to explain this loquacity all marty could say was i can run here she murmured something he failed to catch perhaps just assent whatever his answer seemed to satisfy her and he could feel the anger hed started out with the resentment at her clever talk and her secret life with papa dissolving do you play tennis she asked again out of nowhere no i never have like to learn she suggested halflooking around at him and grinning i could teach you when the weather gets warmer she looked too frail for any strenuous exercise living on the edge all the time seemed to weary her though on the edge of what he didnt know you teach me ill play he said happy with the bargain thats a deal she asked a deal and her eyes he thought are so dark ambiguous eyes that dodge and skim sometimes and sometimes when you least expect it look at you with such directness youre sure shes stripping your soul and he isnt handsome she thought hes too used to be that and he runs to keep himself fit because if he stopped hed get flabby hes probably a narcissist i bet he stands in front of the mirror every night and looks at himself and wishes he was still a prettyboy instead of being solid and somber she caught a thought from him her mind reaching up easily up above her head and snatching it out of the air she did it all the timeto pearl to her fatheroften forgetting that other people lacked the skill to pry with such casualness the thought she had snatched was i would have to learn to be gentle that or something like it he was afraid shed bruise for christs sake that was why he was all dammed up when he was with her so circuitous in his dealings im not going to break she said and a patch of skin at his neck blushed im sorry he answered she wasnt sure if he was conceding his error or simply hadnt understood her observation theres no need to handle me with kid gloves i dont want that from you i get it all the time he threw her a disconsolate glance why didnt he believe what she told him she waited hoping for some clue but none was offered however tentative theyd come to the weir that fed the lake it was high and fast people had drowned in it shed been told as recently as a couple of decades ago just before papa had bought the estate she started to explain all this and about a coach and horses that had been driven into the lake during a storm telling him without listening to herself working out how to get past his courtesy and his machismo to the part of him that might be of use to her and the coach is still in there he asked staring into the threshing water presumably she said the story had lost its charm already why dont you trust me she asked him straight out he didnt reply but he was clearly struggling with something the frown of puzzlement he displayed deepened to dismay damn she thought ive really spoiled things somehow but it was done shed asked him outright and she was ready to take the bad news whatever it was almost without planning the theft she stole another thought from him and it was shockingly clear like living it through his eyes she saw the door of her bedroom and her lying on the bed beyond it glassyeyed with papa sitting close by when was this she wondered yesterday the day before had he heard them talking about it was that what woke such distaste in him hed played the detective and he hadnt liked what hed discovered im not very good with people he said answering her question about trust i never have been how he squirmed rather than tell the truth he was being obscenely polite with her she wanted to wring his neck you spied on us she said with brutal plainness thats all it is isnt it you saw papa and me together she tried to frame the remark as if it were a wild guess it didnt quite convince as such and she knew it but what the hell it was said now and he would have to invent his own reasons as to how shed reached that conclusion what did you overhear she demanded but got no response it wasnt anger that tonguetied him but shame for his peeping the blushing had infected his face from ear to ear he treats you like he owns you he murmured not takinghis eyes off the roiling water he does in a way why im all hes got hes alone yes and afraid does he ever let you leave the sanctuary ive got no desire to go she said ive got all i want here he wanted to ask her what she did for bed companions but hed embarrassed himself enough as it was she found the thought anyway and fast upon the thought the image of whitehead leaning forward to kiss her perhaps it was more than a fatherly kiss though she tried not to think of that possibility too often she could not avoid its presence marty was more acute than shed given him credit for hed caught that subtext subtle as it was i dont trust him he said he took his gaze off the water to look around at her his bewilderment was perfectly apparent i know how to handle him she replied ive made a bargain with him he understands bargains he gets me to stay with him and i get what i want which is now she looked away the spume off the whipping water was a grubby brown a little sunshine she finally replied i thought that came free marty said puzzled not the way i like it she answered what did he want from her apologies if so hed be disappointed i should get back to the house he said suddenly she said dont hate me marty i dont he came back theres a lot of us the same the same belonging to him another ugly truth she was positively brimful of them today you could get the hell out of here if you really wanted to couldnt you he said peevishly she nodded i suppose i could but where the question made no sense to him there was an entire world outside the fences and she surely didnt lack the finances to explore it not joseph whiteheads daughter did she really find the prospect so stale they made such a strange pair he with his experience so unnaturally abbreviatedyears of his life wastedand now anxious to make up for lost time she so apathetic fatigued by the very thought of escape from her selfdefined prison you could go anywhere he said thats as good as nowhere she replied flatly it was a destination that remained much on her mind she glanced across at him hoping some light would have dawned but he didnt show a glimmer of comprehension never mind she said are you coming no i think ill stay here for a while dont throw yourself in cant swim eh she replied testily he frowned not understanding doesnt matter i never took you for a hero he left her standing inches from the edge of the bank watching the water what hed told her was true he wasnt good with people but with women he was even worse he should have taken the cloth the way his mother had always wanted him to that would have solved the problem except that he had no grasp of religion either and never had maybe that was part of the problem between him and the girl they neither of them believed a damn thing there was nothing to say there were no issues to debate he glanced around carys had walked a short way along the bank from the spot where hed left her the sun glared off the skin of the water and burned into her outline it was almost as if she wasnt real at all part three deuce deuce n the two at dice or cards state of score at which either party must gain two consecutive points or games to win deuce n plague mischief the devil v superstition less than a week after the talk at the weir the first hairline cracks began to appear in the pillars of the whitehead empire they rapidly widened spontaneous selling began on the worlds stock markets a sudden failure of faith in the empires credibility crippling losses in share values soon mounted the selling fever once contracted appeared wellnigh incurable in the space of a day there were more visitors to the estate than marty had ever seen before among them of course the familiar faces but this time there were dozens of others financial analysts he presumed japanese and european visitors mingled with the english until the place rang with more accents than the united nations the kitchen much to pearls irritation became an impromptu meeting place for those not immediately required at the great mans hand they gathered around the large table demanding coffee in endless supply to debate the strategies they had congregated here to formulate much of their debating as ever was lost on marty but it was clear from the snippets he overheard that the corporation was facing no explicable emergency there were falls of staggering proportions happening everywhere talk of government intervention to prevent imminent collapse in germany and sweden talk too of the sabotage that had instigated this catastrophe it seemed to be the conventional wisdom among these prophets that only an elaborate planone that had been in preparation for several yearscould have damaged the fortunes of the corporation so fundamentally there were murmurs of secret government interference of a conspiracy of the competition the paranoia in the house knew no bounds there was something about the way these men fretted and fought hands carving up the air in their efforts to contradict the previous speakers remarks that struck marty as absurd after all they never saw the billions they lost and gained or the people whose lives they so casually rearranged it was all an abstraction numbers in their heads marty couldnt see the use of it to have power over notional fortunes was just a dream of power not power itself on the third day with everyone drained of gambits and praying now for a resurrection that showed no sign of coming marty encountered bill toy engaged in a heated debate with dwoskin to his surprise toy seeing marty passing by called him across cutting the conversation short dwoskin hurried away scowling leaving toy and marty to talk well stranger said toy and how are you doing im ok marty said toy looked as if he hadnt slept in a long while and you ill survive any idea of whats going on toy offered a wry smile not really he said ive never been a moneyman hate the breed weasels everyones saying its a disaster oh yes he said with equanimity i think it probably is martys face fell hed been hoping for some words of reassurance toy caught his discomfort and its origins nothing terribles going to happen he said as long as we stay levelheaded youll still be in a job if thats what youre worried about it did cross my mind dont let it toy put his hand on martys shoulder if i thought things looked that bad id tell you i know i just get jittery who doesnt toy tightened his grip on marty what say the two of us go on the town when the worst of this is over id like to ever been to the academy casino never had the money ill take you well lose some of joes fortune for him eh sounds good to me the anxiety still lingered on martys face look said toy its not your fight you understand me whatever happens from now on it wont be your fault weve made some mistakes along the way and now weve got to pay for them mistakes sometimes people dont forgive marty all thismarty spread a hand to take in the whole circusbecause people dont forgive take it from me its the best reason in the world it struck marty that toy had become an outsider of late that he wasnt the pivotal figure in the old mans worldview that he had been did that explain the sour look that had crept across his weary face do you know whos responsible marty asked what do boxers know toy said with an unmistakable trace of irony and marty was suddenly certain the man knew everything the panic days stretched into a week without any sign of letup the faces of the advisers changed but the smart suits and the smart talk remained the same despite the influx of new people whitehead had become increasingly laxer with his security arrangements marty was required to be with the old man less and less the crisis seemed to have put all thoughts of assassination out of papas head the period was not without its surprises on the first sunday curtsinger took marty aside and undertook a labored seduction speech that began with boxing moved laterally to the pleasures of intermale physicality and ended up with a straight cash offer just half an hour nothing elaborate marty had guessed what was in the air several minutes before curtsinger came clean and had prepared a suitably polite refusal they parted amicably enough such diversions aside it was a listless time the rhythm of the house had been broken and it was impossible to establish a fresh one the only way marty could preserve his sanity was by keeping out of the house as much as he could he ran a great deal that week often chasing his tail around and around the perimeter of the estate until an exhaustion fugue set in and he could go back to his room threading his way through the welldressed dummies who loitered in every corridor upstairs behind a door that he happily locked he would shower and sleep for long hours the deep dreamless sleep he enjoyed carys had no such liberty since the night the dogs had found mamoulian she had taken it into her head on occasion to play the spy why this was she wasnt certain shed never been much interested in goingson at the sanctuary indeed shed actively avoided contact with luther and curtsinger and all the rest of her fathers cohorts now however strange imperatives stirred her without warning to go into the library or into the kitchen or the garden and simply watch she got no pleasure out of this activity much that she heard she found impossible to understand much more was simply the vacuous gossip of financial fishwives nevertheless she would sit for hours until some vague appetite was satisfied and then shed move on perhaps to listen in on another debate some of the conversationalists knew who she was to those who didnt she offered the plainest of introductions once her credentials had been established nobody questioned her presence she also went to see lillian and the dogs at that dispiriting compound behind the house it wasnt because she liked the animals she simply felt impelled to see them for the sake of seeing to look at the locks and the cages and at the pups playing around their mother in her mind she charted the position of the kennels relative to the fence and to the house pacing it out in case she needed to find them in the dark why she would ever need that facility escaped her in these trips she was careful not to be seen by martin or toy or worst of all her father it was a game she was playing though its precise purpose was a mystery maybe she was making a map of the place was that why she walked from one end of the house to the other several times checking and rechecking its geography working out the length of the corridors memorizing the way the rooms let on to each other whatever the reason this foolish business answered some unspoken need in her and when it was done and only then would that need pronounce itself satisfied and let her be for a while by the end of the week she knew the house as she never had before shed been in every room except that one room of her fathers which was forbidden even to her she had checked all the entrances and exits stairways and passages with the thoroughness of a thief strange days strange nights was this insanity she began to wonder on the second sundayeleven days into the crisismarty was summoned to the library whitehead was there looking somewhat tired perhaps but not substantially cowed by the enormous pressure he was under he was dressed for the outdoors the furcollared coat hed worn the first day on that symbolic visit to the kennels i havent left the house in several days marty he announced and my heads getting stale i think we should take a walk you and i ill fetch a jacket yes and the gun they headed out the back way avoiding the newly arrived delegations who still thronged the stairs and hallway waiting for access to the holy of holies it was a balmy day the nineteenth of april the shadows of lightheaded clouds passed across the lawn in dissolute troupes well go to the woods the old man said leading off marty walked a respectful couple of yards behind acutely aware that whitehead had come out here to clear his mind not to talk the woods were buzzing with activity new growth poking through the rot of last years fall daredevil birds plummeting and rising between the trees courtship voices on every other branch they walked for several minutes following no particular path without whitehead so much as looking up from his boots out of sight of the house and his disciples he wore the burden of siege more nakedly head bowed he trudged between the trees indifferent to birdsong and leafburst alike marty was enjoying himself whenever hed crossed this territory before it had been at a run now his pace was forcibly slowed and details of the woods became apparent the confusion of flowers underfoot the fungi sprouting in the damp places between the roots all delighted him he picked up a selection of pebbles as he went one bore the fossilized imprint of a fern he thought of carys and of the dovecote and an unexpected longing for her lapped at the edges of his consciousness having no reason to prevent its access he let it come once admitted the weight of his feeling for her shocked him he felt conspired against as though in the last few days his emotions had worked in some secret place in him transforming mild interest in carys into something deeper he had little chance to sort the phenomena out however when he glanced up from the stone fern whitehead had got a good way ahead of him putting thoughts of carys aside he picked up his pace passages of sun and shadow moved through the trees as the light clouds that had sat on the wind earlier gave way to heavier formations the wind had begun to chill there was an occasional speckle of rain in it whitehead had pulled his collar up his hands were plunged into his pockets when marty reached him he was greeted with a question do you believe in god martin the inquiry came out of nowhere unprepared for it marty could only answer i dont know which was as answers to that question went honest enough but whitehead wanted more his eyes glittered i dont pray if thats what you mean marty offered not even before your trial a quick word with the almighty there was no humor malicious or otherwise in this interrogation again marty answered as honestly as he could i dont remember exactly i suppose i must have said something then yes he paused above them the clouds passed over the sun much good it did me and in prison no i never prayed he was sure of that never once but there were godfearing men in wandsworth surely marty remembered heseltine with whom hed shared a cell for a few weeks at the beginning of his stretch an old hand at prison tiny had spent more years behind bars than out every night hed murmur a bastardized version of the lords prayer into his pillow before he went to sleepour father who are in heaven hello be thy namenot understanding the words or their significance simply saying the prayer by rote as he had every night of his life most probably until the sense was corrupted beyond salvation thine by the king dome thine by the glory fever and fever amen was that what whitehead meant was there respect for a maker thanks for creation or even some anticipation of judgment in heseltines prayer no was martys reply not really godfearing i mean whats the use there was more where that thought came from and whitehead waited for it with a vultures patience but the words sat on martys tongue refusing to be spoken the old man prompted them why no use marty because its all down to accident isnt it i mean everythings chance whitehead nodded almost imperceptibly there was a long silence between them until the old man said do you know why i chose you martin not really toy never said anything to you he told me he thought i could do the job well a lot of people advised against me taking you they thought you were unsuitable for a number of reasons we neednt go into even toy wasnt certain he liked you but he wasnt certain but you employed me anyway indeed we did marty was beginning to find the catandmouse game insufferable he said now youre going to tell me why right youre a gambler whitehead replied marty felt hed known the answer long before it was spoken you wouldnt have been in trouble at all if you hadnt been obliged to pay off large gaming debts am i right more or less you spent every penny you earned or so your friends testified at the trial frittered it away not always i had some big wins really big wins the look whitehead gave marty was scalpelsharp after all youve been throughall your disease has made you sufferyou still talk about your big wins i remember the best times like anyone would marty replied defensively flukes no i was good damn it flukes martin you said so yourself a moment ago you said it was all chance how can you be good at anything thats accidental that doesnt make sense does it the man was right at least superficially but it wasnt as simple as he made it out to be was it it was all chance he couldnt argue with that basic condition but a sliver of marty believed something else what it was he believed he couldnt describe isnt that what you said whitehead pressed that it was accident its not always like that some of us have chance on our side is that what youre saying some of us have our fingerswhiteheads forefinger described a spinning circleon the wheel the circling finger stopped in his minds eye marty completed the image the ball jumped from hole to hole and found a niche a number some winner yelped his triumph not always he said just sometimes describe it describe how it feels why not where was the harm sometimes it was just easy you know like taking sweets from a baby id go to a club and the chips would tingle and id know jesus id know i couldnt fail to win whitehead smiled but you did fail he reminded marty with courteous brutality you often failed you failed till you owed everything you had and more besides i was stupid i played even when the chips didnt tingle when i knew i was on a losing streak why marty glowered what do you want a signed confession he snapped i was greedy what do you think and i loved playing even when i didnt have a chance of winning i still wanted to play for the games sake i suppose so yes for the game a look impossibly complex crossed whiteheads face there was regret in it and a terrible aching loss and more incomprehension whitehead the master whitehead the lord of all he surveyed suddenly showedall too brieflyanother more accessible face that of a man confused to the point of despair i wanted someone with your weaknesses he explained now and suddenly he was the one doing the confessing because sooner or later i believed a day like today would come and id have to ask you to take a risk with me what sort of risk nothing so simple as a wheel or a game of cards i wish it were then maybe i could explain to you instead of asking for an act of faith but its so complicated and im tired bill said something whitehead broke in toys left the estate you wont be seeing him again when did he go earlier in the week relations between us have been deteriorating for a while he caught martys dismay dont fret about it your position here is as secure as it ever was but you must trust me absolutely sir no affirmations of loyalty theyre wasted on me not because i dont believe youre sincere but im surrounded by people who tell me whatever they think i want to hear thats how they keep their wives in furs and their sons in cocaine his gloved fingers clawed at his bearded cheek as he spoke so few honest people toy was one evangeline my wife was another but so very few i just have to trust to instinct i have to blot out all the talk and follow what my head tells me and it trusts you martin marty said nothing just listened as whiteheads voice became quieter his eyes so intense now a glance from them might have ignited tinder if you stay with meif you keep me safetheres nothing you cant be or have understand me nothing this was not the first time the old man had offered this seduction but circumstances had clearly changed since marty first arrived at the sanctuary there was more at risk now whats the worst that can happen he asked the mazed face had slackened only the incendiary eyes still showed life the worst whitehead said who knows the worst the burning eyes seemed about to be extinguished by tears he fought them i have seen such things and passed by them on the other side never thought not once a pattering announced rain its soft percussion accompanied whitehead as he stumbled to speak all his verbal skills had deserted him suddenly he was bereft but somethinga vast somethingdemanded to be said never thought it would ever happen to me he bit back more words and shook his head at his own absurdity will you help me he asked in place of further explanation of course well he replied well see eh without warning he suddenly stepped past marty and returned the way theyd come the jaunt was apparently over for several minutes they walked as they had whitehead taking the lead with marty trailing a discreet two yards behind just before they came in sight of the house whitehead spoke again this time he didnt break the rhythm of his step but threw the inquiry over his shoulder just four words and the devil marty what sir the devil did you ever pray to him it was a joke a little leaden maybe but the old mans way of making light of his confessional well did you once or twice marty answered skirting a smile as the words left his lips whitehead froze dead in his tracks a hand outstretched behind him to check marty ssh twenty yards ahead arrested as it crossed their path was a fox it hadnt seen its observers yet but it could only be a matter of moments before their scent reached its nostrils which way whitehead hissed what which way will it run a thousand pounds straight bet i havent got marty began against a weeks pay marty began to smile what was a weeks pay he couldnt spend it anyway a thousand pounds says it runs to the right said whitehead marty hesitated quickly man done even on the word the animal caught their scent its ears pricked its head turned and it saw them for an instant it was too stupefied by surprise to move then it ran for several yards it took off away from them along the path not veering to one side or the other its heels kicking up dead leaves as it went then without warning it sliced away into the cover of the trees to the left there was no ambiguity about the victory well done said whitehead pulling off his glove and extending his hand to marty when he shook it marty felt it tingle like the chips had on a winning night by the time they got back the rain was beginning to come on more heavily a welcome hush had descended on the house apparently pearl unable to bear the barbarians in her kitchen any longer had thrown a fit and left though shed gone the offending parties seemed well chastened their babble was reduced to a murmur and few of them made any approach to whitehead as he entered those few that did were quickly slapped down are you still here munrow he said to one devotee to another who made the error of thrusting a sheaf of papers at him he quietly suggested the man choke on them they reached the study with the minimum of interruptions whitehead unlocked the wall safe you would prefer cash im sure marty studied the carpet though hed won the bet fairly he was embarrassed by the payoff cash is fine he murmured whitehead counted out a wad of twentypound notes and handed them across enjoy he said thank you dont thank me whitehead said it was a straight bet i lost an awkward silence fell while marty pocketed the money our talk the old man said is in the strictest confidence you understand of course i wouldnt whitehead raised his hand to ward off his protestations the strictest confidence my enemies have agents marty nodded as though he understood in a way of course he did perhaps whitehead suspected luther or pearl maybe even toy who was so abruptly persona non grata these people are responsible for the present fall in my fortunes its all meticulously engineered he shrugged eyes like slits god marty thought id never want to be on the wrong side of this man i dont fret about these things if they want to plan my ruin let them but i wouldnt like to think that my most intimate feelings were available to them do you see they wont be no he pursed his lips a cold kiss of satisfaction youve seen something of carys i gather pearl says you spend time together is that right yes whitehead came back with a tone of detachment that was patently fake she seems stable much of the time but essentially thats a performance im afraid shes not well and hasnt been for several years of course shes seen the best psychiatrists money can buy but im afraid its done no good her mother went the same way in the end are you telling me not to see her whitehead looked genuinely surprised no not at all the companionship may be good for her but please bear in mind shes a highly disturbed girl dont take her pronouncements too seriously half the time she doesnt know what shes saying well i think thats it youd better go and pay off your fox he laughed gently clever fox he said in the two and a half months marty had been at the sanctuary whitehead had been an iceberg now he had to think about revising that description today hed glimpsed another man altogether inarticulate alone talking of god and prayer not just god there had been that final question the one hed thrown away so carelessly and the devil did you ever pray to him marty felt hed been handed a pile of jigsaw pieces none of which seemed to belong to the same portrait fragments of a dozen scenes whitehead resplendent among his acolytes or sitting at a window watching the night whitehead the potentate lord of all he surveyed or betting like a drunken porter on the way a fox might run this last fragment puzzled marty the most in it he sensed was a clue that could unite these disparate images he had the strangest feeling that the bet on the fox had been fixed impossible of course and yet and yet suppose whitehead could put his finger on the wheel anytime he wanted to so that even the petty chance of a fox running to the right or left was available to him could he know the future before it happenedas that why the chips tingled and fingers tooor was he shaping it an earlier self would have rejected these subtleties out of hand but marty had changed being in the sanctuary had changed him carys ellipses had changed him in a hundred ways he was more complex than hed been and part of him longed for a return to the clarity of black and white but he knew damn well that such simplicity was a lie experience was made up of endless ambiguitiesof motive of feeling of cause and effectand if he was to win under such circumstances he had to understand how those ambiguities worked no not win there was no winning and losing here not in the way that hed understood before the fox had run to the left and he had a thousand pounds folded in his pocket but he felt none of the exhilaration he had when hed won on the horses or at the casino just black bleeding into white and vice versa until he scarcely knew right from wrong toy had rung the estate in the middle of the afternoon spoken to an irate pearl who was just about to make her exit and left a message for marty to call him at the pimlico number but marty hadnt rung back toy wondered if pearl had failed to pass the message along or if whitehead had somehow intercepted it and prevented a return call being made whatever the reason he hadnt spoken to marty and he felt guilty about it hed promised to warn strauss if events started to go badly awry now they were nothing observable perhaps the anxieties toy was experiencing were born out of instinct rather than fact but yvonne had taught him to trust his heart not his head things were going to fall down after all and he hadnt warned marty perhaps that was why he was having such bad dreams and waking with memories of ugliness flitting in his head not everyone survived being young some died early victims of their own hunger for life toy hadnt been such a victim though hed come perilously close not that hed known it at the time hed been too dazzled by the new pools he was introduced into by whitehead to see how lethal those waters could be and hed obeyed the great mans wishes with such unquestioning zeal hadnt he never once had he balked at his duty however criminal it might have seemed why should he be surprised then if after all these years these same crimes so casually committed were in silent pursuit of him that was why he lay now in a clammy sweat with yvonne sleeping beside him and one phrase circling his skull mamoulian will come that was the only clear notion he had the restthoughts of marty and whiteheadwas a potpourri of shames and accusations but that plain phrasemamoulian will comestood out in the dross of uncertainty as a fixed point to which all his terrors adhered no apology would suffice no humiliation would curb the last europeans anger because toy had been young and a brute and hed had a wicked way with him once upon a time when hed been too young to know better hed made mamoulian suffer and the remorse he felt now came too latetwenty thirty years too lateand after all hadnt he lived on the profits of his brutality all these years oh jesus he said in the unsteady rhythm of his breath jesus help me afraid and ready to admit to being afraid if it meant shed comfort hull he turned over and reached for yvonne she wasnt there her side of the bed was cold he sat up momentarily disorientated yvonne the bedroom door was ajar and the dimmest of lights from downstairs described the room it was chaos they had been packing all evening and the task had still not been finished when at one in the morning theyd retired clothes were heaped on the chest of drawers an open case yawned in the corner his ties hung over the back of a chair like parched snakes tongues to the floor he heard a noise on the landing he knew yvonnes padding step well shed gone for a glass of apple juice or a biscuit the way she so often did she appeared at the door in silhouette are you all right he asked her she murmured something like yes he put his head back on the pillow hungry again he said letting his eyes close always hungry cold air seeped into the bed as she raised the sheet to slip in beside him you left the light on downstairs he chided as sleep started to slide over him again she didnt reply asleep already probably she was blessed with a facility for instant unconsciousness he turned to look at her in the semidarkness she wasnt snoring yet but nor was she entirely silent he listened more carefully his coiled innards jittery it was a liquid sound she was making as though breathing through mud yvonne are you all right she didnt answer from her face which was inches from his the slushing sound went on he reached for the switch of the lamp above the bed keeping his eyes on the black mass of yvonnes head as he did so best to do this fast he reasoned before my imagination gets the better of me his fingers located the switch fumbled with it then pressed the light on what was facing him on the pillow was not recognizably yvonne he jabbered her name as he scrambled backward out of bed eyes fixed on the abomination beside him how was it possible that she was alive enough to climb the stairs and get into bed to murmur yes to him as she had the profundity of her wounding had killed her surely nobody could live skinned and boned like that she halfturned in the bed eyes closed as if rolling over in her sleep thenhorriblyshe said his name her mouth didnt work as it had blood greased the word on its way he couldnt bear to look anymore or hed scream and that would bring themwhoever did thisbring them howling at him with their scalpels already wet they were probably outside the door already but nothing could induce him to stay in the same room not with her performing slow gyrations on the bed still saying his name as she pulled up her nightdress he staggered out of the bedroom and onto the landing to his surprise they were not waiting for him there at the top of the stairs he hesitated he was not a brave man nor was he foolish tomorrow he could mourn her but for tonight she was simply gone from him and there was nothing to be done but preserve himself from whoeverd done this whoever why didnt he admit the name to himself mamoulian was responsible it had his signature and he was not alone the european would never have laid his purged hands on human flesh the way someone had on yvonne his squeamishness was legendary but it was he whod given her that halflife to live after the murder was done only mamoulian was capable of that service and he would be waiting below now wouldnt he in the undersea world at the bottom of the stairs waiting as hed waited so long for toy to traipse down to join him go to hell toy whispered to the dark below and walked along the landing toward the spare bedroom with every step he anticipated some move from the enemy but none came not until he reached the door of the bedroom anyway then as he turned the handle he heard yvonnes voice behind him willy the word was better formed than before for the briefest moment he felt his sanity in doubt was it possible that if he turned now she would be standing at the bedroom door as disfigured as memory suggested or was that all a feverdream where are you going she demanded to know downstairs somebody moved come back to bed without turning to refuse her invitation toy pushed the door of the spare bedroom open and as he did so he heard somebody start up the stairs behind him the footsteps were heavy their owner eager there was no key in the lock to delay his pursuer and no time to drag furniture in front of the door toy crossed the lightless bedroom in three strides threw open the french windows and stepped onto the small wroughtiron balcony it grunted beneath his weight he suspected it would not hold for long below him the garden was in darkness but he had a fair idea of where the flower beds lay and where the paving stones without hesitationthe footsteps loud at his backhe clambered over the balcony his joints complained at this exertion and more so when he lowered himself over the other side until he was hanging by his hands suspended by a grip that was every second in danger of giving out a din in the room hed left drew his glance his pursuer a bloated thug with bloody hands and the eyes of something rabid was in the roomwas crossing now toward the windows growling his displeasure toy rocked his body as best he could praying to miss the paving he knew was directly beneath his bare feet and land in the soft earth of the herbaceous border there was little chance to finetune the maneuver he let go of the balustrade as the obesity reached the balcony and for what seemed a long time fell backward through space the window diminishing above him until he landed with no more injury than a bruising among the geraniums yvonne had planted only the week before he got to his feet badly winded but intact and ran down the moonlit garden to the back gate it was padlocked but he managed to climb over it with easeadrenaline firing his muscles there was no sound of further pursuit and when he glanced back he could see the fat man was still at the french windows watching his escape as though lacking the initiative to follow sick with a sudden excitement he sprinted away down the narrow passage that led along the backs of all the gardens caring only to put distance between himself and the house it was only when he reached the street its lamps starting to go out now as dawn edged upover the city that he realized he was stark naked marty had gone to bed a happy man though there was still much here he didnt understand much which the old mandespite his promises of explanationsseemed pleased to keep obscured finally none of that was his business if papa chose to have secrets so be it marty had been hired to look after him and it appeared that he was fulfilling that obligation to his employers satisfaction the results were there in the intimacies the old man had shared with him and in the thousand pounds beneath his pillow euphoria prevented sleep martys heart seemed to be beating at twice its usual rate he got up slipped on his bathrobe and tried a selection of videos to take his mind off the days events but the boxing tapes depressed him the pornography too he wandered downstairs to the library found a dogeared space opera then slipped back to his room making a detour to the kitchen for a beer carys was in his room when he got back dressed in jeans and a sweater barefoot she looked frayed older than her nineteen years the smile she offered him was too stagemanaged to convince you dont mind she said only i heard you walking about dont you ever sleep not often want some beer no thanks sit down he said throwing a pile of clothes off the single chair for her she deposited herself on the bed however leaving the chair for marty i have to talk to you she said marty laid down the book hed chosen on the cover a naked woman her skin a fluorescent green emerged from an egg on a twinsunned planet carys said do you know whats going on going on what do you mean havent you felt anything odd in the house like what her mouth had found its favorite shape corners turned down in exasperation i dont know its difficult to describe try she hesitated like a diver at the edge of a high board then took the plunge do you know what a sensitive is he shook his head its someone who can pick up waves thought waves mind reading in a way he gave her a noncommittal look is it something you can do he said not do i dont do anything its more like its done to me marty leaned back in the chair flummoxed its as though everything gets sticky i cant shake it off i hear people talking without them moving their lips most of its meaningless just rubbish and its what theyre thinking yes he couldnt find much to say in response except that he doubted her and that wasnt what she wanted to hear shed come for reassurance hadnt she thats not all she said i see shapes sometimes around peoples bodies vague shapes like a kind of light marty thought of the man at the fence of how hed bled light or seemed to he didnt interrupt her however the point is i feel things other people dont i dont think its particularly clever of me or anything like that i just do it and the last few weeks ive felt something in the house i get odd thoughts in my head out of nowhere i dream horrible things she halted aware that her description was getting vaguer and she risked what little credibility this monologue had if she went on the lights you see marty said backtracking yes i saw something like them she leaned forward when the man who broke in i thought i saw light coming from him from his wounds i suppose and his eyes and his mouth even as he finished the sentence he was shrugging it off as if fearful of contagion i dont know he said i was drunk but you saw something yes he conceded without pleasure she got up and crossed to the window like father like daughter he thought window freaks both of them as she stared out across the lawnmarty never drew the curtainshe had ample opportunity to look at her something she said something the grace of her crooked leg the displaced weight of her buttocks her face reflected in the cold glass so intent on this mystery all enthralled him thats why he doesnt talk to me any longer she said papa he knows i can feel what hes thinking and hes frightened the observation was a culdesac she started tapping her foot with irritation her breath ghosting the window intermittently then out of the blue she said did you know you had a breast fixation what you look at them all the time do i hell and youre a liar he stood up not knowing what he intended to do or say until the words were out at last smothered in confusion only the truth seemed appropriate i like looking at you he touched her shoulder at this point if they chose the game could stop tenderness was a breath away they could take the opportunity or let it be resume the repartee or discard it the moment lay between them awaiting instructions babe she said dont shake he moved a halfstep closer and kissed the back of her neck she turned and returned the kiss her hand moving up his spine to cup the back of his head as if to sense the weight of his skull at last she said when they broke i was beginning to think you were too much of a gentleman they tumbled onto the bed and she rolled over to straddle his hips without hesitation she reached to fumble with the belt of his bathrobe he was halfhard beneath her and uncomfortably trapped selfconscious too she pulled the bathrobe open and ran her palms across his chest his body was solid without being heavy silk hair spread out from his sternum and down the central groove of his abdomen coarsening as it descended she sat up a little to release the robe from his groin his cock freed flipped from four to noon she stroked its underside it responded in gulps pretty she said he was getting used to her approbation now her calm was infectious he halfsat up perching on his elbows to get a better look at her poised above him she was intent on his erection putting her index finger into her mouth and transferring a film of saliva to his cock running fingertips up and down in fluid lazy motions he squirmed with pleasure a rash of heat had appeared on his chest further signal if any were needed of his arousal his cheeks burned too kiss me he asked she leaned forward and met his mouth they collapsed back onto the bed his hands felt for the bottom of her sweater and started to ease it up but she stopped him no she murmured into his mouth want to see you he said she sat back up he was looking up at her perplexed not so fast she said and raised the sweater far enough to expose her belly and breasts to him without taking the garment off marty took in her body like a blind man granted sight the dusting of gooseflesh the unexpected fullness of her his hands toured where his eyes went pressing her bright skin describing spirals on her nipples watching the weight of her breasts ride on her rib cage mouth now followed eye and hand he wanted to bathe her with his tongue she pulled his head against her through the mesh of his hair his scalp gleamed a baby pink she craned to kiss it but couldnt reach and slid her hand down instead to take hold of his cock be careful he murmured as she stroked there was wetness in her palm she relinquished her hold gently he coaxed her over and they fell side by side across the bed she pushed the robe off his neck while his fingers worked at the button at the top of her jeans she made no attempt to assist liking the look of concentration he wore it would be so good to be completely naked with him skin to skin but this wasnt the time to risk that suppose he saw the bruises and the needle marks and rejected her it would be unbearable he had successfully undone the button and unzipped the fly and now his hands were in her jeans sliding under the top of her panties there was urgency in him and much as she loved to watch his intent she aided the undressing now raising her hips from the bed and sliding the jeans and panties down exposing her body from nipples to knee he moved over her leaving a trail of saliva to mark his way licking at her navel and lower now face flushed his tongue in her not expert exactly but eager to learn nuzzling out the places that pleased her by the sound of her sighs he slid the jeans lower and when she didnt resist all the way off her panties followed and she closed her eyes blotting out everything but his exploration in his eagerness he displayed the instincts of a cannibal nothing her body fed him would be rejected he pressed as deep as anatomy allowed something itched at the back of her neck but she ignored it too concerned with this other sport he looked up from her groin with doubt on his face go on she said she wriggled up the bed inviting him into her the doubt on his face persisted whats wrong no protection he said forget it he needed no second invitation her position not lying beneath him but halfsitting allowed her to watch his sweet display pressing the root of his cock until the head darkened and glossed before entering her slowly almost reverentially now he relinquished hold of himself and put his hands on the bed to either side of her his back arched a crescent within a crescent as his body weight carried him in his lips parted and his tongue emerged to lap at her eyes she moved to meet him pressing her hips up to his he sighed frowned oh jesus she thought hes come but his eyes opened again still raging and his strokes after the initial threat of mistiming were even and slow again her neck irritated her it felt more than an itch it was a bite a drill hole she tried to ignore it but the sensation only intensified as her body gave way to the moment marty was too intent on their locked anatomies to register her discomfort his breath was jagged hot on her face she tried to move hoping the ache was just the tension of this position marty she breathed roll over he wasnt sure of this maneuver at first but once he was on his back and she sitting on him he caught her rhythm easily he began to climb again dizzy with the height the pain at her neck persisted but she thrust it out of focus she bent forward her face six inches above martys and let saliva fall from her mouth into his a thread of bubbles that he received with an open grin pushing up into her as deep as he could go and holding himself there suddenly something moved in her not marty something or somebody else fluttering in her system her concentration faltered her heart too she lost focus on where she was and what she was another set of eyes seemed to look through hers momentarily she shared their owners vision she saw sex as depravity a raw and bestial exchange no she said trying to cancel the nausea that had suddenly risen in her marty opened his eyes to slits taking her no as a command to postpone the finish im trying babe he said grinning just dont move she couldnt grasp what he meant at first he was a thousand miles from her lying below in a foul sweat wounding her against her wishes ok he breathed holding on until it almost hurt he seemed to swell in her the sensation drove the double vision out of her head the other viewer shrank away behind her eyes revolted by the fullness and the fleshiness of this act by its reality did the intruding mind feel marty too she halfthought its cortex plumbed by a cockhead that was swelling to cream even now god she said with the other eyes in retreat the joy came back cant stop babe marty said go on she said its all right its all right flecks of her sweat hit him as she moved on top of him go on yes she said again it was an exclamation of pure delight and it took him past the point of return he tried to stave off eruption for a few more trembling seconds the weight of her hips on him the heat of her channel the brightness of her breasts filled his head and then somebody spoke a low guttural voice stop it martys eyes fluttered open glancing to left and right there was nobody else in the room his head had invented the sound he canceled the illusion and looked back at carys go on she said please go on she was dancing on him the bones of her hips caught the light the sweat on them ran and ran glowing yes yes he answered the voice forgotten she looked down at him as imminence infested his face and through the intricacies of her own flaring sensations she felt the second mind again it was a worm in her budding head pushing forward its sickness ready to stain her vision she fought it go away she told it under her breath go away but it wanted to defeat her to defeat them both what had seemed like curiosity before was malice now it wanted to spoil everything i love you she told marty defying the presence in her i love you i love you the invader spasmed furious with her and more furious still that she didnt concede to its spoiling marty was rigid on the threshold blind and deaf to anything but pleasure then with a groan he began to spurt in her and she was there too her sensations drove all thoughts of resistance out of her head somewhere far off she could hear marty gasping oh jesus he was saying babe babe but he was in another world they werent together even at this moment she in her ecstasy he in his each running a private race to completion a wayward spasm made marty convulse he opened his eyes carys had her hands glued over her face fingers spread you all right babe he said when her eyes opened he had to bite back a shout it was for a moment not her who stared out between the bars it was something dredged up from the bottom of the sea black eyes swiveling in a gray head some primeval genus that viewed himhe knew this to his marrowwith hatred in its bowels the hallucination lasted two heartbeats only but long enough for him to glance down her body and up again to meet the same vile gaze carys then her eyelids fluttered and the fan of her fingers closed across her face for a lunatic instant he flinched awaiting the revelation her hands dropping from her head the face transformed a fishs head but of course it was her only her here she was now smiling at him are you all right he ventured what do you think i love you babe she murmured something as she slumped on him they lay there for several minutes his cock diminishing in a cooling bath of mingled fluids arent you getting a cramp he asked her after a while but she didnt reply she was asleep gently he slid her sideways slipping out of her with a wet sound she lay on the bed beside him her face impassive he kissed her breasts licked her fingers and fell asleep beside her mamoulian felt sick she wasnt easy prey this woman despite his sentimental claim upon her psyche but then her strength was to be expected she was whiteheads stock peasant breed thief breed cunning and dirty though she couldnt know precisely what she was doing shed fought him with the very sensuality he most despised but her weaknessesand she had manywere exploitable hed used the heroin fugues at first gaining access to her when she was pacified to the point of indifference they warped her perception which had made his invasion less noticeable and through her eyes hed seen the house listened with her ears to the witless conversation of its occupants shared with her though it revolted him the smell of their cologne and their flatulence she was the perfect spy living in the heart of the enemys camp and as the weeks had gone by hed found it easier to slip in and oil of her unnoticed that had made him careless it was carelessness not to have looked before he leaped to commit himself to her head without first checking what she was doing he hadnt even thought she might be with the bodyguard and by the time hed realized his error he was sharing her sensationsher ridiculous raptureand it had left him trembling he would not make such a mistake again he sat in the bare room in the bare house he had bought for himself and breer and tried to forget the turbulence hed experienced the look in strauss eyes as he stared up at the girl had the thug glimpsed perhaps the face behind her face the european guessed so no matter none of them would survive it wouldnt just be the old man the way hed planned at first all of themhis acolytes his serfs allwould go to the wall with their master the memories of strauss assaults lingered in the europeans entrails he longed to evacuate diem the sensation shamed and disgusted him downstairs he heard breer come in or go out on his way to some atrocity or home from one mamoulian concentrated on the blank wall opposite him but try as he might to exile the trauma he still felt the intrusion the spurting head the heat of the act forget he said aloud forget the brown fire off them its no risk to you see only the emptiness the promise of the void his innards shook beneath his gaze the paint on the wall seemed to blister venereal eruptions disfigured its emptiness illusions but horribly real to him nevertheless very well if he couldnt dislodge the obscenities he would transform them it wasnt difficult to smudge sexuality into violence turn sighs into screams thrusts into convulsions the grammar was the same only the punctuation differed picturing the lovers in death together the nausea hed felt receded in the face of that void what was their substance transitory their promises pretension he began to calm the sores on the wall had started to heal and he was left after a few minutes with an echo of the nothingness he had come to need so much life came and went but absence he knew went on forever oh by the way there was a telephone call for you from bill toy day before yesterday marty looked up at pearl from his plate of steak and pulled a face why didnt you tell me she looked contrite it was the day i lost my wick with those damn people i left a message for you i didnt get it on the pad beside the telephone it was still there call toy and a number he dialed and waited a full minute before the phone was picked up at the other end it wasnt toy the woman who repeated the number had a soft lost voice slurred as if by too much drink can i speak to william toy please he asked hes gone the woman replied oh i see he wont be coming back not ever the quality of the voice was eerie who is this it asked of him it doesnt matter marty replied his instinct rebelled against giving his name who is this she asked again im sorry to have bothered you who is this he put the receiver down on the slushing insistence at the other end only when he had did he realize that his shirt was clinging to a cold sweat that had suddenly sprung from his chest and spine in the love nest in pimlico yvonne asked the vacated line who is this for half an hour or more before letting the telephone drop then she went to sit down the couch was damp large sticky stains were spreading on it from the place where she always sat she assumed it was something to do with her but she couldnt work out how or why nor could she explain the flies that congregated all over her in her hair in her clothes whining away who is this she asked again the question remained perfectly pertinent though she was no longer speaking to the stranger on the phone the rotting skin of her hands the blood she left in the tub after bathing the horrid look the mirror gave herall inspired the same hypnotic inquiry who is this who is this who is this who is this vi the tree breer hated the house it was cold and the natives in this part of the city were inhospitable he was regarded with suspicion as soon as he stepped out of the front door there were he had to concede reasons for this in recent weeks a smell had begun to linger around him a sickly syrupy smell that made him almost ashamed to get too close to the pretty ones along the schoolyard railing for fear they would put their fingers to their noses making a poopoo sound and run off calling him names when they did that it made him want to die though there was no heating in the house and he had to bathe in cold water he nevertheless washed from head to foot three or four times a day hoping to dislodge the smell when that didnt work he bought perfumesandalwood in particularand doused his body with it after each ablution now the comments they called after him werent about excreta but about his sex life he took the brunt of their remarks with equanimity nevertheless dull resentments festered in him not just about the way he was treated in the district the european after a courtship that had been polite was more and more treating him with contempt as a lackey rather than an ally it irritated him the way he was sent to this haunt or that looking for toyasked to comb a city of millions in search of a shriveled old man whom breer had last seen scrambling over a wall stark naked his scrawny buttocks white in the moonlight the european was losing his sense of proportion whatever crimes this toy had committed against mamoulian they could scarcely be profound and it made breer weak with tiredness to contemplate another day wandering the streets despite his weariness the capacity for sleep seemed to have deserted him almost entirely nothing not even the fatigue that killed his nerves could persuade his body to close down for more than a few eyefluttering minutes and even then his mind dreamed such things such dreadful things it was scarcely possible to call the slumber blissful the only comfort remaining to him was his pretties that was one of the few advantages in this house it had a cellar just a dry cool space which he was systematically clearing of the rubbish left by the previous owners it was a long job but he was gradually getting the place the way he wanted it and though he had never much liked enclosed spaces there was something about the darkness and the sense of being underground that answered an unarticulated need in him soon he would have it all scrubbed he would put colored paper chains around the walls and flowers in vases on the floor a table maybe with a cloth on it smelling of violets comfortable chairs for his guests then he could begin to entertain friends in the manner to which he hoped they would become accustomed all his arrangements could be effected much more quickly if he werent forever interrupted by the damnfool errands the european sent him on but the time for such servitude hed decided had come to an end today he would tell mamoulian that he wouldnt be blackmailed or bullied into playing this game hed threaten to leave if it came to the worst hed go north there were places north where the sun didnt come up for five months of the yearhed read about such placesand that seemed fine to him no sun and deep caves to live in holes where not even moonlight could stray the time had come to lay his cards on the table if the air in the house was cold it was even colder in mamoulians room the european seemed to exhale a breath that was mortuarychilled breer stood in the doorway hed only been in this room once before and he had a niggling fear of it it was too plain the european had asked breer to nail boards across the window this he had done now by the light of a single wick burning in a dish of oil on the floor the room looked bleak and gray everything in it seemed insubstantial even the european he sat in the dark wood chair that was the only furnishingand looked at breer with eyes so glazed he could have been blind i didnt call you up here mamoulian said i wanted to talk to you close the door then though this was against his better judgment breer obeyed the lock clicked at his back the room was now centered on that single flame and the fitful luminosity it offered sluggishly breer looked around the room for someplace to sit or at least lean but there was no comfort here its austerity would have shamed an ascetic just a few blankets on the bare boards in the corner where the great man slept some books stacked against the wall a pack of cards a jug of water and a cup little else the walls except for the rosary that hung from a hook were naked what do you want anthony all breer could think was i hate this room say what you have to say i want to go go away the flies bother me there are so many flies no more than there are in any other may it is perhaps a little warmer than usual all the signs are that the summer will be blistering the thought of heat and light made breer sick and that was another thing the way his belly revolted if he put food into it the european had promised him a new worldhealth wealth and happinessbut he was suffering the torments of the damned it was a cheat all a cheat why didnt you let me die he said without thinking what he was saying i need you but i feel ill the work will soon be over breer looked straight at mamoulian something he very rarely mustered the courage to do but desperation was a rod at his back you mean finding toy he said we wont find him its impossible oh but we will anthony that i insist upon breer sighed i wish i was dead he said dont say that youve got all the freedom you want havent you you feel no guilt now do you most people would happily suffer your minor discomforts to be guiltless anthony to commit their hearts desire to flesh and never be called to regret it rest today tomorrow were going to be busy you and i why were going to visit mr whitehead mamoulian had told him about whitehead and the house and the dogs the damage theyd done to the european was conspicuous though his torn hand had healed quickly the tissue damage was irreparable a finger and a half missing ugly scars raking palm and face a thumb that would no longer move properly his facility with the cards was permanently spoiled it was a long and sorry tale hed told breer the day hed returned bloodied from his encounter with the dogs a history of promises broken and trust despised of atrocities committed against friendship the european had wept freely in the telling of it and breer had glimpsed the profundity of pain in him they were both despised men conspired against and spat upon remembering the europeans confessional the sense of injustice breer had felt at the time was reawoken and here was he who owed the european so muchhis life his sanityplanning to turn his back on his savior the razoreater felt ashamed please he said eager to make amends for his petty complaints let me go and kill this man for you no anthony i can breer insisted im not afraid of dogs i feel no pain not now not since you came back i can kill him in his bed im sure you could and i will certainly need you to keep the dogs off me ill tear them apart mamoulian looked deeply pleased you do that anthony i loathe the species always have you deal with them while i have words with joseph why bother with him hes so old so am i mamoulian replied older than i look believe me but a bargain is a bargain its difficult said breer his eyes wet with phlegmy tears what is being the last oh yes needing to do everything properly so that the tribes remembered breers voice broke all the glories hed missed not being born into a great age what must that dream time have been like when the razoreaters and the europeans and all the other tribes held the world in their hands there would never come such an age again mamoulian had said so you wont be forgotten the european promised i think i will the european stood up he seemed bigger than breer remembered him and darker have a little faith anthony there is so much to look forward to breer felt a touch at the back of his neck it seemed a moth had alighted there and was stroking his nape with its furred antennae his head had begun to buzz as though the flies that beset him had laid eggs in his ears and they were suddenly hatching he shook his head to try to dislocate the sensation its all right he heard the european say through the whirring of their wings be calm i dont feel well breer protested meekly hoping his weakness would make mamoulian merciful the room was fragmenting around him the walls separating from the floor and ceiling the six sides of this gray box coming apart at the seams and letting all kinds of nothingness in everything had disappeared into a fog furniture blankets even mamoulian theres so much to look forward to he heard the european repeat or was it an echo coming back to him from some faroff cliff face breer was terrified though he could no longer even see his outstretched arm he knew that this place went on forever and he was lost in it the tears came thicker his nose ran his guts knotted just as he thought he must scream or lose his mind the european appeared out of the nothingness in front of him and by the lightning flash of his eclipsed consciousness breer saw the man transformed here was the source of all flies all blistering summers and killing winters all loss all fear floating before him more naked than any man had right to be naked to the point of notbeing now he spread his good hand toward breer in it were bone dice carved with faces breer almost recognized and the last european was crouching and was tossing the dice faces and all into the void while somewhere close by a thing with fire for a head wept and wept until it seemed they would all drown in tears whitehead took the vodka glass and the bottle and went down to the sauna it had become a favorite retreat of his during the weeks of crisis now though the danger was far from over he had lost focus on the state of the empire large sectors of the corporations european and far eastern operations had already been sold off to cut their losses receivers had been called in to a couple of smaller firms there were mass redundancies planned for some of the chemical plants in germany and scandinavia lastditch attempts to stave off closure or sale joe had other problems on his mind however empires could be regained life and sanity could not hed sent the financiers away and the government thinktank men sent them back to their banks and their reportlined offices in whitehall there was nothing they could tell him that he wanted to hear no graphs no computer displays no predictions interested him in the five weeks since the beginning of the crisis he remembered with interest only one conversation the debate hed had with strauss he liked strauss more to the point he trusted strauss and that was a commodity rarer than uranium in the bazaar joe bartered in toys instinct about strauss had been correct bill had been a man with a nose for integrity in others sometimes particularly when the vodka filled him with sentiment and remorse he missed toy badly but he was damned if hed mourn that had never been his style and he wasnt about to start now he poured himself another glass of vodka and raised it to the fall he said and drank hed worked up a good head of steam in the whitetiled room and sitting on the bench in the halflight blotched and florid he felt like some fleshy plant he enjoyed the sensation of sweat in the folds of his belly at his armpits and groin simple physical stimuli that distracted him from bad thoughts maybe the european wouldnt come after all he thought pray god somewhere in the benighted house a door opened and closed but the drink and the steam made him feel quite aloof from events elsewhere the sauna was another planet his and his alone he put the drained glass down on the tiles and closed his eyes hoping to drowse breer went to the gate there was a hum of electricity off it and the sour smell of power in the air youre strong the european said you told me so open the gate breer put his hand on the wire the boasts were true he felt only the slightest tremor there was just a cooking smell and the sound of his teeth chattering as he started to tear the gate apart he was stronger than hed imagined there was no fear in him and its absence made him herculean now the dogs had started to bark along the fence but he just thought let them come he wasnt going to die perhaps he would never die laughing like a loon he ripped the gate open the hum stopped as the circuit was broken the air was tinged with blue smoke thats good said the european breer tried to drop the section of wire he was holding but some of it had welded itself into his palm he had to tear it out with his other hand he looked down incredulously at his seared flesh it was blackened and smelled appetizing soon surely it must begin to hurt a little no mannot even a man like him guiltless and sublimely strongcould receive a wound like this and not suffer but there was no sensation suddenlyout of the darka dog mamoulian backed off fear convulsing him but breer was its intended victim a few paces from its target the dog leaped and its bulk struck breer center chest the impact toppled him over onto his back and the dog was swiftly on top of him jaws snapping at his throat breer was armed with a longbladed kitchen knife but he seemed uninterested in the weapon though it was within easy reach his fat face broke into a laugh as the dog scrabbled to get access to the mans neck breer simply took hold of the dogs lower jaw the animal snapped down clamping breers hand in its mouth almost immediately it realized its error breer reached around the back of the dogs head with his free hand grabbed a fistful of fur and muscle and jerked neck and head in opposite directions there was a grinding sound the dog roared in its throat still unwilling to let go of its executioners hand even as blood sprang from between its clenched teeth breer gave the dog another lethal wrench its eyes showed white and its limbs stiffened it slumped down onto breers chest dead other dogs barked in the distance responding to the deathyelp theyd heard the european looked nervously to right and left along the fence get up quickly breer loosed his hand from the dogs maw and shrugged the corpse off he was still laughing easy he said theres more take me to them maybe too many for you to take on all at once was this the one breer asked kicking the dead dog over so that the european could see it better the one that took off your fingers i dont know the european replied avoiding breers bloodspattered face as it grinned at him eyes sparkling like an adolescents in love the kennels he suggested finish them off there why not the european led off from the fence in the direction of the kennels thanks to carys the layout of the sanctuary was as familiar to him as the palm of his own hand breer kept pace with him stinking of blood already a spring in his heavy step he had seldom felt so alive life was so good wasnt it so very good the dogs barked in her room carys pulled the pillow over her head to shut out the din tomorrow shed pluck up her courage and tell lillian that she resented being kept awake half the night by hysterical hounds if she was ever going to be healthy shed have to start learning the rhythms of a normal life that meant going about her business while the sun shone and sleeping at night as she turned over to find a portion of the bed that was still cool an image flashed into her head it was gone again before she could entirely grasp it but she caught enough to wake her with a start she saw a manfaceless but familiarcrossing a tract of grass at his heels a tide of filth it crept close behind him in blind adoration its waves sibilant as snakes she didnt have time to see what the waves contained and perhaps that was a good thing she turned over a third time and ordered herself to forget these nonsenses curiously the dogs had stopped barking and what after all was the worst he could do what was the very worst whitehead had tried on this particular question so often it felt like a familiar coat the possible physical torments were endless of course sometimes in the clammy hug of a threeam sweat he would deem himself worthy of them allif a man could die a dozen two dozen timesbecause the crimes of power he had committed were not easily paid for the things oh jesus in heaven the things he had done but then damn it who would not have crimes to confess when the time came who would not have acted out of greed and envy or grappled for station and having gained it been absolute in authority rather than relinquish it he couldnt be held responsible for everything the corporation had done if once in a decade a medical preparation that deformed fetuses had slipped onto the market was he to blame because thered been profit made that kind of moral accounting was for the writers of revenge fiction it didnt belong in the real world where most crimes went punished only with wealth and influence where the worm seldom turned and when it did was immediately crushed where the best a man could hope was that having risen to his ambitions height by wit stealth or violence there was some smidgen of pleasure in the view that was the real world and the european was as familiar with its ironies as he was hadnt mamoulian shown him so much of it himself how in all conscience could the european turn around and punish his student for learning his lessons too well ill probably die in a warm bed whitehead thought with curtains partially drawn against a yellow spring sky and surrounded by admirers there is nothing to fear he said aloud the steam billowed the tiles laid with an obsessives precision sweated with him but coldly where he was hot nothing to fear from the door of the doghouse mamoulian watched breer at work it was an efficient slaughter this time not the trial of strength hed had with the dog at the gate the fat man simply opened the cages and then the throats of the dogs one by one using his longbladed knife cornered in their cells the dogs were easy prey all they could do was turn and turn snapping uselessly at their assassin somehow knowing the battle was lost before it was truly entered they dropped turds as they slumped down slashed necks and flanks spurting brown eyes turned up to look at breer like painted saints he killed the pups too tearing them from their mothers lap and cracking their heads open in his hand bella fought back with more vehemence than the other dogs determined to inflict as much damage as she could on the killer before she too was killed he returned the favor mutilating her body after hed silenced her wounds in return for the wounds shed given him once the clamor was over and the only movement in the cages was the twitch of a leg or the splash of a bladder giving vent breer pronounced himself finished they went together toward the house there were two more dogs here the last of them the razoreater made short work of them both by now he looked more like an abattoir worker than a sometime librarian the european thanked him it had been easier than hed expected i have business inside the house now he told breer do you want me to come no but you could open the door for me if you would breer went to the back door and punched out the glass then reached through and unlocked it letting mamoulian into the kitchen thank you wait here for me the european disappeared into the blue gloom of the interior breer watched him go and once his master was out of sight entered the sanctuary after him blood and smiles wreathing his face though the pall of steam muffled the sound whitehead had the impression that somebody was moving around in the house strauss probably the man had become restless recently whitehead let his eyes drift closed again somewhere close by he heard a door opening and closing the door of the antechamber beyond the steam room he stood up and quizzed the gloom marty there was no answer from marty or anybody else the certainty of having heard a door at all faltered it wasnt always easy to judge sound here nor vision the steam had thickened considerably he could no longer see across to the other side of the room is there somebody there he asked the steam was a dead gray wall in front of his eyes he cursed himself for letting it get so heavy martin he said again though there was neither sight nor sound to confirm his suspicions he knew he wasnt alone somebody was very close and yet not answering when he spoke he reached inch by tremulous inch across the tiles to the towel folded at his side his fingers investigated the fold while his eyes stayed fixed on the steamwall in the towel was a gun his grateful fingers located it this time more quietly he addressed the invisible visitor the gun gave him confidence i know youre there show yourself you bastard i wont be terrorized something moved in the steam eddies began and multiplied whitehead could hear the double thump of his heart in his ears whoever it was he was ready and then without warning the steam divided killed by a sudden cold the old man raised the gun if it was marty out there and he was playing some sick joke he was going to regret it the hand that held the gun had begun to tremble and now finally there was a figure in front of him it was still indecipherable in the mist at least it was until a voice hed heard a hundred times in his vodkasodden dreams said pilgrim the steam shrank back the european was there standing in front of him his face had scarcely conceded the seventeen years since last theyd met the domed brow the eyes set so deep in their orbits they glinted like water at the bottom of a well he had changed so little as though timein awe of himhad passed him by sit down he said whitehead didnt move the gun was still pointed directly at the european please joseph sit down might it be better if he sat might the death blows be avoided by a feigned meekness or was it melodrama to think that this man would stoop to blows what kind of dream have i been living in whitehead chided himself to think hed come here to bruise me to bleed me such eyes have more than bruising on their mind he sat down he was aware of his nakedness but he didnt much care mamoulian wasnt seeing his flesh he looked deeper than fat and bone whitehead could feel the stare in him now it stroked his heart how else was he to explain the relief he felt seeing the european at last its so long was all he could say a limping banality did he sound like a hopeful lover longing for a reconciliation perhaps that wasnt so far from the truth the singularity of their mutual hatred had the purity of love the european studied him pilgrim he murmured reproachfully glancing at the gun theres no need or use whitehead smiled and laid the gun down on the towel beside him i was afraid of you coming he said by way of explanation thats why i bought the dogs you know how i loathe dogs but i knew you loathed them more mamoulian put his finger to his lips to hush whiteheads talk i forgive the dogs he said whom was he forgiving the animals or the man whod used them against him why did you have to come back whitehead said you must have known i wouldnt welcome you you know why i came no i dont really i dont joseph mamoulian sighed dont treat me like one of your politicians im not to be paid off in promises then thrown away when your fortunes change you cant treat me like that i didnt no lies please not now not with so little time left to us this time this last time let us be honest with each other let us spill our hearts there wont be any more opportunities why not why cant we start again were old and tired im not why havent you fought for your empire then if not because of fatigue that was your doing whitehead asked already certain of the reply mamoulian nodded youre not the only man ive helped to fortune ive got friends in the highest circles all like you students of providence they could buy and sell half the world if i asked them to they owe me that but none of them were ever quite like you joseph you were the hungriest and the ablest only with you did i see a chance of go on whitehead prompted chance of what salvation mamoulian replied then laughed the thought off of all things he said quietly whitehead had never imagined it would be like this a hushed debate in a whitetiled room two old men exchanging hurts turning the memories over like stones and watching the lice scuttle away it was so much more gentle and so much more painful nothing scourged like loss i made mistakes he said and im genuinely sorry for them tell me the truth mamoulian scolded that is the truth damn it im sorry what more do you want land companies what do you want you amaze me joseph even now in extremis you try to make bargains what a loss you are what a terrible loss i could have made you great i am great you know better than that pilgrim he said gently what would you have been without me with your glib tongue and your fancy suits an actor a car salesman a thief whitehead flinched not just at the taunts the steam had become uneasy behind mamoulian as if ghosts had begun to move in it you were nothing at least have the good grace to admit that i took you on whitehead pointed out oh yes said mamoulian you had appetite i grant you you had that in abundance you needed me whitehead retorted the european had wounded him now despite his better judgment he wanted to wound in return this was his world after all the european was a trespasser here unarmed unaided and he had asked for the truth to be told well hed hear it ghosts or no ghosts why would i need you mamoulian asked there was sudden contempt in his tone what are you worth whitehead held off answering for a moment and then he was spilling the words careless of the consequences to live for you because you were too bloodless to do it for yourself that was why you picked me up to taste it all through me the women the power all of it no youre looking sick mamoulian he called the european by his name see that god the ease of it he called the bastard by his name and he didnt look away when those eyes glinted because he was telling the truth here wasnt he they both knew it mamoulian was pale almost insipid drained of the will to live suddenly whitehead began to know he could win this confrontation if he was clever dont try to fight mamoulian said i will have my due which is you your death your soul for want of a better word you had all i owed you and more years ago that wasnt the bargain pilgrim we all make deals and then change the rules thats not playing the game there is only one game you taught me that as long as i win that one the rest dont matter i will have whats mine mamoulian said with quiet determination its a foregone conclusion why not just have me killed you know me joseph i want this to finish cleanly im granting you time to organize your affairs to close the books clean the slates give the land back to those you stole it from i didnt take you for a communist im not here to debate politics i came to tell you my terms so whitehead thought the execution date is a while away he quickly put all thoughts of escape out of his head for fear the european sniff them out mamoulian had reached into his jacket pocket the mutilated hand brought out a large envelope folded on itself you will dispose of your assets in strict accordance with these directions all to friends of yours presumably i have no friends its fine by me whitehead shrugged im glad to be rid of it didnt i warn you it would become burdensome ill give it all away become a saint if you like will you be satisfied then as long as you die pilgrim the european said no you and i together ill die in my time whitehead said not in yours you wont want to go alone behind the european the ghosts were getting restless the steam simmered with them im not going anywhere whitehead said he thought he glimpsed faces in the billows perhaps defiance wasnt wise he decided wheres the harm he muttered halfstanding to ward off whatever the steam contained the sauna lights were dimming mamoulians eyes shone in the deepening murk and there was illumination spilling up from his throat too staining the air the ghosts were taking substance from it growing more palpable by the second stop whitehead begged but it was a vain hope the sauna had vanished the steam was discharging its passengers whitehead could feel their prickling gaze on him only now did he feel naked he bent for the towel and when he stood upright again mamoulian had gone he clutched the towel to his groin he could feel how the ghosts in the darkness smirked at his breasts at his shrunken pudenda at the sheer absurdity of his old flesh they had known him in rarer times when the chest had been broad the pudenda arrogant the flesh impressive whether naked or dressed mamoulian he murmured hoping the european might yet undo this misery before it got out of control but nobody answered his appeal he took a faltering step across the slippery tiles toward the door if the european had gone then he could simply walk out of the place find strauss and a room where he could hide but the ghosts werent finished with him yet the steam which had darkened to a bruise lifted a little and in its depths something shimmered he couldnt make sense of it at first the uncertain whiteness the fluttering as of snowflakes then from nowhere a breeze it belonged to the past and smelled of it of ash and brick dust of the dirt on bodies unwashed for decades of burning hair of anger but there was another smell that wove between these and when he breathed it the significance of that shimmering air came clear and he forsook the towel and covered his eyes tears and pleas coming and coming but the ghosts pressed in nevertheless carrying the scent of petals with them carys stood on the small landing outside martys room and listened from inside there came the sound of steady sleep she hesitated a momentunsure of whether or not to go inthen slipped down the stairs again leaving him unwoken it was too convenient to slide into bed beside him to weep into the crook of his neck where his pulse ticked to unburden herself of all her fretting and beg him to be strong for her convenient and dangerous it wasnt real safety there in his bed shed find that by herself and in herself nowhere else halfway down the second flight of stairs she stopped there was a curious tingle in the darkened hallway a chill of night air and more she waited shadowthin on the stairs until her eyes accustomed themselves to the dark perhaps she should just go back upstairs lock her bedroom door behind her and find a few pills to while away the hours until the sun came up it would be so much easier than living as she was with every nerve electric along the hall toward the kitchen she caught a movement a black bulk was framed against the doorway and then gone its just the dark she told herself playing tricks she smoothed her hand over the wall feeling the design of the wallpaper ripple under her fingertips until she found the light switch she flipped it on the corridor was empty the stairway at her back was empty the landing was empty she muttered stupid to herself and padded down the last three stairs and along the corridor to the kitchen before she got there her suspicions about the chill were confirmed the back door was in direct line with the kitchen door and both were open it was odd almost shocking in fact to see the house which was usually hermetically sealed exposed to the night the open door was like a wound in its flank she stepped through from the carpeted hallway onto the cool linoleum of the kitchen and was halfway to closing the door when she caught the glass glinting on the floor the door had not been left open accidentally somebody had forced his way in a smellsandalwoodwas pricking her nostrils it was sickly but what it covered was sicklier still she had to inform marty that was the first priority no need to go back upstairs there was a phone on the kitchen wall her mind divided part of her coolly assessed the problem and its solutions where the phone was what she must say to marty when he answered it another part the part that embraced h that was always frightened dissolved in panic theres somebody close it said somebody lethal in the dark rotting in the dark the cooler self kept control she walkedglad now to be barefoot because she made scarcely a soundacross to the phone she picked up the receiver and dialed nineteen the number of martys bedroom it rang once then again she willed him to wake quickly her reserves of control were she knew strictly limited come on come on she breathed then there was a sound behind her heavy feet crunched the glass into smaller pieces she turned to see who it was and there was a nightmare standing in the doorway with a knife in his hand and a dogskin slung over one shoulder the phone slipped from her fingers and the part of her that had advised panic all along took the reins told you so it shouted told you so a phone rang in martys dreams he dreamed he woke put it to his ear and spoke to death on the other end of the line but the ringing went on even though hed picked the phone up and he surfaced from sleep to find the receiver in his hand and no one on the line he put it back in its cradle had it rung at all he thought not still the dream wasnt worth going back to his conversation with death had been gobbledygook swinging his legs out of bed he pulled on his jeans and was at the door blearyeyed when from downstairs there came the crash of breaking glass the butcher had lurched toward herthrowing off the dogs skin to make an embrace easier she ducked him once twice he was ponderous but she knew if he once got his hands on her that was the end he was between her and the exit into the house now she was obliged to maneuver her way toward the back door i wouldnt go out there he advised his voice like his smell mixing sweetness and rot its not safe his warning was the best recommendation shed heard she slipped around the kitchen table and out through the open door trying to skip across the glass shards she contrived to pull the door closed behind hermore glass fell and shatteredand then she was away from the house behind her she heard the door pulled open so roughly it might have been wrenched off its hinges now she heard the dogkillers footstepsthunder in the groundcoming after her the brute was slow she was nimble he was heavy she was light to the point of invisibility instead of clinging to the walls of the house which would only take her around to the front eventually where the lawn was illuminated she struck out away from the building and hoped to god the beast couldnt see in the dark marty stumbled down the stairs still shaking sleep from his head the cold in the hall slapped him fully awake he followed the draft to the kitchen he only had a few seconds to take in the glass and the blood on the floor before carys started screaming from some unimaginable place someone cried out whitehead heard the voice a girls voice but lost as he was in a wilderness he couldnt fix the cry he had no idea how long hed been weeping here watching the damned come and go it seemed an age his head swam with hyperventilation his throat was hoarse with sobs mamoulian he pleaded again dont leave me here the european had been righthe didnt want to go alone into this nowhere though he had begged to be saved from it a hundred times without result now at last the illusion began to relent the tiles like shy white crabs scuttled back into place at his feet the smell of his own stale sweat reassaulted him more welcome than any scent hed ever smelled and now the european was here in front of him as if he had never moved shall we talk pilgrim he asked whitehead was shivering despite the heat his teeth chattered yes he said quietly with dignity and politeness again yes you didnt like what you saw whitehead ran his fingers across his pasty face his thumb and forefinger digging into the pits at the bridge of his nose as if to push the sights out no damn you he said the images would not be dislodged not now not ever perhaps we could talk somewhere else the european suggested dont you have a room we could retire to i heard carys she screamed mamoulian closed his eyes for a moment fetching a thought from the girl shes quite all right he said dont hurt her please shes all ive got theres no harm done she simply found a piece of my friends handiwork breer had not only skinned the dog hed disemboweled it carys had slipped in the muck of its innards and the scream had escaped before she could stop herself when its reverberations died she listened for the butchers footsteps somebody was running in her direction carys it was martys voice im over here he found her staring down at the dogs skinned head who the fuck did this he snapped hes here she said he followed me out he touched her face are you all right its only a dead dog she said it was just a shock as they returned to the house she remembered the dream shed woken from thered been a faceless man crossing this very lawnwere they treading in his footprints nowwith a surf of shit at his heels theres somebody else here she said with absolute certainty besides the dogkiller sure she nodded face stony then took martys arm this ones worse babe ive got a gun its in my room theyd come to the kitchen door the dogs skin still lay discarded beside it do you know who they are he asked her she shook her head hes fat was all she could say stupidlooking and the other one you know him the other of course she knew him he was as familiar as her own face she had thought of him a thousand times a day in the last weeks something told her she had always known him he was the architect who paraded in her sleep who dabbled his fingers at her neck who had come now to unleash the flood of filth that had followed him across the lawn was there ever a time when she hadnt lived in his shadow what are you thinking he was giving her such a sweet look trying to put a heroic face on his confusion ill tell you sometime she said now we should get that damn gun they threaded their way through the house it was absolutely still no bloody footsteps no cries he fetched the gun from his room now for papa he said check that hes all right with the dogkiller still loose the search was stealthy and therefore slow whitehead wasnt in any of the bedrooms or his dressing rooms the bathrooms the library the study and the lounges were similarly deserted it was carys who suggested the sauna marty flung the door of the steam room open a wall of humid heat met his face and steam curled out into the hallway the place had certainly been used recently but the steam room the jacuzzi and solarium were all empty when hed made a quick search of the rooms he came back to find carys leaning unsteadily on the doorjamb i suddenly feel sick she said it just came over me marty supported her as her legs gave sit down for a minute he guided her across to a bench there was a gun on it sweating im all right she insisted you go and find papa ill stay here you look bloody awful thank you she said now will you please go id prefer to throw up with nobody watching if you dont mind you sure go on damn you leave me be ill be fine lock the door after me he stressed yes sir she said throwing him a queasy look he left her in the steam room and waited until he heard the bolt drawn across it didnt completely reassure him but it was better than nothing he cautiously made his way back into the vestibule and decided to take a quick look around the front of the house the lawn lights were on and if the old man were there hed soon be picked out that made marty an easy target too of course but at least he was armed he unlocked the front door and stepped out onto the gravel the floodlights poured unflinching illumination down it was whiter than sunlight but curiously dead he scanned the lawn to right and left there was no sign of the old man behind him in the hallway breer watched the hero stride out in search of his master only when he was well out of sight did the razoreater slouch out of hiding and lope bloodyhanded toward his hearts desire having bolted the door carys returned groggily to the bench and concentrated on controlling her mutinous system she wasnt certain what had brought the nausea on but she was determined to get the better of it when she had shed go after marty and help him search for papa the old man had been here recently that much was apparent that hed left without his gun did not augur well an insinuating voice stirred her from her meditation and she looked up there was a smudge in the steam in front of her a paleness projected onto the air she squinted to try to make sense of it it seemed to have the texture of white dots she stood up andfar from vanishingthe illusion strengthened filaments were spreading to connect one dot to the next and she almost laughed with recognition as all at once the puzzle came clear it was blossom she was looking at brilliant white heads of it caught in sun or starlight twitched by some sourceless wind the branches threw down flurries of petals they seemed to graze her face though when she put her fingers to the places there was nothing there in her years of addiction to h shed never dreamed an image that was so superficially benign and yet so charged with threat it wasnt hers this tree she hadnt made it from her own head it belonged to someone whod been here before her the architect no doubt hed shown this spectacle to papa and its echoes lingered she tried to look away around to the door but her eyes were glued to the tree she couldnt seem to unfix them she had the impression that the blossom was swelling as if more buds were coming into bloom the blankness of the treeits horrid puritywas filling her eyes the whiteness congealing and fattening and then somewhere beneath these swaying laden branches a figure moved a woman with burning eyes lifted her broken head in carys direction her presence brought the nausea back carys felt faint this wasnt the time to lose consciousness not with the blossom still bursting and the woman beneath the tree moving out of hiding toward her she had been beautiful this one and used to admiration but chance had intervened the body had been cruelly maimed the beauty spoiled when finally she emerged from hiding carys knew her as her own mama evangeline whitehead opened her arms and offered her daughter an embrace she had never offered while alive in death had she discovered the capacity to love as well as be loved no never the open arms were a trap carys knew it if she fell into them the tree and its maker would have her forever her head thundering she forced herself to look away her limbs were like jelly she wondered if she had the strength to move unsteadily she craned her head toward the door to her shock she saw that it was wide open the bolt had been wrenched off as the door was beaten open marty she said no she turned again this time to her left and the dogkiller was standing no more than two yards from her he had washed his hands and face of bloodstains and he smelled strongly of perfume youre safe with me he said she glanced back at the tree it was dissolving its illusory life dispersed by the brutes interruption carys mother arms still outstretched was growing thin and wretched at the last instant before she disappeared she opened her mouth and vomited a stream of black blood toward her daughter then the tree and its horrors were gone there was only the steam and the tiles and a man with dogs blood under his fingernails standing beside her shed heard nothing of his forced entry the reverie at the tree had muted the outside world you shouted he explained i heard you shout she didnt remember doing so i want marty she told him no he replied politely where is he she demanded and made a move albeit weakly toward the open door i said no he stepped in her path he didnt need to touch her his very proximity was sufficient to halt her she contemplated trying to slip by him and out into the hallway but how far could she get before he caught her there were two basic rules when dealing with mad dogs and psychotics the first dont run the second show no fear when he reached out toward her she tried not to recoil i wont let anybody hurt you he said he ran the ball of his thumb across the back of her hand finding a speck of sweat there and brushing it away his stroke was featherlight and icecold will you let me look after you pretty he asked she said nothing his touch appalled her not for the first time tonight she wished she werent a sensitive shed never felt such distress at another humans touch i would like to make you comfortable he was saying share he stopped as though the words escaped him your secrets she looked up into his face the muscles of his jaw fluttered as he made his proposals nervous as an adolescent and in return he proposed ill show you my secrets you want to see he didnt wait for an answer his hand had plunged into the pocket of his stained jacket and was taking out a clutch of razors their edges glinted it was too absurd like a fairground sideshow but played without the razzmatazz this clown smelling of sandalwood was about to eat razors to win her love he put out his dry tongue and laid the first blade on it she didnt like this one bit razors made her nervous and always had dont she said its all right he told her swallowing hard im the last of the tribe see he opened his mouth and put out his tongue all gone extraordinary she said it was revolting but extraordinary thats not all he said pleased by her response it was best to let him go on with this bizarre display she reasoned the longer he took showing her these perversities the more chance there was of marty coming back what else can you do she asked he let go of her hand and started to unbuckle his belt ill show you he replied unbuttoning oh christ she thought stupid stupid stupid his arousal at this exhibition was absolutely plain even before he had his trousers down im past pain now he explained courteously no pain whatever i do to myself the razoreater feels nothing he was naked beneath his trousers see he said proudly she saw his groin was completely shaved and the region sported an arrayof selfinflicted adornments hooks and rings transfixing the fat of his lower belly and his genitals his testicles bristled with needles touch me he invited no thank you she said he frowned his upper lip curled to expose teeth that in his pale flesh looked bright yellow i want you to touch me he said and reached for her breer the razoreater stood absolutely still only his eyes flickered let her alone she knew the voice too well it was the architect of course her dreamguide i didnt hurt her breer mumbled did i tell him i didnt hurt you cover yourself up the european said breer hoisted up his trousers like a boy caught masturbating and moved away from carys throwing her a conspiratorial glance only now did the speaker come into the steam room he was taller than shed dreamed hed be and more doleful im sorry he said his tone was that of the perfect maitre d apologizing for a gauche waiter she was sick breer said thats why i broke in sick talking to the wall he blustered calling after her mother the architect understood the observation immediately he looked at carys keenly so you saw he said what was it nothing you need ever suffer again he replied my mother was there evangeline forget it all he said that horrors for others not for you listening to his calm voice was mesmeric she found it difficult to recall her nightmares of nullity his presence canceled memory i think perhaps you should come with me he said why your fathers going to die carys oh she said she felt utterly removed from herself fears were a thing of the past in his courteous presence if you stay here youll only suffer with him and theres no need for that it was a seductive offer never to live under the old mans thumb again never to endure his kisses that tasted so old carys glanced at breer dont be afraid of him the architect reassured her laying a hand on the back of her neck he is nothing and no one youre safe with me she could run away breer protested when the european had let carys go off to her room to gather up her belongings she will never leave me mamoulian replied i mean her no harm and she knows it i rocked her once in these arms naked was she a tiny thing so vulnerable his voice dropped to a nearwhisper she deserved better than him breer said nothing simply lolled insolently against the wall peeling dried blood from under his nails with a razor he was deteriorating faster than the european had anticipated hed hoped breer would survive until all of this chaos was over but knowing the old man hed wheedle and prevaricate and what should have taken days would occupy weeks by which time the razoreaters condition would be poor indeed the european felt weary finding and controlling a substitute for breer would be a drain on his already depleted energies presently carys came downstairs in some ways he regretted losing his spy in the enemy camp but there were too many variables remaining if he didnt take her for one she had knowledge of him deeper knowledge than she was perhaps aware of she knew instinctively his terrors of the flesh witness the way she had driven him out when she and strauss had been together she knew too his weariness his dwindling faith but there was another reason to take her whitehead had said that she was his only comfort if they took her now the pilgrim would be alone and that would be agony mamoulian trusted it would prove unendurable after searching as much of the grounds as was lit by the floodlights and finding no sign of whitehead marty went back upstairs it was time to break whiteheads commandment and look for the old man in forbidden territory the door to the room at the end of the top corridor beyond carys and whiteheads bedrooms was closed heart in mouth marty approached and tapped on it sir at first there was no sound from within then came whiteheads voice vague as if woken from sleep who is it strauss sir come in marty pushed the door gently and it swung open when he had imagined the interior of this room it had always been a treasure house but the truth was quite the reverse the room was spartan its white walls and its spare furnishings a chilly spectacle it did boast one treasure an altarpiece stood against one of the bare walls its richness quite out of place in such an austere setting its central panel was a crucifixion of sublime sadism all gold and blood its owner sat dressed in an opulent dressing gown at the far end of the room behind a large table he looked at marty with neither welcome nor accusation on his face his body slumped in the chair like a sack dont stand in the doorway man come in marty closed the door behind him i know what you told me sir about never coming up here but i was afraid something had happened to you im alive whitehead said spreading his hands alls well the dogs are dead i know sit he gestured to the empty chair opposite him across the table shouldnt i call the police theres no need they could still be on the premises whitehead shook his head theyve gone sit down martin pour yourself a glass of wine you look as if youve been running hard marty pulled out the chair that had been neatly placed under the table and sat down the unadorned bulb that burned in the middle of the room threw an unflattering light on everything heavy shadows ghastly highlights a ghost show put down the gun you wont be needing it he lay the weapon down on the table beside the plate on which there were still several waferthin slices of meat beyond the plate a bowl of strawberries partially devoured and a glass of water the frugality of the meal matched the environment the meat sliced to the point of transparency rare and moist the casual arrangement of cups and strawberry bowl an arbitrary precision invested everything an eerie sense of chance beauty between marty and whitehead a mote of dust turned in the air fluctuating between the light bulb and table its direction influenced by the merest exhalation try the meat martin im not hungry its superb my guest brought it you know who they are then yes of course now eat reluctantly marty cut a piece of the slice in front of him and tasted it the texture dissolved on the tongue delicate and appetizing finish it off whitehead said marty did as the old man had invited the nights exertions had given him an appetite a glass of red wine was poured for him he drank it down your heads full of questions no doubt whitehead said please ask away ill do my best to answer who are they he asked friends they broke in like assassins is it not possible that friends with time can become assassins marty hadnt been prepared for that particular paradox one of them sat where youre sitting now how can i be your bodyguard if i dont know your friends from your enemies whitehead paused and looked hard at marty do you care he asked after a beat youve been good to me marty replied insulted by the inquiry what kind of coldhearted bastard do you take me for my god whitehead shook his head marty explain to me i want to help explain what how you can invite a man who wants to kill you to eat dinner with you whitehead watched the dust mote turning between them he either thought the question beneath contempt or had no answer for it you want to help me he said eventually then bury the dogs is that all im good for the time may come so you keep telling me marty said standing up he wasnt going to get any answers that much was apparent just meat and good wine tonight that wasnt enough can i go now he asked and without waiting for a reply turned his back on the old man and went to the door as he opened it whitehead said forgive me very quietly so quietly in fact that marty wasnt sure whether the words were intended for him or not he closed the door behind him and went back through the house to check that the intruders had indeed gone they had the steam room was empty carys had obviously returned to her room feeling insolent he slipped into the study and poured himself a treble whisky from the decanter and then sat in whiteheads chair by the window sipping and thinking the alcohol did nothing for the clarity of his mind it simply dulled the ache of frustration he felt he slipped away to bed before dawn described the ragged bundles of fur on the lawn too distinctly vii no limits it was no morning for burying dead dogs the sky was too high and promising jets trailing vapor crossed to america the woods budded and winged with life still the work had to be done however inappropriate only by the uncompromising light of day was it possible to see the full extent of the slaughter in addition to killing the dogs around the house the intruders had broken into the kennels and systematically murdered all its occupants including bella and her offspring when marty arrived at the kennels lillian was already there she looked as though shed been weeping for days in her hands she cradled one of the pups its head had been crushed as if in a vise look she said proffering the corpse marty hadnt managed to eat anything for breakfast the thought of the job ahead had taken the edge off his appetite now he wished hed forced something down his empty belly echoed on itself he felt almost lightheaded if only id been here she said you probably would have ended up dead yourself he told her it was the simple truth she laid the pup back on the straw and stroked the matted fur of bellas body marty was more fastidious than she even wearing a pair of thick leather gloves he didnt want to touch the corpses but whatever he lacked in respect he made up for in efficiency using his disgust as a spur to hurry the work along lillian though she had insisted on being there to help was useless in the face of the fact all she could do was watch while marty wrapped the bodies in black plastic refuse bags loaded the forlorn parcels into the back of the jeep and then drove this makeshift hearse across to a clearing hed chosen in the woods it was here that they were to be buried at whiteheads request out of sight of the house hed brought two spades hoping that lillian would assist but she was clearly incapable he was left to do it singlehanded while she stood hands thrust into the pockets of her filthy anorak staring at the leaking bundles it was difficult work the soil was a network of roots crisscrossing from tree to tree and marty soon worked up a sweat hacking at the roots with the blade of his spade once hed dug a shallow grave he rolled the bodies into it and began to shovel the earth back on top of them it rattled on their plastic shrouds a dry rain when the filling was done he patted the soil into a rough mound im going back to the house for a beer he told lillian you coming she shook her head last respects she muttered he left her among the trees and headed back across the lawn to the house as he walked he thought of carys she must be awake by now surely though the curtains at the window were still drawn how fine to be a bird he thought to peer through the gap in the curtains and spy on her stretching naked on the bed sloth that she was her arms thrown up above her head fur at her armpits fur where her legs met he walked into the house wearing a smile and an erection he found pearl in the kitchen told her he was hungry and went upstairs to shower when he came down again she had a cold spread laid out for him beef bread tomatoes he dug in with a will seen carys this morning he asked mouth crammed no she replied she was at her most uncommunicative today her face pinched up with some fermenting grievance he wondered watching her move around the kitchen what she was like in bed for some reason he was full of dirty thoughts today as if his mind refusing to be depressed by the burial was eager for uplifting sport chewing on a mouthful of salted beef he said was it veal you fed the old man last night pearl didnt look up from her labors as she said he didnt eat last night i left fish for him but he didnt touch it but he had meat marty said i finished it off for him and strawberries he must have come down and got those for himself always strawberries she said hell choke on them one of these days now marty came to think of it whitehead had said something about his guest providing the meat it was good whatever it was he said none of my doing pearl said offended as a wife discovering her husbands adultery marty put the conversation to rest it was no use trying to raise her spirits when she was in this kind of mood the meal finished he went up to carys room the house was pindrop still after the lethal farce of the previous night it had regained its composure the pictures that lined the staircase the carpets underfoot all conspired against any rumor of distress chaos here was as unthinkable as a riot in an art gallery all precedent forbade it he knocked on carys door lightly there was no answer so he knocked again more loudly this time carys perhaps she didnt want to speak to him hed never been able to predict from one day to the next whether they were lovers or enemies her ambiguities no longer distressed him however it was her way of testing him he guessed and it was fine by him as long as she finally admitted that she loved him more than any other fucker on the face of the earth he tried the handle the door wasnt locked the room beyond was empty not only did it not contain carys it contained no trace of her existence there her books her toiletries her clothes her ornaments everything that marked out the room as hers had been removed the sheets had been stripped from the bed the pillowcases from the pillow the bare mattress looked desolate marty closed the door and started downstairs hed asked for explanations more than once and hed been granted precious few but this was too much he wished to god toy was still around at least hed treated marty as a thinking animal luther was back in the kitchen his feet up on the table among a clutter of unwashed dishes pearl had clearly left her province to the barbarians wheres carys was martys first question you never quit do you luther said he stubbed out his cigarette on martys lunch plate and turned a page of his magazine marty felt detonation approaching hed never liked luther but hed taken months of sly remarks from the bastard because the system forbade the kind of response he really wanted to give now that system was crumbling rapidly toy gone dogs dead heels on the kitchen table who the hell cared any longer if he beat luther to pulp i want to know where carys is no lady by that name here marty took a step toward the table luther seemed to sense that his repartee had gone sour he slung down the magazine the smile disappeared dont get edgy man where is she he smoothed the page in front of him palm down across the sleek nude shes gone he said where gone man thats all you deaf stupid or both marty crossed the kitchen in one second flat and hauled luther out of his chair like most spontaneous violence there was no grace in it the ragged attack threw them both offbalance luther halffell back an outflung arm catching a coffee cup which leaped and smashed as they staggered across the kitchen finding his balance first luther brought his knee up into martys groin jesus you get your fucking hands off me man luther yelled panicked by the outburst i dont want no fight with you right the demands became a plea for sanitycome on man calm down marty replied by launching himself at the other man fists flying a blow more chance than intention connected with luthers face and marty followed through with three or four punches to stomach and chest luther stepping back to avoid this assault slid in cold coffee and fell breathless and bloodied he stayed down on the floor where he was safe while marty eyes streaming from the blow to his balls rubbed his aching hands just tell me where she is he gasped luther spat out a wad of bloodtinted phlegm before speaking youre out of your fucking mind man you know that i dont know where shes gone ask the big white father hes the one who feeds her fucking heroin of course in that revelation lay the answer to half a dozen mysteries it explained her reluctance to leave the old man it explained her lassitude too that inability to see beyond the next day the next fix and you supply the stuff is that it maybe i do but i never addicted her man i never did that that was him all along it was him he did it to keep her to fucking keep her bastard it was spoken with genuine contempt what kind of father does that i tell you that fucker could teach us both a few lessons in dirty tricks he paused to finger the inside of his mouth he clearly had no intention of standing up again until martys bloodlust had subsided i dont ask no questions he said all i know is i had to clear out her room this morning wheres her stuff gone he didnt answer for several seconds burned most of it he said finally in gods name why old mans orders you finished marty nodded ive finished you and i luther said we never liked each other from the start you know why why were both shit he said grimly worthless shit except i know what i am i can even live with it but you you poor bastard you think if you brownnose around long enough one of these days someones going to forgive you your trespasses marty snorted mucus into his hand and wiped it on his jeans truth hurt luther jibed all right marty came back if youre so good with the truth maybe you can tell me whats going on around here i told you i dont ask questions you never wondered of course i fucking wondered i wondered every day i brought the kid dope or saw the old man sweat when it started to get dark but why should there be any sense to it hes a lunatic thats your answer he lost his marbles when his wife went too sudden he couldnt take it hes been out of his mind ever since and thats enough to explain everything thats going on luther wiped a spot of bloody spittle off his chin with the back of his hand hear no evil speak no evil see no evil he said im no monkey marty replied it wasnt until the middle of the evening that the old man would consent to see marty by that time the edge had been taken off his anger which was presumably the intention of the delay whitehead had forsaken the study and the chair by the window tonight he sat in the library instead the only lamp that burned in the room had been placed a little way behind his chair as a consequence it was almost impossible to see his face and his voice was so drained of color that no clue to his mood could be caught from it but marty had halfexpected the theatrics and was prepared for them there were questions to be asked and he wasnt about to be intimidated into silence wheres carys he demanded the head moved a little in the cove of the chair the hands closed a book on his lap and placed it on the table one of the science fiction paperbacks light reading for a dark night what business is it of yours whitehead wanted to know marty thought hed predicted all the responsesbribery prevaricationbut this question throwing the onus of inquiry back onto him he hadnt expected it begged other questions did whitehead know about his relationship with carys for instance hed tortured himself all afternoon with the idea that shed told him everything gone to the old man after that first night and the subsequent nights to report his every clumsiness every naпvetй i need to know he said well i see no reason why you shouldnt be told the dead voice replied though god knows its a private hurt still there are very few people i have left to confide in marty tried to locate whiteheads eyes but the light behind the chair dazzled him all he could do was listen to the even modulation of the voice and try to dig out the implications beneath the flow shes been taken away marty at my request somewhere where her problems can be dealt with in a proper manner the drugs you must have realized her addiction has worsened considerably in the last few weeks i had hoped to contain it by giving her enough to keep her content while slowly reducing her supply it was working too until recently he sighed a hand went up to his face ive been stupid i should have conceded defeat a long time ago and sent her to a clinic but i didnt want to have her taken from me it was as simple as that then last nightour visitors the slaughter of the dogsi realized how selfish i was subjecting her to such pressures its too late in the day for possessiveness or pride if people find out my daughters a junkie then so be it i see you were fond of her yes shes a beautiful girl and youre lonely she spoke warmly of you in time well have her back amongst us im sure id like to visit her again in time im told they demand isolation in the first few weeks of treatment but rest assured shes in good hands it was all so persuasive but lies surely lies carys room had been stripped was that in anticipation of her being amongst them again in a few weeks this was all another fiction before marty could protest however whitehead was speaking again a measured cadence youre so close to me now marty the way bill used to be in fact i really think you should be welcomed into the inner circle dont you im having a dinner party next sunday id like you to be there our guest of honor this was fine flattering talk effortlessly the old man had gained the upper hand in the week i think you should go down to london and buy yourself something decent to wear im afraid my dinner parties are rather formal he reached for the paperback again and opened it heres a check it lay in the fold of the book already signed ready for marty it should cover the price of a good suit shirts shoes whatever else you want to treat yourself to the check was proffered between fore and middle finger take it please marty stepped forward and took the check thank you it can be cashed at my bank in the strand theyll be expecting you whatever you dont spend i want you to gamble sir marty wasnt certain he was hearing the invitation properly i insist you gamble it marty horses cards whatever you like enjoy it would you do that for me and when you come back you can make an old man envious with tales of your adventures so it was bribery after all the fact of the check made marty more certain than ever that the old man was lying about carys but he lacked the courage to press the issue it wasnt just cowardice however that made him hold back it was burgeoning excitement he had been bribed twice once with the money again with the invitation to gamble it it was years since hed had a chance like this money in abundance and time on his hands the day might come when hed hate papa for waking the virus in his system but before then a fortune could be won and lost and won again he stood in front of the old man with the fever already on him youre a good man strauss whiteheads words rose from the shadowed chair like a prophets from a cleft rock though he couldnt see the potentates face marty knew he was smiling despite her years on the sunshine island carys had a healthy sense of reality or had until they took her to that cold bare house on caliban street there nothing was certain anymore it was mamoulians doing that perhaps was the only thing that was certain houses werent haunted only human minds whatever moved in the air there or flitted along the bare boards with the dust balls and the cockroaches whatever scintillated like light on water at the corners of her eyes it was all of mamoulians manufacture for three days after her arrival at the new house she had refused even to speak to her host or captor whichever he was she couldnt recall why shed come but she knew hed conned her into ithis mind breathing at her neckand shed resented his manipulations breer the fat one had brought her food and on the second day dope too but she wouldnt eat or say a word the room theyd locked her in was quite comfortable she had books and a television too but the atmosphere was too unstable for her to be at ease she couldnt read nor could she watch the inanities on the box sometimes she found it difficult to remember her own name it was as if his constant proximity was wiping her clean perhaps he could do that after all hed got into her head hadnt he surreptitiously wormed his way into her psyche god knows how many times hed been in her in her for christs sake and shed never known dont be frightened it was three am on the fourth day and another sleepless night he had come into her room so silently shed looked down to see if his feet were making contact with the floor i hate this place she informed him would you like to explore rather than being locked up in here its haunted she said expecting him to laugh at her he didnt however so she went on are you the ghost what i am is a mystery he replied even to myself his voice was softened by introspection but im no ghost you may be certain of that dont fear me carys anything you feel i share in some measure she remembered acutely this mans revulsion at the sex act what a pale sickly thing he was for all his powers she couldnt bring herself to hate him though she had reason enough i dont like to be used she said i did you no harm i do you no harm now do i i want to see marty mamoulian had started to try to clench his mutilated hand im afraid thats not possible he said the scar tissue of his hand pulled tight shone but the mishealed anatomy wouldnt give why not why wont you let me see him youll have everything you need ample supplies of food of heroin it suddenly crossed her mind that marty might be on the europeans execution list might in fact already be dead please dont harm him she said thieves come and thieves go he replied i cant be responsible for what happens to him ill never forgive you she said yes you will he replied his voice so soft now it was practically illusory im your protector now carys had i been allowed i would have nurtured you from childhood and you would have been spared the humiliations hes made you suffer but its too late all i can do is shelter you from further corruption he gave up trying to make a fist she saw how the wounded hand disgusted him he would cut it off if he could she thought its not just sex he loathes its flesh no more he said apropos of the hand or debate or nothing at all when he left her to sleep he didnt lock the door behind him the next day she began her exploration of the house there was nothing very remarkable about the place it was simply a large empty threestory house in the street beyond the dirty windows ordinary people passed by too locked in their heads even to glance around though her first instinct was to knock on the glass to mouth some appeal to them the urge was easily conquered by reason if she slipped away what would she be escaping from or to she had safety here of a kind and drugs though at first she resisted them they were too attractive to flush away down the toilet and after a few days of the pills she gave in to the heroin too it came in steady supply never too much never too little and always good stuff only breer the fat one upset her he would come some days and watch her his eyes sloppy in his head like partially poached eggs she told mamoulian about him and the next day he didnt linger just brought the pills and hurried away and the days flowed into one another and sometimes she didnt remember where she was or how shed got here sometimes she remembered her name sometimes not once maybe twice she tried to think her way to marty but he was too far from her either that or the house subdued her powers whichever her thoughts lost their way a few miles from caliban street and she returned there sweating and afraid she had been in the house almost a week when things took a turn for the worse id like you to do something for me the european said what id like you to find mr toy you do remember mr toy of course she remembered not well but she remembered his broken nose those cautious eyes that had always looked at her so sadly do you think you could locate him i dont know how to let your mind go to him you know the way carys why cant you do it because hell be expecting me hell have defenses and im too tired to fight with him at the moment is he afraid of you probably why you were a babe in arms when mr toy and i last met he and i parted as enemies he presumes we are still enemies youre going to harm him she said thats my business carys she stood sliding up the wall against which shed been slumped i dont think i want to find him for you arent we friends no she said no never come now he stepped toward her the broken hand touched her the contact was featherlight i think you are a ghost she said she left him standing in the corridor and went up to the bathroom to think this through locking the door behind her she knew without a shadow of a doubt that hed harm toy if she led him to the man carys he said quietly he was outside the bathroom door his proximity made her scalp creep you cant make me she said dont tempt me suddenly the europeans face loomed in her head he spoke again i knew you before you could walk carys ive held you in my arms often youve sucked on my thumb he was speaking with his lips close to the door his low voice reverberated in the wood she had her back against its no fault of yours or mine that we were parted believe me im glad you carry your fathers gifts because he never used them he never once understood the wisdom there was to be found with them he squandered it all for fame for wealth but you i could teach you carys such things the voice was so seductive it seemed to reach through the door and enfold her the way his arms had so many years ago she was suddenly minute in his grasp he cooed at her made foolish faces to bring a cherubic smile to bloom just find toy for me is it so much to ask for all my favors to you she found herself rocking with the rhythm of his cradling toy never loved you he was saying nobody has ever loved you that was a lie and a tactical error the words were cold water on her sleepy face she was loved marty loved her the runner her runner mamoulian sensed his miscalculation dont defy me he said the cooing had gone from his voice go to hell she replied as you wish there was a falling note in his words as though the issue was closed and done with he didnt leave his station by the door however she felt him close was he waiting for her to tire and come out she wondered persuasion by physical violence wasnt his style surely unless he was going to use breer she hardened herself against the possibility shed claw his watery eyes out minutes passed and she was sure the european was still outside though she could hear neither movement or breath and then the pipes began to rumble somewhere in the system a tide was moving the sink made a sucking sound the water in the toilet bowl splashed the toilet lid flapped open and slammed closed again as a gust of fetid air was discharged from below this was his doing somehow though it seemed a vacuous exercise the toilet farted again the smell was noxious whats happening she asked under her breath a gruel of filth had started to seep over the lip of the toilet and dribble onto the floor wormy shapes moved in it she shut her eyes this was a fabrication conjured up by the european to subdue her mutiny she would ignore it but even with canceled sight the illusion persisted the water splashed more loudly as the flood rose and in the stream she heard wet heavy things flopping onto the bathroom floor well said mamoulian she cursed the illusions and their charmer in one vitriolic breath something skittered across her bare foot she was damned if she was going to open her eyes and give him another sense to assault but curiosity forced them open the dribbles from the toilet had become a stream as if the sewers had backed up and were discharging their contents at her feet not simply excrement and water the soup of hot dirt had bred monsters creatures that could be found in no sane zoology things that had been fish once crabs once fetuses flushed down clinic drains before their mothers could wake to scream beasts that fed on excrement whose bodies were a pun on what they devoured everywhere in the silt forsaken stuff offal and dregs raised itself on queasy limbs and flapped and paddled toward her make them go away she said they had no intention of retreat the scummy tide still edged forward the fauna the toilet was vomiting up were getting larger find toy the voice on the other side of the door bargained her sweaty hands slid on the handle but the door refused to open there was no hint of a reprieve let me out just say yes she flattened herself against the door the toilet lid flew open in the strongest gust yet and this time stayed open the flood thickened and the pipes creaked as something that was almost too large for them began to force its way toward the light she heard its claws rake the sides of the pipes she heard the chatter of its teeth say yes no a glistening arm was thrown up from the belching bowl and flailed around until its digits fixed on the sink then it began to haul itself up its waterrotted bones rubbery please she screamed just say yes yes yes anything yes as she spat out the words the handle of the door moved she turned her back on the emerging horror and put her weight down on the handle at the same time as her other hand fumbled with the key behind her she heard the sound of a body contorting itself to fetch itself free she turned the key the wrong way and then the right muck splashed on her shin it was almost at her heels as she opened the door sodden fingers snatched at her ankle but she threw herself out of the bathroom before it could catch her and onto the landing slamming the door behind her mamoulian his victory won had gone after that she couldnt bring herself to go back into the bathroom at her request the razoreater supplied a bucket for her to use which he brought and took away again with reverence the european never spoke of the incident again there was no need that night she did as he had asked her she opened up her head and went to look for bill toy and within a matter of minutes she found him so soon after did the last european not since the halcyon days of his big wins at the casinos had marty possessed so much money as he did now two thousand pounds was no fortune to whitehead but it raised marty to blind heights perhaps the old mans story about carys had been a lie if so hed wheedle the truth out of him in time slowee slowee catchee monkey as feaver used to say what would feaver say to see marty now with money lapping at his feet he left the car near euston and caught a cab to the strand to cash the check then he went in search of a good evening suit whitehead had suggested an outfitter off regent street the fitters treated him with some brusqueness at first but once he showed them the color of his money the tune changed to sycophancy curbing his smiles marty played the fastidious buyer they fawned and fussed he let them only after threequarters of an hour of their fey attentions did he alight on something he liked a conservative choice but immaculately styled the suit and the accompanying wardrobeshoes shirts a selection of tiesbit more deeply into the cash than hed anticipated but he let it go like water through his fingers the suit and one set of accoutrements he took with him the rest he had sent to the sanctuary it was lunchtime when he emerged and he wandered around looking for somewhere to eat thered been a chinese restaurant on gerard street that he and charmaine had frequented whenever funds allowed he returned there now though its facade had been modernized to accommodate a large neon sign the interior was much the same the food as good as he remembered he sat in splendid isolation and ate and drank his way through the menu happy to play the rich man to the hilt he ordered half a dozen cigars after the meal downed several brandies and tipped like a millionaire papa would be proud of me he thought when he was full drunk and satisfied he headed out into the balmy afternoon it was time he followed the rest of whiteheads instructions he made his way through soho wandering for a few minutes until he found a betting office as he entered the smoky interior guilt assailed him but he told his spoilsport conscience to go hang he was obeying orders in coming here there were races at newmarket kempton park and doncastereach name evoked some bittersweet associationand he bet freely on every one on the board soon the old enthusiasm had killed the last smidgen of guilt it was like living this game but it tasted stronger it dramatized with its promised gains its tooeasy losses the sense he had had as a child of what adult life must be like of how once one grew out of boredom and into the secret bearded erectile world of manhood every word would be loaded with risk and promise every breath taken won in the face of extraordinary odds at first the money dribbled away from him he didnt bet heavily but the frequency of the losses began to dwindle his reserves then threequarters of an hour into the session things took a turn for the better horses he plucked from thin air romped home at ridiculous odds one after the other in one race he made back what hed lost in the previous two and more the enthusiasm turned to euphoria this was the very feeling hed tried so hard to describe to whiteheadof being in charge of chance finally the wins began to bore him pocketing his winnings without taking any proper account of them he left the money in his jacket was a thick wedge it ached to be spent on instinct he sauntered through the crowds to oxford street selected an expensive shop and bought a ninehundredpound fur coat for charmaine then hailed a cab to take it to her it was a slow journey the wageslaves were beginning to make their escape and the roads were snarled but his mood forbade irritation he had the taxi drop him off at the corner of the street because he wanted to walk the length of it things had changed since hed last been here two and a half months before early spring was now early summer now at almost six in the evening the warmth of the day hadnt dissipated there was growing time in it still nor he thought was it just the season that had advanced become riper he had too he felt real god in heaven that was it at last he was able to operate in the world again affect it shape it charmaine came to the door looking flustered she looked more flustered still when marty stepped in kissed her and put the coat box in her arms here i bought you something she frowned what is it marty take a look its for you no she said i cant the front door was still open she was ushering him back toward it or at least attempting to but he wouldnt go there was something beneath the look of embarrassment on her face anger panic even she pressed the box back at him unopened please go she said its a surprise he told her determined not to be repelled i dont want any surprises just go ring me tomorrow he wouldnt take the proffered box and it fell between them breaking open the sumptuous gleam of the coat spilled out she couldnt help but stoop to pick it up oh marty she whispered as he looked down at her gleaming hair someone appeared at the top of the stairs whats the problem marty looked up flynn was standing on the halflanding dressed only in underwear and socks he was unshaven for a few seconds he said nothing juggling the options then the smile his panacea swarmed across his face marty he exclaimed whats buzzing marty looked at charmaine who was looking at the floor she had the coat in her arms bundled up like a dead animal i see marty said flynn descended a few stairs his eyes were bloodshot its not what you think really it isnt he said stopping halfway down waiting to see which way marty would jump its exactly what you think marty charmaine said quietly im sorry you had to find out like this but you never rang i said ring before you come round how long marty murmured two years more or less marty glanced up at flynn theyd played together with that black girlursula was itonly a few weeks past and when the milk was spilt flynn had slid away hed come back here to charmaine had he washed marty wondered before hed joined charmaine in their double bed probably not why him he found himself asking why him for christs sake couldnt you have improved on that flynn said nothing in his own defense i think you should leave marty charmaine said clumsily attempting to rebox the coat hes such a shit marty said cant you see what a shit he is he was there she retorted bitterly you werent hes a fucking pimp for christs sake yes she said letting the box lie and standing up at last eyes furious to spit all the truth out yes thats right why do you think i took up with him no char hard times marty nothing to live on but fresh air and love letters shed whored for him the fucker had made her whore on the stairs flynn had gone a sickly color hold up marty he said no way did i make her do a damn thing she didnt want to do marty moved to the bottom of the stairs isnt that right flynn appealed to charmaine tell him woman did i make you do a thing you didnt want to do dont charmaine said but marty was already starting up the stairs flynn stood his ground for two steps only then retreated backward hey come on palms up to keep the blows at bay you made my wife a whore would i do that you made my wife a fucking whore flynn turned and made a bid for the landing marty stumbled up the stairs after him bastard the escape ploy worked flynn was safely behind the door and wedging a chair against it before marty could get to the landing all he could do was beat on the panels demanding uselessly that flynn let him in but it took only a small interruption to spoil his anger by the time charmaine got to the top of the stairs hed left off haranguing the door and was leaning back on the wall eyes stinging she said nothing she had neither the means nor the desire to cross the chasm between them him was all he could say of all people hes been very good to me she replied she had no intention of pleading their case marty was the intruder here she owed him no apology it wasnt as if i walked out it was your doing marty you lost for both of us i never got a say in the matter she was trembling he saw with fury not with sorrow you gambled everything we had every damn thing and lost it for us both were not dead im thirtytwo i feel twice that he makes you tired youre so stupid she said without feeling her cool contempt withered him you never saw how fragile everything was you just went on being the way it suited you to be stupid and selfish marty bit at his upper lip watching her mouth as it spoke the truth at him he wanted to hit her but that wouldnt make her any less right just bruised and right shaking his head he stepped past her and thundered down the stairs she was silent above he passed the box the discarded fur they could fuck on it he thought flynn would like that he picked up the bag containing his suit and left the glass in the window rattled he slammed the door so hard you can come out now charmaine said to the closed bedroom door the shootings over marty couldnt get one particular thought out of his head that shed told flynn all about him spilling the secrets of their life together he pictured flynn lying on the bed with his socks on stroking her and laughing as she poured out all the dirt how martyd spent all the money on horses or poker how hed never had a winning streak in his life that lasted more than five minutes how he was only good in bed on the infrequent occasions that hed won and uninterested the rest of the time how hed first lost the car to macnamara then the television then the best of the furniture and still owed a small fortune how hed then gone out and tried to steal his way out of debt even that had failed miserably he lived the pursuit again sharp as ever the car smelling of the shotgun nygaard was nursing the sweat on martys face pricking in his pores as it cooled in the draft from the open window fluttering up into his face like petals it was all so clear it might have happened yesterday everything since then almost a decade of his life pivoted on those few minutes it made him almost physically sick to think of it waste all waste it was time to get drunk the money he had left in his pocketstill well into four figureswas burning a hole demanding to be spent or gambled he wandered down to the commercial road and hailed another cab not entirely certain of what to do next it was barely seven the night ahead needed careful planning what would papa do he thought betrayed and shat on what would the great man do whatever his heart desired came the answer whatever his fucking heart desired he went to euston station and spent half an hour in the bathroom there washing and changing into the new shirt and new suit emerging transformed the clothes hed been wearing he gave to the attendant along with a tenpound note some of the old mellowness had crept back into his system by the time hed changed he liked what the mirror told him the evening might turn out to be a winner yet as long as he didnt whip it too hard he drank in covent garden enough to lace his blood and breath with spirits then had a meal in an italian restaurant when he came out the theaters were emptying he garnered a clutch of appreciative glances mostly from middleaged women and wellcoiffured young men i probably look like a gigolo he thought there was a disparity between his dress and his face that signaled a man playing a role the thought pleased him from now on he would play martin strauss man of the world with all the bravura he could muster being himself had not got him very far perhaps a fiction would improve his rate of advancement he idled down charing cross road and into the tangle of traffic and pedestrians at trafalgar square thered been a fight on the steps on st martinsinthefield two men were exchanging curses and accusations while their wives looked on off the square at the back of the mall the traffic quietened it took him several minutes to orient himself he knew where he was going and had thought he knew how to get there but now he wasnt so certain it was a long time since hed been in the area and when he eventually hit the small mews that contained the academybill toys clubit was more by chance than design his heart beat a little faster as he sauntered up the steps ahead lay a major piece of playacting which if it failed would ruin the evening he paused a moment to light a cigar then entered in his time hed frequented a number of highclass casinos this one had the same slightly passй grandeur as others hed been in darkwood paneling damson carpeting portraits of forgotten luminaries on the walls hand in trouser pocket jacket unbuttoned to reveal the gloss of the lining he crossed the mosaic foyer to the desk security would be tight the moneyed expected safety he wasnt a member nor could expect to become one on the spot not without sponsors and references the only way hed get a good nights gaming was by bluffing his way through the english rose at the desk smiled promisingly good evening sir how are you tonight her smile didnt falter for a moment even though she couldnt possibly know who he was well and you lovely night is bill here yet im sorry sir mr toy has he arrived yet mr toy she consulted the guest book running a lacquered finger down the list of tonights gamblers i dont think hes he wont have signed in marty said hes a member for gods sake the slight irritation in his voice took the girl offbalance oh i see i dont think i know him well no matter ill just go straight up tell him im at the tables will you wait sir i havent she reached out as if to tug at his sleeve but thought better of it he flashed her a disarming smile as he started up the stairs who shall i say mr strauss he said affecting a tiny barb of exasperation yes of course artificial recognition flooded her face im sorry mr strauss its just that no problem he replied benignly as he left her below staring up at him it took him only a few minutes to acquaint himself with the layout of the rooms roulette poker blackjack all and more were available the atmosphere was serious frivolity was not welcome where money could be won or lost on such a scale if the men and few women who haunted these hushed enclaves were here to enjoy themselves they showed no sign of it this was work hard serious work there were some quiet exchanges on the stairs and in the corridorsand of course calls from the tables otherwise the interior was almost reverentially subdued he sauntered from room to room standing on the fringe of one game then another familiarizing himself with the etiquette of the place nobody gave him more than a glance he fitted into this obsessives paradise too well anticipation of the moment when he eventually sat down to join a game exhilarated him he indulged it a while longer he had all night to enjoy after all and he knew only too well that the money in his pocket would disappear in minutes if he wasnt careful he went into the bar ordered a whisky and water and scanned his fellow drinkers they were all here for the same reason to pit their wits against chance most drank alone psyching themselves up for the games ahead later when fortunes had been won there might be dancing on the tables an impromptu striptease from a drunken mistress but it was early yet the waiter appeared a young man twenty at most with a mustache that looked drawn on hed already achieved that mixture of obsequiousness and superiority that marked his profession im sorry sir he said martys stomach lurched was somebody going to call his bluff yes scotch or bourbon sir oh er scotch very well sir bring it to the table where will you be sir roulette the waiter withdrew marty went to the cashier and bought eight hundred pounds of chips then went into the roulette room hed never been much of a cardplayer it required techniques that hed always been too bored to learn and much as he admired the skill of great players that very skill blurred the essential confrontation a good cardplayer used luck a great one rode it but roulette though it too had its systems and its techniques was a purer game nothing had the glamor of the spinning wheel its numbers blurring the ball rattling as it lodged and jumped again he sat down at the table between a highly perfumed arab who spoke only french and an american neither said a word to him there were no welcomes or farewells here all the niceties of human intercourse were sacrificed to the matter at hand it was an odd disease its symptoms were like infatuationpalpitations sleeplessness its only certain cure death on one or two occasions hed caught sight of himself in a casino bar mirror or in the glass of the cashiers booth and met a hunted hungry look but nothingnot selfdisgust not the disparagement of friendsnothing had ever quite rooted out the appetite the waiter brought the drink to his elbow its ice clinking marty tipped him heavily there was a spin of the wheel though marty had joined the table too late to place money all eyes were fixed on the circling numbers it was an hour or more before marty left the table and then only to relieve his bladder before returning to his seat players came and went the american indulging the aquiline youth who accompanied him had left the decisions to his companion and lost a small fortune before retiring martys reserves were running low hed won and lost and won then lost and lost and lost the defeats didnt distress him overmuch it wasnt his money and as whitehead had often observed there was plenty more where that came from with enough chips left for one more bet of any consequence he withdrew from the table for a breather hed sometimes found that he could change his luck by retiring from the field for a few minutes and returning with new focus as he got up from his seat his eyes full of numbers somebody walked past the door of the roulette room and glanced in before moving on to another game fleeting seconds were enough for recognition when martyd last met that face it had been illshaven and waxen with pain lit by the floods along the sanctuary fence now mamoulian was transformed no longer the derelict cornered and anguished marty found himself walking toward the door like a man hypnotized the waiter was at his sideanother drink sirbut the inquiry went ignored as marty stepped out of the roulette room and into the corridor contrary feeling ran in him he was halfafraid to confirm his sighting of the man yet curiously excited that the man was here it was no coincidence surely perhaps toy was with him perhaps the whole mystery would unravel here and now he caught sight of mamoulian walking into the baccarat room a particularly fierce match was going on there and spectators had drifted in to watch its closing stages the room was full players from other tables had deserted their own games to enjoy the battle at hand even the waiters were lingering on the periphery trying to catch a glimpse mamoulian threaded his way through the crowd to get a better view his thin gray figure parting the throng having found himself a vantage point he stood light shining up from the baize onto his pale face the wounded hand was lodged in his jacket pocket out of sight the wide brow was clear of the least expression marty watched him for upward of five minutes not once did the europeans eyes flicker from the game in front of him he was like a piece of porcelain a glazed faзade onto which a nonchalant artisan had scrawled a few lines the eyes pressed into the clay were incapable it seemed of anything but that relentless stare yet there was power in the man it was uncanny to see how people kept clear of him cramming themselves into knots rather than press too close to him at the tableside across the room marty caught sight of the penmustache waiter he pushed his way between the spectators to where the young man stood a word he whispered yes sir that man in the gray suit the waiter glanced toward the table then back to marty mr mamoulian yes what do you know about him the waiter gave marty a reproving look im sorry sir were not at liberty to discuss members he turned on his heel and went into the corridor marty followed it was empty downstairs the girl on the desknot the same hed spoken withwas giggling with the coatcheck clerk wait a moment when the waiter looked back marty was producing his wallet still amply enough filled to present a decent bribe the other man stared at the notes with undisguised greed i just want to ask a few questions i dont need the number of his bank account i dont know it anyway the waiter smirked are you police im just interested in mr mamoulian marty said proffering fifty pounds in tens some bare essentials the waiter snatched the money and pocketed it with the speed of a practiced bribee ask away he said is he a regular here a couple of times a month to play the waiter frowned now you mention it i dont think ive ever seen him actually play just to watch then well i cant be sure but i think if he did play id have seen him by now strange still we have a few members who do that and does he have any friends people he arrives with leaves with not that i remember he used to be quite pally with a greek woman who used to come in always won a fortune never failed that was the gamblers equivalent of the fishermans tale the story of the player with a system so flawless it never faltered marty had heard it a hundred times always the friend of a friend a mythical somebody whom you never got to meet facetoface and yet when he thought of mamoulians face so calculating in its supreme indifference he could almost imagine the fiction real why are you so interested in him the waiter asked i have an odd feeling about him youre not the only one what do you mean hes never said or done anything to me you understand the waiter explained he always tips well though god knows all he ever drinks is distilled water but we had one fellow came here this is a couple of years ago now he was american over from boston he saw mamoulian and let me tell youhe freaked out seems hed played with a guy who was his spitting image this is in the s that caused quite a buzz i mean he doesnt look like the type to have a father does he the waiter had something there it was impossible to imagine this mamoulian as a child or a pimply adolescent had he suffered infatuation the death of pets of parents it seemed so unlikely as to be laughable thats all i know really thank you said marty it was enough the waiter walked away leaving marty with an armful of possibilities apocryphal tales most likely the greek with the system the panicking american a man like mamoulian was bound to collect rumors his air of lost aristocracy invited invented histories like an onion unwrapped and unwrapped and unwrapped again each skin giving way not to the core but to another skin tired and dizzy with too much drink and too little sleep marty decided to call it a night hed use the hundred or so left in his wallet to bribe a taxi driver to drive him back to the estate and leave the car to be picked up another day he was too drunk to drive he glanced one final time into the baccarat room the game was still going on mamoulian had not moved from his station marty went downstairs to the bathroom it was a few degrees colder than the interior of the club its rococo plasterwork facetious in the face of its lowly function he glanced at his weariness in the mirror then went to relieve himself at the urinal in one of the stalls somebody had begun to sob very quietly as if attempting to stifle the sound despite his aching bladder marty found he was unable to piss the anonymous grief distressed him too much it was coming from behind the locked door of the stalls probably some optimist whod lost his shirt on a roll of the dice and was now contemplating the consequences marty left him to it there was nothing he could say or do he knew that from bitter experience out in the foyer the woman on the desk called after him mr strauss it was the english rose she showed no sign of wilting despite the hour did you find mr toy no i didnt oh thats odd he was here are you sure yes he came with mr mamoulian i told him you were here and that youd asked after him and what did he say nothing the girl replied not a word she dropped her voice is he well i mean he looked really terrible if you dont mind me saying so awful color marty glanced up the stairs scanned the landing is he still here well i havent been on the desk all evening but i didnt see him leave marty took the stairs two at a time he wanted to see toy so much there were questions to ask confidences to exchange he scoured the rooms looking for that wornleather face but though mamoulian was still there sipping his water toy was not with him nor was he to be found in any of the bars he had clearly come and gone disappointed marty went back downstairs thanked the girl for her help tipped her well and left it was only when he had put a good distance between himself and the academy walking in the middle of the road to waylay the first available taxi that he remembered the sobbing in the bathroom his pace slowed eventually he stopped in the street his head echoing to the thump of his heart was it just hindsight or had that ragged voice sounded familiar as it chewed on its grief had it been toy sitting there in the questionable privacy of a toilet stall crying like a lost child dreamily marty glanced back the way hed come if he suspected toy was still at the club shouldnt he go back and find out but his head was making unpleasant connections the woman at the pimlico number whose voice was too horrid to listen to the deskgirls question is he well the profundity of despair he had heard from behind the locked door no he couldnt go back nothing not even the promise of a faultless system to beat every table in the house would induce him to return there was after all such a thing as reasonable doubt and on occasion it could be a balm without equal viii raising cain the day of the last supper as he was to come to think of it marty shaved three times once in the morning and twice in the afternoon the initial flattery of the invitation had long since faded now all he prayed for was some convenient getout clause a means by which he could politely escape what he was certain would be an excruciating evening he had no place in whiteheads entourage their values were not his their world was one in which he was no more than a functionary there could be nothing about him that would give them more than a moments entertainment it wasnt until he put on the evening jacket again that he began to feel more courageous in this world of appearances why shouldnt he carry off the illusion as well as the next man after all hed succeeded at the academy the trick was to get the superficies rightthe proper dress code the correct direction in which to pass the port he began to view the evening ahead as a test of his wits and his competitive spirit began to rise to the challenge he would play them at their own game among the clinking glasses and the chatter of opera and high finance triply shaved dressed and cologned he went down to the kitchen oddly pearl wasnt in the house luther had been left in charge of the nights gourmandizing he was opening bottles of wine the room was fragrant with the mingled bouquets though marty had understood the gathering to be small several dozen bottles were assembled on the table the labels on many were dirtied to illegibility it looked as though the cellar were being stripped of its finest vintages luther looked marty up and down whod you steal the suit off marty picked up one of the open bottles and sniffed it ignoring the remark tonight he wasnt going to be needled tonight he had things figured out and hed let no one burst the bubble i said whered you i heard you first time i bought it what with marty put the bottle down heavily glasses on the table clinked together why dont you shut up luther shrugged old man give it to you i told you shove it seems to me youre getting in deep man you know youre guest of honor at this shindig im going along to meet some of the old mans friends thats all you mean dwoskin and those fuckheads arent you the lucky one and what are you tonight the wineboy luther grimaced as he pulled the cork on another bottle they dont have no waiters at their special parties theyre very private what do you mean what do i know luther said shrugging im a monkey right between eight and eightthirty the cars started to arrive at the sanctuary marty waited in his room for a summons to join the rest of the guests he heard curtsingers voice and those of women there was laughter some of it shrill he wondered if it was just the wives theyd brought or their daughters too the phone rang marty it was whitehead sir why not come up and join us were waiting for you right were in the white room another surprise that bare room with its ugly altarpiece seemed an unlikely venue for a dinner party evening was drawing on outside and before going on up to the room marty switched the lawn floods on they blazed their illumination echoing through the house his earlier trepidation had been entirely replaced by a mixture of defiance and fatalism as long as he didnt spit in the soup he told himself hed get through come on in marty the atmosphere inside the white room was already chokingly thick with cigar and cigarette smoke no attempt had been made to prettify the place the only decoration was the triptych its crucifixion as vicious as marty remembered it whitehead stood as marty entered and extended his hand in welcome an almost garish smile on his face close the door will you come on in and sit down there was a single empty place at the table marty went to it you know felix of course ottaway the fandancing lawyer nodded the bare bulb threw light on his pate and exposed the line of his toupee and lawrence dwoskinthe lean and trollishwas in the middle of a sip of wine he murmured a greeting and james hello said curtsinger how nice to see you again the cigar he held was just about the largest marty had ever set eyes on the familiar faces accounted for whitehead introduced the three women who sat between the men our guests for tonight he said hello this is my sometime bodyguard martin strauss martin oriana a woman in her midthirties gave him a slightly crooked smile pleased to meet you whitehead used no second name which left marty wondering if this was the wife of one of the men or just a friend she was a good deal younger than either ottaway or curtsinger between whom she sat perhaps she was a mistress the thought tantalized this is stephanie stephanie the first womans senior by a good ten years graced marty with a look that seemed to strip him naked from head to foot it was disconcertingly plain and he wondered if anyone else around the table had caught it weve heard so much about you she said laying a caressing hand on dwoskins havent we dwoskin smirked martys distaste for the man was as thoroughgoing as ever it was difficult to imagine how or why any human would want to touch him and finally emily marty turned to greet the third new face at the table as he did so emily knocked over a glass of red wine oh jesus she said doesnt matter curtsinger said grinning he was already drunk marty now registered the grin was too lavish for sobriety couldnt matter less sweet really it couldnt emily looked up at marty she too had already drunk too much to judge by her flushed complexion she was by far the youngest of the three women and almost winsomely pretty sit down sit down whitehead said never mind the wine for gods sake marty took his place beside curtsinger the wine emily had spilled dribbled off the edge of the table unarrested we were just saying dwoskin chimed in what a pity willy couldnt have been here marty shot a glance at the old man to see if the mention of toythe sound of weeping came back as he thought of himhad brought any response there was none he too marty now saw was the worse for drink the bottles that luther had been openingthe clarets the burgundiesforested the table the atmosphere was more that of an ad hoc picnic rather than a dinner party there was none of the ceremony hed anticipated no meticulous ordering of courses no cutlery in regiments what food there wastins of caviar with spoons thrust into them cheeses thin biscuitstook a poor second place to the wine though marty knew little about wine his suspicions about the old man emptying his cellar were confirmed by the babble around the table they had come together tonight to drink the sanctuary dry of its finest its most celebrated vintages drink curtsinger said its the best stuff youll ever swallow believe me he fumbled for a specific bottle among the throng wheres the latour we havent finished it have we stephanie are you hiding it darling stephanie looked up from her cups marty doubted if she even knew what curtsinger was talking about these women werent wives he was certain of it he doubted if they were even mistresses here curtsinger sloppily filled a glass for marty see what you make of that marty had never much liked wine it was a drink to be sipped and swilled around the mouth and he had no patience with it but the bouquet off the glass spoke quality even to his uneducated nose it had a richness that made him salivate before hed downed a mouthful and the taste didnt disappoint it was superb good eh tasty tasty curtsinger bellowed to the table in mock outrage the boy pronounces it tasty better pass it back over before he downs the lot ottaway remarked its all got to go whitehead said tonight all of it said emily glancing over at the two dozen other bottles that stood against the wall liqueurs and cognacs among the wines yes everything one blowout to finish the best of the stuff what was this about they were like a retreating army razing a place rather than leaving anything for those who followed to occupy what are you going to drink next week oriana asked a heaped spoonful of caviar hovering above her cleavage next week whitehead said no parties next week im joining a monastery he looked across at marty marty knows what a troubled man i am troubled said dwoskin concerned for my immortal soul said whitehead not taking his eyes off marty this earned a spluttered guffaw from ottaway who was rapidly losing control of himself dwoskin leaned across and refilled martys glass drink up he said weve got a lot to get through there was no slow savoring of the wine going on around the table the glasses were being filled guzzled and refilled as though the tipple were water there seemed something desperate in their appetite but he should have known whitehead did nothing by halves not to be outdone marty downed his second glass in two gulps and filled it to brimming again immediately like it dwoskin asked willy would not approve said ottaway what of mr strauss oriana said the caviar had still not found her mouth not of martin of this indiscriminate consumption he was barely able to get his tongue around the last two words there was some pleasure in seeing the lawyer tonguetwisted no more the fandancer toy can go fuck himself dwoskin said marty wanted to say something in bills defense but the drink had slowed his responses and before he could speak whitehead had lifted his glass a toast he announced dwoskin stumbled to his feet knocking over an empty bottle which in turn felled another three wine gurgled out of one of the spilled bottles weaving across the table and splashing on to the floor to willy whitehead said wherever he is glasses raised and tapped together even dwoskins a chorus of voices offered up to willy and the glasses were noisily drained martys glass was filled up by ottaway drink man drink the drink on martys empty stomach was causing ructions he felt dislocated from events in the room from the women the fandancer the crucifixion on the wall his initial shock seeing the men like this wine on their bibs and chins mouthing obscenities had long since faded their behavior didnt matter getting more of these vintages down his throat did he exchanged a baleful look with christ fuck you he said under his breath curtsinger caught the comment my very words he whispered back where is willy emily was asking i thought hed be here she offered the question to the table but nobody seemed willing to take it up hes gone whitehead replied eventually hes such a nice man the girl said she dug dwoskin in the ribs didnt you think he was a nice man dwoskin was irritated by the interruptions he had taken to fumbling at the zipper on the back of stephanies dress she made no objection to this public advance the glass he held in the other hand was spilling wine into his lap he either didnt notice or didnt care whitehead caught martys eye entertaining you are we he said marty wiped the nascent smile off his face dont you approve ottaway asked marty not up to me i always got the impression the criminal classes were quite puritanical at heart is that right marty looked down from the fandancers drinkpuffed features and shook his head the jibe was beneath contempt as was the jiber if i were you marty whitehead said from the other end of the table id break his neck marty shrugged why bother he said seems to me youre not so dangerous after all ottaway went on who said i was dangerous the smirk the lawyer wore deepened i mean we were expecting an animal act you know ottaway moved a bottle to get a better look at marty we were promised the conversation around the table had ground to a halt but ottaway didnt seem to notice still nothings quite as advertised is it he said i mean you ask any one of these godforsaken gentlemen the table was a stilllife ottaways arm swept around to include everyone in his tirade we know dont we we know how disappointing life can be shut up curtsinger snapped he stared woozily at ottaway we dont want to hear we may not get another chance my dear james ottaway replied his courtesy contemptuous dont you think we should all admit the truth we are in extremis oh yes my friends we should all get down on our knees and confess yes yes said stephanie she was trying to stand but her legs were of another mind her dress the back unzipped threatened to slip lets all confess she said dwoskin pulled her back into her chair well be here all night he said emily giggled ottaway undeterred was still talking seems to me he said hes probably the only innocent one amongst us ottaway pointed at marty i mean look at him he doesnt even know what im talking about the remarks were beginning to irritate marty but thered be precious little satisfaction in threatening the lawyer in his present state ottaway would crumble under one blow his bleary eyes didnt look far from unconsciousness you disappoint me ottaway murmured with genuine regret in his voice i thought wed end better than this dwoskin stood up ive got a toast he announced i want to toast the women now theres an idea curtsinger said but well need a fire oriana thought this the funniest remark shed heard all night the women dwoskin declared raising his glass but nobody was listening emily who had been lamblike so far had suddenly taken it into her head to strip off shed pushed her chair back and was now unbuttoning her blouse she wore nothing beneath her nipples looked rouged as if in preparation for this unveiling curtsinger applauded ottaway and whitehead joined in with a chorus of encouraging remarks what do you think curtsinger asked marty your type is she and theyre all her own arent they sweetheart you want to feel emily offered shed discarded her blouse she was now naked from the waist up come on she said taking hold of martys hand and pressing it against her breast working it around and around oh yes said curtsinger leering at marty he likes that i can tell he likes that of course he does marty heard whitehead say his gaze not too focused slid in the old mans direction whitehead met it headon the hooded eyes were devoid of humor or arousal go on he said shes all yours thats what shes here for marty heard the words but couldnt make proper sense of them he pulled his hand off the girls flesh as if scalded go to hell he said curtsinger had stood up now dont be a spoilsport he rebuked marty we only want to see what youre made of down the table oriana had started to laugh again marty wasnt sure at what dwoskin was banging his hand palm down on the table the bottles jumped in rhythm go on whitehead told marty they were all looking at him he turned to face emily she was standing a yard away from him attempting the catch of her skirt there was something undeniably erotic about her exhibitionism martys trousers felt tight his head too curtsinger had his hands on martys shoulders and was trying to slip off his jacket the tattoo dwoskin was beating on the table which ottaway had now taken up made martys head dance emily had succeeded with the catch and her skirt was at her feet now without prompting she pulled off her panties and stood in front of the assembled company wearing only pearls and highheeled shoes naked she looked young enough to be jailbait fourteen fifteen at most her skin was creamy somebodys handorianas he thought was massaging martys erection he halfturned it wasnt her at all but curtsinger he pushed the hand away emily had stepped toward him and was unbuttoning his shirt from the bottom up he tried to stand to say something to whitehead the words werent there yet but he badly wanted to find them wanted to tell the old man what a cheat he was more than a cheat he was scum dirtyminded scum this was why hed been invited up here plied with wine and dirty talk the old man had wanted to see him naked and rutting marty pushed curtsingers hand away a second time the touch was horribly expert he looked along the table to whitehead who was pouring himself another glass of wine dwoskins gaze was fixed on emilys nakedness ottaways on marty both had given up slapping the table the lawyers stare said everything he was sickly pale sweaty anticipation on his face go on he said his breath ragged go on take her give us a show to remember or havent you got anything worth displaying marty heard the sense too late to reply the naked child was pressing herself against him and somebody was trying to unbutton the top of his trousers he made one last ungainly lunge at equilibrium stop this he murmured looking at the old man whats the problem whitehead asked lightly joke over marty said there was a hand in his trousers reaching for his erection get the fuck off me he shoved curtsinger back with more force than hed planned the big man stumbled and fell against the wall whats wrong with you people emily took a step back from him to avoid martys flailing arm the wine was boiling up in his belly and throat his trousers jutted he looked he knew absurd oriana was still laughing riot just her dwoskin too and stephanie ottaway just stared you never seen a fucking hardon before he spat at them all wheres your sense of humor ottaway said we just want a floor show wheres the harm marty jabbed a finger in whiteheads direction i trusted you he said it was all he could find to shape his hurt that was an error then wasnt it dwoskin commented he spoke as if to an imbecile you fucking shut up fighting back the urge to break somebodys faceanybodys would domarty pulled on his jacket and with one backsweep of his hand cleared a dozen bottles most of them full off the table emily screamed as they shattered around her feet but marty didnt wait to see how much damage hed done he backed off from the table and stumbled toward the door the key was in the lock he opened it and stepped into the hallway behind him emily had begun to bawl like a baby just woken from a nightmare he could hear her all the way down the darkened corridor he hoped to god his jittering limbs would bear him up he wanted out into the air into the night he lurched down the back staircase hand outstretched against the wall for support the steps receding beneath his feet he reached the kitchen having fallen only once and opened the back door the night was waiting nothing to see him nothing to know him he breathed in cold black air and it burned in his nostrils and lungs he staggered across the lawn almost blind not knowing which direction he was going in until he thought of the woods taking a moment to reorientate himself he ran toward them begging their discretion he ran the undergrowth dragging at his legs until he was so deep in the stand of trees he could see neither the house nor its lights only then did he stop his whole body thumping like one vast heart his head felt loose on his neck bile gurgled at the back of his throat jesus jesus jesus for a moment his gyrating head lost control his ears whined his eyes blurred he was suddenly certain of nothing not even his physical existence panic crawled up from his bowels raking the tissue of his gut and his stomach as it came get down he told it only once before had he felt so close to losing his mindto throwing back his head and screamingand that had been the first night at wandsworth the first of many years of nights locked in a cell twelve by eight hed sat on the edge of the mattress and felt what he was feeling now the blind beast ascending squeezing adrenaline from his spleen hed mastered the terror then and he could do it again brutally he stuck his fingers as far down his throat as he could reach and was rewarded with a surge of nausea the reflex begun he let his body do the rest throwing up a system full of undigested wine it was a filthy cleansing experience and he made no effort to control the spasms until there was nothing left to vomit his stomach muscles aching from the contractions he uprooted some ferns and wiped his mouth and chin then washed his hands in the damp soil and stood up the rough treatment had done its job there was a marked improvement in his condition he turned his back on his spilled stomach and wandered further away from the house though the thatch of leaves and branches was heavy above some starlight trickled down enough illumination to give a tenuous solidity to trunk and brush walking in the ghostwood enchanted him he let the gentle spectacle of light and leafshade heal his wounded vanity he saw how all his dreams of finding a permanent and trusted place in whiteheads world had been pretension he was and always would be a marked man he walked quietly here where the trees thickened and the undergrowth lightstarved thinned small animals scuttled ahead of him night insects whirred in the grass he stood still to hear the nocturne better as he did so he caught a movement out of the corner of his eye he looked toward it seeking focus through the receding corridor of trunks it was no trick there was somebody gray as the trees standing thirty or so yards from himnow still now moving again concentrating he fixed the figure in the matrix of shadow and deeper shadow it was a ghost surely so quiet so casual he watched it as a deer might watch a hunter not certain if he had been seen but unwilling to break cover fear ran in his scalp not of an open blade hed long ago faced those terrors and mastered them this was the prickly heat fear of childhood the essential fear and paradoxically it made him whole it didnt matter if he were four or thirtyfour he was the same creature at heart hed dreamed of such woods of such encompassing night he touched his terror reverently frozen to the spot while the gray figuretoo taken with its own business to notice himwatched the earth between the trees they stood in that relation ghost and he for what seemed like several minutes certainly a good time passed before he heard a noise that was neither owl nor rodent filtering between the trees it had been there all along he had just failed to interpret it for what it was the sound of digging the rattle of tiny stones the fall of earth the child in him said bad leave it be leave it all be but he was too curious to ignore it he took two experimental steps toward the ghost it made no sign of seeing or hearing him taking courage he advanced a few more steps attempting to keep as close to a tree as possible so that should the ghost look his way he could find cover quickly in this way he advanced ten yards toward his quarry close enough to see the host in enough detail for recognition it was mamoulian the european was still staring down at the earth at his feet marty slid into hiding behind a trunk and flattened himself there his back to the scene there was obviously somebody digging at mamoulians feet he conceivably had other cohorts in the vicinity the only safety was in lying doggo and hoping to god no one had been spying on him as he had spied on the european at length the digging stopped and so as if on an unspoken cue did the nocturne it was bizarre the whole assembly insect and animal alike seemed to hold its breath aghast marty slid down the trunk into crawling position his ears straining for every clue as to what was going on he chanced a look mamoulian was moving off in what marty guessed to be the direction of the house undergrowth obscured his view he could see nothing of the digger or the other disciples who were accompanying the european he heard their passage however the brush of their dragging steps let them go he thought he was past protecting whitehead that bargain was defunct he sat knees hugged against his chest and waited until mamoulian had woven between the trees and disappeared then he counted to twenty and stood up pins and needles pricked at his lower legs and he had to rub the circulation back into them only then did he start toward the spot where mamoulian had lingered even as he approached he recognized the glade though he had previously come to it from the direction of the house his lateevening walk had taken him in a semicircle he was standing now in the place hed buried the dogs the grave was open and empty the black plastic shrouds had been torn apart their contents unceremoniously removed marty stared into the hole not quite comprehending the joke what use were dead dogs there was a movement in the grave something shifted beneath the plastic sheets he stepped back from the edge his gorge too susceptible for this a nest of maggots presumably or perhaps a worm the size of his arm grown fat on dogmeat who knew what hid in the earth turning his back on the hole he walked toward the house following the trail mamoulian had taken until the trees thinned and the starlight brightened there on the borderland between wood and lawn he stayed until the sounds of the night reestablished themselves around him stephanie excused herself from the table and went out to the bathroom leaving the hysteria behind her as she closed the door one of the menottaway she thoughtsuggested she come back in and piss in a bottle for him she didnt grace the remark with a reply however well they paid she wasnt going to get involved in that kind of activity it wasnt clean the hallway was in semidarkness the sheen of vases the richness of the carpet underfootall of it spoke wealth and on previous visits shed enjoyed the extravagance of the place but tonight they were so uneasyottaway dwoskin the old man himselfthere was an air of desperation in their drinking and their innuendo and it took any pleasure out of being here on the other nights theyd all got pleasantly drunk and then thered been the usual performances sometimes developing into something more serious with one or two of them just as often they were content to watch and at the end of the night thered been generous payment but tonight was different there was cruelty in it which she disliked money or no money she wouldnt come here again it was time she retired anyway leave it to younger girls who at least looked less raddled than she did she bent close to the bathroom mirror and tried to reapply her eyeliner but her hand was shaky with drink and it slipped she cursed and dug in her purse for a tissue to clean off the error as she did so there was a scuffling sound in the hallway dwoskin she guessed she didnt want the gargoyle touching her again at least not until she was too paralytic with drink to care she tiptoed to the door and locked it the sounds outside had stopped she went back to the sink and turned on the tap cold water to splash on her tired face dwoskin had gone out after stephanie he intended to suggest something outrageous for her to perform on him something gross for this night of nights where are you going somebody asked him as he traipsed the hall or did he just imagine the words hed taken a few pills before the partythat always loosened him upbut it tended to put voices in his head mostly his mothers whether somebody had asked the question or not he chose not to answer he just wandered down the corridor calling for stephanie the woman was extraordinary or so his drugged libido had decided she had superb buttocks he wanted to be smothered by those cheeks to die under them stephanie he demanded she didnt reappear come on he reassured her its only me there was a smell in the corridor just a hint of sewer he inhaled it foul he announced not unappreciatively the smell was getting stronger as though its source was close by and approaching lights he told himself and peered along the wall looking for a switch a few yards down the corridor something started to move toward him the light was too dim to see properly by but it was a man and the man was not alone there were other shapes kneehigh mustering in the darkness the smell was becoming overpowering dwoskins head had started to dance with color disgraceful images flickered in the air to accompany the smell it took him a moment to grasp that this air graffiti was not his doing it was coming from the man ahead of him dashes and dots of light flared and whirled away into the air who are you dwoskin demanded in answer the graffiti ignited into a fullblown literature not certain if any sound was coming out the trollking began to screech stephanie dropped the eyeliner into the sink as the scream reached her she didnt recognize the voice it was high enough to be a womans but it was neither emily nor oriana the shakes suddenly worsened she held on to the edge of the sink to steady herself as the noises multiplied howls now and running feet somebody was shouting all but incoherent orders it was ottaway she thought but she wasnt going out to check whatever was going on beyond the doorpursuit capture murder evenshe needed none of it she turned off the light in the bathroom in case it spilled under the door somebody ran by calling on god now there was desperation feet thudded down the stairs somebody fell doors slammed screams mounted she backed away from the door and sat on the edge of the bath there in the darkness she started to sing abide with meor what little she could remember of itvery quietly marty heard the screams too though he didnt want to even at such a distance they carried a freight of blind panic that made him clammy he knelt down in the dirt between the trees and stopped his ears the earth smelled ripe beneath him and his mind seethed with unwelcome thoughts of lying faceup in the ground dead perhaps but anticipating resurrection like a sleeper on the verge of waking nervous of the day after a while the din became intermittent soon he told himself he must open his eyes stand up and go back to the house to see the hows and the whys of all this commotion soon but not yet when the noise in the hallway and on the stairs had long stopped stephanie crept to the bathroom door unlocked it and peered out the corridor was in complete darkness now the lamps had either been turned off or shattered but her eyes accustomed to the blackness of the bathroom soon pierced the feeble light from the stairwell the gallery was empty in both directions there was just a smell in the air like a bad butchers shop on a hot day she slipped off her shoes and started to the top of the stairs the contents of a handbag were scattered down the steps and there was something wet underfoot she looked down the carpet was stained either wine or blood she hurried on down into the hallway it was chilly both front and vestibule doors were wide open again there was no sign of life the cars had gone from the driveway the downstairs roomslibrary reception rooms kitchenall were forsaken she rushed back upstairs to collect her belongings from the white room and leave as she retraced her steps along the gallery she heard a soft padding behind her she turned there was a dog at the top of the stairs it had presumably followed her up she could scarcely make it out in the bad light but she wasnt afraid good boy she said glad of its living presence in the abandoned house it didnt growl nor did it wag its tail it simply hobbled towards her only then did she realize her error in welcoming it the butchers shop was here on all fours she backed off no she said i dont oh christ leave me alone still it came and with every step it took toward her she saw more of its condition the innards that looped from its underside the decayed face all teeth and putrescence she headed toward the white room but it covered the distance between them in three strides her hands slid on its body as it leaped at her and to her disgust fur and flesh separated her grasp skinning the creatures flanks she fell back it advanced head rocking uneasily on its scrappy neck its jaws closing around her throat and shaking her she couldnt screamit was devouring her voicebut her arm thrust up into the cold body and found its spine instinct made her grasp the column muscle dividing in slimy threads and the beast let her go arching back as her grip snapped one vertabrae from the next it let out a prolonged hiss as she dragged her arm out her other hand cupped her throat blood was hitting the carpet with thudding sounds she must get help or bleed to death she started to crawl back toward the top of the stairs miles away from her somebody opened a door light fell across her too numb to feel pain she looked around whitehead was silhouetted in a distant doorway between them stood the dog somehow it had got up or rather its front portion had and it was dragging itself across the shining carpet toward her most of its bulk useless now its head barely raised from the ground but still moving as it would move until its resurrector granted it rest she raised her arm to signal her presence to whitehead if he saw her in the gloom he made no sign she had reached the top of the stairs she had no strength lift in her death was coming quickly enough her body said enough her will conceded and she slumped down the blood loosed from her wounded neck flowing down the stairs as her darkening eyes watched one step two steps counting games were a perfect cure for insomnia three steps four she didnt see the fifth step or any other in the creeping descent marty was loath to go back into the house but whatever had happened there was surely over and he was getting chilly where he knelt his expenseaccount suit was dirtied beyond reclamation his shirt was stained and torn his immaculate shoes claycaked he looked like a derelict the thought almost pleased him he meandered back across the lawn he could see the lights of the house somewhere ahead they burned reassuringly though he knew such reassurance was delusion not every house was a refuge sometimes it was safer to be out in the world under the sky where no one could come knocking and looking for you where no roof could fall on your trusting head halfway between house and trees a jet growled overhead high up its lights twin stars he stood and watched it pass over him at his zenith perhaps it was one of the monitoring planes that hed read passed perpetually over europeone american one russiantheir electric eyes scanning the sleeping cities judgmental twins upon whose benevolence the lives of millions depended the sound of the jet diminished to a murmur and then to silence gone to spy on other heads the sins of england would not prove fatal tonight it seemed he began to walk toward the house with fresh resolution taking a route that would lead him around to the front and into the false day of the floodlights as he crossed the stage toward the front door the european stepped out of the house there was no way to avoid being seen marty stood rooted to the spot while breer emerged and the two unlikely companions moved away from the house whatever job theyd come to do was clearly completed a few steps across the gravel mamoulian glanced around his eyes found marty immediately for a long moment the european simply stared across the expanse of bright grass then he nodded a short sharp nod that was simply acknowledgment i see you it said and look i do you no harm then he turned and walked away until he and the gravedigger were obscured by the cypresses that lined the drive part four the thiefs tale civilisations do not degenerate through fear but because they forget that fear exists freya stark perseus in the wind marty stood in the hallway and listened for footsteps or voices there were neither the women had obviously gone as had ottaway curtsinger and the trollking perhaps the old man too few lights burned in the house those that did rendered the place almost twodimensional power had been unleashed here its remnants skittered in the metalwork the air had a bluish tinge he made his way upstairs the second floor was in darkness but he found his way along it by instinct his feet kicking the porcelain shardssome smashed treasure or otheras he went there was more than porcelain underfoot things damp things torn he didnt look down but made his way toward the white room anticipation mounting with every step the door was ajar and a light not electric but candle burned inside he stepped over the threshold the single flame offered a panicky illuminationhis very presence had it jumpingbut he could see that every bottle in the room had been smashed he stepped into a swamp of broken glass and spilled wine the room was pungent with the dregs the table had been overturned and several of the chairs reduced to matchwood old man whitehead was standing in the corner of the room there were spatters of blood on his face but it was difficult to be certain if it was his he looked like a man pictured in the aftermath of an earthquake shock had bled his features white he came early he said disbelief in every hushed syllable imagine that i thought he believed in covenants but he came early to catch me out who is he he wiped tears from his cheeks with the heel of his hand smearing the blood the bastard lied to me he said are you hurt no whitehead said as if the question were utterly ridiculous he wouldnt lay a hand on me he knows better than that he wants me to go willingly you see marty didnt theres a body in the hallway whitehead observed matteroffactly i moved her off the stairs who stephanie he killed her him no his hands are clean you could drink milk from them ill call the police no whitehead took several illadvised steps through the glass to catch martys arm no no police but somebodys dead forget her you can hide her away later eh his tone was almost ingratiating his breath now he was close toxic youll do that wont you after all youve done a little joke whitehead said he tried a smile his grip on martys arm was bloodstopping come on a joke thats all it was like being buttonholed by an alcoholic on a street corner marty loosed his arm ive done all im going to do for you he said you want to go back home is that it whiteheads tone soured on an instant want to go back behind bars where you can hide your head youve tried that trick am i getting repetitive oh dear oh christ in heaven he waved marty away go on then piss off youre not in my class he staggered back to the crutch of the wall and leaned there what the fuck am i doing expecting you to take a stand you set me up marty snarled in reply all along i told you a joke not just tonight all along lying to me bribing me you said you needed someone to trust and then you treat me like shit no wonder they all run out on you in the end whitehead wheeled on him all right he shouted back what do you want the truth are you sure yes damn you yes the old man sucked at his lip debating with himself when he spoke again the voice had quietened all right boy all right the old glitter flared in his eyes and momentarily the defeat was burned away by a new enthusiasm if youre so eager to hear ill tell you he pointed a shaky finger at marty close the door marty kicked a smashed bottle out of the way and pushed the door shut it was bizarre to be closing the door on murder simply to listen to a story but this tale had waited so long to be told it could be delayed no longer when were you born marty in december the war was over yes you dont know what you missed it was an odd beginning for a confession such times you had a good war whitehead reached for one of the less damaged chairs and righted it then he sat down for several seconds he didnt say anything i was a thief marty he said at last well black marketeer has a more impressive ring i suppose but it amounts to the same thing i was able to speak three or four languages adequately and i was always quickwitted things fell my way very easily you were lucky luck had no bearing on it lucks out for people with no control i had control though i didnt know it at the time i made my own luck if you like he paused you must understand war isnt like you see in the cinema or at least my war wasnt europe was falling apart everything was in flux borders were changing people were being shipped into oblivion the world was up for grabs he shook his head you cant conceive of it youve always lived in a period of relative stability but war changes the rules you live by suddenly its good to hate its good to applaud destruction people are allowed to show their true selves marty wondered where this introduction was taking them but whitehead was just getting into the rhythm of his telling this was no time to divert him and when theres so much uncertainty all around the man who can shape his own destiny can be king of the world forgive the hyperbole but its how i felt king of the world i was clever you see not educated that came later but clever streetwise youd call it now and i was determined to make the most of this wonderful war god had sent me i spent two or three months in paris just before the occupation then got out while the going was good later on i went south enjoyed italy the mediterranean i wanted for nothing the worse the war became the better it was for me other peoples desperation made me into a rich man of course i frittered the money away never really held onto my earnings for more than a few months when i think of the paintings i had through my hands the objets dart the sheer loot not that i knew that when i pissed in the bucket i splashed a raphael i bought and sold these things by the jeepload towards the end of the european war i took off north into poland the germans were in a bad way they knew the game was coming to an end and i thought i could strike a few deals eventuallyit was an error reallyi wound up in warsaw there was practically nothing left by the time i got there what the russians hadnt flattened the nazis had it was one wasteland from end to end he sighed and pulled a face making an effort to find the words you cant imagine it he said this had been a great city but now how can i make you understand you have to see through my eyes or none of this makes sense im trying marty said you live in yourself whitehead went on as i live in myself we have very strong ideas of what we are thats why we value ourselves by whats unique in us do you follow what im saying marty was too involved to lie he shook his head no not really the isness of things thats my point the fact that everything of any value in the world is very specifically itself we celebrate the individuality of appearance of being and i suppose we assume that some part of that individuality goes on forever if only in the memories of the people who experienced it thats why i valued evangelines collection because i delight in the special thing the vase that was unlike any other the carpet woven with special artistry then suddenly they were back in warsaw thered been such glories there you know fine houses beautiful churches great collections of paintings so much but by the time i arrived it was all gone pounded to dust everywhere you walked it was the same underfoot there was muck gray muck it caked your boots its dust hung in the air it coated the back of your throat when you sneezed your snot was gray your shit the same and if you looked closely at that filth you could see it wasnt just dirt it was flesh it was rubble it was porcelain fragments newspapers all of warsaw was in that mud its houses its citizens its art its history all ground down to something that you scraped off your boots whitehead was hunched up he looked his seventy years an old man lost in remembering his face was knotted up his hands were fists he was older than martys father would have been had he survived his lousy heart except that his father would never have been able to speak this way hed lacked the power of articulation and marty thought the depth of pain whitehead was in agonies the memory of muck more than that the anticipation of it thinking of his father of the past marty alighted upon a memory that made some sense of whiteheads reminiscences hed been a boy of five or six when a woman whod lived three doors down the terrace died shed had no relatives apparently or none that cared sufficiently to remove what few possessions shed had from the house the council had reclaimed the property and summarily emptied it carting off her furniture to be auctioned the day after marty and his playmates had found some of the dead womans belongings dumped in the alley behind the row of houses the council workmen pressed for time had simply emptied all the drawers of worthless personal effects into a pile and left them there bundles of ancient letters roughly tied up with faded ribbon a photograph album much valueless bricabrac sealing wax inkless pens a letter opener the boys had fallen on these leavings like hyenas in search of something nourishing finding nothing they scattered the tornup letters down the alley they dismembered the album and laughed themselves silly at the photographs although some superstition in them prevented them tearing those they had no need to do so the elements soon vandalized them more efficiently than their best efforts could have done in a week of rain and nightfrost the faces on the photographs had been spoiled dirtied arid finally eroded entirely perhaps the last existing portraits of people now dead went to mush in that alley and marty passing down it daily had watched the gradual extinction seen the ink on the scattered letters rained off until the old womans memorial was gone away utterly just as her body had gone if youd upended the tray that held her ashes onto the trampled remains of her belongings they would have been virtually indistinguishable both gray dirt their significance irretrievably lost muck held the whip hand all this marty recalled mistily it wasnt quite that he saw the letters the rain the boysas much as retouching the feelings the events had aroused the buried sense that what had happened in that alley was unbearably poignant now his memory meshed with whiteheads all the old man had said about muck about the isness of things made some sense i see he murmured whitehead looked up at marty perhaps he said i was a gambling man in those days far more than i am now war brings it out in you i think you hear stories all the time about how some lucky man escaped death because he sneezed or died for the same reason tales of benign providence or fatal bad fortune and after a while you get to look at the world a little differently you begin to see chance at work everywhere you become alive to its mysteries and of course to its flip side to determinism because take it from me there are men who make their own luck men who can mold chance like putty you talked yourself of feeling a tingle in your hands as though today whatever you did you couldnt lose yes that conversation seemed an age away ancient history well while i was in warsaw i heard about a man who never once lost a game a cardplayer never lost marty was incredulous yes i was as cynical as you i treated the stories i heard as fable at least for a while but wherever i went people told me about him i got to be curious in fact i decided to stay in the city though god knows there was precious little to keep me there and find this miracle worker for myself who did he play against all comers apparently some said hed been there in the last days before the russian advance playing against nazis and then when the red army entered the city he stayed on why play in the middle of nowhere there cant have been much money around practically none the russians were betting their rations their boots so again why thats what fascinated me i couldnt understand it either nor did i believe he won every game however good a player he was i dont see how he kept finding people to play him because theres always somebody who thinks he can bring the champion down i was one i went searching for him to prove the stories wrong they offended my sense of reality if you like i spent every waking hour of every day searching the city for him eventually i found a soldier whod played against him and of course lost lieutenant konstantin vasiliev and the cardplayer what was his name i think you know whitehead said yes marty replied after a moment yes you know i saw him at bills club when was this when i went to buy my suit you told me to gamble what was left of the money mamoulian was at the academy and did he play no apparently he never does i tried to get him to play when he came here last but he wouldnt but in warsaw you played him there oh yes thats what hed been waiting for i see that now all these years i pretended i was in charge you know that id gone to him that id won by my own skills you won marty exclaimed certainly i won but he let me it was his way of seducing me and it worked he made it look difficult of course to give some weight to the illusion but i was so full of myself i never once contemplated the possibility that hed lost the game deliberately i mean there was no reason for him to do that was there not that i could see not at the time why did he let you win i told you seduction what do you mean he wanted you in bed whitehead made the gentlest of shrugs its possible yes the thought seemed to amuse him vanity bloomed on his face yes i think i probably was a temptation then the smile faded but sex is nothing is it i mean as possessions go to fuck somebody is trite stuff what he wanted me for went far deeper and was far more permanent than any physical act did you always win when you played him i never played against him again that was the first and only time i know it sounds unlikely he was a gambler and so was i but as i told you he wasnt interested in cards for the betting it was a test yes to see if i was worthy of him fit to build an empire after the war when they started rebuilding europe he used to say there were no real europeans lefttheyd all been wiped out by one holocaust or anotherand he was the last of the line i believed him all the talk of empires and traditions i was flattered to be lionized by him he was more cultured more persuasive more penetrating than any man i had met or have met since whitehead was lost in this reverie hypnotized by the memory all thats left now is a husk of course you cant really appreciate what an impression he made there was nothing he couldnt have been or done if hed put his mind to it but when i said to him why do you bother with the likes of me why dont you go into politics some sphere where you can wield power directly hed give me this look and say its all been done at first i thought he meant those lives were predictable but i think he meant something else i think he was telling me that hed been these people done those things hows that possible one man i dont know its all conjecture it was from the beginning and here i am forty years later still juggling rumors he stood up by the look on his face it was obvious that his sitting position had caused some stiffness in the joints once he was upright he leaned against the wall and put his head back staring up at the blank ceiling he had one great love one allconsuming passion chance it obsessed him all life is chance he used to say the trick is learning how to use it and all this made sense to you it took time but i came to share his fascination over a period of years yes not out of intellectual interest ive never had much of that but because i knew it could bring power if you can make providence work for youhe glanced down at martywork out its system if you likethe world succumbs to you the voice soured i mean look at me see how well ive done for myself he let out a short bitter laugh he cheated he said returning to the beginning of their conversation he didnt obey the rules this was to be the last supper marty said am i right you were going to escape before he came for you in a way how whitehead didnt reply instead he began the story again where hed left off he taught me so much after the war we traveled around for a while picking up a small fortune me with my skills him with his then we came to england and i went into chemicals and got rich beyond the dreams of croesus it took a few years but the money came the power came with his help whitehead frowned at this unwelcome observation i applied his principles yes he replied but he prospered every bit as much as i did he shared my houses my friends even my wife marty made to speak but whitehead cut him off did i tell you about the lieutenant he said you mentioned him vasiliev he died did i tell you that he didnt pay his debts his body was dragged out of the sewers of warsaw mamoulian killed him not personally but yes i think whitehead stopped in midflow almost cocked his head listening did you hear something what no its all right in my head what was i saying the lieutenant oh yes this piece of the story i dont know if itll mean too much to you but i have to explain because without it the rest doesnt quite make sense you see the night i found mamoulian was an incredible evening useless to try to describe it really but you know the way the sun can catch the tops of clouds they were blushcolored lovecolored and i was so full of myself so certain that nothing could ever harm me he stopped and licked his lips before going on i was an imbecile selfcontempt stung the words from him i walked through the ruinssmell of putrefaction everywhere muck under my feetand i didnt care because it wasnt my ruin my putrefaction i thought i was above all that especially that night i felt like the victor because i was alive and the dead were dead the words stopped pressing forward for a moment when he spoke again it was so quietly it hurt the ears to catch the words what did i know nothing at all he covered his face with his shaking hand and said oh jesus quietly into it in the silence that followed marty thought he heard something outside the door a movement in the hallway but the sound was too soft for him to be certain and the atmosphere in the room demanded his absolute fixedness to move now to speak would ruin the confessional and marty like a child hooked by a master storyteller wanted to hear the end of this narrative at that moment it seemed to him more important than anything else whiteheads face was concealed behind his hand as he attempted to stem tears after a moment he took up the tail of the story againcarefully as if it might strike him dead ive never told anyone this i thought if i kept my silenceif i let it become another rumorsooner or later it would disappear there was another noise in the hall a whine like wind through a tiny aperture and then a scratching at the door whitehead didnt hear it he was in warsaw again in a house with a bonfire and a flight of steps and a room with a table and a guttering flame almost like the room they were in now in fact but smelling of old fire rather than souring wine i remember he said when the game was over mamoulian stood up and shook hands with me cold hands icy hands then the door opened behind me i halfturned to see it was vasiliev the lieutenant horribly burned hed survived marty breathed no came the reply he was quite dead marty thought maybe hed missed something in the story that would justify this preposterous statement but no the insanity was presented as plain truth mamoulian was responsible whitehead went on he was trembling but the tears had stopped boiled away by the glare of the memory hed raised the lieutenant from the dead you see like lazarus he needed functionaries i suppose as the words faltered the scratching began again at the door an unmistakable appeal for entry this time whitehead heard it his moment of weakness had passed apparently his head jerked up dont answer it he commanded why not its him he said eyes wild no the europeans gone i saw him leave not the european whitehead replied its the lieutenant vasiliev marty looked incredulous no he said you dont know what mamoulian can do youre being ridiculous marty stood up and picked his way through the glass behind him he heard whitehead say no again please jesus no but he turned the handle and opened the door meager candlelight found the wouldbe entrant it was bella the madonna of the kennels she stood uncertainly on the threshold her eyes what was left of them turned balefully up to look at marty her tongue a rag of maggoty muscle that hung from her mouth as if she lacked the strength to withdraw it from somewhere in the pit of her body she exhaled a thin whistle of air the whine of a dog seeking human comfort marty took two or three stumbling steps back from the door it isnt him whitehead said smiling jesus christ its all right martin it isnt him close the door marty said unable to move and do it himself her eyes her stench kept him at bay she doesnt mean any harm she used to come up here sometimes for tidbits she was the only one of them i trusted vile species whitehead pushed himself away from the wall and walked across to the door kicking broken bottles ahead of him as he went bella shifted her head to look at him and her tail began to wag marty turned away revolted his reason thrashing around to find some sane explanation but there was none to be had the dog had been dead hed parceled her up himself there was no question of premature burial whitehead was staring at bella across the threshold no you cant come in he told her as if she were a living thing send it away marty groaned shes lonely the old man replied chiding him for his lack of compassion it crossed martys mind that whitehead had lost his wits i dont believe this is happening he said dogs are nothing to him believe me marty remembered watching mamoulian standing in the woods staring down at the earth he had seen no gravedigger because thered been none theyd exhumed themselves squirming out of their plastic shrouds and pawing their way to the air its easy with dogs whitehead said isnt it bella youre trained to obey she was sniffing at herself content now that shed seen whitehead her god was still in his heaven and all was well with the world the old man left the door ajar and turned back to marty theres nothing to be afraid of he said shes not going to do us any harm he brought them to the house yes to break up my party pure spite it was his way of reminding me what hes capable of marty stooped and righted another chair he was shaking so violently he feared if he didnt sit down hed fall down the lieutenant was worse the old man said because he didnt obey like bella he knew what had been done to him was an abomination that made him angry bella had woken with an appetite that was why shed made her way up to the room she remembered most fondly a place where a man who knew the best spot to scratch behind her ear would coo soft words to her and feed her morsels off his plate but tonight shed come up to find things changed the man was odd with her his voice jangling and there was someone else in the room one she vaguely knew the scent of but couldnt place she was still hungry such deep hunger and there was an appetizing smell very close to her of meat left in the earth the way she liked it still on the bone and half gone to putrescence she sniffed almost blind looking for the source of the smell and having found it began to eat not a pretty sight she was devouring her own body taking gray greasy bites from the decayed muscle of her haunch whitehead watched as she pulled at herself his passivity in the face of this new horror broke marty dont let her he pushed the old man aside but shes hungry he responded as though this horror were the most natural sight in the world marty picked up the chair hed been sitting on and slammed it against the wall it was heavy but his muscles were brimming and the violence was a welcome release the chair broke the dog looked up from her meal the meat she was swallowing fell from her cut throat too much marty said picking up a leg of the chair and crossing the room to the door before bella could register what he intended at the last moment she seemed to understand that he meant her harm and tried to get to her feet one of her back legs the haunch almost chewed through would no longer support her and she staggered teeth bared as marty swung his makeshift weapon down on her the force of his blow shattered her skull the snarling stopped the body backed off dragging the ruined head on a rope of a neck the tail tucked between its back legs in fear two or three trembling steps of retreat and it could go no further marty waited hoping to god he wouldnt have to strike a second time as he watched the body seemed to deflate the swell of its chest the remnants of its head the organs hanging in the vault of its torso all collapsed into an abstraction one part indistinguishable from the next he closed the door on it and dropped the blooded weapon at his side whitehead had taken refuge across the room his face was as gray as bellas body how did he do this marty said how is it possible he has power whitehead stated it was as simple as that apparently he can steal life and he can give it marty dug in his pocket for the linen handkerchief hed bought specially for this night of dining and conversation shaking it out its edges pristine he wiped his face the handkerchief came away dirtied with specks of rot he felt as empty as the sac in the hall outside you asked me once if i believed in hell he said do you remember yes is that what you think mamoulian is somethinghe wanted to laughsomething from hell ive considered the possibility brut im not by nature a supernaturalist heaven and hell all that paraphernalia my system revolts at it if not devils what is it so important marty wiped his sweaty palms on his trousers he felt contaminated by this obscenity it would take a long time to wash the horror out if he ever could hed made the error of digging too deep and the story hed heardthat and the dog at the doorwere the consequence you look sick whitehead said i never thought what that the dead can get up and walk oh marty i took you for a christian despite your protestations im getting out marty said both of us both carys and me well go away from him from you poor marty youre more bovine than i thought you were you wont see her again why not shes with him damn you didnt it occur to you she went with him so that had been the unthinkable solution to her abrupt vanishing trick willingly of course no oh yes marty he had a claim on her from the beginning he rocked her in his arms when she was barely born who knows what kind of influence he has i won her back of course for a while he sighed i made her love me she wanted to be away from you never shes my daughter strauss shes as manipulative as i am anything between you and her was purely a marriage of her convenience youre a fucking bastard thats a given marty im a monster i concede the point he threw up his hands palms out innocent of everything but guilt i thought you said she loved you still she went i told you shes my daughter she thinks the way i do she went with him to learn how to use her powers i did the same remember this line of argument even from vermin like whitehead made a kind of sense beneath her strange conversation hadnt there always lurked a contempt for marty and the old man alike contempt earned by their inability to sum her up given the opportunity wouldnt carys go dance with the devil if she felt shed understand more of herself by doing so dont concern yourself with her whitehead said forget her shes gone marty tried to hold on to the image of her face but it was deteriorating he was suddenly very tired exhausted to his bones get some rest marty tomorrow we can bury the whore together im not getting involved in this i told you once didnt i if you stayed with me there was nowhere i couldnt take you its more true now than ever you know toys dead when how i didnt ask the details the point is hes gone theres only you and i now you made a fool out of me whiteheads face was a portrait of persuasion an error of taste he said forgive me too late i dont want you to leave me marty i wont let you leave me you hear his finger jabbed the air you came here to help me what have you done nothing nothing blandishment had turned into accusations of betrayal in mere seconds one moment tears the next curses and behind it all the same terror of being left alone marty watched the old mans trembling hands fist and unfist please he appealed dont leave me i want you to finish the story good boy everything you understand me everything what more is there to tell whitehead said i became rich i had entered one of the fastestgrowing postwar markets pharmaceuticals within half a decade i was up there with the world leaders he smiled to himself whats more there was very little illegality in the way i made my fortune unlike many i played by the rules and mamoulian did he help you he taught me not to agonize over the moral issues and what did he want in return whitehead narrowed his eyes youre not so stupid are you he said appreciatively you manage to get right to the hurt when it suits you its an obvious question youd made a deal with him no whitehead interrupted face set i made no deal not in the way you mean it anyway there was perhaps a gentlemans agreement but thats long past hes had all hes getting from me which was to live through me whitehead replied explain marty said i dont understand he wanted life like any other man he had appetites and he satisfied them through me dont ask me how i dont understand myself but sometimes i could feel him at the back of my eyes and you let him at first i didnt even know what he was doing i had other calls on my attention i was getting richer by the hour it seemed i had houses land art women it was easy to forget that he was always there watching living by proxy then in i married evangeline we had a wedding that would have shamed royalty it was written up in newspapers from here to hong kong wealth and influence marries intelligence and beauty it was the ideal match it crowned my happiness it really did you were in love it was impossible not to love evangeline i thinkhe sounded surprised as he spokei think she even loved me what did she make of mamoulian ah theres the rub he said she loathed him from the start she said he was too puritanical that his presence made her feel perpetually guilty and she was right he loathed the body its functions disgusted him but he couldnt be free of it or its appetites that was a torment to him and as time went by that streak of selfhatred worsened because of her i dont know perhaps now i think back he probably wanted her the way hed wanted beauties in the past and of course she despised him right from the beginning once she was mistress of the house this war of nerves just escalated eventually she told me to get rid of him this was just after carys was born she said she didnt like him handling the babywhich he seemed to like to do she just didnt want him in the house id known him two decades by nowhed lived in my house hed shared my lifeand i realized i knew nothing about him he was still the mythical cardplayer id met in warsaw did you ever ask him ask him what who he was where he came from how he got his skills oh yes i asked him on each occasion the answer was a little different from the time before so he was lying to you quite blatantly it was a sort of joke i think his idea of a party piece never to be the same person twice as if he didnt quite exist as if this man called mamoulian was a construction covering something else altogether what whitehead shrugged i dont know evangeline used to say hes empty that was what she found foul about him it wasnt his presence in the house that distressed her it was his absence the nullity of him and i began to think maybe id be better getting rid of him for evangelines sake all the lessons he had to teach me id learned i didnt need him anymore besides hed become a social embarrassment god when i think back i wonderi really wonderhow we let him rule us for so long hed sit at the dinner table and you could feel the spell of depression hed cast on the guests and the older he got the more his talk was all futility not that he visibly aged he didnt he doesnt look a year older now than when i first met him no change at all not physically theres something altered maybe hes got an air of defeat about him now he didnt seem defeated to me you should have seen him in his prime he was terrifying then believe me people would fall silent when he stepped through the door he seemed to soak up the joy in anyone kill it on the spot it got to the point where evangeline couldnt bear to be in the same room with him she got paranoid about him plotting to kill her and the child she had somebody sit with carys every night to make certain that he didnt touch her come to think of it it was evangeline who first coaxed me into buying the dogs she knew he had an abhorrence of them but you didnt do as she asked i mean you didnt throw him out oh i knew id have to act sooner or later i just lacked the balls to do it then he started petty power games just to prove i still needed him it was a tactical error the novelty value of an inhouse puritan had worn very thin i told him so told him hed have to change his whole demeanor or go he refused of course i knew he would all i wanted was an excuse to break our association off and he gave it to me on a plate looking back of course i realize he knew damn well what i was doing anyway the upshot wasi threw him out well not me personally toy did the deed toy worked for you personally oh yes again it was evangelines idea she was always so protective of me she suggested i hire a bodyguard i chose toy hed been a boxer and he was as honest as the days long he was always unimpressed by mamoulian never had the least qualm about speaking his mind so when i told him to get rid of the man he did just that i came home one day and the cardplayer had gone i breathed easy that day it was as though id been wearing a stone around my neck and not known it suddenly it was gone i was lightheaded any fears id had about the consequences proved utterly groundless my fortune didnt evaporate i was as successful as ever without him more so perhaps i found new confidence and you didnt see him again oh no i saw him he came back to the house twice each time unannounced things hadnt gone well for him it seemed i dont know what it was but hed lost the magic touch somehow the first time he came back he was so decrepit i scarcely recognized him he looked ill he smelled foul if youd seen him in the street youd have crossed over the road to avoid him i could scarcely credit the transformation he didnt want even to step into the housenot that i would have let himall he wanted was money which i gave him and then he went away and it was genuine what do you mean genuine the beggar performance it was real was it i mean it wasnt another story whitehead raised his eyebrows all these years i never thought of that always assumed he stopped and began again on a different tack you know im not a sophisticated man despite appearances to the contrary im a thief my father was a thief and probably his father too all this culture i surround myself with its a facade things ive picked up from other people received good taste if you like but after a few years you begin to believe your own publicity you begin to think you actually are a sophisticate a man of the world you start to be ashamed of the instincts that got you where you are because theyre part of an embarrassing history thats what happened to me i lost any sense of what i was well i think its time the thief had his say again time i started to use his eyes his instinct you taught me that though christ knows you werent aware of it me were the same dont you see both thieves both victims the selfpity in whiteheads pronouncement was too much you cant tell me youre a victim marty said the way youve lived what do you know about my feelings whitehead snapped back dont presume you hear me dont think you understand because you dont he took everything away from me everything first evangeline then toy now carys dont tell me whether ive suffered or not what do you mean he took evangeline i thought she died in an accident whitehead shook his head theres a limit to what i can tell you he said some things i cant express never will the voice was ashen marty let the point go and moved on you said he came back twice thats right he came again a year or two after his first visit evangeline wasnt at home that night it was november toy answered the door i remember and though i hadnt heard mamoulians voice i knew it was him i went into the hallway he was standing on the step in the porch light it was drizzling i can see him now the way his eyes found me am i welcome he said just stood there and said am i welcome i dont know why but i let him in he didnt look in bad shape maybe i thought hed come to apologize i cant remember even then i would have been friends with him if hed offered not on the old basis as business acquaintances perhaps i let my defenses down we started talking about the past togetherwhitehead chewed the memory over trying to get a better taste of itand then he started to tell me how lonely he was how he needed my companionship i told him warsaw was a long time gone i was a married man a pillar of the community and i had no intention of changing my ways he started to get abusive accused me of ingratitude said id cheated him broken the covenant between us i told him thered never been a covenant id just won a game of cards once in a distant city and as a result hed chosen to help me for his own reasons i said i felt id acceded to his demands sufficiently to feel that any debt to him had been paid hed shared my house my friends my life for a decade everything that i had had been his to share its not enough he said and he began again the same pleas as before the same demands that i give up this pretense to respectability and go off somewhere with him be a wanderer be his pupil learn new terrible lessons about the way of the world and i have to say he made it sound almost attractive there were times when i tired of the masquerade when i smelled war dirt when i saw the clouds over warsaw and i was homesick for the thief i used to be but i wasnt going to throw everything away for nostalgias sake i told him so i think he must have known i was immovable because he became desperate he started to ramble started to tell me he was frightened without me lost i was the one hed given years of his life and his energies to and how could i be so callous and unloving he laid hands on me wept tried to paw my face i was horrified by the whole thing he disgusted me with his melodrama i wanted no part of it or him but he wouldnt leave his demands turned into threats and i suppose i lost my temper no suppose about it ive never been so angry i wanted an end to him and all he stood for my grubby past i hit him not hard at first but when he wouldnt stop staring at me i lost control he didnt make any attempt to defend himself and his passivity only inflamed me more i hit him and hit him and he just took it kept offering up his face to be beaten he took a trembling breath god knows ive done worse things but nothing i feel so ashamed of i didnt stop till my knuckles began to split then i gave him to toy who really worked him over and all the time not a peep out of him i go cold to think about it i can still see him against the wall with bill at his throat and his eyes not looking at where the next blow was coming from but at me just at me i remember he said do you know what youve done just like that very quietly blood coming out with the words then something happened the air got thick the blood on his face started to crawl around like it was alive toy let him go he slid down the wall left a smear down it i thought wed killed him it was the worst moment of my life standing here with toy both of us staring down at this bag of bones wed beaten up that was our mistake of course we should never have backed down we should have finished it then and there and killed him jesus yes stupid not to have finished it bill was loyal there would have been no comeback but we didnt have the courage i didnt have the courage i just made toy clean mamoulian up then drive him to the middle of the city and dump him you wouldnt have killed him marty said still you insist on reading my mind whitehead replied wearily dont you see thats what he wanted what hed come for he would have let me be his executioner then if id only had the nerve to follow through he was sick of life i could have put him out of his misery and that would have been the end of it you think hes mortal everything has its season his is past he knows it so all you need do is wait right hell die given time marty was suddenly sick of the story now of thieves of chance the whole sorry tale true or untrue repulsed him you dont need me anymore he said he stood and crossed to the door the sound of his feet in the glass was too loud in the small room where are you going the old man wanted to know away as far as i can get you promised to stay i promised to listen i have listened and i dont want any of this bloody place marty began to open the door whitehead addressed his back you think the europeanll let you be youve seen him in the flesh youve seen what he can do hell have to silence you sooner or later have you thought of that ill take the risk youre safe here safe marty repeated incredulously you cant be serious safe you really are pathetic you know that if you go whitehead warned what marty turned on him spitting contempt what will you do old man ill have them after you in two minutes flat youre skipping parole and if they find me ill tell them everything about the heroin about her out there in the hall every dirty thing i can dig up to tell them i dont give a monkeys toss for your fucking threats you hear whitehead nodded so stalemate looks like it marty replied and stepped out into the corridor without looking back there was a morbid surprise awaiting him the pups had found bella they had not been spared mamoulians resurrecting hand though they could not have served any practical purpose too small too blind they lay in the shadow of her empty belly their mouths seeking teats that had long since gone one of them was missing he noted had it been the sixth child hed seen move in the grave either buried too deeply or too profoundly degenerated to follow where the rest went bella raised her neck as he sidled past what was left of her head swung in his general direction marty looked away disgusted but a rhythmical thumping made him glance back she had forgiven him his previous violence apparently content now with her adoring litter in her lap she stared eyeless at him while her wretched tail beat gently on the carpet in the room where marty had left him whitehead sat slumped with exhaustion though it had been difficult to tell the story at first it had become easier with the telling and he was glad to have unburdened it so many times hed wanted to tell evangeline but she had signaled in her elegant subtle way that if there were indeed secrets he had from her she didnt want to know them all those years living with mamoulian in the home she had never directly asked whitehead why as though shed known the answer would be no answer at all merely another question thinking about her brought many sorrows to his throat they brimmed in him the european had killed her he had no doubt of that he or his agents had been on the road with her her death had not been chance had it been chance he would have known his unfailing instinct would have sensed its rightness however terrible his grief but there had been no such sense only the recognition of his oblique complicity in her death she had been killed as revenge upon him one of many such acts but easily the worst and had the european taken her after death had he slipped into the mausoleum and touched her into life the way he had the dogs the thought was repugnant but whitehead entertained it nevertheless determined to think the worst for fear that if he didnt mamoulian might still find terrors to shake him with you wont he said aloud to the room of glass wont frighten me intimidate me destroy me there were ways and means he could escape still and hide at the ends of the earth find a place where he could forget the story of his life there was something he hadnt told a fraction of the tale scarcely pivotal but of more than passing interest that hed withheld from strauss as he would withhold it from any interrogator perhaps it was unspeakable or perhaps it touched so centrally so profoundly upon the ambiguities that had pursued him through the wastelands of his life that to speak it was to reveal the color of his soul he pondered this last secret now and in a strange way the thought of it warmed him he had left the game that first and only game with the european and scrambled through the halfchoked door into muranowski square no stars were burning only the bonfire at his back as hed stood in the gloom reorienting himself the chill creeping up through the soles of his boots the lipless woman had appeared in front of him shed beckoned he assumed she intended to lead him back the way hed come and so followed shed had other intentions however shed led him away from the square to a house with barricaded windows andever curious hed pursued her into it certain that tonight of all nights no harm could possibly come to him in the entrails of the house was a tiny room whose walls were draped with pirated swaths of cloth some rags others dusty lengths of velvet that had once framed majestic windows here in this makeshift boudoir there was one piece of furniture only a bed upon which the dead lieutenant vasilievwhom he had so recently seen in mamoulians gaming roomwas making love and as the thief stepped through the door and the lipless woman stood aside konstantin had looked up from his labors his body continuing to press into the woman who lay beneath him on a mattress strewn with russian and german and polish flags the thief stood disbelieving wanting to tell vasiliev that he was performing the act incorrectly that hed mistaken one hole for another and it was no natural orifice he was using so brutally but a wound the lieutenant wouldnt have listened of course he grinned as he worked the red pole rooting and dislodging rooting and dislodging the corpse he was pleasuring rocked beneath him unimpressed by her paramours attentions how long had the thief watched the act showed no sign of consummation at last the lipless woman had murmured enough in his ear and he had turned a little way to her while she had put her hand on the front of his trousers she seemed not at all surprised that he was aroused though in all the years since he had never understood how such a thing was possible he had long ago accepted that the dead could be woken but that he had felt heat in their presencethat was another crime altogether more terrible to him than the first there is no hell the old man thought putting the boudoir and its charred casanova out of his mind or else hell is a room and a bed and appetite everlasting and ive been there and seen its rapture and if the worst comes to the worst i will endure it part five the deluge out of a fired ship which by no way but drowning could be rescued from the flame some men leaped forth and ever as they came near the foes ships did by their shot decay so all were lost which in the ship were found they in the sea being burnt they in the burnt ship drowned john donne a burnt ship ix bad faith the deluge descended in the driest july in living memory but then no revisionists dream of armageddon is complete without its paradox lightning appearing out of a clear sky flesh turned to salt the meek inheriting the earth all unlikely phenomena that july however there were no spectacular transformations no celestial lights appeared in the clouds no rains of salamanders or children if angels came and went that monthif the lookedfor deluge brokethen it was like the truest armageddons metaphor there are its true some freakish occurrences to be recounted but most of them take place in backwaters in illlit corridors in shunned wastelands among rainsodden mattresses and the ashes of old bonfires they are local almost private their shock wavesat bestmade gossip among wild dogs most of these miracles howevergames rains and salvationswere slipped with such cunning behind the facade of ordinary life that only the sharpestsighted or those in search of the unlikely caught a glimpse of the apocalypse showing its splendors to a sunbleached city the city didnt welcome marty back with open arms but he was glad to be away from the house once and for all his back turned on the old man and his madness whatever the consequences of his departure in the long termand he would have to think very carefully about whether he now turned himself inhe at least had a breathing space time to think things through the tourist season was under way london was thronged with visitors making familiar streets unfamiliar he spent the first couple of days just wandering around getting used to being footloose and fancyfree again he had precious little money left but he could turn his hand to a laboring job if need be with summer at its height the building trade was hungry for fit workhorses the thought of an honest days work its production of sweat paid for in cash was attractive if necessary he would sell the citroлn that hed taken from the sanctuary in one last and probably illadvised gesture of rebellion after two days of liberty his thoughts turned to an old theme america hed had it tattooed on his arm as a keepsake of his prison dreams now perhaps was the time for him to make it a reality in his imagination kansas beckoned its grain fields running to the eyes limit in every direction and not a manmade thing in sight hed be safe there not just from the police and mamoulian but from history from stories told again and again round in circles world without end in kansas there would be a new story a story that he could not know the end of and wasnt that a working definition of freedom unspoiled by european hand european certainty to keep himself off the streets while he planned his escape he found a room in kilburn a dingy oneroom flat with a toilet two flights down which was shared the landlord informed him with six other people in fact there were at least fifteen occupants of the seven rooms in the house including a family of four in one the bawling of the youngest child kept his sleep fitful so hed rise early and leave the house to its own devices all day only returning when the pubs were closed and then only grudgingly still he reassured himself it wasnt for long there were problems about the departure of course not the least of which was getting a passport with a visa stamp in it without it he would not be allowed to step onto american soil securing himself these documents would have to be a speedy operation for all he knew his parolejumping had been reported by whitehead and damn what tales marty told perhaps the authorities were already combing the streets for him on the third day of july a week and a half after leaving the estate he decided to take fate by the horns and visit toys place despite whiteheads insistence that bill was dead marty kept hope intact papa had lied before many times why not in this instance the house was in an elegant backwater in pimlico a road of hushed facades and expensive automobiles straddling the narrow pavements he rang the doorbell half a dozen times but there was no sign of life the venetian blinds were drawn on the downstairs windows there was a fat wedge of mailcirculars mostlythrust in the mailbox he was standing on the step staring dumbly at the door knowing full well it wasnt going to open when a woman appeared on the nextdoor step not the owner of the house he was sure more likely a cleaner her tanned facewho wasnt tanned this blistering summerbore the suppressed delight of a badnews bringer excuse me can i help you she inquired hopefully he was suddenly glad hed dressed in jacket and tie to come to the house this woman looked the kind whod report her slightest suspicions to the police i was looking for bill mr toy she clearly disapproved if not of him of toy hes not here she said do you happen to know where hes gone nobody knows he just left her he just upped and left left who his wife well lady friend she was found in there a couple of weeks ago didnt you read about it it was all over the papers they interviewed me i told them i said he wasnt a pretty piece of work not at all i must have missed it it was all over the papers theyre looking for him at the moment mr toy murder squad really youre not a reporter no only im willing you know to tell my story if the price is right the things i could tell you really she was in a terrible state apparently what do you mean mindful of her salability the matron had no intention of divulging the details even if she knew them which marty doubted but she was willing to offer a tantalizing trailer there was mutilation she promised unrecognizable even to her nearest and dearest are you sure the woman looked affronted by this smear on her authenticity she either did it to herself or else somebody did it to her and kept her in there locked up bleeding to death for days and days the smell when they opened the door the sound of the slushy lost voice that had answered the telephone came back to marty and he knew without doubt that toys lady had already been dead when she spoke mutilated and dead but resurrected as a telephonist to keep up appearances for a useful while the syllables ran in his ear who is this shed asked hadnt she despite the heat and light of a brilliant july he started to shiver mamoulian had been here hed crossed this very threshold in search of toy he had a score to settle with bill as marty now knew what might a man not plan while the humiliations festered in return for such violence marty caught the woman staring at him are you all right she said thank you yes you need some sleep i have the same problems hot nights like these i get restless he thanked her again and hurried away from the house without looking back too easy to imagine the horrors they came without warning out of nowhere nor would they go away not now the memory of mamoulian was with himnight and day and restless nightfrom then on he became aware of another world hovering beyond or behind the facade of reality there was no time for prevarication he had to leave forget whitehead and carys and the law trick his way out of the country and into america any way he could away to a place where real was real and dreams stayed under the eyelids where they belonged raglan was an expert at the fine art of forgery two telephone calls located him and marty struck a deal with the man the appropriate visa could be forged in a passport for a modest fee if marty could bring along a photograph of himself the job could be done in a day two at the most it was the fifteenth of july the month was simmering a few degrees off the boil the radio blaring from the room next door had promised a day as faultlessly blue as the one preceding and the one preceding that not even blue white the sky was blind white these days marty set out for raglans house early partially to avoid the worst of the heat and partially because he was eager to get the forgery made buy his ticket and be away as it was he got no further than kilburn high road tube station it was there on the cover of the daily telegraph that he read the headline millionaire recluse found dead at home beneath it a picture of papa a younger beardless whitehead snapped at the height of his looks and influence he bought the paper and two others that carried the story on their covers and read them standing in the middle of the pavement while harried commuters nudged and tutted at him as they surged down the stairs into the station the death was announced today of joseph newzam whitehead the millionaire head of the whitehead corporation whose pharmaceutical products had until recent falls made it one of the most successful companies in western europe mr whitehead sixtyeight was found at his hideaway sanctum in oxfordshire in the early hours of yesterday morning by his chauffeur he is believed to have died of heart failure police say there are no suspicious circumstances for obituary see page seven the obituary was the usual amalgam of information gleaned from the pages of whos who with a brief outline of the fortunes of the whitehead corporation plus a spicing of conjecture mostly concerning the corporations recent fall from financial grace there was a potted history of whiteheads life though the early years were skimpily reported as though there was some doubt as to the details the rest of the design was there albeit threadbare the marriage to evangeline the spectacular rise in the boom years of the late fifties the decades of consolidation and achievement then the withdrawal after evangelines death into mysterious and unilluminating silence he was dead despite all the brave talk all the defiance all the contempt for the machinations of the european the battle was lost whether it was indeed a natural death as the papers reported or mamoulians doing marty could not know but there was no denying the curiosity he felt more than curiosity grief that he had a capacity for sorrow at the old mans death came as a shock perhaps more of a shock than the sorrow itself he hadnt counted on the ache of loss he felt he canceled the meeting with raglan and went back to the flat there to study the newspapersover and over again squeezing out every drop from the text about the circumstances of whiteheads death there were few clues of course all the reports were couched in the bland and formal language of such announcements having exhausted the written word he went next door and asked to borrow his neighbors radio the young woman who occupied the room a student he thought took some persuading but she eventually relinquished it he listened to the halfhourly bulletins from midmorning on while the heat rose in his room the story had some prominence until noon but thereafter events in beirut and a drugs coup in southampton claimed the bulk of the time the report of whiteheads death steadily slipping from a major story to newsinbrief and thence by midafternoon into invisibility he returned the radio declining a cup of coffee with the girl and her cat the smell of whose uneaten food hung around the narrow room like the threat of thunder and returned to his own quarters to sit and think if mamoulian had indeed murdered whiteheadand he didnt doubt that the european had the skill to do it undetected by the acutest pathologistit was indirectly his fault perhaps had he remained at the house the old man would still be alive it was unlikely far more likely he too would be dead but the guilt still nagged for the next couple of days he did very little entropy had poured lead into his bowels his thoughts were circular almost obsessional in the private cinema of his skull he ran the home movies hed accrued from those first uncertain glimpses of the private life of power to his later memoriesalmost too sharp too detailedof the man alone in a glassfloored cage the dogs the dark through most though not all the face of carys appeared sometimes quizzical sometimes careless often sealed from him peering up between the bars of her downcast lashes as if envying him late at night when the baby had fallen asleep in the flat below and the only sound was the traffic on the high road hed rerun those most private moments between them moments too precious to be conjured up indiscriminately for fear their power to revive him wane with repetition for a time he had tried to forget her it was more convenient that way now he clung to thoughts of that face bereft he wondered if he would see her again the sunday newspapers all carried further reports on the death the sunday times gave over the front of its review section to a thumbnail sketch of britains most mysterious millionaire written by lawrence dwoskin longtime associate and confidant of englands howard hughes marty read the piece through twice unable to scan the printed words without hearing dwoskins insinuating tone in his ear he was in many ways a paragon it read though the almost hermitlike history of his latter years gave rise inevitably to reams of gossip and tittletattle much of it hurtful to a man of josephs sensibilities through all his years in public life exposed to the scrutiny of a press that was not always beneficent he never hardened himself to criticism implied or explicit to we few who knew him well he revealed a nature more susceptible to barbs than his outward show of indifference would ever have suggested when he found rumors of misconduct or excess being circulated about him the criticism bit deeply especially as since his beloved wife evangelines death in he had become the most fastidious of sexual and moral beings marty read this simpering cant with a bitter taste in his throat the canonization of the old man had already begun soon presumably would come the biographies authorizedand then bowdlerizedby his estate turning his life into a series of flattering fables by which he would be remembered the process nauseated him reading the platitudes in dwoskins text he found himself fiercely and unpredictably defensive of the old mans foibles as though everything that had made him uniquemade him realnow stood in danger of being whitewashed away he read dwoskins article to its maudlin end and put it down the only detail in its length that was of interest was mention of the funeral service which was to be held in a small church at minster lovell the following day the body was then to be cremated dangerous though it might be marty felt the need to go and pay his last respects in fact the service attracted so many onlookers from casual observers to diehard scandalsniffers martys presence went entirely unnoticed the whole event had an unreal air to it as if contrived to have the entire world know that the great man was dead there were correspondents and photographers from all over europe in addition to the clan from fleet street and among the mourners some of the most famous faces in public life politicians professional pundits captains of industry even a smattering of movie stars whose only claim to fame was fame itself the presence of so many celebrities attracted dedicated peeping toms in their hundreds the small church the yard around it and the road around that were overrun the service itself was relayed to those outside the building via loudspeakers a curious dislocating detail the voice of the presiding clergyman sounded tinny and theatrical through the sound system his eulogy punctuated by an amplified percussion of coughs and shufflings marty didnt like hearing the service this way any more than he liked the tourists illdressed for a funeral who lolled on the gravestones and littered the grass waiting with barely suppressed impatience for this tiresome interruption in their stargazing to be concluded whitehead had encouraged a dormant misanthropy in marty it now had a permanent place in his worldview looking around the graveyard at this heatflushed dulleyed congregation he felt contempt well up in him he itched to turn his back on the farrago and slip away but the desire to see this final scene played out overwhelmed the desire to leave so he waited in the throng while wasps buzzed at childrens sticky heads and a woman with the physique of a stick insect flirted with him from the top of a tomb somebody was now reading the lesson an actor to judge by the selfregarding tone it was announced as a passage from the psalms but marty didnt recognize it as the reading was drawing to a close a car drew up at the main gate heads turned and cameras clicked as two figures emerged a buzz spread through the crowd people whod taken to lying down stood up again to see what could be seen something roused marty from his lethargy and he too stood on tiptoe to glimpse the latecomers it was quite an entrance they were making he peered between the heads of the crowd to catch a look caught sight then lost it again said no quietly to himself not believing then pushed his way through the crowd trying to keep pace as mamoulian a veiled carys at his side glided down the pathway from gate to porch and disappeared into the church who was it somebody asked him do you know who it was hell he wanted to answer the devil himself mamoulian was here in broad daylight sun on the back of his neck walking with carys arm in arm like man and wife letting the cameras catch him for tomorrows edition he had no fear apparently this late appearance so measured so ironic was a final gesture of contempt and why did she play his game why didnt she throw off his hand and denounce him for the unnatural thing he was because shed gone willingly into his entourage the very way whitehead had told him she would in search of what someone to celebrate that strain of nihilism in her to educate her in the fine art of dying and what might she give in return ah there was the prickly question at long last the service came to an end suddenly to the delight and outrage of the congregation a raucous saxophone broke the solemnity and a jazz rendering of fools rush in was blaring over the loudspeakers whiteheads final joke presumably it earned its laughs some of the crowd even applauded from inside the church there came the clatter of people rising from their pews marty craned to get a better view of the porch and failing threaded his way back through the press of people to a tomb that offered a view there were birds in the heatdrooped trees and their pursuits distracted him catching him up in their swooping play when he looked back the coffin was almost parallel with him shouldered among others by ottaway and curtsinger the plain box seemed almost indecently exposed he wondered what theyd dressed the old man in at the last if theyd trimmed his beard and sewed his eyelids shut the procession of mourners followed on the heels of the pallbearers a black cortege that parted the candycolored sea of tourists to right and left the shutters tutted some damn fool called watch the birdy the jazz played on it was all gratifyingly absurd the old man marty guessed would be smiling in his box finally carys and mamoulian emerged from the shade of the porch into the brilliance of the afternoon and marty was sure he caught the girl cautiously scanning the crowd fearful that her companion would notice she was looking for him he was certain of it she knew hed be there somewhere and she was looking for him his mind raced tripping over itself in its turmoil if he made a sign to her however subtle there was every chance mamoulian would see it and that was surely dangerous for them both better to hide his head then painful as it was not to lock glances with her reluctantly he stepped down off the tomb as the clump of mourners came abreast of him and spied what he could from the shelter of the crowd the european scarcely raised his head from its bowed position and from what marty could glimpse between the bobbing heads carys had given up her searchperhaps despairing of his being there as the coffin and its black tail wound out of the churchyard marty ducked away and over the wall to watch events precede from a better vantage point in the road mamoulian was speaking to one or two of the mourners handshakes were exchanged commiserations offered to carys marty watched impatiently perhaps she and the european would separate in the throng and hed get a chance to show himself if only momentarily and reassure her of his presence but no such opportunity presented itself mamoulian was the perfect guardian keeping carys close to him every moment pleasantries and farewells exchanged they got into the back of a dark green rover and drove away marty raced to the citroлn he mustnt lose her now whatever happened this was perhaps his last chance to locate her the pursuit proved difficult once off the small country roads and onto the highway the rover accelerated with insolent ease marty gave chase as discreetly as the twin imperatives of tactics and excitement would allow in the back seat of the car carys had a strange flickering thought whenever she closed her lids to blink or shut out the days glare a figure appeared a runner she recognized him in seconds the gray track suit a cloud of steam emerging from the hood named him before she glimpsed his face she wanted to glance over her shoulder to see if he was as she guessed behind them somewhere but she knew better mamoulian would guess something was going on if he hadnt already the european looked across at her she was a secret one he thought he never really knew what she was thinking she was in that regard her mothers child whereas he had learned with time to read josephs face evangeline had seldom let a glimmer of her true feelings show for the space of several months hed assumed her to be indifferent to his presence in the house only time had told the true story of her machinations against him he sometimes suspected carys of similar pretenses wasnt she simply too compliant even now she wore the faintest trace of a smile it amused you he inquired what the funeral no she said lightly no of course not you were smiling the trace evaporated her face slackened it had some grotesquerie value i suppose she said her voice dull watching them all play up to the cameras you didnt trust their grief they never loved him and you did she seemed to weigh the question up love she said floating the word on the hot air to see it seemed what it would become yes i suppose i did she made mamoulian uneasy he wanted a better grip on the girls mind but it refused his best endeavors fear of the illusions he might evoke for her had certainly given her a veneer of obsequiousness but he doubted theyd truly made a slave of her terrors were a useful goad but the law of diminishing returns pertained each time she fought him he was obliged to find some new more awesome fright it exhausted him and now to add insult to injury joseph was dead he had perishedaccording to the talk at the funeralpeacefully in his sleep not even died that vulgarity had been exorcised from the vocabulary of all concerned he had passed on or over or away he had gone to sleep but never died the cant and sentimentality that followed the thief to the grave disgusted the european but he disgusted himself more he had let whitehead go not once but twice undone by his own desire to have the game concluded with due attention to detail that and his concern to persuade the thief to come willingly into the void prevarication had proved his undoing while he had threatened and juggled visions the old goat had slipped away that might not have been the end of the story after all he possessed the facility to follow whitehead into death and bring him out of it had he been able to get to the corpse but the old man had been wise to such an eventuality his body had been kept from viewing even by his closest companions it had been locked in a bank safe and guarded night and day much to the delight of the tabloids who reveled in such eccentricities by this evening it would be ash and mamoulians last opportunity for permanent reunion would have been lost and yet why did he feel as if the games theyd played all these yearsthe temptation games the revelation games the rejection vilification and damnation gameswere not quite over his intuition like his strength was dwindling but he was certain that something was amiss he thought of the way the woman at his side smiled the secret on her face is he dead he suddenly asked her the question appeared to flummox her of course hes dead she replied is he carys we just saw his funeral for gods sake she felt his mind a solid presence at the back of her neck they had played this scene many times in the preceding weeksthe trial of strength between willsand she knew that he was weaker by the day not so weak as to be negligible however he could still deliver terrors if it suited him tell me your thoughts he said so i dont have to dig for them if she didnt answer his questions and he entered her forcibly hed see the runner for certain please she said making a sham of cowardice dont hurt me the mind withdrew a little is he dead mamoulian inquired again the night he died she began what could she tell but the truth no lie would suffice he would know the night they said he died felt nothing there was no change not like when mama died she threw a cowed look at mamoulian to reinforce the illusion of servility what do you construe from that he asked i dont know she replied quite honestly what do you guess again honestly that he isnt dead the first smile carys had ever seen on the europeans face appeared it was merest hint but it was there she felt him withdraw the horns of his thought and content himself with musing he would not press her further too many plans to plan oh pilgrim he said under his breath chiding his invisible enemy like a muchloved but errant child you almost had me fooled marty followed the car off the highway and across the city to the house on caliban street it was early evening by the time the pursuit ended parked at a prudent distance he watched them get out of the car the european paid the driver and then after some delay unlocking the front door he and carys stepped into a house whose dirtied lace curtains and peeling paintwork suggested nothing abnormal in a street whose houses were all in need of renovation alight went on at the middle floor a blind was drawn he sat in the car for an hour keeping the house in view though nothing happened she did not appear at the window no letters were thrown wrapped in stones and kisses out to her waiting hero but he hadnt really expected such signs they were fictional devices and this was real dirty stone dirty windows dirty terrors skulking at his groin he hadnt eaten properly since the announcement of whiteheads death now for the first time since that morning he felt healthily hungry leaving the house to creeping twilight he went to find himself sustenance luther was packing the days since whiteheads death had been a whirlwind and he was dizzied by it with so much money in his pocket every minute a new option occurred to him a fantasy now realizable for the short term at least hed decided to go home to jamaica for a long holiday he had left when he was eight nineteen years ago his memories of the island were gilded he was prepared to be disappointed but if he didnt like the place no matter a man of his newfound wealth needed no specific plans he could move on another island another continent he had almost finished his preparations for departure when a voice called him from downstairs it wasnt a voice he knew luther are you there he went to the top of the stairs the woman hed once shared this small house with had gone left him six months ago taking their children the house should have been empty but there was somebody in the hall not one but two people his interlocutor a tall even stately man stared up the stairs at him light from the landing shining on his wide smooth brow luther recognized the face from the funeral perhaps behind him in shadow was a heavier figure id like a word said the first how did you get in here who the hell are you just a word about your employer are you from the press is that it look ive told you everything i know now get the hell out of here before i call the police youve got no right breaking in here the second man stepped out of the shadows and looked up the stairs his face was madeup that much was apparent even from a distance the flesh was powdered the cheeks rouged he looked like a pantomime dame luther stepped back from the top of the stairs mind racing dont be afraid the first man said and the way he said it made luther more afraid than ever what capacities might such politeness harbor if youre not out of here in ten seconds he warned where is joseph the polite man asked dead are you sure of course im sure i saw you at the funeral didnt i i dont know who you are my name is mamoulian well you were there werent you you saw for yourself hes dead i saw a box hes dead man luther insisted you were the one who found him i gather the european said moving a few silent paces across the hallway to the bottom of the stairs thats right in bed luther replied maybe they were press after all i found him in bed he died in his sleep come down here furnish the details if you would im fine where i am the european looked up at the chauffeurs frowning face felt tentatively at the nape of his neck there was too much heat and dirt in there he wasnt resilient enough for an investigation there were other cruder methods however he halfgestured toward the razoreater whose sandalwood presence he smelled close this is anthony breer he said he has in his time dispatched children and dogsyou remember the dogs lutherwith admirable thoroughness he is not afraid of death indeed he enjoys an extraordinary empathy with it the pantomime face gleamed up from the stairwell desire in its eyes now please mamoulian said for both our sakes the truth luthers throat was so dry the words scarcely came the old mans dead he said thats all i know if i knew any more id tell you mamoulian nodded the look on his face as he spoke was compassionate as if he genuinely feared for what must happen next you tell me something i want to believe and you say it with such conviction i almost do in principle i can leave content and you can go about your business excepthe sighed heavilyexcept that i dont quite believe you enough look this is my fucking house luther blustered sensing that extreme measures were needed now the man called breer had unbuttoned his jacket he wore no shirt underneath there were skewers threaded through the fat of his chest transfixing his nipples crossways he reached up and drew two out no blood came armed with these steel needles he shuffled to the bottom of the stairs ive done nothing luther pleaded so you say the razoreater began to mount the stairs the unpowdered breasts were hairless and yellowish wait at luthers shout breer paused yes said mamoulian you keep him off me if you have something to tell me spit it out im more than eager to listen luther nodded breers face registered disappointment luther swallowed hard before speaking hed been paid what was to him a small fortune not to say what he was about to say but whitehead hadnt warned him that it would be like this hed expected a gaggle of inquisitive reporters perhaps even a lucrative offer for his story to go into the sunday papers but not this not this ogre with his dolls face and his bloodless wounds there was a limit to the amount of silence any money could buy for christs sake what have you got to say mamoulian asked hes not dead luther replied there it wasnt so difficult to do was it it was all set up only two or three people knew i was one of them why you luther wasnt certain on this point i suppose he trusted me he said shrugging ah besides somebody had to find the body and i was the most believable candidate he just wanted to make a clean getaway start again where hed never be found and where was that luther shook his head i dont know man anywhere i suppose where nobody knows his face he never told me he must have hinted no breer took heart at luthers reticence his look brightened now come on mamoulian coaxed youve given me the motherlode wheres the harm in telling me the rest there is no more why make pain for yourself he never told me man breer took a step up the stairs and another and another he must have given you some idea mamoulian said think think you said he trusted you not that much hey keep him off me will you the skewers glittered for christs sake keep him off me there were many pities the first was that one human being was capable of such smiling brutality to another the second that luther had known nothing his fund of information had been as hed claimed strictly limited but by the time the european was certain of luthers ignorance the man was past recall well that wasnt strictly true resurrection was perfectly plausible but mamoulian had better things to do with his waning stamina and besides letting the man remain dead was the one way he could compensate for the suffering the chauffeur had vainly endured joseph joseph joseph mamoulian chided and the dark flowed on x nothing and after having secured himself all he needed for a long vigil at the house on caliban streetreading material food drinkmarty returned there and watched through most of the night with a bottle of chivas regal and the car radio for company just before dawn he deserted his watch and drove drunkenly back to his room sleeping through until almost noon when he woke his head felt the size of a balloon and as stalely inflated but there was purpose in the day ahead no dreams of kansas now just the fact of the house and carys locked up in it after a breakfast of hamburgers he returned to the street parking far enough away to be inconspicuous yet close enough to see the comings and goings he spent the next three daysin which the temperature rose from the high seventies into the middle eightiesin the same location sometimes hed catch a few minutes of cramped sleep in the car more often he returned to kilburn to snatch an hour or two the furnace of the street became familiar to him in all its moods he saw it just before dawn flickering into solidity he saw it in midmorning young wives out with children business in their walk in the gaudy afternoon too and in the evening when the sugarpink light of a declining sun made brick and slate exult the private and public lives of the calibanese unfolded to him a spastic child at number sixtyseven whose anger was a secret vice the woman at number eightyone who welcomed a man to the house daily at twelvefortyfive her husband a policeman to judge by shirt and tie was welcomed home each night with a ration of doorstep ardor in direct proportion to the time wife and lover had spent together at lunchtime more too a dozen two dozen stories interlocking dividing again as to the house itself he saw occasional activity there but not once did he glimpse carys the blinds at the middle windows were kept drawn throughout the day and only lifted in the late afternoon when the strongest of the sun was past the single topstory window looked to be permanently shuttered from inside marty concluded that there were only two people in the house besides carys one of course was the european the other was the butcher that theyd almost faced back at the sanctuary the dogkiller he came and went once sometimes twice daily usually about some trivial business an unpalatable sight with his cosmeticized features his hobbled walk the sly looks he gave the children as they played in those three days mamoulian didnt leave the house at least marty didnt see him leave he might appear fleetingly at the downstairs window glancing out down the sunlit street but that infrequently and as long as he was in the house marty knew better than to attempt a rescue no amount of courageand he did not possess that attribute in limitless supplywould arm him against the powers the european wielded no he must sit it out and wait for a safer opportunity to present itself on the fifth day of his surveillance with the heat still rising luck came his way about eightfifty in the evening as dusk invaded the street a taxi drew up outside the house and mamoulian dressed for the casino got into it almost an hour later the other man appeared at the front door his face a blur in the deepening night but hungry somehow marty watched him lock the door then glance up and down the pavement before setting off he waited until the shambling figure disappeared around the corner of caliban street before he got out of the car determined not to risk the least error in thishis first and probably only chance at rescuehe went to the corner to check that the butcher was not simply taking a lateevening constitutional but the mans bulk was unmistakable as he headed toward the city hugging the shadows as he went only when he was completely out of sight did marty go back to the house all the windows were locked back and front there were no visible lights perhapsthe doubt niggledshe was not even in the house perhaps shed gone out while he was dozing in the car he prayed not and praying forced open the back door with a jimmy hed bought for that very purpose that and a flashlight the standbys of any selfrespecting burglar inside the atmosphere was sterile he began a roombyroom search of the ground floor determined to be as systematic as possible this was no time for unprofessional behavior no shouting no rushing about just a cautious efficient investigation the rooms were all empty of people and of furniture a few items discarded by the previous occupants of the house emphasized rather than alleviated the sense of desolation he ascended a flight on the second floor he found breers room it stank an unwholesome mingling of perfume and rancid meat in the corner a largescreened blackandwhite television had been left on its sound turned down to a sibilant whisper some sort of quiz show was playing the quizmaster howled soundlessly in mock despair at a contestants defeat the fluttering metallic light fell on the few articles of furniture in the room a bed with a bare mattress and several stained cushions a mirror propped on a chair the seat of which was littered with cosmetics and toilet waters on the walls were photographs torn from a book of war atrocities he did no more than glimpse at them but their details even in the doubtful light were appalling he closed the door on the squalor and tried the next it was the toilet beside that the bathroom the fourth and last door on this floor was tucked around a halfcorridor and it was locked he turned the handle once twice back and forth and then pressed his ear to the wood listening for some clue from within carys there was no reply no sound of occupancy either carys its marty can you hear me he rattled the handle again more fiercely its marty impatience overtook him she was there just beyond the doorhe was suddenly seized by the absolute conviction of her presence he kicked the door more out of frustration than anything then raising his heel to the lock he booted it with all his strength the wood began to splinter beneath his assault half a dozen further blows and the lock cracked he put his shoulder to the door and forced it open the room smelled of her was hot with her other than her presence and her heat however it was practically empty just a bucket in the corner and a selection of empty dishes a scattering of books a blanket a small table on which lay her gear needles hypodermic dishes matches she was lying curled up on herself in a corner of the room a lamp with a lowvoltage bulb in it stood in another corner its shade partially draped with a cloth to keep the light level lower yet she was wearing only a tshirt and a pair of panties other articles of clothing jeans sweaters shirts lay strewn around when she looked up at him he could see how the sweat on her brow made her hair cling carys at first she didnt seem to recognize him its me its marty a tick of a frown creased her shiny forehead marty she said her voice in miniature the frown deepened he wasnt sure she even saw him her eyes swam marty she repeated and this time the name seemed to mean something to her yes its me he crossed the room to her and she seemed almost shocked by the suddenness of his approach her eyes sprang open recognition flooding into them with fear in attendance she halfsat up the tshirt clinging to her sweaty torso the crook of her arm was punctured and bruised dont come near me whats wrong dont come near me he took a step back at the ferocity of her order what the hell had they done to her she sat up fully and put her head between her legs elbows on her knees wait she said still whispering her breath became very regular he waited aware for the first time that the room seemed to buzz perhaps not just the room perhaps this whineas if a generator were humming away to itself somewhere in the buildinghad been in the air since hed first come in if so he hadnt noticed it now waiting for her to finish whatever ritual she was engaged upon it irritated him subtle yet so pervasive it was impossible after a few seconds of hearing it to know if it were more than a whine in the inner ear he swallowed hard his sinuses clicked the sound went on a monotone at last carys looked up its all right she said he isnt here i could have told you that he left the house two hours ago i watched him go he doesnt need to be here physically she said rubbing the back of her neck are you all right im fine from the tone of her voice they might have seen each other only the day before he felt foolish as though his relief his desire to pick her up and run was inappropriate even redundant we have to go he said they may come back she shook her head no use she told him what do you mean no use if you knew what he can do believe me ive seen he thought of bella poor dead bella with her pups suckling rot hed seen enough and more theres no use trying to escape she insisted hes got access to my head im an open book to him this was an overstatement he was less and less able to control her but she was tired of the fight almost as tired as the european she wondered sometimes if he hadnt infected her with his worldweariness if a trace of him in her cortex hadnt tainted every possibility with the knowledge of its dissolution she saw that now in marty whose face shed dreamed whose body shed wanted saw how he would age would wind down and die as everything wound down and died why stand up at all the disease in her system asked if its only a matter of time before you fall down again cant you block him out marty demanded im too weak to resist him with you ill be weaker still why the remark appalled him as soon as i relax hell get through do you see the moment i surrender to anything anyone he can break in marty thought about carys face on the pillow and the way for an insane moment another face had seemed to peer down between her fingers the last european had been watching even then sharing the experience a mйnage а trois for male female and occupying spirit its obscenity touched deeper chords of anger in him not the superficial rage of a righteous man but a profound rejection of the european in all his decadence whatever happened as a consequence he would not be talked into leaving carys to mamoulians devices if need be hed take her against her will when she was out of this buzzing house with the despair peeling the wallpaper shed remember how good life could be hed make her remember he stepped toward her again and went down on his haunches to touch her she flinched hes occupied he reassured her hes at the casino hell kill you she said simply if he finds youve been here hell kill me whatever happens now ive interfered ive seen his hideyhole and im going to do damage to it before we go just so he remembers me do whatever you want to do she shrugged its up to you but leave me be so papa was right marty said bitterly papa what did he tell you that you wanted to be with mamoulian all along no you want to be like him no marty no i suppose he supplies the bestquality dope eh and i cant can i she didnt deny this just looked sullen what the fuck am i doing here he said youre happy arent you christ youre happy it was laughable to think how hed misunderstood the politics of this rescue she was content in this hovel as long as she was supplied her talk of mamoulians invasions were window dressing in her heart she could forgive him every crime he perpetrated as long as the dope kept coming he stood up wheres his room no marty i want to see where he sleeps where is it she pulled herself up on his arm her hands were hot and damp please leave marty this isnt a game its not all going to be forgiven when we come to the end you know it doesnt even stop when you die do you understand what im saying oh yes he said i understand he put his palm on her face her breath smelled sour his too he thought but for the whisky im not an innocent any longer i know whats going on not all of it but enough ive seen things i pray i never see again ive heard stories christ i understand how could he impress it upon her forcibly enough im shitscared ive never been so scared in my life youve got reason she said coldly dont you care what happens to you not much ill find you dope he said if thats all thats keeping you here ill get it for you did a doubt cross her face he pressed the point home i saw you looking for me at the funeral you were there why were you looking if you didnt want me to come she shrugged i dont know i thought maybe youd gone with papa dead you mean she frowned at him no gone away wherever hes gone it took a moment for her words to sink in at last he said you mean hes not dead she shook her head i thought you knew i thought youd be involved with his getaway of course the old bastard wasnt dead great men didnt just lie down and die offstage they bided their time through the middle actsrevered mourned and vilifiedbefore appearing to play some final scene or other a death scene a marriage where is he marty asked i dont know and neither does mamoulian he tried to get me to find him the way i found toy but i cant do it ive lost focus i even tried to find you once it was useless i could scarcely think my way beyond the front door but you found toy that was at the beginning now im used up i tell him it hurts like somethings going to break inside me pain remembered and actual registered on her face and you still want to stay itll be over soon for all of us come with me ive got friends who can help us he appealed to her gripping her wrists gentle god cant you see i need you please i need you im no use im weak me too im weak too we deserve each other the thought in its cynicism seemed to please her she pondered it a moment before saying maybe we do very quietly her face was a maze of indecision dope and doubt finally she said ill dress he hugged her hard breathing the staleness of her hair knowing that this first victory might be his only one but jubilating nevertheless she gently broke his embrace and turned to the business of preparing to go he watched her while she pulled on her jeans but her selfconsciousness made him leave her to it he stepped onto the landing out of her presence the hum filled his ears louder now he thought than it had been switching on his flashlight he climbed the last flight of stairs to mamoulians room with each step he took the whine deepened it sounded in the boards of the stairs and in the wallsa living presence on the top landing there was only one door the room beyond it apparently spread over the entire top floor mamoulian the natural aristocrat had taken the choicest space for himself the door had been left open the european feared no intruder when marty pushed it swung inward a few inches but his reluctant flashlight beam failed to penetrate more than an arms length into the darkness beyond he stood on the threshold like a child hesitating in front of a ghosttrain ride during his peripheral association with mamoulian he had come to feel an intense curiosity about the man there was harm there no doubt of that perhaps terrible capacities for violence but just as mamoulians face had appeared beneath carys there was probably a face under that of the european more than one perhaps half a hundred faces each stranger than the one before regressing toward some state that was older than bethlehem he had to have one peep didnt he one look for old times sake girding his loins he pushed forward into the living darkness of the room marty something flickered in front of him a bubble burst in his head as carys called up to him marty im ready the hum in the room seemed to have risen as he entered now as he withdrew it lowered itself to a moan of disappointment dont go it seemed to sigh why go she can wait let her wait stay awhile up here and see whats to be seen theres no time carys said almost angered to have been summoned away marty closed the door on the voice and went down i dont feel good she said when he joined her on the lower landing is it him is he trying to get to you no im just dizzy i didnt realize that id got so weak theres a car outside he said offering a supportive hand she waved him off theres a parcel of my things she said in the room he went back to get it and was picking it up when she made a small noise of complaint and stumbled on the stairs are you all right yes she said when he appeared on the stairs beside her pillowcase parcel in hand she gave him an ashen look the house wants me to stay she whispered well take it steady he said and went ahead of her for fear she stumble again they reached the hallway without further incident we cant go by the front door she said its doublelocked from the outside as they made their way back through the hall they heard the unmistakable sound of the back door opening shit marty said under his breath he let go of carys arm and slipped back through the gloom to the front door and tried to open it it was as carys had warned doublelocked panic was rising in him but in its confusion a still voice which he knew to be the voice of the room said no need to worry come up be safe in me hide in me he thrust the temptation aside carys face was turned to his its breer she breathed the dogkiller was in the kitchen marty could hear him smell him carys tapped at martys sleeve and pointed to a bolted door under the well of the stairs cellar he guessed whitefaced in the murk she pointed down he nodded breer about some business was singing to himself strange to think of him happy this lumbering slaughterer content enough with his lot to sing carys had slid the bolt open on the cellar door steps dimly illuminated by the thrown light from the kitchen led down into the pit a smell of disinfectant and wood shaving healthy smells they crept down the stairs cringing at each scraped heel each creaking step but the razoreater was too busy to hear it seemed there was no howl of pursuit marty closed the cellar door on them desperately hoping freer would not notice that the bolts had been drawn and listened in time the sound of running water then the clink of cups a teapot perhaps the monster was brewing camomile breers senses were not as acute as they had been the heat of the summer made him listless and weak his skin smelled his hair was falling out his bowels would scarcely move these days he needed a holiday hed decided once the european had found whitehead and dispatched himand that was surely only a matter of days awayhed go and see the aurora borealis that would mean leaving his houseguesthe felt her proximity mere feet awaybut by that time she would have lost her appeal anyway he was more fickle than he used to be and beauty was transient in two weeks three in cool weather all their charms dispersed he sat down at the table and poured a cup of the camomile its scent once a great joy to him was too subtle for his dogged sinuses but he drank it for traditions sake later hed go up to his room and watch the soap operas he loved so much maybe hed look in on carys and watch her while she slept oblige her if she woke to pass water in his presence lost in a reverie of toilet training he sat and sipped his tea marty had hoped the man would retire to his room with his brew leaving them access to the back door but breer was clearly staying put for awhile he reached back in the dark to carys she was on the stairs behind him trembling from head to toe as was he foolishly hed left his jimmy his only weapon somewhere in the house probably in carys room should it come to a facetoface confrontation he was weaponless worse time was passing how long before mamoulian came home his heart sank at the thought he slid down the stairs hands on the cold brick of the wall past carys and into the body of the cellar itself perhaps there was a weapon of some kind down here even hope of hopes another exit from the house there was very little light however he could see no chinks to suggest a trapdoor or coalhole certain that he was out of direct line with the door he switched on his flashlight the cellar was not entirely empty there was a tarpaulin strung up to divide it an artificial wall he put his hand up to the low roof and guided himself across the cellar step by tentative step clinging to the pipes on the ceiling for equilibrium he pulled the tarpaulin aside and aimed the flashlight beam into the space beyond as he did so his stomach leaped up into his mouth a cry almost came he stifled it an instant before it escaped a yard or two from where he stood was a table at it sat a young girl she was staring at him he put his fingers to his mouth to hush her before she cried out but there was no need she neither moved nor spoke the glazed look on her face was not mental deficiency the child was dead he now understood there was dust on her oh christ he said very quietly carys heard him she turned and made her way to the bottom of the steps marty she breathed stay away he said unable to unglue his eyes from the dead girl there was more than the body to feast his eyes upon there were the knives and the plate on the table in front of her with a napkin lovingly shaken out and spread in her lap the plate he saw had meat on it sliced thinly as if by a master butcher he moved past the body trying to slide from under its gaze as he passed the table he brushed the silk napkin it slid through the divide of the girls legs two horrors came brutal twins one upon the other the napkin had neatly covered a place on the girls inner thigh from which the meat on her plate had been carved in the same moment came another recognition that he had eaten such meat at whiteheads encouragement in the room at the estate it had been the tastiest of delicacies hed left his plate clean nausea swept up him he dropped the flashlight as he tried to fight the sickness back but it was beyond his physical control the bitter odor of stomach acid filled the cellar all at once there was no hiding no help for this insanity but to throw it up and take the consequences overhead the razoreater raised himself from his tea pushed back his chair and came out of the kitchen who his thick voice demanded whos down there he crossed unerringly to the cellar door and pulled it open dead fluorescent light rolled down the stairs whos there he said again and now he was coming down in pursuit of the light his feet thundering on the wooden steps what are you doing he was shouting his voice was at hysteria pitch you cant come down here marty looked up dizzied by breathlessness to see carys crossing the cellar toward him her eyes alighted on the tableau at the table but she kept admirable control ignoring the body and reaching for the knife and fork that sat beside the plate she snatched them both up catching the tablecloth in her haste the plate and its flyblown serving spun to the floor knives cluttered beside it breer had paused at the bottom of the stairs to take in the desecration of his temple now appalled he came careering toward the infidels his size lending awesome momentum to the attack dwarfed by him carys halfturned as he reached for her roaring she was eclipsed marty couldnt make out who was where but the confusion lasted only seconds then breer was raising his gray hands as if to push carys off his head shaking to and fro a howl was issuing from him more of complaint than pain carys ducked his flailing and slipped sideways out of harms way the knife and fork she had held were no longer in her hands breer had run straight onto them he seemed not to be aware of their presence in his gut however his concern was for the girl whose body was even now toppling and falling into a rubberjointed heap on the cellar floor he rushed to her comfort ignoring the desecraters in his anguish carys caught sight of marty his face a greaseball hauling himself upright by hanging on to the ceiling pipes move she yelled at him she waited long enough to see that he had responded and then made for the stairs as she clattered up the steps toward the light she heard the razoreater behind him shouting no no she glanced over her shoulder marty gained the bottom of the stairs just as breers handsmanicured perfumed and lethalgrabbed for him marty threw an illaimed swipe backward and breer lost his hold it was a moments grace however no more marty was only halfway up the stairs before his attacker was back on his heels the rouged face was smeared as it peered up from the cellar depths the features so contorted by outrage that they appeared scarcely human this time breers grasp caught martys trousers the fingers digging deeply into the muscle of his skin marty yelped as cloth tore and blood ran he flung out a hand to carys who loaned what strength she had left to the contest pulling marty up toward her breer badly balanced lost his snatched grip and marty stumbled up the stairs pressing carys ahead of him she tumbled into the hallway and marty followed with breer at his back at the top of the stairs marty suddenly turned and kicked his heel struck the razoreaters punctured belly breer fell backward hands clawing the air for support there was none to be had his nails managed to rake the brickwork as he toppled and fell heavily down the steps hitting the stone floor of the cellar with a lazy thud there sprawled he lay still a painted giant marty slammed the door on him and bolted it he felt too squeamish to look at the gouging on his leg but he could tell by the warmth soaking into sock and shoe that it was bleeding badly can you you get something he said just to cover it too breathless to reply carys nodded and rounded the corner into the kitchen there was a towel on the draining board but it was too unsavory to be used on an open wound she started to search for something clean however primitive it was time they were gone mamoulian would not stay out all night in the hallway marty listened for any sound from the cellar he heard none another noise infiltrated however one that hed almost forgotten about the buzz of the house was back in his head and that mellow voice was threaded into it a dreamy undercurrent common sense told him to shut it out but when he listened trying to sort out its syllables it seemed the nausea and the pain in his leg subsided on the back of a kitchen chair carys had found one of mamoulians darkgray shirts the european was fastidious about his laundry the shirt had been recently laundered an ideal bandage she tore it upthough its finequality cotton resistedthen soaked a length of it in cold water to clean the wound and made strips of the rest to bind the leg up when she was done she went out into the hallway but marty had gone he had to see or if seeing wouldnt do then he would learn a new way of knowing that was the promise the room whispered in his ear a new thing to know and a way of knowing it he pulled himself up the banisters hand over hand less and less aware of the pain as he climbed to the buzzing darkness he wanted so much to take the ghosttrain ride there were dreams in there hed never dreamed would never have a chance to dream again blood squelched in his shoe he laughed at it a spasm had begun in his leg he ignored it the last steps were ahead he climbed them with steady work the door was ajar he achieved the summit of the stairs and limped toward it though it was totally dark in the cellar that scarcely concerned the razoreater it was many weeks since his eyes had worked as well as theyd used to hed learned to substitute touch for sight he stood up and tried to think clearly soon the european would come home there would be punishment for leaving the house unattended and letting this escape take place worse than that he would not see the girl anymore no longer be able to watch her pass water that fragrant water he preserved for special occasions he was desolate he heard her moving even now in the hallway above him she was going up the stairs the rhythm of her tiny feet was familiar to him hed listened long nights and days to her padding back and forth in her cell in his minds eye the ceiling of the cellar became transparent he looked up between her legs as she climbed the stairs that lavish slit gaped it made him angry to be losing it and her she was old of course not like the pretty at the table or the others on the streets but there had been times when her presence had been the one thing keeping him from insanity he went back stumbling in the pitch in the direction of his little autocannibal whose dining had been so rudely interrupted before he got to her his foot kicked at one of the carving knives hed left on the table should she want to help herself he went down on all fours and patted the ground until he found it and then he crawled back up the stairs and started to hack at the wood where the light through the door crack showed the bolts to be carys didnt want to go to the top of the house again there was so much up there she feared innuendo rather than fact but enough to make her weak why marty had gone upand that was the only place he could have goneconfounded her despite his claim to understanding there was still so much he had to learn marty shed called at the foot of the stairs hoping hed appear at the top smiling and limp down to her without her having to go up and fetch him but her inquiry was met with silence and the night wasnt getting any younger the european might come to the door at any moment unwillingly she started up the stairs marty had never understood until now hed been a virgin living in a world innocent of this deep and exhilarating penetration not simply of body of mind too the air in the room closed around his head as soon as he stepped into it the plates of his skull seemed to grind against each other the voice of the room no longer needing its whispered tones shouted in his brain so you came of course you came welcome to wonderland he was dimly aware that it was his own voice that was speaking these words it had probably been his voice all along he had been talking to himself like a lunatic even though hed now seen through the trick the voice came again lower this timethis is a fine place to find yourself in dont you think at the question he looked around there was nothing to see not even walls if there were windows in the room they were hermetically sealed not a chink of the outside world belonged in here i dont see anything he murmured in reply to the rooms boast the voice laughed he laughed with it nothing here to be frightened of it said then after a smirking pause nothing here at all and that was right wasnt it nothing at all it wasnt just darkness that kept him sightless it was the room itself he glanced giddily over his shoulder he could no longer see the door behind him even though he knew he had left it open when he came in there should have been at least a glimmer of light from downstairs spilling into the room but that illumination had been eaten up as was the beam of his flashlight a smothering gray fog pressed so close to his eyes that even if he lifted his hand up in front of him he could see nothing youre all right here the room soothed him no judges here no bars here am i blind he asked no the room replied youre seeing truly for the first time i dont like it of course you dont but youll learn in time livings not for you ghosts of ghosts the living are you want to lie down be done with that caper nothings essential boy i want to leave would i tell you lies i want to leave please youre in safe hands please he stumbled forward confused as to which way the door was in front or behind arms spread before him like a blind man on a cliff edge he reeled looking for some point of security this wasnt the adventure hed thought it would be it was nothing nothing is essential once stepped into this boundless nowhere had neither distance nor depth north nor south and everything outside itthe stairs the landing the stairs below that the hallway carysall of it was like a fabrication a dream of palpability not a true place there was no true place but here all hed lived and experienced all hed taken joy in taken pain in it was insubstantial passion was dust optimism selfdeception he doubted now even the memory of senses the textures the temperatures color form pattern all diversionsgames the mind had invented to disguise this unbearable zero and why not looking too long into the abyss would madden a man not mad surely said the room savoring the thought always even in his blackest moments there had been something to look forward to a letter a dawn release some glimpse of meaning but here meaning was dead future and past were dead love and life were dead even death was dead because anything that excited emotion was unwelcome here only nothing once and for all nothing help me he said like a lost child go to hell the room respectfully replied and for the first time in his life he knew exactly what that meant on the second landing carys stopped she could hear voices not now she listened more closely plural but the same voicemartys voicespeaking and answering itself it was difficult to know where the exchange was coming from the words seemed to be everywhere and nowhere she glanced into her room then into breers finally steeling herself for a repeat of her nightmare she looked into the bathroom he was in none of them there was no avoiding the unpalatable conclusion hed gone upstairs back to mamoulians room even as she crossed the landing to the flight of stairs that led up to the top story another sound caught her attention somewhere below a blade was hacking wood she knew at once it was the razoreater he was up and itching to come for her what a house this is she thought for all its bland facade it would take another dante to describe its depths and heights dead children razoreaters addicts madmen and all surely the stars that hung at its zenith squirmed in their settings in the earth beneath it the magma curdled in the europeans room marty cried out a bewildered plea calling his name in answer and hoping to god he heard her she scrambled to the top of the stairs and crossed heart in mouth toward the door he had fallen to his knees what was left of his selfpreservation was a tattered and hopeless thought gray on gray even the voice had stopped now it was bored with the banter besides it had taught its lesson well nothing is essential it had said and shown him the why and how or rather dug up that part of him that had known all along now he would just wait for the progenitor of this elegant syllogism to come and dispatch him he lay down not certain if he was alive or dead if the man who would presently come would kill him or resurrect him only certain that to lie down was easiest in this the emptiest of all possible worlds carys had been in this nowhere before shed tasted its flat futile air but in the past few hours she had glimpsed something beyond its aridity there had been victories today not large perhaps but victories nevertheless she thought of the way marty had come his eyes with more than lust in them that was a victory wasnt it shed won that feeling out of him earned it in some incalculable way she would not be beaten by this last oppressor this stale beast that smothered her senses it was only the europeans residue after all his sloughings left to decorate his bower scurf dross it and he were contemptible marty she said where are you nowhere came a voice she followed it stumbling desolation pressed in insisting on her breer paused for a moment a long way off he heard voices he couldnt make out the words but the sense was academic they hadnt escaped yet that was the important thing he had plans for them once he got out especially the man he would divide him into tiny pieces until not even his loved ones could tell which part was his finger which his face he began to hack at the wood with renewed fervor under his relentless attack the door finally began to splinter carys followed martys voice through the fog but he eluded her either he was moving around or else the room was somehow deceiving her echoing his voice off the walls or even impersonating him then his voice called her name close by she turned in the murk utterly without bearings there was no sign of the door shed entered byit had disappeared as had the windows the pieces of her resolve began to unglue doubt seeped in smirking well well and who are you somebody asked perhaps herself i know my name she breathed it wasnt going to unseat her that way i know my name she was a pragmatist damn it she wasnt prone to believing that the world was all in the mind thats why shed gone to h the world was too real now here was this vapor in her ears telling her she was nothing everything was nothing nameless muck shit she told it youre shit his shit it didnt deign to reply she took the advantage while she had it marty can you hear me there was no answer its just a room marty can you hear me thats all it is just a room youve been in me before the voice in her head pointed out remember oh yes she remembered there was a tree in this fog somewhere shed seen it in the sauna it was a blossomladen freak of a tree and under it shed glimpsed such horrid sights was that where marty had gone was he hanging from it even now new fruit damn it no she mustnt give in to such thoughts it was just a room she could find the walls if she concentrated even find the window maybe careless of what she might stumble over she turned to her right and walked four paces five until her outstretched hands hit the wall it was shockingly splendidly solid ha she thought fuck you and your tree look what ive found she put her palms flat on the wall now left or right she threw up an imaginary coin it came down heads and she started to edge along to her left no you dont the room whispered try stopping me nowhere to go it spat back just round and round youve always gone round and round havent you weak lazy ridiculous woman you call me ridiculous you a talking fog the wall she was moving steadily along seemed to stretch on and on after half a dozen paces she began to doubt the theory she was testing perhaps this was a manipulable space after all perhaps she was moving away from marty along some new wall of china but she clung to the cold surface as tenaciously as a climber to a sheer cliff if necessary she would make her way around the entire room until she found the door marty or both pure cunt the room said thats all you are cant even find your way out of a little maze like this better just lie down and take whats coming to you the way good cunts should did she sense a note of desperation in this fresh assault despair said the room i thrive on it cunt she had reached a corner of the room now she turned along the next wall no you dont said the room yes i do she thought i wouldnt go that way oh no really i wouldnt the razoreaters up here with you cant you hear him hes just a few inches ahead of you no dont oh please dont i hate the smell of blood pure histrionics that was all it could muster the more the room panicked the more her spirits rose stop for your own sake stop even as it shouted in her head her hands found the window this was what it was so frightened shed discover cunt it shrieked youll be sorry i promise you oh yes there were no curtains or shutters the window had been entirely boarded up so that nothing could spoil this perfect nullity her fingers scrabbled for purchase on one of the planks it was time she let some outside world in the wood had been very firmly nailed in place however though she tugged there was little or no give shift damn you the plank creaked splinters sprang off it yes she coaxed here we are light a fractured alltoouncertain thread of it filtered between the planks come on she cajoled pulling harder the top joints of her fingers were bent back in her effort to wrest the wood from its place but the thread of light had now widened to a beam it fell on her and through a veil of dirty air she began to make out the shape of her own hands it wasnt daylight that spilled between the planks just the glimmer of streetlamps and car headlights of starlight perhaps of televisions blazing in a dozen houses along caliban street it was sufficient though with every inch the gap increased more certainty invaded the room edge and substance elsewhere in the room marty too felt the light it irritated him like someone throwing open springmorning curtains on a dying man he crabbed his way across the floor trying to bury himself in the fog before it dispersed seeking out the reassuring voice that would tell him nothing was essential but it had gone he was deserted and the light was falling in broader and yet broader strokes he could see a woman outlined against the window she had wrenched off one plank and thrown it down now she was pulling at a second come to mama she was saying and the light came defining her within ever more nauseating detail he wanted none of it it was a burden this being business he exhaled a little whistle of pain and exasperation she turned to him there you are she said crossing to him and pulling him to his feet weve got to be quick marty was staring at the room which was now revealed in all its banality a mattress on the floor an upturned porcelain cup beside it a water jug wake up carys said shaking him no need to go he thought nothing to lose if i stay here and the gray comes again for christs sake marty she yelled at him from below came the sound of wood shrieking hes coming ready or not she thought marty she shouted at him can you hear its breer the name awoke horrors a cold girl sitting at her table laid with her own meat his terrible unspeakable joke the image slapped the fog from martys head the thing that had performed that horror was downstairs he remembered now all too well he looked at carys with clear if tearful eyes what happened no time she said he limped after her toward the door she was still carrying one of the planks shed pulled from the window its nails still in place the noise from below mounted still the din of unhinged door and mind the pain in martys torn leg which the room had so skillfully dulled now raged up again he needed support from carys to make his way down the first flight of stairs they made the descent together his hand bloody from touching the wound marking their passage on the wall halfway down the second flight of stairs the cacophony from the cellar stopped they stood still waiting for breers next move from below there came a thin creak as the razoreater pushed the cellar door wide other than the dim light from the kitchen which had several corners to round before it reached the hallway there was nothing to illuminate the scene hunter and prey both camouflaged by darkness hung on to this tenuous moment neither knowing if the next would bring catastrophe carys left marty behind and slipped down the remaining steps to the bottom of the stairs her feet were all but silent on the carpetless stairs but after the sense deprivation of mamoulians room marty heard her every heartbeat nothing moved in the hallway she beckoned marty down after her the passageway was still and apparently empty breer was near she knew but where he was large and cumbersome hiding places would be difficult to find perhaps she prayed he hadnt escaped after all merely given up exhausted she stepped forward without warning the razoreater emerged from the door of the front room roaring the carving knife descended in a swooping stroke she succeeded in sidestepping the blow but in doing so all but lost her balance it was martys hand that caught her arm and dragged her out of the way of breers second slash the force of the razoreaters charge propelled him past her he slammed against the front door the glass rattled out marty said seeing the way clear along the passage but this time carys had no intention of running there was a time for running and a time for confrontation she might never have another opportunity to thank breer for his many humiliations she shrugged martys hold off and took the wooden club she still carried in a twohanded grasp the razoreater had righted himself the knife still in his hand and now he took a raging step toward her she preempted his attack however she raised the plank and ran at him delivering a blow to the side of his head his neck already fractured by his fall snapped the nails in the plank pierced his skull and she was obliged to relinquish her weapon leaving it fixed like a fifth limb to the side of breers head he fell to his knees his twitching hand dropped the knife while the other scrabbled for the plank and wrenched it from his head she was glad of the darkness the slosh of blood and the tattoo his feet beat on the bare boards were more than enough to appall he knelt upright for several moments then pitched forward pressing the cutlery in his belly all the way home she was satisfied this time when marty pulled at her she went with him as they made their way along the corridor there was a sharp rapping on the wall they stopped what now more possessing spirits what is it he asked the rapping ceased then began again this time accompanied by a voice be quiet will you theres people trying to sleep in here next door she said the thought of their complaints struck her as funny and by the time theyd made their way out of the house past the wreckage of the cellar door and breers cooling camomile they were both laughing they slipped away down the darkened alleyway behind the house to the car where they sat for several minutes tears and laughter coming on them in alternating waves two mad people the calibanese might have guessed or else adulterers amused by a night of adventures xi kingdom come chad schuckman and tom loomis had been bringing the message of the church of the resurrected saints to the populace of london for three weeks now and they were sick to the back teeth of it some way to spend a vacation tom grumbled daily as they planned their days route memphis seemed a long way off and they were both homesick for it besides the whole campaign was proving a failure the sinners they encountered on the doorsteps of this godforsaken city were as indifferent to the reverends message of imminent apocalypse as they were to his promise of deliverance despite the weather sin wasnt hot news in england these days chad was contemptuous they dont know what theyve got coming he kept telling tom who knew all the descriptions of the deluge by heart but also knew they sounded better from the lips of a golden boy like chad than from himself he even suspected that those few people who did stop to listen did so more because chad had the looks of a cornfed angel than because they wanted to hear the reverends inspired word most simply slammed their doors but chad was adamant theres sin here he assured tom and where theres sin theres guilt and where theres guilt theres money for the lords work it was a simple equation and if tom had some doubts about its ethics he kept them to himself better his silence than chads disapprobation all they had was each other in this foreign city and tom wasnt about to lose his guiding light sometimes though it was difficult to keep your faith intact especially on blistering days like this when your polyester suit was itching at the back of your neck and the lord if he was in his heaven was keeping well out of sight not a hint of a breeze to cool your face not a rain cloud in sight isnt this from something tom asked chad whats that chad was counting the pamphlets they still had left to distribute today the name of the street tom said caliban its from something that so chad had finished counting we only got rid of five pamphlets he handed the armful of literature to tom and fished for a comb in the inside pocket of his jacket despite the heat he looked cool and unruffled by comparison tom felt shabby overheated and he feared easily tempted from the path of righteousness by what he wasnt certain but he was open to suggestions chad put the comb through his hair restoring in one elegant sweep the perfect sheen of his halo it was important the reverend taught to look your best youre agents of the lord hed said he wants you to be clean and tidy to shine through every nook and cranny here chad said exchanging the comb for the pamphlets your hairs a mess tom took the comb its teeth had gold in them he made a desultory attempt to control his coxcomb while chad looked on toms hair wouldnt lie flat the way chads did the lord probably tutted at that he wouldnt like it at all but then what did the lord like he disapproved of smoking drinking fornication tea coffee pepsi roller coasters masturbation and for those weak creatures who indulged in any or god help them all of the above the deluge hovered tom just prayed that the waters when they came would be cool the guy in the dark suit who answered the door of number eightytwo caliban street reminded both tom and chad of the reverend not physically of course bliss was a tanned glutinous man while this dude was thin and sallow but there was the same implicit authority about them both the same seriousness of purpose he was drawn to the pamphlets too the first real interest theyd had all morning he even quoted deuteronomy at thema text they were unfamiliar withand then offering them both a drink invited them into the house it was like home from home the bare walls and floors the smell of disinfectant and incense as though something had just been cleaned up truth to tell tom thought this guy had taken the asceticism to extremes the back room he led them into boasted two chairs no more my name is mamoulian how do you do im chad schuckman this is thomas loomis both saints eh the young men looked mystified your names both names of saints saint chad the blond one ventured oh certainly he was an english bishop were speaking of the seventh century now thomas of course the great doubter he left them awhile to fetch water tom squirmed in his chair whats your problem chad snapped hes the first sniff of a convert weve had over here hes weird you think the lord cares if hes weird chad said it was a good question and one for which tom was shaping a reply when their host came back in your water do you live alone chad asked its such a big house for one person of late ive been alone mamoulian said proffering the glasses of water and i must say im in serious need of help i bet you are tom thought the man looked at him as the idea flashed through his head almost as though hed said it aloud tom flushed and drank his water to cover his embarrassment it was warm had the english never heard of refrigerators mamoulian turned his attention back to saint chad what are you two doing in the next few days the lords work chad returned patly mamoulian nodded good he said spreading the word i will make you fishers of men matthew chapter four chad returned perhaps said mamoulian if i allowed you to save my immortal soul you might help me doing what mamoulian shrugged i need the assistance of two healthy young animals like yourself animals that didnt sound too fundamentalist had this poor sinner never heard of eden no tom thought looking at the mans eyes no he probably never has im afraid weve got other commitments chad replied politely but well be very happy to have you come along when the reverend arrives and have you baptized id like to meet the reverend the man returned tom wasnt certain if this wasnt all a charade we have so little time before the makers wrath descends mamoulian was saying chad nodded fervently then we shall be as flotsamshall we notas flotsam in the flood the words were the reverends almost precisely tom heard them falling from this mans narrow lips and that accusation of being a doubter came home to roost but chad was entranced his face had that evangelical look that came over it during sermons the look that tom had always envied but now thought positively rabid chad he began flotsam in the flood chad repeated hallelujah tom put his glass down beside his chair i think we should be going he said and got up for some reason the bare boards he stood on seemed far more than six feet away from his eyes more like sixty as though he was a tower about to topple his foundations dug away weve got so many streets to cover he said trying to focus on the problem at hand which was in a nutshell how to get out of this house before something terrible happened the deluge mamoulian announced is almost upon us tom reached toward chad to wake him from his trance the fingers at the end of his outstretched arm seemed a thousand miles from his eyes chad he said saint chad he of the halo pissing rainbows are you all right boy the stranger asked swiveling his fish eyes in toms direction i feel what do you feel mamoulian asked chad was looking at him too face innocent of concern innocent in fact of all feeling perhapsthis thought dawned on tom for the first timethat was why chads face was so perfect white symmetrical and completely empty sit down the stranger said before you fall down its all right chad reassured him no tom said his knees felt disobedient he suspected theyd give out very soon trust me chad said tom wanted to chad had usually been right in the past believe me were on to a good thing here sit down like the gentleman said is it the heat yes chad told the man on toms behalf its the heat it gets hot in memphis but weve got airconditioning he turned to tom and put his hand on his companions shoulder tom let himself give in to weakness and sat down he felt a fluttering at the back of his neck as though a hummingbird was hovering there but he didnt have the willpower to flick it away you call yourselves agents the man said almost under his breath i dont think you know the meaning of the word chad was quick to their defense the reverend says the reverend the man interrupted contemptuously do you think he had the slightest idea of your value this flummoxed chad tom tried to tell his friend not to be flattered but the words wouldnt come his tongue lay in his mouth like a dead fish whatever happens now he thought at least itll happen to us together theyd been friends since first grade theyd tasted pubescence and metaphysics together tom thought of them as inseparable he hoped the man understood that where chad went tom went too the fluttering at his neck had stopped a warm reassurance was creeping over his head things didnt seem so bad after all i need help from you young men to do what chad asked to begin the deluge mamoulian replied a smile uncertain at first but broadening as the idea caught his imagination appeared on chads face his features too often sober with zeal ignited oh yes he said he glanced across at tom hear what this mans telling us tom nodded you hear man i hear i hear all his blissful life chad had waited for this invitation for the first time he could picture the literal reality behind the destruction hed threatened on a hundred doorsteps in his mind watersred raging watersmounted into foamcrested waves and bore down on this pagan city we are as flotsam in the flood he said and the words brought images with them men and womenbut mostly womenrunning naked before these curling tides the water was hot rains of it fell on their screaming faces their gleaming jiggling breasts this was what the reverend had promised all along and here was this man asking them to help make it all possible to bring this thrashing foamy day of days to consummation how could they refuse he felt the urge to thank the man for considering them worthy the thought fathered the action his knees bent and he fell to the floor at mamoulians feet thank you he said to the man with the dark suit youll help me then yes chad replied wasnt this homage sign enough of course behind him tom murmured his own concession thank you chad said thank you but when he looked up the man apparently convinced by their devotion had already left the room marty and carys slept together in his single bed long rewarding sleep if the baby in the room below them cried in the night they didnt hear it nor did they hear the sirens on kilburn high road police and fire engines going to a conflagration in maida vale dawn through the dirty window didnt wake them either though the curtains had not been drawn but once in the early hours marty turned in his sleep and his eyes flickered open to see the first light of day at the glass rather than turning away from it he let it fall on his lids as they flickered down again they had half a day together in the flat before the need began bathing themselves drinking coffee saying very little carys washed and bound the wound on martys leg they changed their clothes ditching those theyd worn the previous night it wasnt until the middle of the afternoon that they started to talk the dialogue began quite calmly but carys nervousness escalated as she felt hungrier for a fix and the talk rapidly became a desperate diversion from her jittering belly she told marty what life with the european had been like the humiliations the deceptions the sense she had that he knew her father and her too better than she guessed marty in his turn attempted to paraphrase the story whitehead had told him on that last night but she was too distracted to concentrate properly her conversation became increasingly agitated i have to have a fix marty now pretty soon hed been waiting for this moment and dreading it not because he couldnt find her a supply he knew he could but because hed hoped somehow shed be able to resist the need when she was with him i feel really bad she said youre all right youre with me hell come you know not now he wont hell be angry and hell come martys mind went back and back again to his experience in the upstairs room of caliban street what he had seen there or rather not seen there had terrified him more profoundly than the dogs or breer those were merely physical dangers but what had gone on in the room was a danger of another order altogether he had felt perhaps for the first time in his life that his soula notion he had hitherto rejected as christian flimflamhad been threatened what he meant by the word he wasnt certain not he suspected what the pope meant but some part of him more essential than limb or life had been almost eclipsed and mamoulian had been responsible what more could the creature unleash if pressed his curiosity was more now than an idle desire to know what was behind the veil it had become a necessity how could they hope to arm themselves against this demagogue without some clue to his nature i dont want to know carys said reading his thoughts if he comes he comes theres nothing we can do about it last night he began about to remind her of how they had won the skirmish she waved the thought away before it was finished the strain on her face was unbearable her need was flaying her marty he looked across at her you promised she said accusingly i havent forgotten hed done the mental arithmetic in his head not the cost of the drug itself but of lost pride he would have to go to flynn for the heroin he knew no one else he could trust they were both fugitives now from mamoulian and from the law ill have to make a phone call he said make it she replied she seemed to have physically altered in the last halfhour her skin was waxy her eyes had a desperate gleam in them the shaking was worsening by the minute dont make it easy for him she said he frowned easy he can make me do things i dont want to she said tears had started to run there was no accompanying sob just a freefall from the eyes maybe make me hurt you its all right ill go now theres a guy lives with charmaine hell be able to get me stuff dont worry you want to come she hugged herself no she said ill slow you down just go he pulled on his jacket trying not to look at her the mixture of frailty and appetite scared him the sweat on her body was fresh it gathered in the soft passage behind her clavicles it streamed on her face dont let anybody in ok she nodded her eyes searing him when hed gone she locked the door behind him and went back to sit on the bed the tears started to come again freely not grief tears just salt water well perhaps there was some grief in them for this rediscovered fragility and for the mats who had gone down the stairs he was responsible for her present discomfort she thought hed been the one to seduce her into thinking she could stand on her own two feet and where had it brought her brought them both to this hothouse cell in the middle of a july afternoon with so much malice ready to close in on them it wasnt love she felt for him that was too big a burden of feeling to carry it was at best infatuation mingled with that sense of impending loss she always tasted when close to somebody as though every moment in his presence she was internally mourning the time when he would no longer be there below the door slammed as he stepped into the street she lay back on the bed thinking of the first time theyd made love together of how even that most private act had been overlooked by the european the thought of mamoulian once begun was like a snowball on a steep hill it rolled gathering speed and size as it went until it was monstrous an avalanche a whiteout for an instant she doubted that she was simply remembering the feeling was so clear so real then she had no doubts she stood up the bedsprings creaking it wasnt memory at all he was here flynn hello the voice at the other end of the line was gruff with sleep who is this its marty have i woken you up what the hell do you want i need some help there was a long silence at the other end of the phone are you still there yeah yeah i need heroin the gruffness left the voice incredulity replaced it you on it i need it for a friend marty could sense the smile spreading on flynns face can you get me something quickly how much ive got a hundred quid its not impossible soon yeah if you like what time is it now the thought of easy money had got flynns mind oiled and ready to go onefifteen ok he paused for calculations you come around in about threequarters of an hour that was efficient unless as marty suspected flynn was involved with the market so deeply he had easy access to the stuff his jacket pocket for instance i cant guarantee of course he said just to keep the desperation simmering but ill do my best cant say fairer than that can i thanks marty replied i appreciate this just bring the cash marty thats all the appreciation i need the phone went dead flynn had a knack of getting the last word in bastard marty said to the receiver and slammed it down he was shaking slightly his nerves were frayed he slipped into a newsstand picked up a packet of cigarettes and then got back into the car it was lunchtime the traffic in the middle of london would be thick and it would take the best part of fortyfive minutes to get to the old stamping ground there was no time to go back and check on carys besides he guessed she wouldnt have thanked him for delaying his purchase she needed dope more than she needed him the european appeared too suddenly for carys to hold his insinuating presence at bay but weak as she felt she had to fight and there was something about this assault that was different from others was it that he was more desperate in his approach this time the back of her neck felt physically bruised by his entrance she rubbed it with a sweating palm i found you he said in her head she looked around the room for a way to drive him out no use he told her leave us alone youve treated me badly carys i should punish you but i wont not if you give me your father is that so much to ask i have a right to him you know that in your heart of hearts he belongs to me she knew better than to trust his coaxing tones if she found papa what would he do then leave her to live her life no he would take her too the way hed taken evangeline and toy and only he knew how many others to that tree to that nowhere her eyes came to rest on the small electric cooker in the corner of the room she got up her limbs jangling and walked unsteadily across to it if the european had caught wind of her plan then all the better he was weak she could sense it tired and sad one eye on the sky for kites his concentration faltering but his presence was still distressing enough to muddy her thought processes once she reached the cooker she could hardly think of why she was there she pressed her mind into higher gear refusal that was it the cooker was refusal she reached out and turned on one of the two electric rings no carys he told her this isnt wise his face appeared in her minds eye it was vast and it blotted out the room around her she shook her head to rid herself of him but he wouldnt be dislodged there was a second illusion too besides his face she felt arms around her not a stranglehold but a sheltering embrace they rocked her those arms i dont belong to you she said fighting off the urge to succumb to his cradling in the back of her head she could hear a song being sung its rhythm matched the soporific rhythm of the rocking the words werent english but russian it was a lullaby she knew that without understanding the words and as it ran and she listened it seemed all the hurts shed felt disappeared she was a babeinarms again in his arms he was rocking her to sleep to this murmured song through the lace of approaching sleep she caught sight of a bright pattern though she couldnt fix its significance she remembered that it had been important this orange spiral that glowed not far from her but what did it mean the problem vexed her and kept the sleep she wanted at bay so she opened her eyes a little wider to work out what the pattern was once and for all and so be done with it the cooker came into focus in front of her the ring glowing the air above it shimmered now she remembered and the memory thrust sleepiness away she stretched out her arm toward the heat dont do this the voice in her head advised youll only hurt yourself but she knew better slumber in his arms was more dangerous than any pain the next few moments would bring the heat was uncomfortable though her skin was still inches from its source and for a desperate moment her willpower faltered youll be scarred for life the european said sensing her equivocation let me alone i just dont want to see you hurt child i love you too much the lie was a spur she found the vital ounce of courage raised her hand and pressed it palm down onto the electric ring the european screamed first she heard his voice begin to rise in the instant before her own cry began she pulled her hand off the cooker as the smell of burning hit her mamoulian withdrew from her she felt his retreat relief flooded her system then the pain overwhelmed her and a quick dark came down she didnt fear it though it was quite safe that dark he wasnt in it gone she said and collapsed when she came to less than five minutes later her first thought was that she was holding a fistful of razors she edged her way across to the bed and put her head on it until shed fully regained her consciousness when she had courage enough she looked at her hand the design of the rings was burned quite clearly onto her palm a spiral tattoo she stood up and went to the sink to run the wound under cold water the process calmed the pain somewhat the damage was not as severe as she had thought though it had seemed an age her palm had probably only been in direct contact with the ring for a second or two she wrapped her hand up in one of martys tshirts then she remembered shed read somewhere that burns were best left to the open air and she undid her handiwork exhausted she lay on the bed and waited for marty to bring her a piece of the island the reverend bliss boys stayed in the downstairs back room of the house on caliban street lost in a reverie of watery death for well over an hour in that time mamoulian had gone in search of carys found her and been driven out again but he had discovered her whereabouts more than that he had gleaned that straussthe man he had so foolishly ignored at the sanctuaryhad now gone to fetch the girl heroin it was time he thought to stop being so compassionate he felt like a beaten dog all he wanted to do was to lie down and die it seemed todayespecially since the girls skillful rejection of himthat he felt every hour of his long long life in his sinews he looked down at his hand which still ached with the burn hed received through carys perhaps the girl would understand finally that all of this was inevitable that the endgame he was about to enter was more important than her life or strauss or breers or those of the two idiot memphisites hed left dreaming two floors below he went down to the first landing and into breers room the razoreater was recumbent on his mattress in the corner of the room his neck akimbo his stomach impaled gaping up at him like a lunatic fish at the bottom of the mattress drawn up close because of breers failing eyesight the television gabbled its inanities well be leaving soon mamoulian said did you find her yes i found her a place called bright street the house he seemed to find this thought amusing is painted yellow the second floor i think bright street said breer dreamily shall we go and find her then no not we breer turned a little more toward the european he had braced his broken neck with a makeshift splint and it made movement difficult i want to see her he said you shouldnt have let her go in the first place he came the one from the house i told you oh yes said mamoulian i have plans for strauss shall i find him for you breer said the old images of execution sprang into his head as if fresh from a book of atrocities one or two of them were sharper than ever as if they were close to being realized no need the european replied i have two eager acolytes willing to do that job for me breer sulked what can i do then you can prepare the house for our departure i want you to burn what few possessions we have i want it to be as though we never existed you and i the ends near is it now i know where she is yes she may run off shes too weak she wont be able to move until strauss brings her drug and of course hell never do that youre going to have him killed him and anyone who gets in my way from this moment on ive no energy left for compassion thats been my error so often letting the innocent escape youve got your instructions anthony be about your business he withdrew from the fetid room and went downstairs to his new agents the americans stood respectfully when he opened the door are you ready he asked the blond one who had been the more compliant from the outset started to express his undying thanks over again but mamoulian silenced him he gave them their orders and they took them as if he were dispensing sweets there are knives in the kitchen he said take them and use them in good health chad smiled you want us to kill the wife too the deluge has no time to be selective suppose she hasnt sinned tom said not sure of why he thought this foolish thought oh shes sinned the man replied with glittering eyes and that was good enough for the reverend bliss boys upstairs breer hoisted himself off his mattress with difficulty and stumbled into the bathroom to look at himself in the cracked mirror his injuries had long ago stopped seeping but he looked terrible shave he told himself and sandalwood he was afraid that things were moving too fast now and if he wasnt careful he was going to be left out of the calculations it was time he acted on his own behalf he would find a clean shirt a tie and a jacket and then he would go out courting if the endgame was so close that the evidence had to be destroyed then he had better be quick better finish his romance with the girl before she went the way of all flesh it took considerably longer than threequarters of an hour to cross london a large antinuclear march was underway various sections of the main body were assembling around the city then marching toward a mass rally in hyde park the center of the city which was at best difficult to navigate was so thick with marchers and arrested traffic as to be virtually impassable none of which marty had realized until he was in the thick of it by which time retreat and rerouting was out of the question he cursed his lack of attention there had surely been police signs warning incoming motorists of the delay he had noticed none of them there was nothing to be done however except perhaps t desert the car and set out on foot or by subway neither option was particularly attractive the subway would be packed and walking in todays blistering heat would be debilitating he needed what small reserves of energy he still possessed he was living on adrenaline and cigarettes and had been for too long he was weak he only hopedvain hopethat the opposition was weaker it was the middle of the afternoon by the time he reached charmaines place he drove around the block looking for somewhere to park and eventually found a space around the corner from the house his feet were somewhat reluctant the abasement ahead wasnt particularly attractive but carys was waiting the front door was just slightly ajar he rang the bell nevertheless and waited on the pavement unwilling simply to step into the house perhaps they were upstairs in bed or taking a cool shower together the heat was still furious even though the afternoon was well advanced down at the end of the street an icecream van playing an offkey version of the blue danube appeared and stopped by the curb to await patrons marty glanced toward it the waltz had already attracted two customers they drew his attention for a moment sobersuited young men whose backs were turned to him one of them boasted bright yellow hair it shone in the sun they were taking possession of their ice creams now money was exchanged satisfied they disappeared around the corner without looking over their shoulders despairing of an answer to his bellringing marty pushed the door open it grated across the coconut matting which bore a threadbare welcome a pamphlet stuck halfway through the mailbox dislodged and fell on the inside facedown the sprung mailbox snapped loudly back into place flynn charmaine his voice was an intrusion it carried up the stairs where dust motes thronged the sunlight through the halflanding window it ran into the kitchen where yesterdays milk was curdling on the board beside the sink is anybody in standing in the hallway he heard a fly it circled his head and he waved it off unconcerned it buzzed off down the hallway toward the kitchen tempted by something marty followed it calling charmaines name as he went she was waiting for him in the kitchen as was flynn they had both had their throats cut charmaine had sunk down against the washing machine she sat one leg bent beneath her staring at the opposite wall flynn had been placed with his head over the sink as though bending to douse his face the illusion of life was almost successful even to the splashing sound marty stood in the doorway while the fly not as finicky as he flew around and around the kitchen ecstatic marty just stared there was nothing to be done all that was left was to look they were dead and marty knew without the effort of thinking about it that the killers were dressed in gray and had turned that far corner ice creams in hand accompanied by the blue danube theyd called marty the dancer of wandsworththose whod called him anything at allbecause strauss was the waltz king he wondered if hed ever told charmaine that in any of his letters no he probably hadnt and now it was too late tears had begun to sting the rims of his eyes he fought them back they would interrupt the view and he hadnt finished looking yet the fly whod brought him here was circling close to his head again the european he murmured to it he sent them the fly zigzagged excitedly of course it buzzed ill kill him the fly laughed you dont have any idea what he is he could be the devil himself fucking fly what do you know dont get so grand with me the fly replied youre a shitwalker same as i am he watched it rove looking for a place to put its dirty feet it landed at last on charmaines face atrocious that she didnt raise a lazy hand to swat it away terrible that she just sprawled there leg bent neck slit and let it crawl on her cheek up to her eye down to her nostril supping here and there careless the fly was right he was ignorant if they were to survive he had to root out mamoulians secret life because that knowledge was power carys had been wise all along there was no closing your eyes and turning your back on the european the only way to be free of him was to know him to look at him for as long as courage allowed and see him in every ghastly particular he left the lovers in the kitchen and went to look for the heroin he didnt have to search far the packet was in the inside of flynns jacket which was casually thrown over the sofa in the front room pocketing the fix marty went to the front door aware that stepping out of this house into the open sunlight was tantamount to inviting a murder charge he would be seen and easily recognized the police would be after himin hours but there was no help for it escaping by the back door would look every bit as suspicious at the door he stooped and snatched up the pamphlet that had slid from the letterbox it bore the smiling face of an evangelist one reverend bliss who was standing microphone in hand raising his eyes to heaven join the crowd the banner proclaimed and feel the power of god in operation hear the words feel the spirit he pocketed it for future reference on his way back to kilburn he stopped at a telephone box and reported the murders when they asked him who he was he told them admitting that he was a parole jumper to boot when they told him to turn himself in to the nearest police station he replied that he would but first he had to attend to some personal business as he drove back to kilburn through streets now littered with the aftermath of the march his mind turned over every possible lead to whiteheads whereabouts wherever the old man was there sooner or later mamoulian would be he could try to get carys to find her father of course but he had another request to make of her one that it might take more than gentle persuasion to get her to concede to he would have to locate the old man by his own ingenuity it was only as he drove back and caught sight of a signpost to holborn that he remembered mr halifax and the strawberries marty smelled carys as soon as he opened the door but for a few seconds he mistook the scent for pork cooking only when he crossed to the bed did he see the burn on her open hand im all right she told him very coolly hes been here she nodded but hes gone now didnt he leave me any messages he asked with a crooked smile she sat up something was horribly wrong with him his voice was odd his face was the color of fishmeat he stood off from her as if the merest touch would shatter him looking at him made her almost forget the appetite that still consumed her message she said for you she didnt understand why whats happened they were dead who flynn charmaine somebody slit their throats his face came within an ace of crumpling up this was the nadir surely they had no further to fall oh marty he knew i was going back to my house he said she looked for accusation in his voice but there was none she defended herself nevertheless it couldnt have been me i dont even know where you live oh but he does im sure he makes it his business to know everything why kill them i dont see why mistaken identity breer knows who you are it wasnt breer who did it you saw who i think so two kids he fished for the pamphlet hed found behind the door the assassins had delivered it he guessed something about their sober suits and that glimpsed halo of blond hair suggested doorstep evangelists freshfaced and lethal wouldnt the european delight in such a paradox they made an error he said slipping off his jacket and starting to unbutton his sweatsoaked shirt they just went into the house and murdered the first man and woman they met only it wasnt me it was flynn he pulled his shirt out of his trousers and slung it off its so easy isnt it he doesnt care about the lawhe thinks hes above all that marty was forcibly aware of how ironic this was he the excon the despiser of uniforms cleaving to the notion of law it wasnt a pretty refuge but it was the best hed got at the moment what is he carys what makes him so certain hes immune she was staring down at the fervent face of the reverend bliss baptism in the holy ghost he promised blithely what does it matter what he is she said otherwise its over she made no reply he went to the sink and washed his face and chest in cold water as far as the european was concerned they were like sheep in a pen not just in this room in any room wherever they hid hed find their refuge in time and come there might be a small struggledo sheep fight the oncoming execution he wondered he should have asked the fly the fly would have known he turned from the sink water dripping from his jawline to look at carys she was staring at the floor scratching herself go to him he said without warning hed tried a dozen ways to open this conversation as he drove back but why try to sweeten the pill she looked up at him emptyeyed what did you say go to him carys go into him the way he goes into you reverse the procedure she almost laughed there was a sneer mustering in reply to this obscenity into him she said yes youre insane we cant fight what we dont know and we cant know unless we look you can do that you can do it for both of us he started across the room toward her but she bowed her head again find out what he is find a weakness a hint of a weakness anything that can help us survive no because if you dont whatever we try to do wherever we try to go hes going to come him or one of his cohorts and slit my throat the way he did flynns and you god knows i think youll be wishing youd died the way i did this was brutal stuff and he felt dirtied by the very saying of it but he knew how passionately shed resist if bullying didnt work he still had the heroin he squatted on his haunches in front of her looking up at her think about it carys give the idea a chance her face hardened you saw his room she said itd be like locking myself in an asylum he wouldnt even know he said he wouldnt be prepared im not going to discuss it give me the smack marty he stood up face slack dont make me cruel he thought you want me to shoot up and then wait is that it yes she said faintly then more strongly yes is that all you think youre worth she didnt reply her face was impossible to read if you thought that whyd you burn yourself i didnt want to go not without seeing you again being with you she was trembling we cant win she said if we cant win whats to lose im tired she replied shaking her head give me the smack maybe tomorrow when im feeling better she looked up at him eyes shining in the bruises of her eye sockets just give me the smack then you can forget all about it eh marty dont its going to spoil she stopped spoil what our last few hours together i need the dope marty thats very convenient fuck what happens to me he suddenly felt this to be indisputably true that she didnt care what he suffered and never really had hed run into her life and now once hed brought her dope he could fade out of it again and leave her to her dreams he wanted to hit her he turned his back on her before he did behind him she said we could have some dopeyou too marty why not then we could be together he didnt reply for a long moment when he did he said no fix marty no fix until you go to him it took carys several seconds to register the full impact of his blackmail hadnt she said a long time ago that hed disappointed her because shed expected a brute shed spoken too soon hell know she breathed hell know the moment i get near him tread softly you can you know you can youre clever youve crept into my head often enough i cant she protested didnt he understand what he was asking he made a face sighed and crossed to his jacket which was where hed dropped it on the floor he rummaged around in the pocket until he found the heroin it was a pitifully small packet and if he knew flynn the stuff was cut but that was her business not his she stared transfixed at the packet its all yours he said and threw it over to her it landed on the bed beside her youre welcome to it she still stared now at his empty hand he broke her look to pick up his stale shirt and slip it back on where are you going ive seen you high on that crap ive heard the garbage you talk i dont want to remember you like that i have to have it she hated him she looked at him standing in a patch of lateafternoon sun with his bare belly and his bare chest and she hated every fiber of him the blackmail she could understand it was crude but functional this desertion was a worse kind of trick altogether even if i was to do as you say she began the thought seemed to shrink her i wont find out anything he shrugged look the smacks yours he said youve got what you wanted and what about you what do you want i want to live and i think this is our only chance even then it was such a slim chance the slimmest crack in the wall through which they might if fate loved them slip she weighed up the options why she even contemplated his idea she wasnt certain on another day she might have said for loves sake finally she said you win he sat down and watched her prepare for the journey ahead first she washed not just her face her whole body standing on a spread towelat the little sink in the corner of the room with the gasfired water heater roaring as it spat water into the bowl watching her he got an erection and he felt ashamed that he should be thinking of sex when so much was at issue but that was just the puritan talking he should feel whatever felt right shed taught him that when shed finished she put her underwear back on and a tshirt it was what shed been wearing when hed arrived at caliban street he noted simple unconfining clothes she sat on a chair her skin rippled with gooseflesh he wanted to be forgiven by her to be told that his manipulation was justified andwhatever happened from now onshe understood that hed acted for the best she offered no such disclaimer she just said i think im ready what can i do very little she replied but be here marty and if you know if anything seems to be wrong can i help you no she answered when will i know that youre there he asked she looked at him as though his question was an idiots and said youll know it wasnt difficult to find the european her mind went to him with almost distressing readiness as if into the arms of a longlost compatriot she could distinctly feel the pull of him though not she thought a conscious magnetism when her thoughts arrived at caliban street and entered the room at the top of the stairs her suspicions about his passivity were verified he was lying on the bare boards of the room in a posture of utter exhaustion perhaps she thought i can do this after all like a teasing mistress she crept to his side and slipped into him she murmured marty flinched there were movements in her throat which were so thin he felt he could almost see the words shaping in it speak to me he willed her say its all right her body had become rigid he touched her her muscle was stone as though shed exchanged glances with the basilisk carys she murmured again her throat palpitating but no words came there was barely breath can you hear me if she could she made no sign of it seconds passed into minutes and still she was a wall his questions fracturing against her and falling into silence and then she said im here her voice was insubstantial like a foreign station found on a radio words from some unfixable place with him he asked yes no prevarication now he charged himself shed gone to the european as hed asked now he had to use her courage as efficiently as possible and call her back before anything went wrong he asked the most difficult question first and the one he most needed an answer to what is he carys i dont know she said the tip of her tongue flickered out to spread a film of spit across her lips so dark she muttered it was dark in him the same palpable darkness as in the room at caliban street but for the moment at least the shadows were passive the european didnt expect intruders here hed left no guardian terrors at the gates of his brain she stepped deeper into his head darts of light burst at the corners of her thoughts sight like the colors that came after shed rubbed her eyes only more brilliant and more momentary they came and went so quickly she was not certain if she saw anything in them or illuminated by them but as she progressed and the bursts became more frequent she began to see patterns there commas lattices bars dots spirals martys voice interrupted the reverie some foolish question that she had no patience with she ignored it let him wait the lights were becoming more intricate their patterns crossfertilizing gaining depth and weight now she seemed to see tunnels and tumbling cubes seas of rolling light fissures opening and sealing rains of white noise she watched entranced by the way they grew and multiplied the world of his thought appearing in flickering heavens above her falling in showers on her and about her vast blocks of intersecting geometries thundered over hovering inches above her skull the weight of small moons just as suddenly gone all of them darkness again as relentless as ever pressed on her from every side for a moment she had the sensation of being smothered she grabbed for breath panicking carys im all right she whispered to the distant inquirer he was a world away but he cared for her or so she dimly remembered where are you he wanted to know she didnt have a clue so she shook her head which way should she advance if at all she waited in the darkness readying herself for whatever might happen next suddenly the lights began again at the horizon this timefor their second performancepattern had become form instead of spirals she saw rising columns of burning smoke in place of seas of light a landscape with intermittent sunshine stabbing distant hillsides birds rose on burning wings then turned into leaves of books fluttering up from conflagrations that were even now flaring on every side where are you he asked her again her eyes roved maniacally behind her closed lids taking in this burgeoning province he could share none of it except through her words and she was dumb with admiration or terror he couldnt tell which there was sound here too not much the promontory she walked on had suffered too many ravages to shout its life was almost out bodies sprawled underfoot so badly disfigured they might have been dropped out of the sky weapons horses wheels she saw all of this as if by a show of lurid fireworks with no sight glimpsed more than once in the instant of darkness between one lightburst and the next the entire scene would change one moment she was standing on an open road with a naked girl running toward her bawling the next on a hillside looking down on a razed valley snatched through a pall of smoke now a silver birch copse now not now a ruin with a headless man at her feet again not but always the fires somewhere near the smuts and the shrieks dirtying the air the sense of relentless pursuit she felt it could go on forever these scenes changing before herone moment a landscape the next an atrocitywithout her having time to correlate the disparate images then as abruptly as the first patterns had ceased the fires did also and the darkness was everywhere about her again where martys voice found her he was so agitated in his confusion she answered him im almost dead she said quite calmly carys he was terrified that naming her would alert mamoulian but he had to know if she spoke for herself or for him not carys she replied her mouth seemed to lose its fullness the lips thinning it was mamoulians mouth not hers she raised her hand a little way from her lap as if making to touch her face almost dead she said again lost the battle you see lost the whole bloody war which war lost from the beginning not that it matters eh find myself another war theres always one around who are you she frowned whats it to you she snapped at him none of your business it doesnt matter marty returned he feared pushing the interrogation too hard as it was his question was answered in the next breath my names mamoulian im a sergeant in the third fusiliers correction was a sergeant not now no not now im nobody now its safer to be nobody these days dont you think the tone was eerily conversational as though the european knew exactly what was happening and had chosen to talk with marty through carys another game perhaps when i think of the things ive done he said to stay out of trouble im such a coward you see always have been loathe the sight of blood he began to laugh in her a solid unfeminine laugh youre just a man marty said he could scarcely credit what he was being told there was no devil hiding in the europeans cortex just this halfmad sergeant lost on some battlefield just a man he said again what did you want me to be the sergeant replied quick as a flash im happy to oblige anything to get me out of this shit who do you think youre talking to the sergeant frowned with carys face puzzling this one out im losing my mind he said dolefully ive been talking to myself for days now on and off theres no one left you see the thirds been wiped out and the fourth and the fifth all blown to hell he stopped and pulled a wry face got no one to play cards with damn it cant play with dead men can i theyve got nothing i want the voice trailed away what date is it sometime in october isnt it the sergeant came back ive lost track of time still its fucking cold at night i tell you that much yes must be october at least there was snow in the wind yesterday or was it the day before what year is it the sergeant laughed im not that far gone he said its thats right im thirtytwo on the ninth of november and i dont look a day over forty it was if the sergeant was answering truthfully that made mamoulian two centuries old are you sure marty asked the year is youre certain shut your mouth the answer came what trouble carys had drawn her arms up against her chest as though constricted she felt enclosedbut by what she wasnt certain the open road shed been standing on had abruptly disappeared and now she sensed herself lying down in darkness it was warmer here than it had been on the road but not a pleasant heat it smelled putrid she spat not once but three or four times to rid herself of a mouthful of muck where was she for gods sake close by she could hear the approach of horses the sound was muffled but it made her or rather the man she occupied panic off to her right somebody moaned ssh she hissed didnt the moaner hear the horses too theyd be discovered and though she didnt know why she was certain discovery would prove fatal whats happening marty asked she didnt dare reply the horsemen were too close to dare a word she could hear them dismounting and approaching her hiding place she repeated a prayer soundlessly the riders were talking now they were soldiers she guessed an argument had erupted among them as to who would tackle some distasteful duty maybe she prayed theyd give up their search before they started but no the debate was over and they were grunting and complaining as several set about their labors she heard them moving sacks and flinging them down a dozen two dozen light seeped through to where she lay scarcely breathing more sacks were moved more light fell on her she opened her eyes and finally recognized what refuge the sergeant had chosen god almighty she said they werent sacks she lay among but bodies he had hidden himself in a mound of corpses it was the heat of putrefaction that made her sweat now the hillock was being taken apart by the horsemen who were pricking each of the bodies as they were hauled from the heap in order to distinguish living from dead the few who still breathed were pointed out to the officer he dismissed them all as past the point of no return they were swiftly dispatched before a bayonet could pierce his hide the sergeant rolled over and showed himself i surrender he said they jabbed him through the shoulder anyway he yelled carys too marty reached to touch her her face was scrawled with pain but he thought better of interfering at what was clearly a vital juncture it might do more harm than good well well said the officer high on the horse you dont look very dead to me i was practicing the sergeant replied his wit earned him a second jab to judge by the looks of the men who surrounded him hed be lucky to avoid a disemboweling they were ready for some sport youre not going to die the officer said patting his mounts gleaming neck the presence of so much decay made the thoroughbred uneasy we need answers to some questions first then you can have your place in the pit behind the officers plumed head the sky had darkened even as he spoke the scene began to lose coherence as though mamoulian had forgotten how it went from here under her lids carys eyes began to twitch back and forth again another welter of impressions had overtaken her each moment delineated with absolute precision but all coming too fast for her to make any sense of carys are you all right yes yes she said breathlessly just moments living moments she saw a room a chair felt a kiss a slap pain relief pain again questions laughter she couldnt be certain but she guessed that under pressure the sergeant was telling the enemy everything they wanted to know and more days passed in a heartbeat she let them run through her fingers sensing that the europeans dreaming head was moving with mounting velocity toward some critical event it was best to let him lead the way he knew better than she the significance of this descent the journey finished with shocking suddenness a sky the color of cold iron opened above her head snow drifted from it a lazy fall of goosedown which instead of warming her made her bones ache in the claustrophobic oneroom flat with marty sitting barechested and sweating opposite her carys teeth began to chatter the sergeants captors were done with their interrogation it seemed they had led him and five other ragged prisoners out into a small quadrangle he looked around this was a monastery or had been until its occupation one or two monks stood in the shelter of the cloister walkway and watched events in the yard unfold with philosophical gaze the six prisoners waited in a line while the snow fell they were not bound there was nowhere in this square for them to run to the sergeant on the end of the line chewed his nails and tried to keep his thoughts light they were going to die here that was an unavoidable fact they were not the first to be executed this afternoon along one wall arranged neatly for posthumous inspection lay five dead men their lopped heads had been placed the ultimate defamation at their groins openeyed as if startled by the killing stroke they stared at the snow as it descended at the windows at the one tree that was planted in a square of soil among the stones in summer it surely bore fruit birds made idiot song in it now it was leafless theyre going to kill us she said matteroffactly it was all very informal the presiding officer a fur coat pulled around his shoulders was standing with his hands at a blazing brazier his back to the prisoners the executioner was with him his bloody sword jauntily leaned on his shoulder a fat lumbering man he laughed at some joke the officer made and downed a cup of something warming before turning back to his business carys smiled whats happening now she said nothing her eyes were on the man who was going to kill them she smiled on carys whats happening the soldiers had come along the line and pushed them to the ground in the middle of the square carys had bowed her head to expose the nape of her neck were going to die she whispered to her distant confidant at the far end of the line the executioner raised his sword and brought it down with one professional stroke the prisoners head seemed to leap from the neck pushed forward by a geyser of blood it was lurid against the gray walls the white snow the head fell faceforward rolled a little way and stopped the body curled to the ground out of the corner of his eye mamoulian watched the proceedings trying to stop his teeth from chattering he wasnt afraid and didnt want them to think he was the next man in line had started to scream two soldiers stepped forward at the officers barked command and seized the man suddenly after a calm in which you could hear the snow pat the ground the line erupted with pleas and prayers the mans terror had opened a floodgate the sergeant said nothing they were lucky to be dying in such style he thought the sword was for aristocrats and officers but the tree was not yet tall enough to hang a man from he watched the sword fall a second time wondering if the tongue still wagged after death sitting in the draining palate of the dead mans head im not afraid he said whats the use of fear you cant buy it or sell it you cant make love to it you cant even wear it if they strip off your shirt and youre cold a third prisoners head rolled in the snow and a fourth a soldier laughed the blood steamed its meaty smell was appetizing to a man who hadnt been fed for a week im not losing anything he said in lieu of prayer ive had a useless life if it ends here so what the prisoner at his left was young no more than fifteen a drummerboy the sergeant guessed he was quietly crying look over there mamoulian said desertion if ever i saw it he nodded toward the sprawled bodies which were already being vacated by their various parasites fleas and nits aware that their host had ceased crawled and leaped from head and hem eager to find new residence before the cold caught them the boy looked and smiled the spectacle diverted him in the moment it took for the executioner to position himself and deliver the killing stroke the head sprang heat escaped onto the sergeants chest idly mamoulian looked around at the executioner he was slightly bloodspattered otherwise his profession was not written upon him it was a stupid face with a shabby beard that needed trimming and round parboiled eyes shall i be murdered by this the sergeant thought well im not ashamed he spread his arms to either side of his body the universal gesture of submission and bowed his head somebody pulled at his shirt to expose his neck he waited a noise like a shot sounded in his head he opened his eyes expecting to see the snow approaching as his head leaped from his neck but no in the middle of the square one of the soldiers was falling to his knees his chest blown open by a shot from one of the upper cloister windows mamoulian glanced behind him soldiers were swarming from every side of the quadrangle shots sliced the snow the presiding officer wounded fell clumsily against the brazier and his fur coat caught fire trapped beneath the tree two soldiers were mowed down slumping together like lovers under the branches away carys whispered the imperative with his voice quickly away he bellycrawled across the frozen stone as the factions fought above his head scarcely able to believe that hed been spared nobody gave him a second glance unarmed and skeletalthin he was no danger to anyone once out of the square and into the backwaters of the monastery he took a breath smoke had started to drift along the icy corridors inevitably the place was being put to the torch by one side or the other perhaps both they were all imbeciles he loved none of them he began his way through the maze of the building hoping to find his way out without encountering any stray fusiliers in a passageway far from the skirmishes he heard footstepssandaled not bootedcoming after him he turned to face his pursuer it was a monk his scrawny features every inch the ascetics he arrested the sergeant by the tattered collar of his shirt youre godgiven he said he was breathless but his grip was fierce let me alone i want to get out the fightings spreading through the building its not safe anywhere ill take the risk the sergeant grinned you were chosen soldier the monk replied still holding on chance stepped in on your behalf the innocent boy at your side died but you survived dont you see ask yourself why he tried to push the shaveling away the mixture of incense and stale sweat was vile but the man held fast speaking hurriedly there are secret tunnels beneath the cells we can slip away without being slaughtered yes certainly if youll help me how ive got writings to salvage a lifes work i need your muscle soldier dont fret yourself youll get something in return what have you got that id want the sergeant said what could this wildeyed flagellant possibly possess i need an acolyte the monk said someone to give my learning to spare me your spiritual guidance i can teach you so much how to live forever if thats what you want mamoulian had started to laugh but the monk went on with his dreamtalk how to take life from other people and have it for yourself or if you like give it to the dead to resurrect them never its old wisdom the monk said but ive found it again written out in plain greek secrets that were ancient when the hills were young such secrets if you can do all that why arent you tsar of all the russians mamoulian replied the monk let go of his shirt and looked at the soldier with contempt freshly squeezed from his eyes what man he said slowly what man with true ambition in his soul would want to be merely tsar the reply wiped the soldiers smile away strange words whose significancehad he been askedhe would have had difficulty explaining but there was a promise in them that his confusion couldnt rob them of well he thought maybe this is the way wisdom comes and the sword didnt fall on me did it show me the way he said carys smiled a small but radiant smile in the space of a wingbeat winter melted away spring blossomed the ground was green everywhere especially over the burial pits where are you going marty asked her it was clear from her delighted expression that circumstances had changed for several minutes she had spat out clues to the life she was sharing in the europeans head marty had barely grasped the gist of what was going on he hoped she would be able to furnish the details later what country this was what war suddenly she said im finished her voice was light almost playful carys whos carys never heard of him probably dead theyre all dead but me what have you finished learning of course all he can teach me and it was true everything he promised all true old wisdom what have you learned she raised her hand the burned one and spread it i can steal life she said easily just find the place and drink easy to take easy to give give for a while as long as it suits me she extended a finger god to adam let there be life he began to laugh in her again and the monk what about him is he still with you the sergeant shook carys head i killed him when hed taught me everything he could her hands reached out and strangled the air i just throttled him one night when he was sleeping of course he woke when he felt my grip around his throat but he didnt struggle he didnt make the slightest attempt to save himself the sergeant was leering as he described the act he just let me murder him i could scarcely believe my luck id been planning the thing for weeks terrified that hed read my thoughts when he went so easily i was ecstatic the leer suddenly vanished stupid he murmured in her throat so so stupid why i didnt see the trap hed set didnt see how hed planned it all along nurtured me like a son knowing that id be his executioner when the time came i never realizednot oncethat i was just his tool he wanted to die he wanted to pass his wisdomthe word was pronounced derisivelyalong to me and then have me put an end to him why did he want to die dont you see how terrible it is to live when everything around you perishes and the more the years pass the more the thought of death freezes your bowels because the longer you avoid it the worse you imagine it must be and you start to longoh how you longfor someone to take pity on you someone to embrace you and share your terrors and at the end someone to go into the dark with you and you chose whitehead marty said almost beneath his breath the way you were chosen by chance everything is chance and so nothing is the sleeping man pronounced then laughed again at his own expense bitterly yes i chose him with a game of cards and then i made a bargain with him but he cheated you carys nodded her head very slowly her hand inscribing a circle on the air round and round she said round and round what will you do now find the pilgrim wherever he is find him take him with me i swear wont let him escape me ill take him and show him show him what no answer came in its place she sighed stretching a little and moving her head from left to right and back again with a shock of recognition marty realized that he was still watching her repeat mamoulians movements that ail the time the european had been asleep and now his energies repleted he was preparing to wake he snapped his previous question out again determined to have an answer to his last vital inquiry show him what hell mamoulian said he cheated me he squandered all my teachings all my knowledge threw it away for greeds sake for powers sake for the life of the body appetite all gone for appetite all my precious love wasted marty could hear in his litany the voice of the puritanmonks voice perhapsthe rage of a creature who wanted the world purer than it was and lived in torment because it saw only filth and flesh sweating to make more flesh more filth what hope of sanity in such a place except to find a soul to share the torment a lover to hate the world with whitehead had been such a partner and now mamoulian was being true to his lovers soul wanting at the end to g into death with the only other creature he had ever trusted well go to nothing he breathed and the breath was a promise all of us go to nothing down down he was waking there was no time left for further questions however curious marty was carys down down carys can you hear me come out of him quickly her head rolled on her neck carys she grunted quickly in mamoulians head the patterns had begun again as enchanting as ever spurts of light that would become pictures in a while she knew what would they be this time birds flowers trees in blossom what a wonderland it was carys the voice of someone she had once known was calling her from some very distant place but so were the lights they were resolving themselves even now she waited expectantly but this time they werent memories that burst into view carys quickly they were the real world appearing as the european opened his lids her body tensed marty reached for her hand and seized it she exhaled slowly the breath coming out as a thin whine between her teeth and suddenly she was awake to her imminent danger she flung her thought out of the europeans head and back across the miles to kilburn for an agonized instant she felt her will falter and she was falling backward back into his waiting head terrified she gasped like a stranded fish while her mind fought for propulsion marty dragged her to a standing position but her legs buckled he held her up with his arms wrapped around her dont leave me he whispered into her hair gentle god dont leave me suddenly her eyes flickered open marty she mumbled marty it was her he knew her look too well for the european to deceive him you came back he said they didnt speak for several minutes simply held on to each other when they did talk she had no taste for retelling what shed experienced marty held his curiosity in check it was enough to know they had no devil on their backs just old humanity cheated of love and ready to pull down the world on its head so perhaps they had a chance of life after all mamoulian was a man for all his unnatural faculties he was two hundred years old perhaps but what were a few years between friends the priority now was to find papa and warn him of what mamoulian intended then plan as best they could against the europeans offensive if whitehead wouldnt help that was his prerogative at least marty would have tried for old times sake and in the light of the murder of charmaine and flynn whiteheads crimes against marty diminished to sins of discourtesy he was easily the lesser of two evils as to the how of finding whitehead the only lead marty had was the strawberries it had been pearl whod told him that old man whitehead had never let a day go by without strawberries not in twenty years shed claimed wasnt it possible then that hed continued to indulge himself even in hiding it was a slender line of inquiry but appetite as marty had so recently learned was at the crux of this conundrum he tried to persuade carys to come with him but she was wrung out to the point of collapse her journeys she said were over shed seen too much for one day all she wanted now was the sunshine island and on that point she would not be moved reluctantly marty left her to her fix and went off to discuss strawberries with mr halifax of holborn left alone carys found forgetfulness very quickly the sights she had witnessed in mamoulians head were dismissed to the dim past from which theyd come the future if there was to be one was ignored here where there was only tranquility she bathed under a sun of nonsenses while outside a soft rain began xii the fat man dances breer didnt mind the change in the weather it was altogether too sultry on the street and the rain with its symbolic cleansing made him feel more comfortable though it was many weeks since hed felt the least spasm of pain he did itch in the heat not even an itch really it was a more fundamental irritation a crawling sensation on or beneath his skin that no ointment allayed the drizzle seemed to subdue it a measure however for which he was grateful either the rain or the fact that he was going to see the woman he loved though carys had attacked him several times he forgave her her trespasses she understood him better than anyone else she was uniquea goddess despite her body hairand he knew that if he could only see her again display himself for her touch her all would be well but first he had to get to the house it had taken him a while to find a taxi that would stop for him and when one obliged the driver only took him part of the way before telling him to get out because he claimed the smell was so repulsive he wouldnt be able to get another fare all day shamed by this alltoopublic rejectionthe taxi driver harangued him from his cab as he drove awaybreer took to the back streets where he hoped he wouldnt be sneered and sniggered at it was in one such backwater just a few minutes walk from where carys was waiting for him that a young man with blue swallows tattooed on his neck stepped out of a doorway to offer the razoreater some assistance hey man you look sick you know that let me lend you a hand no no breer grunted hoping the good samaritan would leave him alone im fine really but i insist swallows said picking up his pace to overtake breer then standing in the razoreaters way he glanced up and down the road to check for witnesses before pushing breer into the doorway of a brickedup house you keep your mouth shut man he said whipping out a knife and pressing it to breers bandaged throat and youll be ok just empty your pockets quick quick breer made no move to comply the suddenness of the attack had disoriented him and the way the youth had seized his splinted neck had made him giddy swallows pushed the knife a little way into the bandaging to make his point clear the victim smelled bad and the thief wanted the job over and done with as soon as possible pockets man you deaf he pushed the knife deeper the man didnt flinch ill do it man the thief warned ill slit your fucking throat oh said breer unimpressed more to quiet the tick than out of fear he rummaged in the pocket of his coat and found a handful of possessions some coins a few peppermints that hed continued to suck until his saliva supply dried up and a bottle of aftershave he proffered them with faint apology on his rouged face that all youve got swallows was outraged he tore open breers coat dont the razoreater suggested bit hot to be wearing a coat isnt it said the thief what are you hiding the buttons gave as he tore at the jacket breer was wearing beneath his coat and now the thief was staring openmouthed at the handles of the knife and fork that were still buried in the razoreaters abdomen the stains of dried fluids that ran from the wounds were only marginally less disgusting than the brown rot that was spreading down from his armpits and up from his groin in his panic the thief pressed the knife more deeply into breers throat christ man anthony having lost his dignity his selfesteem and did he but know it his lifehad only his temper left to lose he reached up and took hold of the inquiring knife in a greasy palm the thief relinquished it a moment too late breer swifter than his bulk suggested twisted blade and hand back and broke his assailants wrist swallows was seventeen he had lived he thought a full life for a seventeenyearold hed seen two violent deaths hed lost his virginity to his halfsisterat fourteen hed raised whippets hed watched snuff movies hed taken every kind of pill he could get his trembling hands on it had been he thought a busy existence full of acquired wisdom but this was new nothing like this ever it made his bladder ache breer still had hold of the thiefs useless arm let me go please breer just looked at him his jacket still swinging open those bizarre wounds displayed what do you want man youre hurting me swallows jacket was also open inside was another weapon thrust into a deep pocket knife breer said looking at the handle no man breer reached for it the youth eager to oblige pulled the weapon out and dropped it at breers feet it was a machete its blade was stained but its edge keen its yours man go on take it only let go of my arm man pick it up get down and pick it up breer said releasing the injured wrist the youth went down onto his haunches and picked the machete up then handed it to breer the razoreater took it the tableau with him standing over his kneeling victim blade in hand meant something to breer but he couldnt fix exactly what a picture from his book of atrocities perhaps i could kill you he observed with some detachment the thought had not escaped swallows he closed his eyes and waited but no blow came the man simply said thank you and walked away kneeling in the doorway swallows began to pray he quite surprised himself with this show of godliness reciting by rote the prayers he and hosanna his halfsister had said together before and after theyd sinned he was still praying ten minutes later when the rain started to come on in earnest it took breer several minutes of searching along bright street before he found the yellow house once hed located it he stood outside for several minutes preparing himself she was here his salvation he wanted their reunion to be as perfect as he could make it the front door was open children were playing on the threshold having been driven from their hopscotch arid skipping games by the onset of the rain he edged past them with caution anxious that his lumpen feet shouldnt crush a tiny hand one particularly fetching child earned a smile from him she did not return it however he stood in the hallway trying to remember where the european had told him carys was hiding second floor wasnt it carys heard somebody moving about on the landing outside the room but that passage of shabby wood and peeling wallpaper lay across unbridgeable straits far from her island she was quite safe where she was then somebody outside knocked on the door a tentative gentlemanly knock she didnt answer at first but when the knocking came again she said go away after several seconds hesitation the handle of the door was lightly jiggled please she said as politely as possible go away marty isnt here the handle was rattled again this time more strongly she heard soft fingers working at the wood or was that the slosh of waves on the shore of the island she couldnt find it in her to be frightened or even concerned it was good h marty had brought not the bestshed only had that from papabut it took away every fiber of fear you cant come in she told the wouldbe intruder youll have to go away and come back later its me the razoreater tried to say even through the haze of sunshine she knew the voice how could breer be whispering at the door like this her mind was playing unwelcome tricks she sat up on the bed while the noise of his pressure on the door increased suddenly tiring of subtlety he pushed once twice the lock succumbed too easily and he stumbled into the room it wasnt mindplay after all he was here in all his glory found you he said the perfect prince he carefully closed the door behind him and presented himself to her she looked disbelievingly at him his broken neck supported by some homemade contraption of wood and bandages his shabby clothes he worked at one of his leather gloves to take it off but it wouldnt come i came to see you he said the words fractured yes he pulled at the glove there was a soft sickly noise she looked at his hand much of the skin had come off with the glove he extended this seeping patchwork to her you have to help me he told her are you alone she asked him yes that was something at least perhaps the european didnt even know he was here hed come courting to judge by this pathetic attempt at civility his dalliance went back to that first encounter in the steam room she hadnt screamed or puked and that had won his undying loyalty help me he moaned i cant help you i dont know how to let me touch you youre ill the hand was still extended he took a step forward did he think she was an icon of some kind a talisman thatonce touchedcured all sickness pretty he said the smell of him was overpowering but her drugged mind idled she knew it was important to escape but how the door perhaps the window or just ask him to leave come again tomorrow will you go please just touch the hand was within inches of her face revulsion overcame her bypassing the lethargy the island had induced she swatted the arm away appalled by even the briefest contact with his flesh he looked offended you tried to harm me he reminded her so many times i never harmed you once you wanted to him never me i want you to be with all my other friends where nothing can hurt you the hand which had returned to his side suddenly darted up and took her by the neck youll never leave me he said youre hurting me anthony he drew her closer and bent his head toward her as best he could given the condition of his neck in a patch of skin beneath his right eye she could see movement the closer he came the more she saw the fat white grubs that had been laid as eggs in his face and were maturing there awaiting wings did he know he was a home for maggots was it perhaps a point of pride to be flyblown he was going to kiss her she had no doubt of that if he puts his tongue in my mouth she halfthought ill bite it off i wont let him do this gentle god id rather die he put his lips on hers you are unforgivable said a thin voice the door was open let her go the razoreater unhanded carys and drew away from her face she spat to rinse the kiss off and looked up mamoulian was in the doorway behind him stood two welldressed young men one with golden hair both with winning smiles unforgivable the european said again and turned his vacant gaze to carys you see what happens if you desert my custody he said what horrors come she didnt respond youre alone carys your erstwhile protector is dead marty dead at his house going out for your heroin she was seconds ahead of him realizing his error maybe it gave marty an edge on them if they thought him dead but it wouldnt be wise to fake tears she was no tragic actress best to feign disbelief doubt at least no she said i dont believe you my own fair hands said the blond adonis at the europeans back no she insisted take it from me the european said he wont be coming back trust me in this at least trust you she murmured it was almost funny havent i just prevented your rape hes your creature yes and he will be punished depend upon it now i trust you will return my kindness in coming here by finding your father for me i will not brook delay of any kind carys we will go back to caliban street and you will find him or by god i will turn you inside out that is a promise saint thomas will escort you down to the car the brownhaired smile stepped past his blond companion and offered a hand to carys i have very little time to waste girl mamoulian said and the changed tone of his voice confirmed that claim so please lets be done with this wretched business tom led carys down the stairs when shed gone the european turned his attention to the razoreater breer was not afraid of him he was afraid of no one any longer the poky room they faced each other in was hot he could tell it was hot by the sweat on mamoulians cheeks and upper lip he on the other hand was cool he was the coolest man in creation nothing would bring fear to him mamoulian surely saw that close the door the european told the blond boy and find something to bind this man with breer grinned you disobeyed me the european said i left you to finish the work at caliban street i wanted to see her shes not yours to see i made a bargain with you and like all the others you break my trust a little game breer said no game is little anthony have you been with me all this time and not understood that every act carries some weight of significance especially play i dont care what you say all words just words you are despicable the european said breers smudged face looked back at him without a trace of anxiety or contrition though the european knew he had supremacy here something about breers look made him uneasy in his time mamoulian had been served by far viler creatures poor konstantin for example whose postmortem appetites had run to more than kisses why then did breer distress him saint chad had torn up a selection of clothes these with a belt and a tie were sufficient for mamoulians purposes tie him to the bed chad could barely bring himself to touch breer though at least the man didnt struggle he acceded to this punishment game with the same idiot grin still creasing his face his skinbeneath chads handfelt insolid as though under its taut glossy surface the muscle had turned to jelly and pus the saint worked as efficiently as he could to get the duty done while the prisoner amused himself watching the flies orbiting his head within three or four minutes breer was secured hand and foot mamoulian nodded his satisfaction thats fine you may go and join tom in the car ill be down in a few moments respectfully chad withdrew wiping his hands on his handkerchief as he went breer still watched the flies i have to leave you now said the european when will you come back the razoreater asked never breer smiled im free then he said you are dead anthony mamoulian replied what breers smile began to decay youve been dead since the day i found you hanging from the ceiling i think perhaps somehow you knew i was coming and you killed yourself to escape me but i needed you so i gave you a little of my life to keep you in my employ breers smile had disappeared altogether thats why youre so impervious to pain you are a walking corpse the deterioration your body should have suffered in these hot months has been held at bay not entirely prevented im afraid but slowed considerably breer shook his head was this the miracle of redemption now i no longer need you so i withdraw my gift no he tried to make a small pleading gesture but his wrists were bound together and the bindings bit into the muscle causing it to buckle and furrow like soft clay tell me how to make amends he offered anything there is no way anything you ask please i ask you to suffer the european replied why for treachery for being in the end like the others no just a little game then let this be a game too if it amuses you six months of deterioration pressed into as many hours mamoulian crossed to the bed and put his hand on breers sobbing mouth making something very like a snatching gesture its over anthony he said breer felt a motion in his lower belly as though some jittering thing had suddenly twitched and perished in there he followed the europeans exit with upturned eyes matter not tears gathered at their rims forgive me he begged his savior please forgive me but the european had gone quietly closing the door behind him there was a brawling on the windowsill breer looked from door to window two pigeons had squabbled over some morsel and were now flying off small white feathers settled on the sill like midsummer snow it is mr halifax isnt it the man inspecting the boxes of fruit in the breezeless waspwoven yard at the back of the shop turned to marty yes what can i do for you mr halifax had been out sunbathing and injudiciously his face was peeling in places and looked tender he was hot and uncomfortable and marty guessed thin of temper tact was the order of the day if he hoped to win the mans confidence business ok marty asked halifax shrugged itll do he said unwilling to be drawn on the subject lot of my regular customers are on holiday at this time of year he peered at marty do i know you yes ive been here several times marty lied for mr whiteheads strawberries thats what i came for the usual order halifax registered nothing he put down the tray of peaches he was holding im sorry i dont supply any mr whitehead strawberries marty prompted i heard what you said halifax replied testily but i dont know anyone of that name you must be mistaken you do remember me no i dont now if youd like to make a purchase theresa will serve you he nodded back in the direction of the shop itself id like to finish here before i cook in this bloody heat but im supposed to be picking up strawberries you can have as many as you like halifax said spreading his arms theres a glut just ask theresa marty could see failure looming the man wasnt about to give an inch he tried one final tack you dont have any fruit set aside for mr whitehead you normally have them packed ready for him this significant detail seemed to mellow the dismissal on halifaxs face doubt dawned look he said i dont think you quite understand his voice dropped in volume though there was nobody else in the yard to hear joe whitehead is dead dont you read the newspapers a large wasp alighted on halifaxs arm navigating the ginger hairs with difficulty he let it crawl there undisturbed i dont believe everything i read in the newspapers marty replied quietly do you i dont know what youre talking about the other man returned his strawberries marty said thats all im after mr whitehead is dead no mr halifax joe is not dead you and i both know that the wasp rose from halifaxs arm and careered in the air between them marty swatted it away it came back its buzz louder who are you halifax said mr whiteheads bodyguard ive told you ive been here before halifax bent back to the tray of peaches more wasps congregated at a bruise on one of them im sorry i cant help you he said you took them already did you marty laid a hand on halifaxs shoulder did you im not at liberty to tell you anything im a friend halifax glanced round at marty ive sworn he said with the finality of a practiced bargainer marty had thought the scenario through as far as this impasse halifax confessing that he knew something but refusing to provide the details what now did he lay hands on the man beat it out of him joe is in great danger oh yes halifax murmured you think i dont realize that i can help him halifax shook his head mr whitehead has been a valued customer for a good many years he explained hes always had his strawberries from me i never knew a man love strawberries the way he does present tense marty commented halifax went on as though he hadnt been interrupted he used to come in here personally before his lady wife died then he stopped coming he still bought the fruit had somebody come and pick it up for him and at christmas there was always a check for the kiddies there still is come to that still sends money for them the wasp had alighted on the back of his hand where the sweet juice of one fruit or another had dried halifax let it have its fill marty liked him if halifax wasnt willing to volunteer the information marty wouldnt be able to bully it out of the man now you come here and tell me youre a friend of his halifax said how do i know youre telling the truth people have friends whod cut their throats his more than most true so much money so few people who care about him halifax had a sad look seems to me i should keep his hideaway secret dont you or else who can he trust in all the world yes marty conceded what halifax said made perfect and compassionate sense and there was nothing he was prepared to do to make him rescind it thank you he said cowed by the lesson im sorry to have kept you from your work he made his way back toward the shop hed gone a few paces when halifax said you were the one marty pivoted on his heel what you were the one who came for the strawberries i remember you only you looked different then marty ran his hand across several days growth of beard shaving was a forgotten craft these mornings not the hair halifax said you were harder i didnt take to you marty waited somewhat impatiently for halifax to finish this farewell homily his mind was already turning over other possibilities it was only when he turned back into halifaxs words that he realized the man had changed his mind he was going to tell he beckoned marty back across the yard you think you can help him maybe i hope somebody can youve seen him ill tell you he rang the shop asked for me funny i recognized the voice immediately even after all these years he asked me to bring him some strawberries he said he couldnt come himself it was terrible why hes so frightened halifax hesitated looking for the right words i remember him as being big you know impressive hed come in the shop and everyone would part for him now shrunk to nothing fear did that to him ive seen it happen my sisterinlaw same thing happened to her she had cancer fear killed her months before the tumor where is he i tell you i went back home and i didnt say a word to anyone i just drank half a bottle of scotch straight off never done that in my life i just wanted to get the way hed looked out of my head it really turned my stomach hearing him and seeing him that way i meanif the likes of hims scared what chance have the rest of us got youre safe marty said hoping to god the europeans revenge wouldnt stretch as far as the old mans strawberry supplier halifax was a good man marty found himself holding on to this realization while staring at the round red face here is goodness flaws too no doubt sins by the armful perhaps but the good was worth celebrating however many stains the man had marty wanted to tattoo the date of this recognition on the palm of his hand theres a hotel halifax was saying it used to be called the orpheus apparently its up the edgware road staple corner terrible rundown place waiting for the demolition squad i shouldnt be surprised hes there alone yes halifax sighed thinking of how the mighty had fallen perhaps he suggested after a moment you might take him some peaches too he went into the shop and came back with a tattered copy of the london a to z street atlas he flicked through the agecreamed pages looking for the appropriate map all the while sounding his dismay at this turn of events and his hope that things might still turn out well lot of streets been leveled around the hotel he explained these maps are well out of date im afraid marty peered at the page halifax had selected a cloud bearing the rain that had already dampened kilburn and points northwest covered the sun as halifaxs stained index finger traced a route across the map from the thoroughfares of holborn to the hotel pandemonium xiii at the hotel pandemonium hell is reimagined by each generation its terrain is surveyed for absurdities and remade in a fresher mold its terrors are scrutinized and if necessary reinvented to suit the current climate of atrocity its architecture is redesigned to appall the eye of the modern damned in an earlier age pandemoniumthe first city of hellstood on a lava mountain while lightning tore the clouds above it and beacons burned on its walls to summon the fallen angels now such spectacle belongs to hollywood hell stands transposed no lightning no pits of fire in a wasteland a few hundred yards from a highway overpass it finds a new incarnation shabby degenerate forsaken but here where fumes thicken the atmosphere minor terrors take on a new brutality heaven by night would have all the configurations of hell no less the orpheushereafter called pandemoniumhotel it had once been an impressive building and could have been again if its owners had been willing to invest in it but the task of rebuilding and refurbishing such a large and oldfashioned hotel was probably financially unsound sometime in its past a fire had raged through the place gutting the first second and third floors before being extinguished the fourth floor and those above were smokespoiled leaving only the vaguest signs of the hotels former glamor intact the vagaries of the city planning department had taken a further toll on the buildings chances of restoration as halifax had described the land to either side of the hotel had been cleared for some projected redevelopment none had been undertaken however the hotel stood in splendid isolation mated about with feed roads to and from the ml no more than three hundred yards from one of the busiest stretches of concrete and tarmac in the south of england thousands of drivers glanced its way every day but its shabby grandeur was by now so familiar they probably scarcely registered its existence clever marty thought to hide in such plain sight he parked the car as close to the hotel as he could then slipped in through a hole in the corrugated iron fencing around the plot and picked his way across the wasteland the instructions on the fenceno trespassing and no dumpinghad been conspicuously ignored black plastic bags bulging with rubbish were piled in heaps among the rubble and the old bonfires many of the bags had been torn open by children or dogs domestic and manufacturing trash spilled out hundreds of scraps of clothsweatshop offcutswere scattered underfoot rotting food the ubiquitous tin can cushions lampshades and car enginesall abandoned on a bed of rubble dust and gray grass some of the dogswild marty guessedlooked up from their scavenging as he advanced their pale flanks dirty their eyes yellow in the twilight he thought of bella and her gleaming family these curs hardly seemed of the same species when he looked their way they hung their heads and watched him indirectly like inept spies he went up to the main entrance of the hotel the word orpheus was still clearly carved above the door there were mockdoric columns to either side of the steps and fancy tilework on the threshold but the door itself had boards nailed across it and notices warned of swift prosecution if anyone trespassed there seemed little chance of that the second third and fourthstory windows were boarded up with the same thoroughness as the door those on the first floor had been bricked up entirely there was a door at the back of the building that was not boarded up but it was bolted from the inside this was probably where halifax had entered the building but whitehead must have given him access without breaking and entering there was no way in it was only on his second orbit of the hotel that he gave some serious consideration to the fire escape it zigzagged up the east side of the building an impressive piece of wroughtiron work that was now rusting badly further mutilation had been done to it by some enterprising salvage firm that seeing profit in the scrap metal had started to cut the escape away from the wall only to give up on the job when it had reached the second floor this left the bottom flight missing the escapes truncated tail hanging ten or eleven feet from the ground marty studied the problem the fireexit doors on most of the stories had been nailed up but one on the fourth story showed signs of tampering was this how the old man had gained entrance he would have needed help presumably luther perhaps marty scanned the wall beneath the fire escape it was graffitistrewn but smooth there was no chance of a handhold or foothold to get him up the first few feet and onto the steps themselves he turned to the wasteland looking for inspiration and a few minutes search in the deepening dusk revealed a pile of discarded furniture among it a table threelegged but serviceable he hauled it back to the fire escape and then wedged a collection of refuse bags beneath it in lieu of its missing limb it made an unsteady perch when he climbed up onto it and even then his fingers missed the bottom of the escape he was obliged to jump for a handhold and on the fourth attempt he achieved one leaving him swinging at arms length from the bottom step a drizzle of rust scales hit his face and hair the escape creaked he mustered his will and hauled himself up a vital few inches then struck out with his left hand for a hold on a higher stair his shoulder joints complained but he pulled on upward hand over hand until he could lift his leg high enough to hoist his whole body onto the steps the first stage achieved he stood on the escape and caught his breath then started up the structure was by no means stable the salvage crew had obviously been at work loosening it from the wall every step he took a grating squeal seemed to presage its capitulation hold on he whispered to it mounting the steps with as light a tread as he could his efforts were rewarded on the fourth story as he guessed the door had been opened quite recently and with no small sense of relief he stepped from the dubious safety of the fire escape and into the hotel itself it still stank of the conflagration that had defeated it the bitter smell of burned wood and charred carpeting below him he could seeby the meager light through the open fire doorthe gutted floors the walls were scorched the paint on the banisters diseased with blisters but just a few steps up from here the fires progress had been arrested marty started up the stairs to the fifth story a long corridor presented itself to him with rooms to right and left he wandered down the passageway taking a perfunctory look into each of the suites as he passed the numbered doors let onto empty spaces all the furniture and fittings that were salvageable had been removed years ago perhaps because of its isolated position and the difficulty of entering the building had not been squatted or vandalized the rooms were almost absurdly clean their deeppile beige carpetstoo bothersome to remove apparentlyspringy as cliff turf beneath his feet he checked every suite on the fifth floor before retracing his path to the stairs and going up another flight the scene was the same here although the suiteswhich had perhaps once commanded a salable viewwere larger and fewer on this floor the carpets if anything lusher it was bizarre ascending from the charred depths of the hotel to this pristine breathless place people had perhaps died in the blindfold corridors below asphyxiated or baked to death in their dressing gowns but up here no trace of the tragedy had intruded there was one floor left to investigate as he climbed the final flight of stairs the illumination suddenly strengthened until it was almost as bright as day the source was highway light finding its way through the skylights and ineptly sealed windows he explored the labyrinthine system of rooms as quickly as possible pausing only to glance out of the window far below he could see the car parked beyond the fence the dogs engaged in a mass rape in the second suite he suddenly caught sight of somebody watching him across the vast reception room only to realize that the haggard face was his own reflected in a wallsized mirror the door of the third suite on this final floor was locked the first locked suite marty had encountered proof positive if any were needed that it had an occupant jubilant marty rapped on the door hello mr whitehead there was no answering movement from within he rapped again harder casing the door as he did so to see if a breakin was plausible but it looked too solid to be easily shouldered down if necessary hed have to go back to the car and get some tools its strauss mr whitehead its marty strauss i know youre in there answer me he listened when there was no reply he beat on the door a third time this time with fist instead of knuckles and suddenly the reply came shockingly close the old man was standing just the other side of the door had been all along probably go to hell the voice said it was a little slurred but unmistakably that of whitehead i have to speak to you marty replied let me in how the fuck did you find me whitehead demanded you bastard i made some inquiries thats all if i can find you anybody can not if you keep your wretched mouth shut you want money is that it come here for money have you no you can have it ill get it to you however much you want i dont want money then youre a damn fool whitehead said and he laughed to himself a witless ragged titter the man was drunk mamoulians on to you marty said he knows youre alive the laughing stopped how carys youve seen her yes shes safe well i underestimated you he paused there was a soft sound as if he was leaning against the door after a while he spoke again he sounded exhausted what did you come for if not for money shes got some expensive habits you know no thanks to you im sure youll find it as convenient as i did given time shell bend over backward for a fix youre filth you know that but you came to warn me anyway the old man leaped on the paradox with lightning speed quick as ever to open a hole in a mans flank poor marty the slurred voice trailed away smothered by mock pity then razorsharp how did you find me the strawberries what sounded like muffled choking came from within the suite but it was whitehead laughing again this time at himself it took several moments for him to regain his composure strawberries he murmured my you must be persuasive did you break his arms no he volunteered the information he didnt want to see you curl up and die im not going to die the old man snapped mamoulians the one wholl die youll see hes running out of time all i have to do is wait heres as good a place as any im very comfortable except for carys i miss her why dont you send her to me marty now that would be most welcome youll never see her again whitehead sighed oh yes he said shell be back when shes tired of you when she needs someone who really appreciates her stony heart youll see well thank you for calling goodnight marty wait i said goodnight ive got questions marty began questions questions the voice was already receding marty pressed closer to the door to offer his final sliver of bait we found out who the european is what he is but there was no reply hed lost whiteheads attention it was fruitless anyway he knew there was no wisdom to be got here just a drunken old man replaying his old power games somewhere deep inside the penthouse suite a door closed all contact between the two men was summarily severed marty descended the two flights of stairs back to the open fire door and left the building by the route hed entered after the smell of dead fire inside even the highwaytainted air smelled light and new he stood for several minutes on the escape and watched the traffic passing along the highway his attention pleasantly diverted by the spectacle of lanehopping commuters below two dogs fought among the refuse bored with rape none of them cared drivers or dogs about the fall of potentates why should he whitehead like the hotel was a lost cause hed done his best to salvage the old man and failed now he and carys would slip away into a new life and let whitehead make whatever arrangements for cessation he chose let him slit his wrists in a stupor of remorse or choke on vomit in his sleep marty was past caring he climbed down the escape and scrambled onto the table then crossed the wasteland to the car glancing back only once to see if whitehead was watching needless to say the upper windows were blank when they got to caliban street the girl was still so high on her delayed fix it was difficult to communicate through her chemically elated senses the european left the evangelists to do the cleaning up and burning hed instructed breer to do and escorted carys to the room on the top floor there he set about persuading her to find her father and quickly at first the drug in her just smiled at him his frustration began to curdle into anger when she started to laugh at his threatsthat slow rootless laughter that was so like the pilgrims laugh as if she knew some joke about him that she wasnt tellinghis control snapped and he unleashed a nightmare of such unrestrained viciousness upon her its crudity disgusted him almost as much as it terrorized her she watched in disbelief as the same tide of muck that hed conjured in the bathroom dribbled and then gushed from her own body take it away she told him but he only increased the pitch of the illusion until her lap squirmed with monstrosities abruptly her drug bubble burst a gleam of insanity crept into her eyes as she cowered in the corner of the room while the things came from her every orifice struggling to work their way out then clinging to her with whatever limbs his invention had supplied she was within a hairbreadth of madness but hed gone too far to withdraw the assault now repelled though he was by its depravity find the pilgrim he told her and all this vanishes yes yes yes she pleaded whatever you want he stood and watched while she obeyed his demands flinging herself into that same fugue state shed achieved when pursuing toy it took her longer to find the pilgrim however so long that the european began to suspect shed canceled all link with her body and left it to his devices rather than reenter it but she finally returned she had found him at a hotel no less than half an hours drive from caliban street mamoulian was not surprised it was not in the nature of foxes to travel far from their natural habitat whitehead had simply gone to ground wrung out by the journey and the fear that had propelled her carys was halfcarried down the stairs by chad and tom and out to the waiting car the european made one farewell circuit of the house to see that any sign of his presence there had been removed the girl in the cellar and breers detritus could not be cleared at such short notice but that was a nicety let those who came after construe what they liked from the atrocity photographs on the wall and the bottles of perfume so lovingly arranged all that mattered was that evidence of his the europeans existence hereor indeed anywherebe thoroughly effaced soon he would be rumor again gossip among the haunted people time to go he said as he locked the door the deluge is almost upon us now as they drove carys was beginning to find some strength balmy air through the front window caressed her face she opened her eyes fractionally and cast them in the direction of the european he was not looking her way he was staring out of the window that aristocratic profile of his made blander than ever by fatigue she wondered how her father would fare in the approaching endgame he was old but mamoulian was vastly older was age in this confrontation an advantage or a disadvantage supposethe thought occurred to her for the first timethey were equally matched suppose the game they were playing ended without defeat or victory on either side just a twentiethcentury conclusionall ambiguities she didnt want that she wanted finality whichever way it went she knew there was small chance of her survival in the coming deluge only marty could tip the balance in her favor and where was he now if he returned to kilburn and found it deserted mightnt he assume shed left him of her own accord she couldnt predict the way hed jump that he was capable of the blackmail with the heroin had come as a shock one desperate maneuver remained a possibility to think her way to him and tell him where she was and why there were risks in such a gambit catching stray thoughts from him was one thingit was no more than a parlor trickbut attempting to push her way into his head and communicate with him consciously mind to mind would require more mental muscle even assuming she had the strength to do it what would the consequences of such an intrusion be for marty she pondered the dilemma in a daze of anxiety knowing the minutes were ticking by and soon it would be too late for any escape attempt however desperate marty was driving south toward cricklewood when a pain began at the nape of his neck it spread rapidly up and over his skull escalating within two minutes to a headache of unparalleled proportions his instinct was to pick up speed and get back to kilburn as quickly as possible but the finchley road was heavily trafficked and all he could do was edge along with the flow the pain worsening every ten yards his consciousnessincreasingly preoccupied with the upward spiral of painfocused on smaller and yet smaller bits of information his perception narrowing to a pinprick ahead of the citroлn the road was a blur he was almost blinded and a collision with a refrigerated meat truck was only prevented by the skill of the other driver he realized that driving any further could be fatal so he edged out of the traffic as best he couldhorns blaring front and behindand parked inelegantly at the side of the road then stumbled out of the car to get some air completely disoriented he stepped straight into the middle of the traffic the lights of the oncoming vehicles were a wall of strobing colors he felt his knees about to buckle and only prevented himself from collapsing in front of the traffic by hanging on to the open car door and hauling himself around the front of the citroлn to the comparative safety of the pavement a single drop of rain fell on his hand he peered at it concentrating to bring it into focus it was bright red blood he thought dimly not rain blood he put his hand up to his face his nose was bleeding copiously the heat ran down his arm and into the rolled sleeve of his shirt digging into his pocket he pulled out a handkerchief and clamped it under his nose then staggered across the pavement to a shopfront in the window he caught his reflection fish swam behind his eyes he fought the illusion but it persisted brilliantly colored exotica blowing bubbles inside his skull he stood away from the glass and took in the words painted on it cricklewood aquarium supplies he turned his back on the guppies and the ornamental carp and sat on the narrow sill he had begun to shake this was mamoulians doing was all he could think if i give into it ill die i must fight at all costs fight carys spoke the word escaping her lips before she could prevent it marty the european looked at her was she dreaming there was sweat on her swollen lips yes she was of congress with strauss no doubt that was why she spoke his name with such demand in her tone marty yes for certain she was dreaming the arrow and the wound look how she trembled look how her hands ran between her legs a shameful display how far now he asked saint tom who was consulting the map five minutes the youth replied fine night for it chad said marty he looked up narrowing his eyes to improve his vision of the street but he could not see his interrogator the voice was in his head marty it was carys voice horribly distorted when it spoke his skull seemed to creak his brain blowing up to the size of a melon the pain was unbearable marty shut up he wanted to say but she wasnt there to tell besides it wasnt her it was him it the european the voice was now replaced by the sound of somebodys breath not his own his was a sickening pant this was a sleepy rhythm the blur of the street was darkening the ache in his head had become heaven and earth he knew if he didnt get help hed die he stood up blind a hissing had filled his ears now which all but blocked the din of traffic mere yards from him he stumbled forward more blood streamed from his nose somebody help me an anonymous voice filtered through the chaos in his head the words it spoke were incomprehensible to him but at least he was not alone a hand was touching his chest another was holding his arm the voice hed heard vas raised in panic he wasnt sure if he made any reply to it he wasnt even sure if he was standing up or falling down what did it matter anyway blind and deaf he waited for some kind person to tell him he could die they drew up in the street a short way from the orpheus hotel mamoulian got out and left the evangelists to bring carys shed begun to smell hed noted that ripe smell he associated with menstruation he strode on ahead stepping through the rent fence and onto the nomansland that surrounded the hotel desolation pleased him the heaps of rubble the piles of abandoned furniture by the sickly light of the highway the place had a glamor about it if last rites were to be performed what better place than here the pilgrim had chosen well this is it said saint chad following on it is will you find a point of access for us my pleasure only do it quietly if you will the young man skipped off across the pitfraught ground stopping only to select a piece of twisted metal from among the rubble to force an entry so resourceful these americans mamoulian mused as he picked his way after chad no wonder they ruled the world resourceful but not subtle at the front door chad was tearing the planks away without much regard for surprise attacks can you hear he thought to the pilgrim do you know im down here so close to you at last he turned his cold eyes up to the top of the hotel his belly was acid with anticipation a film of sweat glossed his forehead and palms im like a nervous lover he thought so strange that the romance should end this way without a sane observer to witness the final acts who would know once it was all over who would tell not the americans they would not survive the next few hours with the tatters of their sanity intact not carys she would not survive at all there would be nobody to report the story whichfor some buried reasonhe regretted was that what made him a european to want to have his story told once more passed down the line to another eager listener who would in his time disregard its lesson and repeat his own suffering ah how he loved tradition the front door had been beaten open saint chad stood grinning at his achievement sweating in his tie and suit lead the way mamoulian invited him the eager youth went inside the european followed carys and saint tom brought up the rear within the smell was tantalizing associations were one of the curses of age in this case the perfume of carbonized wood and the sprawl of wreckage underfoot evoked a dozen cities hed wandered in but one of course in particular was that why joseph had come to this spot because the scent of smoke and the climb up the creaking stairs woke memories of that room off muranowski square the thiefs skills had been the equal of his own that night hadnt they thered been something blessed about the young man with the glittering eyes the fox whod shown so little awe just sat down at the table willing to risk his life in order to play mamoulian believed the pilgrim had forgotten warsaw as hed grown from fortune to fortune but this ascent up burned stairs was proof positive that he had not they climbed in the dark saint chad going ahead to scout the way and calling behind him that the banister was gone in this place and a stair in that between the fourth and fifth stories where the fire stopped mamoulian called a halt and waited until carys and tom caught up when they had he instructed that the girl be brought to him it was lighter up here mamoulian could see a look of loss on the girls tender face he touched her not liking the contact but feeling it appropriate your father is here he told her she didnt reply nor did her features relinquish the look of grief carys are you listening she blinked he assumed he was making some contact with her if primitive i want you to speak to papa do you understand i want you to tell him to open the door for me gently she shook her head carys he chided you know better than to refuse me hes dead she said no the european replied flatly hes up there a few flights above us i killed him what delusion was this who he asked sharply killed who marty he doesnt answer i killed him shush shush the cold fingers stroked her cheek is he dead then so hes dead thats all that can be said i did it no carys it wasnt you it was something that had to be done dont concern yourself he took her wan face in both hands often he had cradled her head when she was a child proud that she was the pilgrims fruit in those embraces he had nurtured the powers she had grown up with sensing that a time might come when he would need her just open the door carys tell him youre here and hell open it for you i dont want to see him but i do youll be doing me a great service and once its over therell be nothing to be afraid of ever again i promise you that she seemed to see some sense in this the door he prompted yes he loosed her face and she turned away from him to climb the stairs in the deeppile comfort of his suite his jazz playing on the portable hifi he had personally lugged up six flights whitehead had heard nothing he had all that he needed drink books records strawberries a man might sit out the apocalypse up here and be none the worse for it he had even brought some pictures the early matisse from the study reclining nude quai st michel a miro and a francis bacon the last was a mistake it was too morbidly suggestive with its hints of flayed flesh hed turned it to the wall but the matisse was a joy even by candlelight he was staring at it never less than enchanted by its casual facility when the knocking came he stood up it was many hourshed lost track of timesince strauss had been here had he come again somewhat groggy with vodka whitehead lurched along the hall of the suite and listened at the door papa it was carys he didnt answer her it was suspicious her being here its me papa its me are you there her voice was so tentative she sounded like a child again was it possible strauss had taken him at his word and sent the girl to him or had she simply come back of her own accord the way evangeline had after cross words yes that was it shed come because like her mother she couldnt help but come he began to unlock the door fingers awkward in anticipation papa at last he got the best of the key and the handle and opened the door she wasnt there nobody was there or so he thought at first but even as he stepped back into the hall of the suite the door was thrown wide and he was flung against the wall by a youth whose hands seized him at neck and groin and pinned him flat he dropped the vodka bottle he was carrying and threw up his hands to signify his surrender when hed shaken the assault from his head he looked over the youths shoulder and his bleary eyes came to rest on the man who had followed the youth in quietly and quite without warning he began to cry they left carys in the dressing room beside the master bedroom of the suite it was empty but for a fitted wardrobe and a pile of curtains which had been removed from the windows and then forgotten she made a nest in their musty folds and lay down a single thought circled in her head i killed him she had felt his resistance to her investigation felt the tension building in him and then nothing the suite which occupied a quarter of the top story boasted two views one was of the highway a garish ribbon of headlights the other that let on to the east side of the hotel was gloomier the small dressingroom window faced this second view a stretch of wasteland then the fence and the city beyond it but from her position lying on the floor all of that was out of sight all she could see was a skyfield across which the blinking lights of a jet crept she watched its circling descent thinking martys name marty they were lifting him into an ambulance he still felt sick to the pit of his stomach with the roller coaster hed been on he didnt want consciousness because with it came the nausea the hissing had gone from his ears however and his sight was intact what happened hitandrun somebody asked him he just fell down a witness replied i saw him fell down in the middle of the pavement i was just coming out of the newsagents when i marty and there he was marty his name was sounding in his head clear as a springmorning bell there was a renewed trickle of blood from his nose but no pain this time he raised his hand to his face to stem the flow but a hand was already there stanching and wiping youll be all right a mans voice said somehow marty felt this to be indisputably true though it was nothing to do with this mans ministrations the pain had gone and the fear had gone with it it was carys speaking in his head it had been all along now some wall in him had been breachedforcibly perhaps and painfully but the worst was overand she was thinking his name in her head and he was catching her thought like a lobbed tennis ball his previous doubts seemed naive it was a simple act this thought catching once you had the knack of it she felt him wake to her for several seconds she lay on her curtain bed while the jet winked across the window not quite daring to believe what her instincts were telling herthat he was hearing her that he was alive marty she thought this time instead of the word getting lost in the dark between his mind and hers it went unerringly home welcomed into his cortex he didnt have the skill to frame an answer but that was academic at this point as long as he could hear and understand he could come the hotel she thought do you understand marty im with the european at a hotel she tried to remember the name shed glimpsed over the door orpheus that was it she had no address but she did her best to picture the building for him in the hope that he could make sense of her impressionist directions he sat up in the ambulance dont worry the carll be taken care of the attendant said pressing a hand on his shoulder to get him to lie back down theyd wrapped a scarlet blanket across him red so the blood doesnt show he registered as he threw it off you cant get up the attendant told him youre in bad shape im fine marty insisted pushing the solicitous hand away youve been wonderful but ive got a prior engagement the driver was closing the double doors at the back of the ambulance through the narrowing gap marty could see a ring of professional bystanders straining to catch a final look at the spectacle he made a dive for the doors the spectators were disgruntled to see lazarus risen and worse to see him smiling like a loon as he emerged apologizing from the back of the vehicle didnt the man have any sense of occasion im fine he told the driver as he backed off through the crowd must have been something i ate the driver stared at him uncomprehending youre bloody he managed to mutter never felt better marty replied and in a way despite the exhaustion in his bones it was true she was here in his head and there was still time to make things right if he hurried the citroen was a few yards down the road splashes of his blood painted the pavement beside it the keys were still in the ignition wait for me babe he said and started back toward the pandemonium hotel it was not the first time sharon had been locked out of her house while her mother entertained a man the young girl had never seen before and would on past form never see again but tonight the expulsion was particularly unwelcome she felt a summer cold coming on and she wanted to be in the house in front of the television instead of out in the street after dark vainly trying to devise new skipping games for herself she wandered down the street beginning a solitary game of hopscotch then abandoning it on the fifth square she was just outside number eightytwo it was a house her mother had warned her to keep clear of a family of asians lived on the ground floorsleeping twelve to a bed or so mrs lennox had told sharons motherin conditions of criminal squalor but despite its reputation number eightytwo had been a disappointment all summer until today today sharon had seen peculiar comings and goings at the house some people had arrived in a big car and taken a sicklooking woman away with them and now as she idled at the hopscotch game there was somebody at one of the middle floor windows a big shadowy figure and he was beckoning to her sharon was ten it would be a year before her first period and though she had an inkling of the matter between men and women from her halfsister she thought it a ridiculous palaver the boys who played football in the street were foulmouthed grubby creatures she could scarcely imagine ever pining for their affections but the alluring figure at the window was a male and it found something in sharon it turned over a rock beneath were the first stirrings of lives that werent quite ready for the sun they wriggled they made her thin legs itch it was to stop that itch that she disobeyed every prohibition on number eightytwo and slipped into the house when next the front door was opened and up to where she knew the stranger to be hello she said standing on the landing outside the room you can come in the man said sharon had never smelled death before but she knew it instinctively introductions were superfluous she stood in the doorway and peered at the man she could still run if she wanted to she knew that too she was made yet safer by the fact that he was tied to the bed this she could see though the room was dark her inquisitive mind found nothing odd in this adults played games the way children did put on the light the man suggested she reached up for the switch beside the door and turned it on the weak bulb lit the prisoner strangely by it he looked sicker than anybody sharon had ever set eyes on he had obviously dragged the bed across the room to the window and in so doing the ropes that tied him had bitten into his gray skin so that shiny brown fluidsnot quite like bloodcovered his hands and trousers and spattered the floor at his feet black blotches made his face which was also shiny piebald hello he said his voice was warped as though he was speaking out of a cheap radio its weirdness amused her hello she said back he gave her a lopsided grin and the bulb caught the wetness of his eyes which were so deep in his head she could scarcely make them out but when they moved as they did now the skin around them fluttered im sorry to call you away from your games he said she dawdled in the door not quite certain whether to go or stay i shouldnt really be here she teased oh he said rolling his eyes up until all the whites showed please dont go she thought he looked comical with his jacket all stained and his eyes rolling if marilyn found out id been here your sister is that my mother shed hit me the man looked doleful she shouldnt do that he said well she does thats shameful he replied mournfully oh she wont find out sharon reassured him the man was more distressed by her talk of a beating than shed intended nobody knows im here good he said i wouldnt want any harm to come to you on my account why are you all tied up she inquired is it a game yes thats all it is tell me whats your name sharon youre quite right sharon its a game only i dont want to play anymore its started to hurt me you can see he raised his hands as far as he could to show how the bindings bit a diet of flies disrupted from their laying buzzed about his head are you any good at untying knots he asked her not very could you try for me suppose so she said only im feeling very tired come in sharon close the door she did as she was told there was no threat here just a mystery and she wanted to know more besides the man was ill he could do her no harm in his present condition the closer she got to him the worse he looked his skin was blistering and there were beads of something like black oil dotting his face beneath the smell of his perfume which was strong there was something bitter she didnt want to touch him sorry as she felt for him please he said proffering his bound hands the flies roved around irritated there were lots of them and they were all interested in him in his eyes in his ears i should get a doctor she said youre not well no time for that he insisted just untie me then ill find a doctor myself and nobody need know youve been up here she nodded seeing the logic of this and approached him through the cloud of flies to untie the restraints her fingers were not strong her nails bitten to the quick but she worked at the knots with determination a charming frown flawing the perfect plane of her brow as she labored her efforts were hampered by the flow of yolky fluid from his broken flesh which gummed everything up once in a while shed turn her hazel eyes up to him he wondered whether she could see degeneration occurring in front of her if she could she was too engrossed in the challenge of the knots to leave either that or she was willingly unleashing him aware of the power she wielded in so doing only once did she show any sign of anxiety when something in his chest seemed to fail a piece of internal machinery slipping into a lake around his bowels he coughed and exhaled a breath that made sewerage smell like primroses she turned her head away and pulled a face he apologized politely and she asked him not to do it again then went back to the problem at hand he waited patiently knowing that any attempt to hurry her along would only spoil her concentration but in time she got the measure of the riddle and the binding began to loosen his flesh which was now the consistency of softened soap skidded off the bone of his wrists as he pulled his hands free thank you he said thank you youve been very kind he bent to untie the ropes at his feet his breath or what passed for it a gritty rattle in his chest ill go now she said not yet sharon he replied speaking was drudgery now please dont go yet but i have to be home the razoreater looked at her creamy face she looked so fragile standing under the light she had withdrawn from his immediate vicinity once the knots were untied as though the initial trepidation had begun again he tried to smile to reassure her that all was well but his face wouldnt obey the fat and muscle just drooped on his skull his lips felt inept words he knew were close to failing him it would have to be signs from now on he was moving into a purer worldone of symbols of rituala world where razoreaters truly belonged his feet were free in a matter of moments he could be across the room to where she stood even if she turned and ran he could catch her no one to see or hear and even if there were what could they punish him with he was a dead man he crossed the room toward her the little living thing stood in his shadow and made not the least effort to escape him had she too calculated her chances and seen the futility of a chase no she was simply trusting he put out a sordid hand to stroke her head she blinked and held her breath at his proximity but made no attempt to evade the contact he longed for touch in his fingers so as to feel her gloss she was so perfect what a blessing it would be to put a piece of her in him to show as proof of love at the gates of paradise but her look was enough he would take that with him and count himself content just the somber sweetness of her as a token like coins in his eyes to pay his passage with goodbye he said and walked his gait uneven to the door she went ahead of him and opened the door then led him down the stairs a child was crying in one of the adjacent rooms the whooping wail of a baby that knows no one will come on the front step breer thanked sharon again and they parted he watched her run off home for his part he was not certainat least not consciouslyof where he was going to go now or why but once down the steps and onto the pavement his legs took him in a direction he had never been before and he didnt become lost though he soon made his way into unfamiliar territory somebody called him him and his machete and his blurred gray face he went as quickly as anatomy allowed like a man summoned by history whitehead was not afraid to die he was only afraid that in dying he might discover that he had not lived enough that had been his concern as he faced mamoulian in the hallway of the penthouse suite and it still tormented him as they sat in the lounge with the buzz of the highway at their backs no more running joe mamoulian said whitehead said nothing he collected a large bowl of halifaxs prime strawberries from the corner of the room then returned to his chair running his expert fingers across the fruit in the bowl he selected a particularly appetizing strawberry and began to nibble at it the european watched him betraying no clue to his thoughts the chase was done with now before the end he hoped theyd be able to talk over old times for a while but he didnt know where to begin tell me whitehead said seeking the meat of the fruit right up to the hull did you bring a pack with you mamoulian stared at him cards not dogs the old man quipped of course the european answered always and do these fine boys play he gestured to chad and tom who stood by the window we came for the deluge chad said a frown nicked the old mans brow what have you been telling them he asked the european its all their own doing mamoulian replied the worlds coming to an end chad said combing his hair with obsessive care and staring out at the highway his back to the two old men didnt you know is that so said whitehead the unrighteous will be swept away the old man put down his bowl of strawberries and who will judge he asked chad let his coiffure be god in heaven he said cant we play for it whitehead responded chad turned to look at the questioner puzzled but the inquiry was not for him but for the european no mamoulian replied for old times sake whitehead pressed just a game your gamesmanship would impress me pilgrim if it werent so obviously a delaying tactic you wont play then mamoulians eyes flickered he almost smiled as he said yes of course ill play theres a table next door in the bedroom do you want to send one of your bumboys through to fetch it not bumboys too old for that are you godfearing men both of them which is more than can be said of you that was always my problem whitehead said conceding the barb with a grin this was like the old days the exchange of ironies the sweetsour repartee the knowledge shared every moment they were together that the words disguised a depth of feeling that would shame a poet would you fetch the table mamoulian asked chad he didnt move he had become too interested in the struggle of wills between these two men much of its significance was lost on him but the tension in the room was unmistakable something awesome was on the horizon maybe a wave maybe not you go he told tom he was unwilling to take his eyes off the combatants for a single instant tom happy to have something to take his mind off his doubts obliged chad loosened the knot of his tie which was for him tantamount to nakedness he grinned flawlessly at mamoulian youre going to kill him right he said what do you think the european replied what is he the antichrist whitehead gurgled with pleasure at the absurdity of this idea youve been telling he chided the european is that what he is chad urged tell me i can take the truth im worse than that boy whitehead said worse want a strawberry whitehead picked up the bowl and proffered the fruit chad cast a sideways glance at mamoulian he hasnt poisoned them the european reassured him theyre fresh take them go next door and leave us in peace tom had returned with a small bedside table he set it down in the middle of the room if you go into the bathroom whitehead said youll find a plentiful supply of spirits mostly vodka a little cognac too i think we dont drink tom said make an exception whitehead replied why not said chad his mouth bulging with strawberries there was juice on his chin why the fuck not its the end of the world right right said whitehead nodding now you go away and eat and drink and play with each other tom stared at whitehead who returned a mockcontrite look im sorry arent you allowed to masturbate either tom made a noise of disgust and left the room your colleagues unhappy whitehead said to chad go on take the rest of the fruit tempt him chad wasnt certain if he was being mocked or not but he took the bowl and followed tom to the door youre going to die he said to whitehead as a parting shot then he closed the door on the two men mamoulian had laid a pack of cards on the table this wasnt the pornographic pack hed had that destroyed at caliban street along with his few books the cards on the table were older than the other pack by many centuries their faces were handcolored the illustrations for the court cards crudely rendered must i whitehead asked picking up on chads closing remark must you what die please pilgrim joseph call me joseph the way you used to spare us both i want to live of course you do what happened between usit didnt harm you did it mamoulian offered the cards for whitehead to shuffle and cut when the offer was ignored he did the job himself manipulating the cards with his one good hand well did it no the european replied no not really well then why harm me you misunderstand my motives pilgrim i havent come here for revenge why then mamoulian started to deal the cards for chemin de fer to finish our bargain of course is that so difficult to grasp i made no bargain you cheated me joseph of a lot of living you threw me away when i was no longer of any use to you and let me rot i forgive you all that its in the past but death josephhe finished the shufflingthats in the future the near future and i will not be alone when i go into it ive made my apologies if you want acts of contrition name them nothing you want my balls my eyes take them play the game pilgrim whitehead stood up i dont want to play but you asked whitehead stared down at the cards laid out on the inlaid table thats how you got me here he said quietly that fucking game sit down pilgrim made me suffer the torments of the damned have i mamoulian said concern lacing his voice have you really suffered if you have im truly sorry the point of temptation is surely that some of the goods be worth the price are you the devil you know im not mamoulian said pained by this new melodrama every man is his own mephistopheles dont you think if i hadnt come along youd have made a bargain with some other power and you would have had your fortune and your women and your strawberries all those torments ive made you suffer whitehead listened to the fluting voice lay these ironies out of course he hadnt suffered hed lived a life of delights mamoulian read the thought off his face if id really wanted you to suffer he said snailslow i could have had that dubious satisfaction many years ago and you know it whitehead nodded the candle which the european now lifted onto the table beside the dealt cards guttered what i want from you is something far more permanent than suffering mamoulian said now play my fingers are itching marty got out of the car and stood for several seconds looking up at the looming bulk of the hotel pandemonium it was not completely in darkness a light albeit frail glimmered in one of the penthouse windows he began for a second time today across the wasteland his body shaking carys had made no contact with him since he had started on his journey here he didnt question her silence there were too many plausible reasons for it none of them pleasant as he approached he could see that the front door of the hotel had been forced at least hed be able to enter by a direct route instead of clambering up the fire escape he stepped over the litter of planks and through the grandiose doorway into the foyer halting to accustom his eyes to the darkness before he began a cautious ascent of the burned stairs in the gloom every sound he made was like gunfire at a funeral shockingly loud try as he might to hush his tread the stairway hid too many obstacles for complete silence every step he took he was certain the european was hearing was readying himself to breathe a killing emptiness onto him once he reached the spot hed entered from the fire escape the going got easier it was only as he advanced into the carpeted regions he realizedthe thought brought a smile to his lipsthat hed come without either a weapon or a plan however primitive of how he was to snatch carys all he could hope was that she was no longer an important item on the europeans agenda that she might be overlooked for a few vital moments as he stepped onto the final staircase he caught sight of himself in one of the hall mirrors thin unshaven his face still bearing traces of bloodstains his shirt dark with bloodhe looked like a lunatic the image reflecting so accurately the way hed pictured himselfdesperate barbarousgave him courage he and his reflection agreed he was out of his mind for only the second time in their long association they sat facing each other over the tiny table and played chemin de fer the game was uneventful they were it seemed more evenly matched than theyd been in muranowski square forty odd years before and as they played they talked the talk too was calm and undramatic of evangeline of how the market had fallen of late of america even as the game progressed of warsaw have you ever been back whitehead asked the european shook his head its terrible what they did the germans the city planners they played on the cards were shuffled and dealt again shuffled and dealt the breeze of their motions made the candle flame flicker the game went one way then the other the conversation faltered and began again chatty almost banal it was as though in these last minutes togetherwhen they had so much to saythey could say nothing of the least significance for fear it open the floodgates only once did the chat show its true colorsescalating from a simple remark to metaphysics in mere seconds i think youre cheating the european observed lightly youd know if i was all the tricks i use are yours oh come now its true everything i learned about cheating i learned from you the european looked almost flattered even now whitehead said even now what youre still cheating arent you you shouldnt be alive not at your age its true you look the way you did in warsaw give or take a scar what age are you a hundred hundred and fifty older and whats it done for you youre more afraid than i am you need someone to hold your hand while you die and you chose me together we might never have died oh we might have founded worlds i doubt it mamoulian sighed it was all appetite then from the beginning most of it you never cared to make sense of it all sense theres no sense to be made you told me that the first lesson its all chance the european threw down his cards having lost the hand yes he said another game whitehead offered just one more then we really must be going at the head of the stairs marty halted the door of whiteheads suite was slightly ajar he had no idea of the geography of the rooms beyondthe two suites hed investigated on this floor had been totally different and he could not predict the layout of this one from theirs he thought back to his earlier conversation with whitehead when it was over hed had the distinct impression that the old man had walked quite a distance before an interior door had closed to bring an end to the exchange a long hallway then possibly offering some hiding places it was no use hesitating standing there juggling his odds only worsened the nervous anticipation he felt he must act at the door itself he halted again there was a murmur of voices from inside but muffled as if the speakers were beyond closed doors he put his fingers on the door of the suite and pushed gently it swung open a few more inches and he peered inside there was as hed guessed an empty corridor leading into the suite itself off it four doors three were closed one ajar from behind one of the closed doors came the voices hed heard he concentrated trying to pick some sense from the murmur but he failed to catch more than an odd word he recognized the speakers however one was whitehead the other mamoulian and the tone of the exchange was apparent too gentlemanly civilized not for the first time he longed to possess the ability to go to carys the way that she had come to him to seek out her location with mind alone and to debate the best means of escape as it was allas everwas chance he advanced along the hallway to the first closed door and surreptitiously opened it though the lock made some noise the voices in the far room murmured on unalerted to his presence the room he peered into was a cloakroom no more he closed the door and advanced a few more yards down the carpeted corridor through the open door he could hear movement then the clink of glass a candle shadow thrown by someone inside flitted across the wall he stood absolutely still reluctant to retreat a foot now that hed got so far voices drifted from the adjacent room shit chad the speaker sounded almost fearful what the fuck are we doing here i cant think properly the objection was met with laughter you dont need to think were on gods work here tommy drink up something terribles going to happen tom said sure as shit chad replied whyd you think were here now drink marty had rapidly worked out the identity of this pair they were here on gods work including murder he had seen them buying ice creams in the afternoon sun with their bloody knives safely pocketed fear overrode the urge to revenge however he had little enough chance of getting out of here alive as it was there was one last door to be investigated directly opposite the room occupied by the young americans in order to check it he would have to cross in front of the open door the lazy voice began again you look like you want to puke why dont you let me alone the other replied he seemed or was this just wishful thinking to be moving away then came the unmistakable sound of retching marty held his breath would the other youth go to his companions aid he prayed so you ok tommy the voice changed timbre as the speaker moved yes he was walking away from the door taking chance by the throat marty stepped smartly off from the wall opened the final door closing it behind him the room he had entered was not large but it was dark by the little light there was he could see a figure lying curled up on the floor it was carys she was sleeping her even exhalations marked a gentle rhythm he went to where she lay how to wake her that was the problem next door one wall away was the european if she made the slightest sound as he roused her he would surely hear and if he didnt the americans would he went down on his haunches and gently laid his hand over her mouth then shook her shoulder she seemed resistant to waking she frowned in her sleep and muttered some complaint he bent closer to her and risked hissing her name urgently into her ear that did the trick her eyes sprang open wide as an astonished childs her mouth formed a cry against his palm recognition came the instant before she gave voice he removed his hand there was no welcoming smile her face was pallid and grim but she touched his lips with her fingertips in welcome he stood up offering her a hand next door a row had suddenly erupted the mellow voices were raised in mutual accusation furniture was being overturned mamoulian shouted for chad in answer there came the thud of feet from the bathroom damn there was no time for tactical thinking theyd have to make a break for it and take what the moment offered good or bad he pulled carys to her feet and crossed to the door as he turned the handle he glanced over his shoulder to check that carys was still following him but disaster had registered on her face he turned back to the door and the reasonsaint thomas his chin shiny with vomitwas standing directly outside the door he was apparently as startled to see marty as the other way around using his hesitation marty stepped into the hallway and pushed tom in the chest the american fell back the word chad escaping his lips as he stumbled through the open door opposite knocking over a bowl of strawberries as he did so the fruit rolled underfoot marty ducked around the dressingroom door and out into the hall but the american recovered his balance with speed and reached out to snatch the back of his shirt the attempt was sufficient to slow marty down and as he turned to beat the arresting hand away he saw the second american emerging from the room the old men were in there was a frightening serenity in the youths eyes as he closed in on marty run was all he could shout to carys but the blond god stopped her as she slipped out into the corridor pushing her back the way shed come with a breathed no before continuing on his way toward marty hold her he told his companion as he took over the hold on marty tom stepped out of sight after carys and there was a noise of struggle but marty had little time to analyze it as chad doubled him up with a blow to the stomach marty too confused by the sudden rush of action to prepare for the pain groaned and fell back against the front door of the suite slamming it the blond boy followed him down the corridor and through tearbleared eyes marty just caught sight of the next blow before it landed he didnt see the third or fourth there was no time between the punches and kicks to stand upright or catch a breath the cornfed body pummeling him was lithe and strong more than martys equal vainly he flailed against the tattoo he was so damn tired and sick his nose began to bleed again and still the serene eyes fixed him as the fists beat his body black so calm those eyes they could have been at prayer but it was marty who was falling to his knees marty whose head was dragged back in enforced adulation as the blond boy spat on him marty who said help meor some bruised corruption of those wordsas he collapsed mamoulian stepped out of the gaming room leaving the pilgrim to his tears hed done as the old man had askedtheyd played a game or two for old times sake but now the indulgence was over and what was this chaos in the hall the tangle of limbs at the front door blood spattered on the wall ah it was strauss somehow the european had expected a late arrival at the celebrations who it was to be he hadnt foreseen he stalked the corridor to see what damage had been done looking down at the disfigured spittlelaced face with a sigh saint chad his fists bloody was sweating a little the scent off the young lion was sweet he was almost away the saint said indeed the european replied gesturing for the youth to give him room from his collapsed position on the hall floor marty gazed up at the last european the air between them seemed to be itching marty waited surely the killing stroke would follow quickly but there was nothing except the gaze from those noncommittal eyes even in his broken state marty could see the tragedy written in the mask of mamoulians face it no longer terrified him simply fascinated this man was the source of the nullity he had barely survived in caliban street was there not a ghost of that gray air lurking in his sockets now seeping from his nostrils and mouth as though a fire smoldered in his cranium in the room where he and the european had played cards whitehead moved stealthily across to the pillow of his makeshift bed events in the hall had shifted the focus for a useful moment he slipped his hand beneath the pillow and drew out the gun hidden there then crept through into the adjoining dressing room and slipped out of sight behind the wardrobe from that position he could see saint tom and carys standing in the hallway watching events at the front door both were too intent on the gladiators to notice in the darkened room is he dead tom asked from a distance who knows whitehead heard mamoulian reply put him in the bathroom out of the way whitehead watched as strauss inert bulk was hauled past the door and into the room opposite to be dumped in the bathroom mamoulian approached carys you brought him here he said simply she didnt reply whiteheads gun hand itched from where he was standing mamoulian made an easy target except that carys stood in the way would a bullet fired at her back pass through her and into the european the thought though appalling had to be contemplated survival was at issue here but the moments hesitation had snatched his chance the european was escorting carys toward the gaming room and out of shot no matter it left the coast clear he slipped out of hiding and darted to the dressingroom door as he stepped into the corridor he heard mamoulian say joseph whitehead ran the few yards to the front door knowing the chance of escape without violence was gossamerthin he grabbed the handle and turned it joseph said the voice behind him whiteheads hand froze as he felt invisible fingers plucking at the nape of his neck he ignored the pressure and forced the handle around it slid in his sweaty palm the thought that breathed at his neck pressed around his axis vertebra the threat unmistakable well then he thought the choice is out of my hands he released the door handle and turned fully around to face the cardplayer he was standing at the end of the corridor which seemed to be darkening becoming a tunnel extruded from mamoulians eyes such potent illusions but simply that illusions he could resist them long enough to bring their forger down whitehead raised the gun and pointed it at the european without giving the cardplayer another moment to confound him he fired the first shot hit mamoulians chest the second his stomach perplexity crossed the europeans face blood spread from the wounds across his shirt he did not fall however instead in a voice so even it was as if the shots had not been fired he said do you want to go outside pilgrim behind whitehead the door handle had started to rattle is that what you want mamoulian demanded to go outside yes then go whitehead stepped away from the door as it was flung open with such venom the handle impaled itself in the corridor wall the old man turned away from mamoulian to make good his escape but before he could take a step the light in the corridor was sucked away into the pitch darkness beyond the door and to his horror whitehead realized that the hotel had disappeared from beyond the threshold there were no carpets and mirrors out there no stairs winding down to the outside world only a wilderness hed walked in half a life ago a square a sky shot with trembling stars go out the european invited him its been waiting for you all these years go on go the floor beneath whiteheads feet seemed to have become slick he felt himself sliding toward the past his face was washed by the open air as it glided into the hallway to meet him it smelled of spring of the vistula which roared to the sea ten minutes walk from here it smelled of blossom too of course it smelled of blossom what hed mistaken for stars were petals white petals lifted by the breeze and gusted toward him the sight of the petals was too persuasive to be ignored he let them lead him back into this glorious night when for a few shimmering hours the whole world had promised to be his for the taking even as he conceded his senses to the night the tree appeared as phenomenal as he had so often dreamed it its white head shaking slightly somebody lurked in the shade beneath its laden branches their smallest movement caused a new cascade his entranced reason made one final snatch at the reality of the hotel and he reached to touch the door of the suite but his hand missed it in the darkness there was no time to look again the obscured watcher was emerging from the cover of the branches dйjа vu suffused whitehead except that the first time hed been here there had only been a glimpse of the man beneath the tree this time the reluctant sentinel broke cover smiling a welcome lieutenant konstantin vasiliev showed his burned face to the man whod come visiting from the future tonight the lieutenant would not shamble off for a rendezvous with a dead woman tonight he would embrace the thief who had grown furrowed and bearded but whose presence here hed awaited a lifetime we thought youd never come vasiliev said he pushed a branch aside and stepped fully into the dead light of this fantastical night he was proud to show himself though his hair was entirely burned off his face black and red his body full of holes his trousers were open his member erect perhaps later they would go to his mistress together he and the thief drink vodka like old friends he grinned at whitehead i told them youd come eventually i knew you would to see us again whitehead raised the gun he still had in his hand and fired at the lieutenant the illusion was not interrupted by this violence however merely reinforced shoutsin russianechoed from beyond the square now look what youve done vasiliev said now the soldiers will come the thief recognized his error he had never used a gun after a curfew it was an invitation to arrest he heard booted feet running close by we must hurry the lieutenant insisted casually spitting out the bullet which he had caught between his teeth im not going with you whitehead said but weve waited so long vasiliev replied and shook the branch to cue the next act the tree raised its limbs like a bride shrugging off its trousseau of blossom within moments the air was thick with a blizzard of petals as they settled spilling their radiance onto the ground the thief began to pick out the familiar faces that waited beneath the branches people who down the years had come to this wasteland to this tree and gathered under it with vasiliev to rot and weep evangeline was among them the wounds that had been so tastefully concealed as shed lain in her coffin now freely displayed she did not smile but she stretched her arms out to embrace him her mouth forming his namejojoas she stepped forward bill toy was behind her in evening dress as if for the academy his ears bled beside him her face opened from lip to brow was a woman in a nightgown there were others too some of whom he recognized many of whom he didnt the woman whod led him to the cardplayer was there barebreasted as he remembered her her smile was as distressing as ever there were soldiers too others whod lost to mamoulian like vasiliev one wore a skirt in addition to his bullet holes from under its folds a snout appeared saulhis carcass ravagedsniffed his old master and growled see how long weve waited vasiliev said the lost faces were all looking at whitehead their mouths open no sound emerged i cant help you we want to cease the lieutenant said go then not without you he wont die without you finally the thief understood this place which hed glimpsed in the sauna at the sanctuary existed within the european these ghosts were creatures hed devoured evangeline even she they waited the tattered remains of them in this nomansland between flesh and death until mamoulian sickened of existence and lay down and perished then they too presumably would have their liberty until then their faces would make that soundless o at him a melancholy appeal the thief shook his head no he said he would not give up his breath not for an orchard of trees not for a nation of despairing faces he turned his back on muranowski square and its plaintive ghosts the soldiers were shouting nearby soon they would arrive he looked back toward the hotel the penthouse corridor was still there across the doorstep of a bombed house a surreal juxtaposition of ruin and luxury he crossed the rubble toward it ignoring the soldiers orders for him to halt vasilievs cries were loudest however bastard he screeched the thief blocked his curses and stepped out of the square and back into the heat of the hallway raising his gun as he did so old news he said you dont scare me with it mamoulian was still standing at the other end of the corridor the minutes the thief had spent in the square had not elapsed here im not afraid whitehead shouted you hear me you soulless bastard im not afraid he fired again this time at the europeans head the shot hit his cheek blood came before whitehead could fire again mamoulian retaliated there are no limits he said his voice trembling to what i shall do his thought caught the thief by the throat and twisted the old mans limbs convulsed the gun flew out of his hand his bladder and bowels failed him behind him in the square the ghosts began to applaud the tree shook itself with such vehemence that the few blossoms it still carried were swept into the air some of them flew toward the door melting on the threshold of past and present like snowflakes whitehead fell against the wall out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of evangeline spitting blood at him he began to slide down the wall his body jangled as if in the throes of a grand mal he let out one word through his rattling jaws he said no on the bathroom floor marty heard the denial howled out he tried to stir himself but his consciousness was sluggish and his beaten body ached from scalp to skin taking hold of the bath he hoisted himself to his knees hed clearly been forgotten his part in the proceedings was purely comic relief he tried to stand but his lower limbs were traitorous they buckled beneath him and he fell again feeling every bruise on impact in the hallway whitehead had sunk down onto his haunches mouth gaga the european moved in for the coup de grвce but carys interrupted leave him she said distracted mamoulian turned toward her the blood on his cheek had traced a single line to his jaw you too he murmured no limits carys backed off into the gaming room the candle on the table had begun to flare energy was loose in the suite and the spitting flame was fat and white on it the european looked at carys with hunger in his eyes there was an appetite on himan instinctive response to his blood lossand all he could see in her was nourishment like the thief hungry for another strawberry though his belly was full enough i know what you are carys said deflecting his gaze from the bathroom marty heard her ploy stupid he thought to tell him that i know what you did the europeans eyes widened smoky youre nobody the girl started to say youre just a soldier who met a monk and strangled him in his sleep what have you got to be so proud of her fury beat against his face youre nobody nobody and nothing he reached to catch hold of her she dodged him around the cardtable once but he threw it over the pack scattering and caught her his hold felt like a vast leech on her arm taking blood from her and giving only the void only purposeless dark he was the architect of her dreams again god help me she breathed her senses crumbled and grayness streamed in to take their place he pulled her out of her body with one insolent wrench and took her into him dropping her husk to the floor beside the overturned table he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and looked up at the evangelists they were standing in the doorway staring at him he felt sick with his greed she was in himall of her at onceand it was too much and the saints were making it worse looking at him as though he were something loathsome the dark one shaking his head you killed her he said you killed her the european turned away from the accusations his system boiling over and leaned elbow and forearm on the wall like a drunk about to vomit her presence in him was a torment it wouldnt be still it raged and raged and her turbulence unlocked so much more strauss piercing his bowels the dogs at his heels unleashing blood and smoke and then back back beyond these few terrible months to other ordeals yards and snow and starlight and women and hunger always hunger and still at his back he felt the stare of the christians one of them spoke the blond boy whom once he might have lusted after he and she and all is this all there is he demanded to know is this all you fucking liar you promised us the deluge the european pressed his hand over his mouth to stem the escaping smoke and pictured a wave curling over the hotel over the city descending to sweep europe away dont tempt me he said in the hallway whitehead his neck broken became vaguely aware of a perfume in the air he could see the landing outside the suite from where he was lying muranowski square with its fatal tree had long since faded leaving only the mirrors and the carpets now as he sprawled beside the door he heard somebody come up the stairs he glimpsed a figure moving in the shadows this was the perfumed one the newcomer approached slowly but doggedly hesitating for only a moment at the threshold before stepping over whiteheads crumpled form and making his way toward the room where the two men had played cards there had been a while as theyd chatted over the game that the old man had fancied he might yet make a fresh covenant with the european might escape for a few more years the inevitable catastrophe but it had all gone wrong they had rowed over some trivia the way lovers do and by some incomprehensible mathematic it had escalated to this death he rolled himself over so that he could look the other way down the corridor toward the gaming room carys was lying on the floor among the spilled cards he could see her corpse through the open door the european had devoured her now the newcomer interrupted his view as he lurched to the door from where he lay whitehead hadnt been able to see the mans face but he saw the shine on the machete at his side tom caught sight of the razoreater before chad his unruly stomach rebelled at the mingled stench of sandalwood and putrefaction and he threw up on the old mans bed as breer stepped into the room hed come a long way and the miles had not been kind but he was here mamoulian stood upright from the wall and faced breer he was not entirely surprised to see that rotted face though he wasnt sure why was it that his mind had not quite relinquished its hold on the razoreater and that breer was somehow here at his behest breer stared at mamoulian through the bright air as if awaiting a new instruction before he acted again the muscles of his face were so deteriorated that each flicker of his eyeball threatened to tear the skin of its orbit he looked thought chadhis mind high on cognaclike a man full to bursting with butterflies their wings beat against the confines of his anatomy they powdered his bones in their fervor soon their relentless motion would split him open and the air would be full of them the european looked down at the machete breer was carrying why did you come he wanted to know the razoreater tried to reply but his tongue rebelled against the duty there was just a soft palate word that could have been good or got or god but was none of them have you come to be killed is that it breer shook his head he had no such intention and mamoulian knew it death was the least of his problems he raised the blade at his side to signal his intentions i can wipe you out mamoulian said again breer shook his head egg he said which mamoulian interpreted and repeated as dead dead chad mused god in heaven the mans dead the european murmured the affirmative chad smiled maybe they were going to be cheated of the destroying wave perhaps the reverends calculations had been wrong and the deluge wouldnt be on them for a few more months what did it matter he had stories to tellsuch stories even bliss with all his talk of the demons in the soul of the hemisphere hadnt known about scenes like this the saint watched licking his lips with anticipation in the hallway whitehead had managed to drag himself three or four yards away from the front door and he could see marty who had managed to stand leaning on the lintel of the bathroom door marty felt the old mans eyes on him whitehead raised a beckoning hand groggily marty lurched into the hallway his presence ignored by the actors in the gaming room it was dark out here the light in the gaming room that livid candlelight was all but sealed off by the partially closed door marty knelt at whiteheads side the old man took hold of his shirt youve got to fetch her he said the voice almost faded his eyes bulged there was blood in his beard and more coming with each word but his hold was strong fetch her marty he hissed what are you talking about he has her whitehead said in him fetch her for christs sake or shell be there forever like the others his eyes flicked in the direction of the landing remembering the scourge of muranowski square was she there already a prisoner under the tree with vasilievs eager hands on her the old mans lips began to tremble cant let him have her boy he said you hear me wont let him have her marty had difficulty sewing the sense of this together was whitehead suggesting that he should find his way into mamoulian and retrieve carys it wasnt possible i cant he said the old man registered disgust and let go of marty as though hed discovered he had hold of excrement painfully he turned his head away marty looked toward the gaming room through the gap in the door he could see mamoulian moving toward the unmistakable figure of the razoreater there was frailty on the europeans face marty studied it for a moment and then looked down at the europeans feet carys lay there her face startled by cessation her skin bright he could do nothing why didnt papa leave him be to run away into the night and heal his bruises he could do nothing and if he ran if he found a place to hide to heal would he ever wash away the smell of his cowardice would this momentthe roads dividing and dividing againnot be burned into his dreams forever he looked back at papa but for the feeble movement of his lips he could have already been dead fetch her he was still saying a catechism to be repeated until his breath failed fetch her fetch her marty had asked something similar of carysto go into the lunatics lair and come back with a story to tell how could he now not return the favor fetch her fetch her papas words were fading with every beat of his failing heart maybe she was retrievable marty thought somewhere in the flux of mamoulians body and if not if not would it be so hard to die trying to fetch her and have an end to roads dividing and choices turning to ash but how he tried to recall how shed done it but the procedures were too elaboratethe washing the silenceand surely he had scant opportunity to make his voyage before circumstances changed his only source of hope lay in the fact of his bloody shirtthe way hed felt on his way here that carys had snapped some barrier in his head and that the damage once done was permanent perhaps his mind could go to her through the wound shed opened tracing her scent as relentlessly as shed pursued his he closed his eyes shutting off the hallway and whitehead and the body lying at the europeans feet sight was a trap shed said that once effort too he must let go let instinct and imagination take him where sense and intellect could not he conjured her effortlessly putting the bleak fact of her corpse out of his head and evoking instead her living smile in his mind he spoke her name and she came to him in a dozen moments laughing naked puzzled contrite but he let the particulars go leaving only her essential presence in his aching head he was dreaming her the wound was open and it pained him to touch it again blood was running into his open mouth but the sensation was a distant phenomenon it had little to do with his present condition which was increasingly dislocated he felt as though he was slipping his body off it was redundant waste matter the ease of the procedure astonished him his only anxiety vas that hed become too eager he had to control his exhilaration for fear he throw caution to the wind and be discovered he could see nothing hear nothing the state he moved indid he even movewas not susceptible to the senses now though he had no proof of the perception he was sure he was abstracted from his body it was behind below him an untenanted shell ahead of him carys he would dream his way to her and then just as he had thought he could take pleasure in this extraordinary journey hell opened in front of him mamoulian too intent on the razoreater felt nothing as marty breached him breer made a halfrun forward lifting the machete and aiming a blow at the european he sidestepped to avoid it with perfect economy but breer pivoted around for a second strike with startling speed and this time more by chance than direction the machete glanced down mamoulians arm slicing into the cloth of his dark gray suit chad the european said not taking his eyes off breer yes the blond boy replied he was still leaning on the wall beside the door posed there like an indolent hero he had found whiteheads cache of cigars pocketing several and lighting one he blew a cloud of dusty blue smoke and watched the gladiators through a blur of drink what do you want find the pilgrims gun why for our visitor kill him yourself chad replied nonchalantly you can do it mamoulians mind revolted at the thought of laying his flesh on such decay better a bullet at close range it would lay the razoreater to waste without a head even the dead couldnt walk fetch the gun he demanded no chad replied the reverend had said plain speaking was best this is no time for games mamoulian said taking his attention off breer for a moment to glance across at chad it was an error the dead man swung the machete again and this time the blow found mamoulians shoulder lodging in the muscle close to his neck the european made no sound but a grunt as the blow fell and a second as breer pulled the blade out of its niche stop he told his assailant breer shook his head this was what he had come for wasnt it this was the prelude to an act hed waited so long to perform mamoulian put his hand up to the wound at his shoulder bullets he could take and survive but a more traumatic attack one that compromised the integrity of his fleshthat was dangerous he had to finish breer off and if the saint wouldnt fetch the gun then hed have to kill the razoreater with his bare hands breer seemed to sense his intention you cant hurt me he tried to say the words coming out in a jumble im dead mamoulian shook his head limb from limb he murmured if i must limb from limb chad grinned hearing the europeans promise sweet jesus he thought this was the way the world would end a warren of rooms cars on the freeway winding their last way home the dead and almost dead exchanging blows by candlelight the reverend had been wrong the deluge wasnt a wave was it it was blind men with axes it was the great on their knees begging not to die at the hands of idiots it was the itch of the irrational grown to an epidemic he watched and thought of how he would describe this scene to the reverend and for the first time in his nineteen years his pretty head felt a spasm of pure joy marty hadnt realized how pleasurable the experience of travel had been a passenger of pure thoughtuntil he plunged into mamoulians body he felt like a skinned man immersed in boiling oil he thrashed his essence screeching for an end to this hell of another mans physicality but carys was here he had to keep that thought uppermost a touchstone in this maelstrom his feelings for her had the purity of mathematics its equationscomplex but elegant in their proofsoffered a nicety that was like truth he had to hold on to this recognition if he once relinquished it he was lost though without senses he felt this new state struggling to impinge a vision of itself upon him at the corners of his blind eyes lights flared perspective opened up and closed again in an instantsuns threatened to ignite overhead and were snuffed out before they could shed warmth or illumination some irritation possessed him an itch of lunacy scratch me it said and you neednt sweat anymore he countered the seduction with thoughts of carys gone the itch said deeper than youd dare to go so much deeper what it claimed was perhaps true hed swallowed her whole taken her down to wherever he kept his favorite things to the place where the zero hed tampered with at caliban street was sourced facetoface with such a vacuum he would shrivel there would be no reprieve this time such a place the itch salad such a terrible place you want to see no come on look look and tremble look and cease you wanted to know what he was well youre about to get a wormseye view im not listening marty thought he pressed on and thoughlike caliban streetthere was no up or down no forward or back in this place he had a sense of descent was it just the metaphors he carried with him that he pictured hell as a pit or was he crawling through the europeans innards to the bowel where carys was hidden of course youll never get out the itch said with a smile not once you get down there theres no way back hell never shit you out youll stay locked up in there once and for all carys got out he reasoned she was in his head the itch reminded him she was flipping through his library youre buried in the dungheap and deep oh yes my man so deep no for certain no mamoulian shook his head it was full of strange aches voices too or was that just the past chattering to him yes the past it had buzzed and gossiped in his ear more loudly in these recent weeks than ever in the preceding decades whenever his mind had idled the gravity of history had claimed it and he had been back in the monastery yard with the snow falling and the drummerboy at his righthand side quaking and the parasites leaving the bodies as they cooled two hundred years of life had sprung from that conspiracy of moments had the shot that killed the executioner been delayed by mere seconds the sword would have fallen his head would have rolled and the centuries hed lived would not have contained him nor he they and why did this cycle of thoughts return now as he looked at anthony across the room they were a thousand miles and seventeen decades from that event im not in danger he chided himself so why quake breer was teetering on the edge of total collapse dispatching him was a simple if distasteful task he moved suddenly his good hand snatching at breers throat before the other had a chance to retaliate the europeans slender fingers dug through the mush and closed around breers esophagus then he pulled hard a goodly portion of breers neck came away in a splutter of grease and fluids there was a sound like escaping steam chad applauded cigar in mouth in the corner where hed collapsed tom had stopped whimpering and was also watching the mutilation one man fighting for his life the other for his death hallelujah saints and sinners all together mamoulian flung the fistful of muck away despite his formidable injury the razoreater was still standing must i tear you apart mamoulian said even as he spoke something scrabbled inside him was the girl still fighting her confinement whos there he asked softly carys answered not to mamoulian but to marty here she said he heard her no not heard felt she summoned him and he followed the itch in marty was in seventh heaven too late to help her it said too late for anything now but she was close by he knew it her presence choking back his panic im with you she said two of us now the itch was unimpressed it smirked at the thought of escape youre sealed up forever it said better concede it if she cant get out why should you be able to two carys said two of us now for the frailest of moments he caught the intention in her words they were together and together they were more than a sum of their parts he thought of their locking anatomiesthe physical act that was metaphor for this other unity hed never understood until now his mind jubilated she was with him he with her they were one indivisible thought imagining each other go and hell divided it had no choice the province fragmented as they delivered themselves out of the europeans grasp they experienced a few exquisite moments as one mind and then gravityor whatever law pertained in this statedemanded its lot division camea rude expulsion from this momentary edenand they were plumeting now toward their own bodies the conjunction over mamoulian felt their escape as a wounding more traumatic than any breer had so far delivered he put his finger up to his mouth a look of pitiful loss on his face tears came freely diluting the blood on his face breer seemed to sense a cue in this his moment had come an image had spontaneously appeared in his liquefying brainlike one of the grainy photographs in his book of atrocitiesexcept that this image moved snow fell the flames of a brazier danced the machete in his hand felt heavier by the second more like a sword he raised it its shadow fell across the europeans face mamoulian looked at breers ruined features and recognized them saw how it had all come to this moment bowed under a weight of years he fell to his knees as he was doing so carys opened her eyes there had been a vile grinding return more terrible for marty than for herself who was used to the sensation but it was never entirely pleasant to feel muscle and fat congeal around the spirit martys eyes had opened too and he was looking down at the body he occupied it was heavy and stale so much of itthe layers of skin the hair the nailswas dead matter its very substance revolted him being in this state was a parody of the freedom hed just tasted he started up from his slumped position with a small cry of disgust as if hed woken to find his body crawling with insects he looked across to carys for reassurance but her attention had been claimed by a sight concealed from marty by the partially closed door she was watching a spectacle she knew from somewhere but the point of view was different and it took awhile for her to place the scene the man on his knees his neck exposed his arms spread a little from his body fingers splayed in the universal gesture of submission the executioner face blurred raising the blade to decapitate his willing victim somebody laughing somewhere nearby the last time shed seen this tableau shed been behind mamoulians eyes a soldier in a snowspattered yard awaiting the blow that would cancel his young life a blow that had never come or rather had been deferred until now had the executioner waited so long living in one body only to discard it for another trailing mamoulian through decade upon decade until at last fate assembled the pieces of a reunion or was this all the europeans doing had his will summoned breer to finish a story accidentally interrupted generations before she would never know the act begun a second time was not to be postponed again the weapon sliced down almost dividing head from neck in one blow a few tenacious sinews kept it rockingnose to chestfrom the trunk for two succeeding blows before it departed rolling down between the europeans legs and coming to rest at toms feet the boy kicked it away mamoulian had made no sound but now headless his torso gave vent noise came from the wound with the blood complaints sounded it seemed from every pore and with the sound came smoky ghosts of unmade pictures rising from him like steam bitter things appeared and fled dreams perhaps or fragments of the past it was all one now always had been in fact he had come from rumor he the legendary he the unfixable he whose very name was a lie could it matter if now his biography fleeing into nothingness was taken as fiction breer unassuaged began to berate the open wound of the corpses neck with the machete slicing first down then sideways in an effort to cleave the enemy into smaller and yet smaller pieces an arm was summarily lopped off he picked it up to sever hand from wrist forearm from upper arm in moments the room which had been almost serene as the execution took place became an abattoir marty stumbled to the door in time to see breer strike off mamoulians other arm look at him go said the american boy toasting the bloodbath with whiteheads vodka marty watched the carnage unblenched it was all over the european was a dead man his head lay on its side under the window it looked small vestigial carys flattened against the wall beside the door caught martys hand papa she said what about papa as she spoke mamoulians corpse pitched forward from its kneeling position the ghosts and the din it had spilled had stopped now there was only dark blood splashing from it breer bent to further butchery opening the abdomen with two slashes urine fountained from the punctured bladder carys revolted by the attacks slipped out of the room marty lingered a while longer the last sight he caught as he followed carys was the razoreater picking up the head by the hair like some exotic fruit and delivering a lateral cut to it in the hallway carys was crouching at her fathers side marty joined her she stroked the old mans cheek papa she said he wasnt dead but neither was he truly alive there was a flicker in his pulse no more his eyes were closed no use marty said as she shook the old mans shoulder hes as good as gone in the gaming room chad had begun to shriek with laughter apparently the slaughterhouse scenes were reaching new heights of absurdist brio i dont want to be here when he gets bored marty said carys made no move theres nothing we can do for the old man he said she looked at him bewildered by the dilemma hes gone carys and we should go too a silence had started in the abattoir it was worse in its way than the laughter or the sound of breers labors we cant wait around marty said he roughly pulled carys to her feet and propelled her toward the front door of the penthouse she made only faint objection as they slipped away downstairs somewhere up above them the blond american began to applaud again the dead man worked at his work for a good time long after the domestic traffic on the highway had dwindled to a trickle leaving only the longdistance freight drivers to roar their way north breer heard none of it his ears had long since given out and his eyesight once so sharp could barely make sense of the carnage that now lay on every side of him but when his sight failed completely he still had the rudiments of touch this he used to finish his commission dividing and subdividing the flesh of the european until it was impossible to tell apart the piece that spoke and the piece that pissed chad tired of the entertainment long before that point was reached grinding out his second cigar with his heel he sauntered through to see how things were progressing elsewhere the girl had gone the hero too god loves them he thought the old man was still lying in the hallway however clutching the gun which hed retrieved at some point in the proceedings his fingers spasmed once in a while nothing more chad went back into the bloody chamber where breer was on his knees among the meat and the cards still chopping and raised tom off the floor he was in a languid state his lips almost blue and it took a good deal of cajoling to get any action out of him but chad was a born proselytizer and a short talk got some enthusiasm back into him nothin we cant do now you know chad told him were baptized men i mean weve seen everything havent we there aint nothing in this whole wide world the devil can fight us with because weve been there aint we been there chad was high on his newfound freedom he wanted to prove the point and he had this fine ideayoull like this tommyof doing a dump on the old mans chest tom didnt seem to care either way and he just watched while chad dropped his trousers to do the dirty work his bowels would not oblige as he started to stand upright however whiteheads eyes snapped open and the gun fired the bullet missed plowing into chads testicles by a hairbreadth but scored a fine red mark on the inside of his milkwhite thigh and whistled past his face to slam into the ceiling chads bowels gave then but the old man was dead hed died with the shot that came so close to blowing off chads manhood near thing tom said his catatonia broken by chads nearmutiliation guess im just lucky the blond boy replied then they took their revenges as best they could and went their way im the last of the tribe thought breer when im gone the razoreaters will be a thing of the past he hauled himself from the pandemonium hotel knowing that what coherence his body had was fast diminishing his fingers could barely grip the petrol can hed stolen from the boot of a car before hed come to the hotel and had left awaiting these last rites in the foyer it was as difficult to grasp with his mind as it was with his fingers but he did the best he could he couldnt name the things that sniffed at his carcass as he squatted among the rubbish couldnt even remember who he was except that he had seen once some fine and wonderful sights he twisted the cap off the petrol can and spilled the contents over him as efficiently as he could most of the fluid simply pooled around him then he dropped the can and ferreted blind for the matches the first and second didnt catch the third did flames instantly engulfed him in the conflagration his body curled up taking on that pugilistic attitude common to the victims of immolation the joints shortening as they cooked drawing arms and legs up into a posture of defense when at last the games went out the dogs came to scavenge what they could more than one of them went away yelping however their palates slit by a mouthful of meat in which secreted like pearls in an oyster were the razor blades breer had downed like a gourmet xiv after the wave wind had the world it blew exactly eastwest that evening carrying the clouds buoyant after a day of rain in the direction of the setting sun as if they were hurrying to some apocalypse just over the horizon or perhapsthis thought was worsethey were rushing to persuade the sun to back up from oblivion for another hour another minuteanything to delay the night and of course it wouldnt come and instead the sun was taking advantage of their fleecyheaded panic to steal them over the edge of the world carys had tried to persuade marty that all was well but she hadnt succeeded now as he hurried toward the orpheus hotel once more with the clouds suicidal and the night coming down he sensed the rightness of his suspicions the whole visible world carried evidence of conspiracy besides carys still spoke in her sleep not with mamoulians voice perhaps that cautious looping ironic voice that hed come to know and hate she didnt even make words as such just scraps of sound the noise of crabs of birds trapped in an attic whirrs and scratchings as though she or something in her was laboring to reinvent a forgotten vocabulary there was nothing human in it as yet but he was certain the european was in hiding there the more he listened the more he seemed to hear order in the muttering the more the noise her sleeping tongue made sounded like a palate seeking after speech the thought made him sweat and then the night before this night of rushing clouds hed been startled awake at four in the morning there were dreadful dreams of course and would he supposed be dreams for many years to come but tonight they were not confined to his head they were here they were now carys was not lying beside him in the narrow bed she was standing in the middle of the room her eyes closed her face infested with tiny inexplicable tics she was talking again or at least attempting to and this time he knew knew without a shadow of a doubt that somehow mamoulian was still with her he said her name but she made no sign of waking getting up out of bed he crossed the room toward her but as he made his move the air around them seemed to bleed darkness her chattering took on a more urge pitch and he sensed the darkness solidifying his face and chest began itch his eyes stung again he called her name shouting now there was no response shadows had begun to flit across her though there was no light in the room that could have cast them he stared at her gabbling face the shadows resembled those cast by light through blossomladen boughs as though she were standing in the shade of a tree above him something sighed he looked up the ceiling had disappeared in its place a spreading tracery of branches growing even as he watched her words were at its root he had no doubt of it and it grew stronger and more intricate with every syllable she spoke the boughs rippled as they swelled sprouting twigs that in seconds grew heavy with foliage but despite its health the tree was corrupted in every bud its leaves were black and shone not with sap but with the sweat of putrescence vermin scuttled up and down the branches fetid blossoms fell like snow leaving the fruit exposed such terrible fruit a sheaf of knives tied up in a ribbon like a gift for an assassin a childs head hung up by its plaited hair one branch was looped with human intestine from another a cage depended in which a bird was burning alive mementos all keepsakes of past atrocities and was the collector here among his souvenirs something moved in the turbulent darkness above marty and it was no rat he could hear whispers exchanged there were human beings up there resting in the rot and they were climbing down to have him join them he reached through the boiling air and took hold of carys arm it felt mushy as though the flesh was about to come away in his hand beneath her lids she rolled her eyes like a stage lunatic her mouth still shaping the words that conjured the tree stop he said but she only chattered on he took hold of her with both hands and shouted for her to shut up shaking her as he did so above them the boughs creaked a litter of twigs fell down on him wake up damn you he told her carys this is marty me marty wake up for christs sake he felt something in his hair and glanced up to see a woman spitting a pearlthread of saliva down upon him it spattered on his face icecold panic mounting he started to yell at carys to make her stop and when that failed he slapped her hard across the face for an instant the flow of conjuring was interrupted the tree and its inhabitants complained with growls he slapped her again harder the fever behind her lids had begun to abate he saw he called to her again and shook her her mouth lolled open the tics and terrible intentionality left her face the tree trembled please he begged her wake up the black leaves shrank upon themselves the fevered limbs lost their ambition she opened her eyes murmuring its chagrin the rot rotted and went away into nothingness the mark of his hand was still ripening on her cheek but she was apparently unaware of his blows her voice was blurred by sleep as she said whats wrong he held her tight not having any answer he felt brave enough to voice he only said you were dreaming she looked at him puzzled i dont remember she said and then becoming aware of his trembling hands whats happened a nightmare he said why am i out of bed i was trying to wake you she stared at him i dont want to be woken she said im tired enough as it is she disengaged herself i want to go back to bed he let her return to the crumpled sheets and lie down she was asleep again before he had crossed to her he did not join her but sat up until dawn watching her sleep and trying to keep the memories at bay im going back to the hotel he told her in the middle of the next day this very day hed hoped she might have some explanation for the events of the previous nightfrail hopethat she might tell him it was some stray illusion that she had managed at last to spit out but she had no such reassurances to offer when he asked her if she remembered anything of the preceding night she replied that she dreamed nothing these nights and was glad of it nothing he repeated the word like a death sentence thinking of the empty room in caliban street of how nothing was the essence of his fear seeing his distress she reached across to him and touched his facehis skin was hot it was raining outside but the room was clammy the europeans dead she told him i have to see for myself theres no need babe if hes dead and gone why do you talk in your sleep do i talk and make illusions maybe im writing a book she said the attempt at levity was stillborn weve got plenty of problems without going back there that was true there was much to decide how to tell this story for one and how to be believed for another how to give themselves into the hands of the law and not be accused of murders known and unknown there was a fortune waiting for carys somewhere she was her fathers sole beneficiary that too was a reality that had to be faced mamoulians dead she told him cant we forget about him for a while when they find the bodies well tell the whole story but not yet i want to rest for a few days you made something appear last night here in this room i saw it why are you so certain its me she retorted why should i be the one whos still obsessed are you sure it isnt you whos keeping this alive me not able to let it go nothing would make me happier then forget it damn you let it be marty hes gone dead and gone and thats the end of it she left him to turn the accusation over in his head maybe it was him maybe hed just dreamed the tree and was blaming her for his own paranoia but in her absence his doubts conspired how could he trust her if the european was alivesomehow somewherecouldnt he put those arguments into her mouth to keep marty from interfering he spent the time she was out in an agony of indecision not knowing a way forward that wasnt tainted with suspicion but lacking the strength to face the hotel again and so prove the matter one way or the other then in the late afternoon shed returned theyd said nothing or very little and after a while shed gone back to bed complaining of an aching head after half an hour sharing the room with her sleeping presence hearing only her even breath hed gone out for whisky and a paper scanning it for news of discovery or pursuit there was nothing world events dominated where there were not cyclones or wars there were cartoons and racing results he headed back to the flat prepared to forget his doubts to tell her that shed been right all along only to find the bedroom locked and from the inside her voicesoftened by sleepstumbling toward a new coherence he broke in and tried to wake her but this time neither shaking nor slaps made any impression upon her possessed slumber and he was almost there now he wasnt dressed for the cold that was creeping on and he shivered as he crossed the desolation to the hotel pandemonium autumn was making its presence felt early this year not even waiting for the beginning of september to chill the air in the weeks since hed last stood on this spot the summer had given in to rain and wind he was not unhappy with its desertion summer heat in small rooms would never have benign associations for him again he looked up at the hotel it was coralcolored in the sliding lightthe details of scorch marks and graffiti looked almost too real a portrait by an obsessive each detail in absolute focus he watched the facade awhile to see if something signaled to him perhaps a window might wink a door grimace anything to prepare him for what he might discover inside but it remained politic just a solid building face staled with age and flame catching the last light of the day the front door had been closed by the last visitor to leave the hotel but no attempt had been made to replace the boards marty pushed and the door opened grinding across the plaster and dirt on the floor inside nothing had changed the chandelier tinkled as a gust from outside trespassed into the sanctum a dry rain of dust flitted down as he climbed the first two flights a smell began to infiltrate something riper than damp or ash presumably the bodies would still be where theyd been left substantial decay would have set in he didnt know how long such processes took but after the experiences of recent weeks he was prepared for the worst even the strengthening smell as he ascended scarcely touched him he halted halfway up and took out the bottle of scotch hed bought unscrewed the top and still eyeing the remaining flights of stairs put the bottle to his lips the mouthful of spirits sluiced his gums and throat and scorched its way down into his belly he resisted the temptation to take a second swig instead he resealed the bottle and pocketed it before continuing up memories began to besiege him hed hoped to keep them at bay but they came unbidden and he wasnt strong enough to resist them there were no pictures just voices they echoed around his skull as if it were empty as if he were simply some mindless brute answering the call of a superior mind the urge to turn tail and run came over him but he knew that if he capitulated now and went back to her the qualms would only deepen soon hed be suspecting every twitch of her arm wondering if the european was preparing her for murder it would be another kind of prison its walls suspicion its bars doubt and hed be sentenced to it for the rest of his life even if carys left wouldnt he still be glancing over his shoulder as the years passed watching for a someone to appear who had a face behind his face and the europeans unforgiving eyes and still with every step taken his fears multiplied he gripped the filthy banister and forced himself onward and upward i dont want to go the child in him complained dont make me go please easy enough to turn around easy enough to delay the whole thing look your feet will do it just say the word go back shell wake eventually just be patient go back and if she doesnt wake the voice of reason replied and that made him go on as he took another step something moved on the landing ahead of him a fleajump noise no more so soft he could barely hear it a rat perhaps probably all manner of scavengers would come here wouldnt they in the expectation of a feast hed preempted that horror too and was hardened to the thought he reached the landing no rats scurried away from his footfall at least he saw none but there was something here at the head of the stairs a small brown maggot rolled around on the carpet twisting upon itself in its enthusiasm to get somewhere down the stairs probably into the dark he didnt look at it too closely whatever it was it was harmless let it find a niche to grow fat in and become a fly in time if that was its ambition he crossed the penultimate landing and started up the final flight of stairs a few steps up the smell abruptly worsened the stench of fetid meat assaulted him and now despite the scotch and all the mental preparation his innards turned over and over like the maggot on the carpet twisting and turning he stopped two or three steps up the flight pulled out his whisky and took two solid throatfuls swallowing it so quickly it made his eyes water then he continued his ascent something soft slid beneath his heel he looked down another maggot the larger brother of the one below had been arrested in its descent by his foot it was squashed to a fatty pulp he glanced at it for only a second before hurrying on aware that the sole of his shoe was slimy either that or he was pressing other such grubs underfoot as he went the gulps of liquor had made his head sing he took the last two dozen steps almost at a run eager to have the worst over with by the time hed reached the top of the stairs he was breathless he had an absurd image of himself a drunkards fancy as a messenger coming with newslost battles murdered childrento the palace of some fabulous king except that the king too was murdered his battles lost he started toward the penthouse the smell had become so dense it was almost edible as he had once before he caught sight of himself in the mirror he looked down ashamed from the frightened face andgodthe carpet crawled not two or three but a dozen or more fat ragged maggots were laboring blindly it seemed to find their way across the carpet which was stained by their travels they were like no insect hed ever seen before lacking any decipherable anatomy and all different sizes some fingerthin others the size of a babys fist their shapeless forms purple but streaked with yellow they left trails of slime and blood like wounded slugs he stepped around them theyd got fat on meat hed once debated with he didnt want to examine them too closely but as he pushed open the door of the suite and stepped cautiously into the corridor an appalling possibility crept into his head and sat there whispering obscenities the creatures were everywhere in the suite the more ambitious of them were scaling the pastel walls gluing the slivers of their bodies to the wallpaper with seeped fluids edging up like caterpillars a peristalsis moving through their length their direction was arbitrary some to judge by their trails were circling on themselves in the dim light of the corridor his worst suspicions merely simmered but they began to boil when he edged past whiteheads sprawled body and stepped into the slaughterhouse room where the light from the highway made a sodium day here the creatures were in yet greater abundance the whole room swarmed with them from fleasized fragments to slabs the size of a mans heart throwing out tattered filaments like tentacles to haul themselves about worms fleas maggotsa whole new entymology congregated at the place of execution except that these werent insects or the larvae of insects he could see that plainly now they were pieces of the europeans flesh he was still alive in pieces in a thousand senseless pieces but alive breer had been unrelentingly thorough in his destruction eradicating the european as best his machete and failing hands would allow but it had not been enough there was too much stolen life buzzing in mamoulians cells it roared on in contravention of any sane law unquenchable for all his vehemence the razoreater had not finished the europeans life merely subdivided it leaving it to describe these futile circles and somewhere in this lunatics menagerie was a beast with a will a fragment that still possessed sufficient sense to think itselfalbeit stutteringlyinto carys mind perhaps not one piece perhaps manya sum of these wandering parts marty wasnt interested in its biology how this obscenity survived was a matter for a madhouse debating society he backed out of the room and stood shivering in the hall wind gusted against the window the glass complained he listened to the gusts while he worked out what to do next down the corridor a piece of filth fell from the wall he watched it struggle to turn itself over and then begin the slow ascent again just beyond the spot where it labored lay whitehead marty went back to the body charmaines killers had enjoyed themselves mightily before they left whiteheads trousers and underwear had been pulled down and his groin scrawled on with a knife his eyes were open his false teeth had been removed he stared at marty jaw sagging like a delinquent child flies crawled on him there were patches of decay on his face but he was dead which in this world was something the boys had as a final insult defecated on his chest flies gathered there too in his time marty had hated this man loved him too if only for a day called him papa called him bastard made love to his daughter and thought himself king of creation hed seen the man in power a lord seen him afraid too scrabbling for escape like a rat in a fire hed seen the old mans odd species of integrity in practice and found it workable as fruitful perhaps as the affections of more loving men he reached across to seal off the stare but in their zeal the evangelists had cut off whiteheads lids and martys fingers instead touched the slick of his eyeball not tears that wetted it but rot he grimaced withdrew his hand sickened just to shut off the look on papas face he thrust his fingers under the corpse to heave it onto its belly the body fluids had settled and his underside was damp and sticky gritting his teeth he rolled the mans bulk onto its side and let gravity pull it over now at least the old man didnt have to watch what followed marty stood up his hands stank he baptized them liberally with the rest of the scotch to cancel the smell the libation served another purpose it removed the temptation of the drink it would be too easy to become muzzy and lose focus on the problem the enemy was here it had to be dealt with put away forever he began where he was in the hall digging his heels into the pieces of flesh that crawled around whiteheads body squashing their stolen life out as best he could they made no sound of course which made the task simpler they were just worms he told himself dumb slivers of mindless life and it became yet easier as he went up and down the corridor grinding the meat into smears of yellow fat and brown muscle the beasts succumbed without argument he began to sweat working out his revulsion on this human refuse eyes darting everywhere to make sure he caught each wretched scrap he felt a smile twitch at the corners of his mouthnow a low laugh quite without humor escaped it was an easy decimation he was a boy again killing ants with his thumbs one two three only these things were slower than the most laden ant and he could stamp them down at a leisurely pace all the power and wisdom of the european had come to this muck and hemarty strausshad been elected to play the godgame and wipe it away he had gained at the last a terrible authority nothing is essential the words hed heardand spokenin caliban street at last made absolute sense here was the european proving the bitter syllogism with his own flesh and bone when hed finished his work in the hallway he returned to the main room and began his labors there his initial revulsion at touching the flesh dwindling until with time he was snatching pieces from their perches on the wall and flinging them down to be ground out when hed done in the gaming room he went to scour the landing and stairs finally when all was still he returned to the suite and made a bonfire of the curtains from the dressing room fueled by the table the old man had played cards on and tindered by the cards themselves and then went
