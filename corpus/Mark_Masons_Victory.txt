middle age with a thin face and a nose like a hawk he was well dressed and across his vest was visible a showy gold chain with a cameo charm attached to it the boy probably about fifteen was the image of his father they were crossing city hall park in new york and mr talbot was pointing out to his son the public buildings which make this one of the noted localities in the metropolis shine asked a bootblack walking up to the pair id like to take a shine father said edgar what do you charge five cents but i dont object to a dime replied the bootblack can i have a shine father why didnt you get one at the hotel because they charged ten cents i thought i could get it for less outside good boy said the father in a tone of approval get things as low as you can thats my motto and thats the way i got rich here boy you can get to work instantly the bootblack was on his knees and signed for edgar to put his foot on the box whats your name boy asked edgar with a condescending tone no it aint boy its tom well tom do you make much money well i dont often make moren five dollars a day five dollars you are trying to humbug me its true though i never made moren five dollars in a day in my life cept when i shined shoes for swells like you who were liberal with their cash edgar felt rather flattered to be called a swell but a little alarmed at the suggestion that tom might expect more than the usual sum thats all right but i shall only pay you five cents i knew you wouldnt as soon as i saw you why cause you dont look like george w childs whos he the ledger man from philadelphia i once blacked his shoes and he gave me a quarter general washington once paid me a dollar what ejaculated edgar do you mean to say that you ever blacked general washingtons shoes no he wore boots why my good boy general washington died almost a hundred years ago did he well it might have been some other general i guess it was you dont seem to know much about history no i dont i spent all my time studyin stronomy when i went to school whats your whole name tom trotter i guess youve heard of my father hes judge trotter of the supreme court i am afraid you dont tell the truth very often no i dont it aint healthy do you of course i do this conversation was not heard by mr talbot who had taken a seat on one of the park benches and was busily engaged in reading the morning world by this time tom began to think it was his time to ask questions where did you come from he inquired how do you know but i live in the city cause you aint got new york style oh said edgar rather mortified then he added in a tone which he intended to be highly sarcastic i suppose you have well i guess youd ought to see me walk down fifth avener sunday mornin with my best girl do you wear the same clothes youve got on now no i guess not ive got a little lord fauntleroy suit of black velvet with kid gloves and all the fixins but you aint told me where you live yet i live in syracuse my fathers one of the most prominent citizens of that city is it the man you was walkin with yes there he is sitting on that bench he aint much to look at you look just like him really i think you are the most impudent boy i ever met said edgar with asperity why what have i said i only told you you looked like him yes but you said he wasnt much to look at i guess hes rich and thats better than good looks yes my father is quite wealthy returned edgar complacently i wish i was rich instead of good lookin you good looking thats what everybody says i aint no judge myself tom looked roguishly at edgar and his aristocratic patron was obliged to confess that he had a pleasant face though it was marred by a black spot on each cheek probably caused by the contact of his hands youre a queer boy said edgar i dont know what to make of you make a rich man of me and well go to europe together my doctor says i ought to travel for my health edgar havent you got your shoes blacked yet asked his father from the bench tom struck the box sharply with his brush to show that the job was completed just got done governor he said familiarly here is your money said edgar producing some pennies from his pockets theres only four observed tom with a critical glance only four havent you dropped one no thats all you gave me father have you got a cent mr talbots hand dived into his pocket and he brought out a penny but it was a canadian coin i dont know as i can pass this said tom theyre very particular at the windsor hotel where i am boarding you can save it till you go traveling in canada suggested edgar with unusual brightness for him thats so answered tom who appreciated a joke ill stop in syracuse on the way and pay you a visit how does he know about our living in syracuse asked mr talbot i told him i lived there he said you was a big bug up there i hope you didnt use that expression edgar said his father oh well thats what he meant wont you have a shine yourself governor no i dont think i shall need it whered you get that shine youve got on in syracuse tell em they dont understand shinin boots up there hadnt you better go up there and give them some lessons suggested edgar well i dont mind if i can get free board at your house do you think we would have a bootblack living in our house dont waste any time on him edgar he is a street boy and his manners are fitted to his station thank you governor thats the biggest compliment ive had for a long time mr talbot laughed really boy you are very grotesque thats another compliment said tom taking off his hat and bowing with mock politeness hallo tom tom turned to meet the smile of a district telegraph messenger who was crossing the park to broadway hows yourself mark he said id offer to shake hands but ive been doin a little business for these gentlemen and my gloves aint handy no following the direction of toms nod glanced at mr talbot and edgar and instantly a look of surprise came over his face why uncle solon is that you he exclaimed solon talbot looked embarrassed and seemed in doubt whether to acknowledge his relationship to the humble telegraph boy are you mark mason he asked yes dont you know me i havent seen you for two years you know and this is edgar continued the telegraph boy youve grown so i would hardly know you i hope you are well said edgar coldly thank you uncle solon where are you staying ahem i am stopping up town shall you be in the city long i dont think so mother would like very much to see you she would like to ask about grandfathers estate ah um yes where do you live no st marks place near first avenue well call if we can edgar well have to hurry away as they walked toward the other side of the park at a brisk pace tom asked you dont mean to say thats your uncle mark yes that is he married my mothers sister and that young swell is your cousin yes he is rich isnt he i suppose so why dont he do something for you and your mother he was always a very selfish man but we dont ask any favors mother and i dont all we ask is justice what do you mean by that my grandfather that is mothers father and mrs talbots died two years ago and uncle solon was the administrator we supposed he had left a good deal of money but all we have received from his estate is seventyfive dollars do you think the old fellers been playin any game on you i dont know what to think i tell you what mark he deserves a good lickin if hes cheated you and id like to give it to him well tom i must be going i cant stop talking here or ill get into trouble at the office chapter ii where mark lived there is a large tenement house on st marks place between third avenue and avenue a the suites of rooms consist as is the general new york custom in tenement houses of one square apartment used as kitchen sitting room and parlor combined and two small bedrooms opening out of it it was in an apartment of this kind on the third floor back that mark masons mother and little sister edith lived it was a humble home and plainly furnished but a few books and pictures saved from the wreck of their former prosperity gave the rooms an air of refinement not to be found in those of their neighbors mrs mason was setting the table for supper and edith was studying a lesson in geography when the door opened and mark entered his mother greeted him with a pleasant smile you are through early mark she said yes mother i was let off earlier than usual as there was an errand up this way that fortunately took very little time im glad youve come home mark said edith i want you to help me in my map questions all right edie but you will have to wait till after supper ive got something to tell mother what is it mark i saw two old acquaintances of ours from syracuse this forenoon who were they asked mrs mason eagerly uncle solon and edgar is it possible where did you see them in city hall park edgar had just been having his boots blacked by tom trotter did you speak to them yes how did they appear well they didnt fall on my neck and embrace me answered mark with a smile in fact they seemed very cool and yet solon talbot is my brotherinlaw the husband of my only sister and edgar is my own cousin hes an awful snob mother and he looks as like his father as one pea looks like another then he is not very handsome i wish i could see them did you invite them to call yes and what did solon mr talbot say he said he might call but he was in a great hurry did you remember to give him our address yes mother i said you would like to see him about grandfathers estate i certainly would it seems strange very strange that father should have left so little money we only got seventyfive dollars out of it when i expected at least five thousand i suspect theres been some dishonesty on the part of uncle solon you know he is awfully fond of money yes he always was and tom trotter says that edgar told him his father was very rich it seems strange the change that has taken place when i first knew solon talbot i was a young lady in society with a high position and he was a clerk in my fathers store he was of humble parentage though that of course is not to his discredit his father used to go about sawing wood for those who chose to employ him you dont mean it you never told me that before no for i knew that solon would be ashamed to have it known and as i said before it is nothing to his discredit but it might prevent edgar from putting on such airs he looked at me as if i was an inferior being and he didnt care to have anything to say to me i hope you dont feel sensitive on that account sensitive no i can get along without edgar talbots notice i mean some time to stand as high or higher than uncle solon and to be quite as rich i hope you will mark but as we are at present situated it will be hard to rise plenty of poor boys have risen and why not i it is natural for the young to be hopeful but i have had a good deal to depress me did you remember that the rent comes due the day after tomorrow how much have you towards it mother only five dollars and its eight i dont see where the other three dollars are coming from unless and here her glance rested on the plain gold ring on her finger pledge your weddingring mother exclaimed mark surely you dont mean that i would rather do it than lose our shelter poor as it is there must be some other way there must be you will not receive any wages till saturday no but perhaps we can borrow something till then theres mrs mack upstairs she has plenty of money though she lives in a poor way there isnt much hope there mark she feels poorer than i do though i am told she has five thousand dollars out at interest never mind i am going to try her eat your supper first so i will i shall need all the strength i can get from a good meal to confront her half an hour later mark went upstairs and tapped at the door of the rooms above his mothers come in said a feeble quavering voice mark opened the door and entered in a rocking chair sat or rather crouched a little old woman her face seamed and wrinkled she had taken a comforter from the bed and wrapped it around her to keep her warm for it was a chilly day and there was no fire in her little stove good evening mrs mack said mark how do you feel its a cold day groaned the old lady i i feel very uncomfortable why dont you have a fire then its gone out and its so late it isnt worth while to light it again but it is worth while to be comfortable insisted mark i i can keep warm with this comforter around me and fuel is high very high but you can afford to buy more when this is burned no mark i have to be economical very economical i dont want to spend all my money and go to the poorhouse i dont think theres much danger of that youve got money in the savings bank havent you yes a little but i cant earn anything im too old to work for i am seventyseven and i might live years longer you know dont you get interest on your money yes a little but it costs a good deal to live well if the interest isnt enough you can use some of the principal i can put you in the way of earning twentyfive cents can you asked the old woman eagerly how if youll lend me three dollars till saturday i get my wages then ill pay you twentyfive cents for the accommodation but you might not pay me said the old woman cautiously and it would kill me to lose three dollars mark wanted to laugh but felt that it would not do there isnt any danger he said i get two weeks pay on saturday it will be as much as nine dollars so you see you are sure of getting back your money i i dont know i am afraid what are you afraid of you might get run over by the horse cars or a truck and then you couldnt get your money i will be careful for your sake mrs mack said mark goodhumoredly youll get your money back and twentyfive cents more the old womans face was a study between avarice on the one hand and timidity on the other i im afraid she said she rocked to and fro in her chair in her mental perturbation and mark saw that his errand was a failure if you change your mind let me know he said as he reached the foot of the stairs he was treated to a surprise there just in front of his mothers door stood solon talbot and edgar chapter iii an unexpected call in what room does your mother live asked solon talbot this is our home said mark proceeding to open the door edgar talbot sniffed contemptuously i dont see how you can live in such a mean place he remarked it is not a matter of choice returned mark gravely we have to live in a cheap tenement by this time the door was opened mother said mark preceding the two visitors here are uncle solon and edgar come to call on you mrs masons pale cheek flushed partly with mortification at her humble surroundings for when she first knew solon talbot he was only a clerk as she had said and she was a society belle there was another feeling also she had a strong suspicion that her brotherinlaw had defrauded her of her share in her fathers estate i am glad to see you mr talbot she said extending her hand and this is edgar how you have grown edgar yes maam responded edgar stiffly both mrs mason and mark noticed that he did not call her aunt her nephews coldness chilled her i am sorry to see you in such a poor place she said smiling faintly i suppose rents are high in new york said solon talbot awkwardly yes and our means are small how is my sister mary quite well thank you did she send me any message she did not know i was going to call how long it seems since i saw her sighed mrs mason i suppose you heard that i was in town yes mark told me i was not sure whether i could call as i am here on a hurried business errand i am glad you have called i wished to ask you about fathers estate just so it is very surprising i assure you that it amazed me very much to find that he left so little i cant understand it at all solon only a year before he died he told me that he considered himself worth fifteen thousand dollars people are often deluded as to the amount of their possessions i have known many such cases but i have only received seventyfive dollars and there were two heirs mary and myself according to that father must have left only one hundred and fifty dollars of course he left more but there were debts and funeral expenses and doctors bills i understand that but it seems so little it was very little and i felt sorry not only on your account but on marys of course as my wife she will be provided for but it would have been comfortable for her to inherit a fair sum you can imagine what it is to me who am not amply provided for i thought there might be five thousand dollars coming to me solon talbot shook his head that anticipation was very extravagant he said it was founded on what father told me true but i think your fathers mind was weakened towards the end of his life he was not really responsible for what he said i disagree with you there solon father seemed to me in full possession of his faculties to the last you viewed him through the eyes of filial affection but i was less likely to be influenced in my judgments five thousand dollars would have made me so happy we are miserably poor and mark has to work so hard to support us in this poor way i thought telegraph boys earned quite a snug income said solon talbot who looked uncomfortable he was dreading every moment that his sisterinlaw would ask him for pecuniary assistance he did not understand her independent nature her brotherinlaw was about the last man to whom she would have stooped to beg a favor mark sometimes makes as high as five dollars a week said mrs mason in a tone of mild sarcasm i am sure that is very good pay for a boy of his age it is a small sum for a family of three persons to live upon solon um ah i thought perhaps you might earn something else sometimes i earn as high as a dollar and a half a week making shirts mr talbot thought it best to drop the subject i am deeply sorry for you he said it is a pity your husband didnt insure his life he might have left you in comfort he did make application for insurance but his lungs were already diseased and the application was refused i may be able to help you in a small way of course proceeded solon talbot mark looked up in surprise was it possible that his closefisted uncle was offering to assist them mrs mason did not answer but waited for developments i have already paid you seventyfive dollars from your fathers estate resumed mr talbot strictly speaking it is all you are entitled to but i feel for your position and and your natural disappointment and i feel prompted to make it a hundred dollars by paying you twentyfive dollars more i have drafted a simple receipt here which i will get you to sign and then i will hand you the money he drew from his wallet a narrow slip of paper on which was written this form received from solon talbot the sum of one hundred dollars being the full amount due me from the estate of my late father elisha doane of which he is the administrator mr talbot placed the paper on the table and pointing to a black line below the writing said sign here let me see the paper mother said mark he read it carefully i advise you not to sign it he added looking up what do you mean exclaimed solon talbot angrily i mean returned mark firmly that mother has no means of knowing that a hundred dollars is all that she is entitled to from grandfathers estate didnt i tell you it was demanded talbot frowning uncle solon said mark calmly i am only a boy but i know that one cant be too careful in business matters do you dare to doubt my fathers word blustered edgar our business is with your father not with you said mark what is it you want asked solon talbot irritably i want or rather mother does to see a detailed statement of grandfathers property and the items of his debts and expenses solon talbot was quite taken aback by marks demand he had supposed the boy knew nothing of business really he said this impertinence from my own nephew is something i was by no means prepared for it is a poor return for my liberal offer your liberal offer yes the twentyfive dollars i offered your mother is out of my own pocket offered solely out of consideration for her poverty do i understand he asked addressing his sisterinlaw that you decline my offer mrs mason looked doubtfully at mark twentyfive dollars in their present circumstances would be a boon and in addition to marks earnings would tide them over at least three months was it right or wise to decline it marks face showed no signs of wavering he was calm and resolute what do you think mark asked his mother you know what i think mother we have no knowledge that the estate has been fairly administered and you would be bartering away our rights i think i wont sign the receipt solon said mrs mason solon talbot looked very angry then he replied i cannot give you the twentyfive dollars edgar we will go give my love to mary faltered mrs mason solon talbot deigned no answer but strode from the room with an angry look mother i am convinced that uncle solon was trying to swindle us said mark i hope we have done right mark rejoined his mother doubtfully what is this mother asked mark as he picked up from the floor a letter partially torn it must have been dropped by solon talbot chapter iv a night at dalys i will read this letter to see if it is of any importance said mark in that case i will forward it to syracuse he read as follows wall street exchange dear sir in reference to the mining stock about which you inquire our information is that the mine is a valuable one and very productive the stock is held in few hands and it is difficult to obtain it you tell me that it belongs to an estate of which you are the administrator i advise you to hold it awhile longer before you seek to dispose of it we are about to send an agent to nevada to look after some mining interests of our own and will authorize him also to look up the golden hope mine yours truly crane lawton stock and mining brokers mother and son looked at each other significantly finally mark said this mining stock must have belonged to grandfather yes i remember now his alluding to having purchased a hundred shares of some mine the brokers say they are valuable yet uncle solon has never said anything about them mother he means to defraud us of our share in this property supposing that we will hear nothing about it how shameful exclaimed mrs mason indignantly i will sit right down and write him a letter taxing him with his treachery no mother i dont want you to do anything of the kind you dont want us to submit to imposition that dont sound like you mark i mean that he shall give us whatever is our due but i dont want him to suspect that we know anything of his underhand schemes he hasnt sold the mining stock yet what do you want me to do leave the matter in my hands mother i will keep the letter and it will always be evidence against him he is shrewd and will get full value for the stock then we can make him hand you your share if you think that is best mark said mrs mason doubtfully i havent much of a head for business i think i have mother there is nothing i like better did you see mrs mack about a loan i didnt think to ask you as your uncle came in with you when you returned from upstairs yes i saw her but it was of no use then she wont lend us the money no she is afraid to though i offered her twentyfive cents interest i told her that i should have nine dollars coming in on saturday but she thought something might prevent my getting it then i had better pawn my ring the landlord wont wait even a day for his money dont be in a hurry mother the rent is not due till day after tomorrow and something may happen between now and then to put me in funds perhaps you are right mark five minutes later there was a knock at the door opening it mark saw another telegraph boy in the entrance he had a paper in his hand youre to go there he said handing mark a card put on your best clothes its a lady to take to the theater all right jimmy ill be ready in a jiffy do you know what theater no i dont the lady will tell you mother ill be home late said mark i must put on some clean clothes is my collar dirty yes you had better put on a clean one i dont like your being out so late i thought you were through for the day ill get extra pay mother and every little helps i say mark said jimmy youd better wear your dress suit and diamond scarfpin i would jimmy only i lent em both to a bootblack of my acquaintance whos going to attend a ball on fifth avenue tonight jimmy laughed youve always got an answer ready mark he said well so long hope youll have a good time where does the lady live mark asked mrs mason at no west fortyfifth street i havent much time to spare i must go as soon as i can get ready it was halfpast seven oclock before mark rang the bell at a fine brown stone house on west fortyfifth street the door was opened by a colored servant who without speaking to mark turned his head and called out the messengers come miss maud im so glad said a silvery voice as a young lady of twenty already dressed for the street came out of a room on the left of the hall mark took off his hat politely so you are the messenger boy she said you are to take me to dalys theater yes miss so i heard let us go at once we will take the horse cars at sixth avenue and get out at thirtieth street before she had finished they were already in the street i must explain she said that my uncle bought two tickets this morning and expected to accompany me but an important engagement has prevented i was resolved to go and so i sent for a messenger perhaps you had better take the tickets all right miss gilbert as you are to be my escort i will ask your name mark mason shall i call you mark or mr mason she asked with a roguish smile i would rather you would call me mark perhaps as you are taking the place of my uncle it would be proper to call you uncle mark she laughed all right if you prefer it said mark on the whole i wont i am afraid you dont look the character are you quite sure you can protect me ill try to miss gilbert then i wont borrow any trouble maud gilbert had carefully observed mark and as he was an attractivelooking boy she felt satisfied with the selection made for her i am glad you didnt wear your uniform she said i forgot to speak about that when i heard what i was wanted for i thought it would be better to leave off the uniform said mark that was right now i can pass you off as a young friend if i meet any young lady friend dont call me miss gilbert but call me maud perhaps you had better call me that at any rate i will maud thats right and i will call you let me see cousin mark i dont want my friends to think i had to send for an escort to a telegraph office when they entered dalys miss gilbert met an old school friend louisa morton why maud are you here said her friend how delightful and who is this young gentleman my cousin mark mason indeed well i congratulate you on having such a nice escort if he were a few years older i might try to make you jealous maud laughed gaily oh you cant get him away he is devoted to me arent you cousin mark mark was about to say you bet but it occurred to him that this would not be comme il faut so he only said you are right maud where are your seats i hope they are near ours they proved to be in the same row but on the other side of the center aisle as mark and the young lady took seats two pairs of astonished eyes noted their entrance these belonged to edgar and his father who sat two rows behind edgar was the first to catch sight of them look father he said clutching his fathers arm there is mark mason and a beautiful girl just taking their seats what does it mean i dont know returned mr talbot she seems to be a fashionable young lady how in the world did he get acquainted with such people she treats him as familiarly as if he were a brother or cousin it is very strange please take the operaglass mark edgar heard miss gilbert say you know i must make you useful for the rest of the evening the attention of edgar and his father was divided between the play and miss gilbert and mark for the benefit chiefly of her friend maud treated her young escort with the utmost familiarity and quite misled solon talbot and edgar when the play was over mark carefully adjusted miss gilberts wraps as he passed through the aisle he saw for the first time edgar and his father looking at him with astonished eyes good evening he said with a smile i hope you enjoyed the play come mark it is growing late said maud mark bowed and passed on well if that doesnt beat all ejaculated edgar they seemed very intimate when mark bade miss gilbert good night after ringing the bell at her home she pressed a bank note into his hand thank you so much she said keep the change and when i want another escort i will send for you by the light of the street lamp mark inspected the bill and found it was a five that will give me over three dollars for myself he said joyfully so the rent is secure the next day about two oclock he was in the office of a prominent banker to whom he had carried a message when a wildlooking man with light brown hair and wearing glasses rushed in and exclaimed dramatically to the astonished banker i want a hundred thousand dollars give it to me at once or i will blow your office to atoms he pointed significantly to a small carpet bag which he carried in his left hand the broker turned pale and half rose from his chair he was too frightened to speak while two clerks writing in another part of the office seemed ready to faint chapter v mark as a hero the situation was critical that the wildeyed visitor was demented there was hardly a doubt but his madness was of a most dangerous character the eyes of all were fixed with terror upon the innocentlooking valise which he held in his left hand and in the mind of all was the terrible thought dynamite well will you give me the money demanded the crank fiercely i i dont think i have as much money in the office stammered the pallid banker that wont work exclaimed the visitor angrily if you cant find it i will send you where you wont need money and he moved his arm as if to throw the valise on the floor i ill give you a check faltered luther rockwell the banker and stop payment on it said the crank with a cunning look no that wont do give me half an hour to get the money pleaded rockwell desperately perhaps twenty minutes will do you would send for a policeman said the intruder that wont do i must have the money now or if you havent got it bonds will answer luther rockwell looked helplessly toward the two clerks but they were even more terrified than he there was one to whom he did not look for help and that was the telegraph boy who stood but three feet from the crank watching him sharply for a plan of relief had come into the mind of mark mason who though he appreciated the danger was cooler and more selfpossessed than any one else in the office standing just behind the crank so that he did not attract his attention he swiftly signaled to the clerks who saw the signal but did not know what it meant mark had observed that the dangerous satchel was held loosely in the hands of the visitor whose blazing eyes were fixed upon the banker the telegraph boy had made up his mind to take a desperate step which depended for its success on rapid execution and unfaltering nerves luther rockwell was hesitating what reply to make to his visitors demand when mark with one step forward snatched the valise from the unsuspecting visitor and rapidly retreated in the direction of the two clerks now do your part he exclaimed in keen excitement the crank uttered a howl of rage and turning his fierce bloodshot eyes upon mark dashed towards him the two clerks were now nerved up to action they were not cowards but the nature of the peril had dazed them one was a member of an athletic club and unusually strong they dashed forward and together seized the madman mr rockwell too sprang from his seat and though an old man joined the attacking party quick he shouted to mark take that valise out of the office and carry it where it will do no harm then come back mark needed no second bidding he ran out of the office and downstairs never stopping till he reached the nearest police station quickly he told his story and two policemen were despatched on a run to mr rockwells office they arrived none too soon the crank appeared to have the strength of three men and it seemed doubtful how the contest between him and the three who assailed him would terminate the two policemen turned the scale they dexterously slipped handcuffs over his wrists and at last he sank to the floor conquered he was panting and frothing at the mouth luther rockwell fell back into his seat exhausted youve had a trying time sir said one of the policemen respectfully yes ejaculated the banker with dry lips i wouldnt pass through it again for fifty thousand dollars ive been as near a terrible death as any man can be and live but for the heroism of that boy where is he the question was answered by the appearance of mark mason himself just returned from the police station but for you said the banker gratefully we should all be in eternity i too answered mark let me get at him shrieked the crank eying mark with a demoniac hatred but for him i should have succeeded was there really dynamite in the bag asked one of the policemen yes answered mark the sergeant opened it in my presence he said there was enough dynamite to blow up the biggest building in the city what is going to be done with it asked the banker anxiously the policemen were starting with it for the north river thats the only safe place for it if you have no further use for this man well carry him to the stationhouse said one of the officers yes yes take him away ejaculated the banker with a shudder struggling fiercely the crank was hurried down the stairs by the two official guardians and then mr rockwell who was an old man quietly fainted away when he came to he said feebly i am very much upset i think i will go home call a cab my boy mark soon had one at the door now i want you to go with me and see me home i dont dare to go by myself mark helped the old gentleman into his cab and up the stairs of his dwelling mr rockwell paid the cab driver adding take this boy back to my office what is your name my boy mark mason no luther rockwell scribbled a few lines on a leaf torn from his memorandum book and gave it to mark present that at the office he said come round next week and see me yes sir answered mark respectfully and sprang into the cab as he was riding through madison avenue he noticed from the window his uncle solon and edgar walking slowly along on the left hand side at the same moment they espied him look father cried edgar in excitement mark mason is riding in that cab so he is echoed mr talbot in surprise catching their glance mark smiled and bowed he could understand their amazement and he enjoyed it mechanically mr talbot returned the salutation but edgar closed his lips very firmly and refused to take any notice of his cousin i dont understand it he said to his father when the cab had passed doesnt it cost a good deal to ride in a cab in new york yes i never rode in one but once and then i had to pay two dollars and yet mark mason who is little more than a beggar can afford to ride and last evening he was at the theater in company with a fashionable young lady telegraph boys must get higher pay than he said perhaps edgar suggested his father with an attempt at humor you would like to become a telegraph boy yourself id scorn to go into such a low business well i wont urge you to do so meanwhile mark continued on his way in the cab as he passed city hall park tom trotter who had just finished shining a gentlemans boots chanced to look towards broadway as he saw his friend mark leaning back in the cab his eyes opened wide well ill be jiggered he exclaimed hows that for puttin on style fust thing you know mark mason will have his name down wid de four hundred it did not occur to mark to look at the paper given him by mr rockwell till he got out of the cab this was what he read mr nichols give this boy ten dollars luther rockwell his eyes flashed with delight this is a lucky day he exclaimed its worth while running the risk of being blown up when youre so well paid for it nichols the chief clerk at once complied with his employers directions youre a brave boy he said if it hadnt been for you wed all have been blown higher than a kite how did you leave mr rockwell he seems pretty well upset answered mark no wonder hes an old man i dont mind saying i was upset myself and i am less than half his age you were the only one of us that kept his wits about him somehow i didnt think of danger said mark i was considering how i could get the better of the crank you took a great risk if the valise had fallen wed have all gone up and he pointed significantly overhead i am glad mr rockwell has given you something if he had given you a hundred dollars or a thousand it wouldnt have been too much he told me to call at the office next week dont forget to do it it will be to your interest chapter vi the evening globe while mark was passing through these exciting scenes mrs mason went about her daily duties at home anxiously considering how the rent was to be paid on the following day mark had not told her of his gift from maud gilbert intending it as a surprise as she was washing the breakfast dishes there was a little tap at the door to her surprise the visitor turned out to be mrs mack of the floor above to whom mark had applied for a loan without success as mrs mack seldom left her room mrs mason regarded her with surprise come in and sit down mrs mack she said kindly she had no regard for the old woman but felt that she deserved some consideration on account of her great age mrs mack hobbled in and seated herself in a rockingchair i hope you are well said mrs mason tollable tollable answered the old woman glancing curiously about the room as if making an inventory of what it contained cant i give you a cup of tea at your age it will be strengthening im not so very old said the old woman querulously im only seventyseven and my mother lived to be eightyseven i hope you will live as long as you wish to but mrs mack you must make yourself comfortable old people live longer if they live in comfort will you have the tea i dont mind answered mrs mack brightening up at the prospect of this unwonted luxury she did not allow herself tea every day on account of its cost there are many foolish people in the world but among the most foolish are those who deny themselves ordinary comforts in order to save money for their heirs the tea was prepared and the old woman drank it with evident enjoyment your boy came up yesterday to borrow three dollars she began then coming to business yes he told me so he said hed pay me saturday night yes he gets two weeks pay then i i was afraid he might not pay me back and i cant afford to lose so much money im a poor old woman mark would have paid you back he always pays his debts yes i think he is a good boy if i thought he would pay me back i i think i would lend him the money he offered to pay me interest yes he would pay you for the favor if if he will pay me four dollars on saturday night i will lend him what he wants what ejaculated mrs mason do you propose to ask him a dollar for the use of three dollars for two or three days its its a great risk mumbled mrs mack there is no risk at all to ask such interest as that would be sheer robbery we are poor and we cant afford to pay it i am a poor old woman you are not poor at all you are worth thousands of dollars who said so demanded mrs mack in alarm everybody knows it its its a mistake a great mistake i i cant earn anything im too old to work i dont want to die in a poorhouse you would live a great deal better in a poorhouse than you live by yourself i decline your offer mrs mack i would rather pawn my wedding ring as i proposed to mark that would only cost me nine cents in place of the dollar that you demand the old woman looked disappointed she had thought of the matter all night with an avaricious longing for the interest that she expected to get out of mark and she had no thought that her offer would be declined never mind about business mrs mack said mrs mason more kindly as she reflected that the old woman could not change her nature wont you have another cup of tea and i can give you some toast too if you think you would like it an expression of pleasure appeared on the old womans face if its handy she said i dont always make tea for it is too much trouble it is safe to say that mrs mack thoroughly enjoyed her call though she did not effect the loan she desired to make when she rose to go mrs mason invited her to call again i always have tea or i can make it in five minutes she said thank you kindly maam i will come she said if it isnt putting you to too much trouble mother said edith after the visitor had hobbled upstairs i wouldnt give tea to that stingy old woman my dear child she is old and though she is not poor she thinks she is which is almost as bad if i can brighten her cheerless life in any way i am glad to do so about one oclock a knock was heard at the door mrs mason answered it in person and to her surprise found in the caller a brisklooking young man with an intelligent face he had a notebook in his hand is this mrs mason he inquired yes sir your son is a telegraph boy yes no yes sir has anything happened to him she asked in quick alarm i bring no bad news answered the young man with a smile have you a photograph or even a tintype of your son recently taken i have a tintype taken last summer at coney island that will do will you lend it to me till tomorrow but what can you possibly want with marks picture asked the mother feeling quite bewildered i represent the daily globe mrs mason his picture is to appear in the evening edition but why should you publish marks picture because he has distinguished himself by a heroic action i cant stop to give you particulars for i ought to be at the office now but i will refer you to the paper with the tintype in his hand the reporter hurried to the office of the journal he represented leaving mrs mason in a state of wondering perplexity within an incredibly short time hundreds of newsboys were running through the streets crying extry extra a dynamite crank at the office of luther rockwell the great banker mark mason was returning from a trip to brooklyn when a newsboy thrust the paper in his face here johnny give me that paper he said the boy peered curiously at him aint you mark mason he asked yes how did you know me your picture is in the paper mark opened the paper in natural excitement and being a modest boy blushed as he saw his picture staring at him from the front page labeled underneath the heroic telegraph boy he read the account which was quite correctly written with a mixture of emotions among which gratification predominated but where did they get my picture he asked himself there was also a picture of the dynamite crank which was also tolerably accurate i must take this home to mother said mark folding up the paper wont she be surprised about the same time solon talbot and edgar were in the grand central depot on fortysecond street their visit was over and mr talbot had purchased the return tickets you may buy a couple of evening papers edgar said his father one of them selected was the evening globe edgar uttered an exclamation as he opened it whats the matter edgar asked his father just look at this heres mark masons picture in the paper what nonsense you talk said solon talbot no i dont here is the picture and here is his name said edgar triumphantly solon talbot read the account in silence i see said another syracuse man coming up you are reading the account of the daring attempt to blow up banker rockwells office yes answered solon that was a brave telegraph boy who seized the bag of dynamite very true said solon unable to resist the temptation to shine by the help of the nephew whom he had hitherto despised that boy is my own nephew you dont say so yes his mother is the sister of my wife but how does he happen to be a telegraph boy a whim of his he is a very independent boy and he insisted on entering the messenger service be that as it may you have reason to be proud of him edgar said nothing but he wished that just for this once he could change places with his poor cousin id have done the same if id had the chance he said to himself chapter vii the great mr bunsby so you have become quite a hero mark said his mother smiling as mark entered the house at halfpast six have you heard of it then mother asked the messenger boy yes a little bird came and told me i suppose you saw the evening globe yes i sent edith out to buy a copy but how did you know it contained anything about me because a reporter came to me for your picture that explains it i couldnt understand how they got that it makes me shudder mark when i think of the risk you ran how did you dare to go near that terrible man i knew something must be done or we should all lose our lives no one seemed to think what to do except myself you ought to have been handsomely paid the least mr rockwell could do was to give you five dollars he gave me ten and told me to call at the office next week then said his mother relieved we shall be able to pay the rent that was provided for already the young lady i escorted to the theater last evening gave me three dollars over the regular charges for my services why didnt you tell me before mark i ought to have done so but i wanted it to be an agreeable surprise so you see i have thirteen dollars on hand it is a blessed relief oh i mustnt forget to tell you that mrs mack came in this morning to offer to lend me three dollars what has the old woman become kindhearted all at once as to that i think there is very little kindness in offering three dollars at thirtythree per cent interest for three days she was willing to lend three dollars but demanded four dollars in return it is lucky we shall not have to pay such enormous interest now mother what have you got for supper some tea and toast mark we must have something better i will go out and buy a sirloin steak and some potatoes we will have a good supper for once at the entrance to the street mark found tom trotter toms honest face lighted up with pleasure i see youve got into de papers mark he said yes tom i wouldnt believe it when jim sheehan told me but i went and bought de evening globe and there you was i hope youll get into the papers some time tom there aint no chance for me cept i rob a bank where you goin mark to buy some steak for supper have you eaten supper yet no then come along with me and ill invite you to join us i dont look fit mark never mind about your clothes tom we dont generally put on dress suits a little soap and water will make you all right whatll your mudder say that any friend of mine is welcome so tom allowed himself to be persuaded and had no reason to complain of his reception the steak emitted appetizing odors as it was being broiled and when at length supper was ready no one enjoyed it more than tom how do you think my mother can cook tom asked mark she beats beefsteak john all hollow i just wish shed open a eaten house ill think about it tom said mrs mason smiling would you be one of my regular customers i would if i had money enough it is hard to say which enjoyed the supper most the day before mrs mason had been anxious and apprehensive but today with a surplus fund of thirteen dollars she felt in high spirits this may seem a small sum to many of our readers but to the frugal little household it meant nearly two weeks comfort the table was cleared and mark and tom sat down to a game of checkers they had just finished the first game when steps were heard on the stairs and directly there was a knock at the door go to the door mark said his mother mark opened the door and found himself in the presence of a stout man rather showily dressed and wearing a white hat is this mark mason asked the visitor yes sir the visitor took out a copy of the evening globe and compared mark with the picture yes i see you are he proceeded you are the telegraph boy that disarmed the dynamite crank in mr rockwells office yes sir allow me to say young man i wouldnt have been in your shoes at that moment for ten thousand dollars i wouldnt want to go through it again myself smiled mark all the while he was wondering why the stout man should have taken the trouble to come and see him perhaps youll know me when i tell you that im bunsby said the stout visitor drawing himself up and inflating his chest with an air of importance of bunsbys dime museum asked mark exactly youve hit it the first time most people have heard of me he added complacently oh yes sir ive heard of you often so have you tom yes answered tom fixing his eyes on mr bunsby with awestruck deference ive been to de museum often mr bunsby said mark gravely this is my particular friend tom trotter glad to make your acquaintance mr trotter said mr bunsby offering his hand tom took it shyly and felt that it was indeed a proud moment for him to be called mr trotter by the great bunsby and to have his hand shaken into the bargain put him on a pinnacle of greatness which he had never hoped to reach wont you walk in mr bunsby this is my mother mrs mason and this is my sister edith glad to meet you ladies both i congratulate you mrs mason on having so distinguished a son he is a good boy mr bunsby whether he is distinguished or not i have no doubt of it in fact i am sure of it you already know that i keep a dime museum where if i do say it myself may be found an unrivaled collection of curiosities gathered from the four quarters of the globe and where may be witnessed the most refined and recherchй entertainments which delight daily the йlite of new york and the surrounding cities yes sir assented mrs mason rather puzzled to guess what all this had to do with her i have come here to offer your son an engagement of four weeks at twentyfive dollars a week and the privilege of selling his photographs with all the profits it may bring but what am i to do asked mark merely to sit on the platform with the other curiosities but i am not a curiosity i beg your pardon my dear boy but everybody will want to see the heroic boy who foiled a dynamite fiend and saved the life of a banker somehow this proposal was very repugnant to mark thank you mr bunsby he said but i should not like to earn money in that way i might say thirty dollars a week continued mr bunsby come let us strike up a bargain it isnt the money twentyfive dollars a week is more than i could earn in any other way but i shouldnt like to have people staring at me my dear boy you are not practical i quite agree with mark said mrs mason i would not wish him to become a public spectacle chapter viii a scene in mrs macks room fifteen minutes before a stout illdressed man of perhaps forty years of age knocked at the door of mrs macks room come in called the old lady in quavering accents the visitor opened the door and entered who are you asked the old lady in alarm dont you know me aunt jane replied the intruder im jack minton your nephew i dont want to see you go away cried mrs mack thats a pretty way to receive your own sisters son whom you havent seen for five years i havent seen you because youve been in jail retorted his aunt in a shrill voice yes i was took for another man said jack he stole and laid it off on to me i dont care how it was but i dont want to see you go away look here aunt jane youre treating me awful mean im your own orphan nephew and you ought to make much of me an orphan yes you hurried your poor mother to the grave by your bad conduct said mrs mack with some emotion you wont find me so soft as she was soft no youre as hard as flint but all the same youre my aunt and youre rich while i havent a dollar to bless myself with rich me rich repeated the old lady shrilly you see how i live does it look as if i was rich oh you cant humbug me that way you could live better if you wanted to im poor miserably poor returned the old woman id like to be as poor as you are said jack minton grimly youre a miser thats all there is about it you half starve yourself and live without fire when you might be comfortable and all to save money youre a fool do you know where all your money will go when youre dead there wont be any left wont there ill take the risk of that for i shall be your heir itll all go to me said jack chuckling go away go away cried the terrified old woman wildly i want to have a little talk with you first aunt said jack drawing the only other chair in the room in front of mrs mack and sitting down on it youre my only relation and we ought to have an understanding why you cant live more than a year or two at your age what do you mean said mrs mack angrily im good for ten years im only seventyseven youre living on borrowed time aunt jane you know that yourself youve lived seven years beyond the regular term and you cant live much longer go away go away said the terrified old woman really alarmed at her nephews prediction i dont want to have anything to do with you dont forget that im your heir i can leave my money as i please not that ive got much to leave you mean youll make a will well go ahead and do it there was a man i know made a will and he died the next day this shot struck home for the old woman really had a superstitious dread of making a will youre a terrible man she moaned you scare me come aunt be reasonable you can leave part of your money away from me if you like but i want you to help me now im hard up do you see this nickel and he drew one from his vest pocket yes well its all the money ive got why i havent eaten anything today and i have no money to pay for a bed i i havent any supper for you i dont want any here i wouldnt care to board with you aunt jane why i should soon become a bag of bones like yourself i dont believe youve got five cents worth of provisions in the room theres half a loaf of bread in the closet let me take a look at it he strode to the closet and opened the door on a shelf he saw half a loaf of bread dry and stale he took it in his hand laughing why that bread is three days old he said wheres your butter i i dont eat butter its too high and you dont care to live high said jack laughing at his own joke i dont care to rob you of this bread aunt jane its too rich for my blood dont you ever eat anything else sometimes she answered hesitating id rather take my supper at the cheapest restaurant on the bowery what i want is money mrs mack uttered a little cry of alarm oh dont go into a fit aunt i only want a little just to get along till i can find work give me twentyfive dollars and i wont come near you again for a month i swear it twentyfive dollars ejaculated mrs mack in dismay do you think i am made of money i dont take you for an astor or a vanderbilt aunt jane but youve got a tidy lot of money somewhere that i am sure of i shouldnt wonder if you had five thousand dollars now where do you keep it have you taken leave of your senses asked the old woman sharply no i havent but it looks to me as if you had but i cant waste my time here all night im your only relative and its your duty to help me will you let me have twentyfive dollars or not no i wont answered mrs mack angrily then ill take the liberty of helping myself if i can find where you keep your hoards jack minton jumped up from his chair and went at once to a cheap bureau which however was probably the most valuable article in the room and pulling out the top drawer began to rummage about among the contents then it was that mrs mack uttered the piercing shriek referred to at the end of the last chapter and her nephew tramping across the floor seized her roughly by the shoulder what do you mean by this noise you old fool he demanded roughly help murder thieves screamed the old woman then the door opened and mark mason burst into the room followed by tom trotter whats the matter mrs mack asked mark this man is going to rob me answered the old woman oh save me its a lie said jack minton just ask this woman who i am she knows who is he mrs mack it is my nephew jack minton he do you hear that im her nephew come in to make her a call after a long time what are you doing to her demanded mark suspiciously trying to stop her infernal racket youd think i was murdering her by the way she goes on what made you scream mrs mack because he he was going to rob me how is that demanded mark sternly none of your business kid you aint no call to interfere between me and my aunt i have if she asks me to he was at my bureau drawers he told me i must give him twentyfive dollars supposing i did its the least you can do for your own nephew that hasnt a cent to bless himself with oh take him away mark hell rob me first and murder me afterwards and im his mothers only sister you see she admits it shes rolling in money oh exclaimed mrs mack throwing up her hands you know im poor mark mason no i dont mrs mack i think youve got all the money you need but you have a right to keep it if you want to mr minton you had better leave the room your aunt is evidently afraid of you and old as she is your staying here may make her sick it aint much use living the way she is aunt jane i ask you again will you lend me twentyfive dollars no no will you lend me five dollars no are you going to turn your own nephew out into the street without a cent to buy food or pay for a bed he glowered at his aunt so fiercely as he said this that mark was afraid he might strangle her mrs mack he said you had better give him something if he is in so much need since he is really your nephew you might give him a dollar on condition that he wont trouble you again after long persuasion the old woman was induced to do this though she declared that it would leave her destitute and send her to the poorhouse now mr minton said mark i advise you not to come here again or i may have to call in a policeman ive a great mind to throw you downstairs growled jack youd have to throw me too put in tom trotter id do it with pleasure jack left the room and steered his way to the nearest saloon while mark and tom returned to the room beneath chapter ix an adventure in a fifth avenue stage mark did not fail to call at mr rockwells office during the following week nichols the clerk who had already shown a friendly interest in him received him kindly mr rockwell is still confined at his house he said the affair of last week was a great shock to him and not being a strong man he is quite prostrated i am sorry to hear it said mark in a tone of sympathy but i am not surprised that is what i read in the papers still as i was asked to call at the office i have done so i am glad to see you i hope you are getting along well oh yes fairly well how do you like being a telegraph messenger it will do very well for a boy but it leads to nothing i wish i could get into some position where i would be promoted that will come after a while if you show yourself faithful and reliable the next day mark had a surprise walking past the metropolitan hotel not far from houston street he saw a boy just leaving the hotel whose face and figure were familiar edgar talbot he exclaimed in surprise oh its you is it said edgar turning at the call yes how do you happen to visit new york again so soon we are going to move to new york answered edgar father feels that syracuse is too small a place for a man of his business ability he added in a consequential tone are you going to live at the hotel no we shall live in a nice flat up town near the park this was news indeed mark felt no interest in any of the family except in mrs talbot his mothers sister who alone of all displayed a friendly regard for her poor relatives mother will be glad to hear of it he said why because your mother is her only sister and she will like to call on her look here said edgar i hope you dont expect to be on visiting terms at our house why not you are my own cousin arent you yes i suppose so answered edgar making the admission grudgingly but of course there is a great difference in our social positions you mean that you are rich and we are poor yes thats about the size of it i dont care a particle about seeing you but my mother will be glad to see her sister oh well mother can call at your tenement house now and then but it would be better that none of you should call on us why because we wouldnt like to let the servants know that we have such poor relations do you say this on your own account or did your father tell you this said mark indignantly i know that is the way he feels i dont believe aunt mary feels so just then a boy approached whom edgar seemed to know good morning he said hurriedly i have an engagement mark felt that he was dismissed and kept on his way he hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry that his uncles family was coming to new york he did not care for edgars companionship nor did he expect to get any of it but he knew that his mother would like to meet her sister occasionally about the middle of the afternoon he found himself riding in a fifth avenue stage the stage was tolerably full directly opposite mark sat an old lady richly dressed whose means were evidently large next to her sat a flashily dressed young man on whose bosom glittered what might be a valuable diamond stud conspicuous for its size he had a diamond ring on his finger and might easily be mistaken for a bankers son all at once mark noticed some suspicious movements which led him to think that the young man might be quite different from what he appeared a moment later he saw the young mans hand dive into the old ladys side pocket directly afterwards he rose and pulled the strap for the stage to stop mark realized that a robbery had taken place he rose and placed himself between the young man and the door madam he said to the old lady i think you have been robbed feel in your pockets and see the old lady startled followed marks advice my pocketbook is gone she said nervously out of the way boy cried the young man i have to get out here not yet answered mark firmly give back the ladys pocketbook why you insolent young rascal what do you mean i mean just what i say you have insulted me and i will horsewhip you exclaimed the rogue in assumed virtuous indignation he seized mark by the shoulder and was about to thrust him forcibly aside when a stout thickset man rose and ranged himself by marks side young man he said give back the pocketbook as the boy tells you i have no pocketbook as he spoke he dexterously dropped it to the floor of the stage heres your pocketbook maam said a nurse girl picking it up thank you responded the old lady relieved what did i tell you exclaimed the dude triumphantly boy youre too fresh i am a young man of high family it is most ridiculous to charge me with stealing i saw you with your hand in the ladys pocket said mark calmly its a lie but i ought not to be surprised i know you now you were sent to the island last summer for stealing i remember seeing you on trial at jefferson market police court suspicious glances were directed at mark for most people are inclined to believe evil of their neighbors but the stout man only laughed that is too thin my friend he said of course your motive in bringing a charge against this boy is plain let me out sir stormed the crook madam do you wish to bring a charge against this man no let him go ive got my pocketbook back and thats all i want the stout man turned aside and the adventurer sprang out of the stage and dashed down thirtyninth street in the direction of third avenue im very much obliged to you boy said the old lady did you really see that young man take my pocketbook i saw him with his hand in your pocket im so sorry he seemed so nicely dressed too i thought he belonged to a rich family the stout man laughed my dear madam he said the young men connected with our best families dont dress as flashily as your late companion he is probably a professional pickpocket did you have much money with you over a hundred dollars i was going down town to pay a bill then you ought to be much obliged to this boy for detecting the thief i am said the old lady earnestly here take this she continued and she drew a fivedollar bill from her pocketbook mark hung back no thank you he said i dont want any pay for that give me your name and address then mark had a business card in his pocket and wrote his name and address upon it give me your name and address too said the gentleman who had proved so valuable an ally i may need your services some time i dont think i have another card sir then take one of mine mark glanced at the card offered him henry swan watches diamonds jewelry no ѕ broadway were that young mans diamonds bought at your store asked mark smiling they were only paste they might deceive a novice but i saw through them at once but i must bid you good morning i have to make a call at the fifth avenue hotel a few blocks farther on the old lady got out mark assisted her to the street youre a very polite boy she said youve done me a great favor you had better take the five dollars i offered you no thank you madam i will wait till i have a chance to do you another service he did not resume his seat in the stage having an errand on eighteenth street as he was passing lord taylors store he heard his name called turning in some surprise he saw maud gilbert the young lady he had escorted to dalys theater leaving the store how do you do mark she said extending her hand with a smile very well thank you miss gilbert didnt i see your picture in the evening globe a short time since yes i believe so answered mark blushing in connection with mr rockwell the banker yes you have become quite a hero i concluded it was you and i felt quite proud to think i knew you did i tell you that i had a brother about your age no miss gilbert i have and he is home on a vacation from exeter academy if you have no engagement on thursday evening call and i will introduce you i shall be delighted to do so miss maud suggested the young lady smiling miss maud thank you for the invitation i will come chapter x an important commission no called the superintendent mark mason came forward to receive his commission he had been sitting on a bench with several other telegraph boys awaiting a call do you know henry swan jeweler asked the superintendent referring to a paper in his hand yes sir that is i met him lately in a fifth avenue stage he has sent for a telegraph boy no preferred mark smiled with pleasure i am glad he remembers me he said you may go there at once mark put on his cap and went to the jewelers store as he entered mr swan who was crossing from one side of the store to the other recognized him you see i havent forgotten you he said i am glad of that sir the boy in my employ has sent word that he is sick it is necessary for me to supply his place in my business fidelity and sharpness are requisite i knew that you possess these traits and as i dont want to experiment with a new boy of whom i know nothing i sent for you i will try to meet your wishes sir to begin with have you another suit i dont want you to wear the uniform of a telegraph boy while you are in my employ yes sir shall i go home and get it on the whole no i will give you an order on a clothier in fulton street for a new suit you are very kind mr swan said mark in astonishment i have done nothing to deserve such kindness not yet answered the jeweler pleasantly but perhaps you may soon take this note to knight brothers and you will have no trouble this was the note knight brothers fulton street fit out this boy with a nice suit and send the bill to me henry swan mark lost no time in visiting the clothiers what can i do for you young man asked the salesman this note will explain said mark the salesman opened and read it it will be all right he said mr swan gets his clothes here but he has them made to order do you want one made to order or ready made ready made i want to put it on today come upstairs then in twenty minutes mark left the store attired in a nice eighteen dollar suit he would have selected a cheaper one but the salesman overruled him mr swan never buys a cheap suit or inferior article he said in the letter he wishes you to have a nice suit and we must follow directions i dont want to abuse his generosity you wont he is a very liberal man he is teacher of a class of five poor boys in a mission sundayschool last christmas he sent them all in here for new suits if that is the case said mark i shall feel easier when he reappeared at the jewelers mr swan regarded him with critical approval you have made a good selection he said i hope i didnt go too high for the suit mr swan i wanted to order a cheaper one but the salesman wouldnt let me the salesman was right said the jeweler smiling i am satisfied and now to your work i have a request from a lady up town to send her a couple of diamond rings to select from she professed to be on her way from brooklyn and to be in haste she is she says staying at the house of a friend at no west fortyseventh between seventh and eighth avenues she is to go away tomorrow and would like to make choice of a ring today mark was rather surprised to hear this full account from the jeweler as he was only to take the part of an errand boy he didnt see the necessity for it he was soon enlightened now proceeded the jeweler i am of the opinion that this lady is a clever swindler i believe she wants to get hold of the rings and carry them off without paying for them then you wont send them to her i suppose i would not if i were absolutely sure that she is a fraud but this i dont know she may be a bona fide customer and if so i should like to sell her a ring how can you find out sir i hope to do so with your help chapter xi mr hamilton schuyler is astonished the jeweler took from his case two diamond rings they were large brilliant and showy how do you like the appearance of these rings he asked they are beautiful exclaimed mark admiringly dont you think the lady would admire them i should think so sir what should you think they are worth a hundred dollars apiece guessed mark if the diamonds were genuine one would be worth three hundred and fifty dollars and the other four hundred are they not genuine asked mark in surprise paste my boy paste the gold however is real instead of being worth the sum mentioned one is worth perhaps three dollars and a half the other four dollars but i shouldnt think it would be worth your while to keep false diamond rings nor would it if all persons were honest i never sell them i only sell genuine jewelry i will let you understand the use i mean to make of them these two rings i mean to have you carry to mrs montgomery on fortyseventh street but suppose she takes them for genuine then i will make them so in other words i will take out the paste diamonds and replace them with real stones if on the other hand any fraud is intended it wont benefit her much very well sir i think i understand you must to a certain extent exercise your own discretion i judged from the observations i made the other afternoon that you are a boy who possesses that important quality thank you for the compliment i will tell you what made me suspect the woman of whom i have spoken first the name she calls herself mrs philip montgomery it sounds like a fictitious name again she is a stout rather commonlooking woman with a florid complexion and larger features now montgomery is an aristocratic name again she says she is from buffalo swindlers generally hail from some distant city then again it is rather suspicious that she should be in such haste the purchase is an important one and the amount to be paid she herself fixed the approximate value is considerable you would think she would wish to inspect my stock carefully before making a selection instead of this she only asked to have two rings sent up to her of the value of three or four hundred dollars and she would make choice of one of them it does look rather suspicious sir mr swan gave mark some further directions and the latter started up town on the eighth avenue horse cars which he took on the lower side of the astor house this is new business to me thought mark i feel an interest to see this mrs montgomery if she is planning to entrap me she wont make as much as she anticipates mark had the rings each in a little morocco case carefully laid away in the inside pocket of his coat when they reached canal street to marks surprise his cousin edgar entered the car he did not recognize mark at first the latter no longer wearing the messengers uniform how do you do cousin edgar said mark edgar turned sharply around oh its you is it he said please dont call me cousin i am just as much ashamed of the relationship as you are responded mark with a comical smile that is impertinent besides it isnt true have you been discharged from the telegraph service no what makes you think so because you are not wearing the uniform i am working for a party that doesnt want me to wear it while in his service who is it i dont feel at liberty to tell oh just as you like isnt that a new suit yes where did you get it i bought it business seems to be pretty good with you how much did it cost eighteen dollars is it paid for of course it is i didnt know but you might have bought it in installments i dont have to do that yet you pretended a little while since that you and your mother had hard work to get along business is looking up edgar got out at twentythird street mark kept on till he reached fortyseventh street he walked toward seventh avenue and finally stood in front of the house in which the customer for the diamond rings was staying it was a plain threestory residence with nothing peculiar about it mark rang the bell little suspecting what was in store for him a boy of about seventeen shabbily dressed answered the bell is mrs montgomery at home asked mark referring to a card i guess so answered the boy i should like to see her all right ill go up and ask the boy left mark standing in the doorway and went upstairs he returned in a very short time youre to come up he said mark followed him up the staircase and into a back room it was scantily furnished there was a lounge on one side of the room and a cabinet bed on the other these with three chairs and a bureau constituted the furniture just step in here said the boy and ill call mrs montgomery mark took a seat on the sofa and awaited the arrival of the lady he did not have long to wait the door opened but the lady he expected did not appear instead a young man entered whom mark instantly recognized as the person who had left the fifth avenue stage under suspicious circumstances on the day when the old lady was robbed of her pocketbook mark started and wondered if the recognition was mutual it did not appear to be youre the jewelers boy i believe said the newcomer languidly i came from henry swan exactly and you have brought two diamond rings with you yes all right you can show them to me marks suspicions were aroused and he felt that he had need of all his shrewdness he was very glad now that the diamonds were paste and the rings of little value excuse me he said but i was told to deliver the rings to mrs philip montgomery yes thats all right mrs montgomery is my aunt i should like to see her persisted mark come boy youre too fresh itll be all the same if you hand the rings to me i dont think so isnt mrs montgomery at home yes but she has a severe headache and cannot see you at present then perhaps i had better call again no you dont i am a gentleman and wont permit you to insult me what do you want to do to take the rings up to my aunt if she likes them or either of them she will send you down a check mark reflected a moment remembering that the rings were not valuable he decided to show them here are the rings he said producing them from his pocket the young man opened the small caskets and his eyes lighted up with satisfaction when he saw the glittering rings what is the price he asked looking up that ring is three hundred and fifty dollars the other is four hundred seven hundred and fifty together yes i will show them to my aunt perhaps she may decide to keep both you wont be long asked mark as the young man left the room no ill be back as soon as my aunt decides left alone mark began to think over the situation his recognition of his unprincipled acquaintance of the fifth avenue stage convinced him that some fraudulent scheme was being carried out mrs montgomery was probably a confederate of the young man who had just left the room is he going upstairs or down thought mark he listened and thought he heard the front door open and shut it occurred to him to open the door of the chamber and look downstairs he started to do this but to his surprise found that the door was fastened in some way he had not heard a key turned in the lock possibly there was an outside bolt what object can they have in keeping me a prisoner he asked should he ring the bell and summon a servant if he did so he would have to leave the house in a state of uncertainty no he decided to wait and let further events throw a light on the mystery meanwhile the young man who had possessed himself of the rings left the house for it was he who had descended the stairs and gone out into the street he bent his steps to the nearest pawnshop on eighth avenue and taking out one of the boxes said in a nonchalant voice what will you loan me on this magnificent diamond ring the pawnbroker took the box and drawing out the ring held it up in the best light he examined it through a magnifying glass and a gleam of intelligence flashed in his face he returned to the counter and scrutinizing the young man who had presented it asked in a matteroffact tone what do you want to borrow on the ring my friend two hundred dollars answered the customer promptly humph said the pawnbroker with an amused smile two hundred dollars is a large sum of money yes but the ring cost three hundred and fifty dollars i am asking a little more than half price so the ring cost three hundred and fifty dollars did you pay that price for it no the ring does not belong to me then to whom does it belong to my aunt mrs philip montgomery i do not know the lady does she live in the city no she lives in buffalo and she sent the ring to you yes she sent it to me she is in want of a little money and did not like to ask her husband for it for he might not be pleased so she wants to borrow money on this ring which was given her by her brother at the time of her marriage so so and your aunt would like me to lend her two hundred dollars on the ring yes sir i think you will have to carry it to some other pawnbroker my friend i dont mind taking a little less said the young man who was anxious for more than one reason to realize on the ring at once how much now do you call a little less well say a hundred and seventyfive dollars probably my aunt will be able to redeem it in a few weeks if i give you a hundred and seventyfive dollars laughed the pawnbroker i think your aunt will let me keep it for good as to that said the young man impatiently i can make no promises how much will you give on it i might give you a dollar and a half answered the pawnbroker composedly a dollar and a half exclaimed the young man clutching at the counter for support a dollar and a half on this magnificent diamond ring for which my aunt paid three hundred and fifty dollars what do you mean i mean not to be cheated my friend how much do you think this magnificent ring is worth i have told you what it cost my friend you are very much mistaken the ring cost only three dollars or three and a half what do you mean gasped the visitor turning pale i mean that it is not diamond but paste but it came from a jeweler of great reputation surely you have heard of mr henry swan yes i have heard of mr swan if you will bring him here and he will say that the diamond is real i will see if i cant give you more wait said the customer hurriedly drawing out the other casket look at this ring and tell me what it is worth the pawnbroker took it to the window and examined it attentively that may be worth four dollars he answered after a brief pause and is this stone false also yes my friend then i wont pawn either here give me back both rings here they are i am afraid you are not a good judge of diamonds i am sure they are real go somewhere else my friend and satisfy yourself if you can find any one in my line who will give you five dollars for either you had better take it and call yourself a fortunate man will you leave your name my name is hamilton schuyler and i live on second avenue it is a very good name my friend i think you must belong to the four hundred i do answered schuyler haughtily it is a pity you should have to pawn your aunts diamonds and such diamonds chuckled the pawnbroker but mr schuyler had already left the shop and was hurrying along the avenue to another of the same class at which he had occasionally had dealings chapter xii mr schuyler has a bad time i shall have to stay here till i am let out thought mark he didnt worry particularly as he knew that even if the rings were kept they would not involve his employer in any serious loss in about half an hour he heard steps ascending the stairs then he heard a bolt shoved back and he was not surprised when the young man whose name he did not know entered the room he noted not without amusement that his face betrayed dissatisfaction what does your aunt think of the rings asked mark ingenuously look here young fellow said schuyler sitting down and glaring at the messenger youve played a pretty trick on me what kind of a trick asked mark arching his eyebrows those rings are not diamond rings what are they then asked mark in assumed surprise paste bogus answered schuyler scornfully are you sure of that mr schuyler mr schuyler yes i took them round to a jeweler and had him test them it must be a mistake murmured mark it is a very strange mistake then for a firstclass house to make rejoined schuyler in a tone of sarcasm so it is they must have given me the wrong rings said mark innocently my aunt is very much disappointed she wanted to start this evening for buffalo i thought she lived in syracuse she is going to visit her son in buffalo explained schuyler with ready wit i am really sorry if she would go down to the jewelers with me or if you would the matter could be set right at once mr hamilton schuyler thought over this suggestion and on the whole regarded it favorably i will go down in about an hour he said you can explain matters to mr swan just think if my aunt had taken the rings and paid full price for them and not found out till she got to buffalo that they were not genuine in that case mr swan would have paid her the money or exchanged the rings i hope so perhaps you had better hand me back the caskets and i will carry them back to the store mr schuyler returned the boxes to mark who opened them to see if the rings were inside you will go down in an hour then he said yes or upon second thought you had better come right back with the genuine rings i have an appointment at the windsor hotel but will be back to receive them mark understood why schuyler did not care to go to the jewelers he could not get possession of the genuine rings without paying for them whereas if mark should bring them he could carry out his original plan and retain them by stratagem schuyler accompanied mark to the front door now hurry down and back he said my aunt is anxious to catch the evening train very well mr schuyler at this moment schuyler noted for the first time a familiar look in marks face havent i seen you before he asked abruptly very likely said mark with selfpossession perhaps you have been in the store no my aunt called there but i did not you look very much like some boy i saw recently and schuyler wrinkled up his forehead in the vain endeavor to place mark i hope i remind you of a goodlooking boy he said laughing i see it now you look like a telegraph boy i recently met in a fifth avenue stage i should like to see him but i shouldnt think youd remember a common telegraph boy he was impertinent to me that is why i remember him frowned schuyler i hope to meet him alone some time i will give him a lesson he wont be likely to forget then im glad im not the boy you mean good day good day hurry back as fast as you can when mark reentered the jewelry store mr swan advanced to meet him well he said how did you make out ive got the rings with me did you see mrs montgomery no but i saw a young man who claimed to be her nephew what did he say about the rings he left me alone in a back room on the second floor when i went to the door i found that it was locked but i didnt trouble myself i concluded that he had gone out to pawn or sell the rings he returned in half an hour quite angry and told me he had ascertained that the diamonds were not genuine why did you think he went out to pawn or sell them because i recognized him you recognized him yes as the young man in the fifth avenue stage who robbed an old lady of her wallet the day that we first met yes sir the jeweler looked surprised didnt he recognize you he asked if we hadnt met before he said there was something familiar in my face finally he said i reminded him of an impudent telegraph boy he had fallen in with he wants to meet that telegraph boy alone added mark with a smile he has had his wish yes but luckily for me he didnt recognize me how did you explain about the rings being false i said you had probably made a mistake i see you are quickwitted well was that satisfactory he expects me to bring back the genuine rings this afternoon as his aunt wants to leave the city this evening i think he will have to wait perhaps it may be as well to notify him that she neednt put off her journey on that account i dont want to spare you to go there again however theres a boy i know out on the street suggested mark he would be glad to go who is it tom trotter a friend of mine hes a good boy though hes only a bootblack is he reliable yes sir i will answer for him very well call him in mark went to the door and called tom tom trotter tom looked around and recognized mark you aint left de telegraph have you mark he said no but im working here for a day or two would you like to go up town on an errand yes answered tom with alacrity will i be paid of course cant you leave your blacking box somewhere and get your face and hands washed yes mark theres a small sloon near by where i hang out sometimes just wait for me and ill be back in a jiffy tom reappeared in a very short time with his appearance greatly improved by the application of cold water and soap mr swan said mark smiling this is mr thomas trotter the young gentleman i spoke to you about oh stow that mark expostulated tom i aint mr trotter im tom mr trotter said the jeweler smiling for he had a sense of humor i have a letter here which i wish you to take to the address named and to walk sir no i will give you ten cents for car fare and when you return and make your report you shall be paid for doing the errand all right governor tom started up town and in due time reached the house on fortyseventh street he rang the bell and the door was opened by the hall boy already referred to is mr schuyler at home asked tom ive got a letter for him mr schuyler who was anxiously awaiting marks return came out of a room to the left of the hall when he saw tom he looked disappointed i was expecting a boy from mr swans jewelry store thats where i come from did you bring the rings asked schuyler eagerly i dont know nothin about no rings answered tom ive brought you a letter give it to me quick he opened the letter and this is what he read with contracted brow mr hamilton schuyler when i called here this morning i recognized you as the young man who stole an old ladys pocketbook in a fifth avenue stage not long since of course i knew that this was another scheme of yours to get hold of money that did not belong to you if you had been all right i would myself have brought back the real diamond rings which your aunt wished to buy tell her not to put off her journey to buffalo as mr swan has made up his mind not to send them yours as ever a d t then it was the telegraph boy after all ejaculated schuyler in a rage i only wish i had known it are you a friend of the telegraph boy am i a friend of mark mason i should smile step in a minute then said schuyler with an assumed friendliness as the unsuspecting tom stepped inside the hall the young man began to shower blows on his shoulders with a cane that he snatched from the hat rack tom was for a minute dazed then his wits returned to him he lowered his head and butted schuyler in the stomach with such force that the latter fell over backwards with an ejaculation of pain then tom darted through the open door but paused on the steps to say with the compliments of tom trotter schuyler picked himself up uttering execrations and looked for the boy but he was gone illustration schuyler fell over backwards with a cry of pain page mark masons victory chapter xiii mark starts on a journey shall you want me tomorrow mr swan asked mark as the clock struck six and the jeweler prepared to close up yes i shall probably want you for a week very well sir i will so report at the office the next morning about eight oclock mark reported for duty and waited for orders the jeweler looked up from a letter he had been reading how would you like to make a journey he asked very much sir i shall probably send you to cleveland is cleveland in ohio asked mark his eyes sparkling yes do you think you can find your way there ill try you generally succeed in what you undertake to do well i will explain i have a customer living in euclid avenue in cleveland who used to be a new york society lady she bought a good deal of jewelry and always purchased of me this is what she writes the material part of the letter was this i want a diamond pin worth about one thousand dollars my husband has agreed to give it to me for a birthday present and left the selection to me i cant find anything here that i want and have been led to think of my old jeweler in new york you know my taste select what you think i will like and send me by private messenger i might of course employ an express but there have been some express robberies recently and i am ready to pay the extra expense required by a special messenger send at once arabella loring you see said the jeweler that this is an important matter the messenger will bear great responsibility on account of the value of what he has in charge do you think i am old enough for the commission mr swan said mark modestly it is not so much a matter of age as of shrewdness and reliability i have been led to think that you possess these qualifications of course there would be danger of your being robbed if it were known that you carried such a valuable parcel i am not afraid sir of course again you must take care not to let it be known what you have in charge make what statements you like as to your business i can safely leave that to your own shrewdness when do you want me to start mr swan there is a train this afternoon for buffalo on the new york central road can you get ready to take that yes sir may i go home and let my mother know i am not quite sure whether i have a supply of clean clothes you can buy anything that you need on the way have you a gripsack yes sir my mother has one will it do i think so so far so good then now about money i cant tell just how much you will need but i will give you a certain amount and if there is any over when you return you can account for it to me mrs mason was greatly surprised when mark came home and inquired for her traveling bag what do you want of it mark she asked i am going to start for cleveland this afternoon youre only funning mark said edith no i am not i have agreed to go to cleveland on business what kind of business mark asked his mother the gentleman who sends me mr swan the jeweler has asked me to keep my business secret how long will you be gone i cant tell but i will write you mr swan has told me i may stop over at niagara falls but i shall not be very apt to do so till i am on my return this seems very sudden i dont know how i shall ever get along without you you have money enough to last you mother yes then i think there wont be any trouble if i stay away longer than i anticipate i will send you some more it seems strange that mr swan should send a boy on an important errand the fact of the matter is mother that he has confidence in me i am sure he is justified in this but boys are not usually selected for important missions that is the reason why i feel ambitious to succeed by the way mark mrs macks nephew called yesterday and tried to get some more money out of his aunt did you give him any no she was very much frightened but i threatened to call a policeman and the fellow went off grumbling she wont be safe till he gets into prison again on his way back to the jewelers mark met his friend tom trotter where are you goin out west toms eyes expanded like saucers you aint jokin no when youre goin this afternoon goin to be gone long i expect to be back in a week i wish youd take me with you id like to tom but i cant traveling costs money tom showed considerable curiosity as to the nature of marks business but on this point the telegraph boy was not communicative he liked tom as a friend but did not dare to trust him with so important a secret mr swan had already been to a ticket agent and procured a through ticket for mark your train starts at fourthirty said the jeweler you can engage a sleeping berth at the grand central depot you will travel all night i am sorry for that said mark i shall miss some of the scenery you can arrange to travel over this part by day on your return it was four oclock when mark entered the depot he thought it best to be on time when the doors were opened he entered the station proper and sought the car containing his berth there was an upper and a lower berth his being the lower the two were numbered and he had scarcely taken his seat when a gentleman came in and sat down beside him neither he nor mark had noticed each other particularly till the train had left the depot then the gentleman exclaimed in surprise mark mason uncle solon exclaimed the messenger in equal surprise what brings you here a ticket answered mark briefly you are in the wrong car didnt you know that this is the limited western express yes i know it where are you going then i shall stop at buffalo answered mark not caring to mention his further destination solon talbot looked amazed what on earth carries you out there he asked this train answered mark demurely solon talbot frowned you know what i mean why are you going to buffalo a little matter of business what business can a boy like you possibly have id like to know it isnt my own business uncle solon and so i dont feel at liberty to tell it is very strange have you a sleeping berth yes what number no that is the lower berth just the one i wanted exclaimed talbot in vexation mine is the upper let me see your sleeping check mark showed it solon talbot regarded it enviously i will give you twentyfive cents to exchange he said i will exchange without the twentyfive cents if you prefer the lower berth i do but i would rather pay i cant accept it here is the check give me yours in return solon did so muttering his thanks rather ungraciously he hated to be under any obligation to his nephew where is edgar asked mark i left him in new york i am going back to syracuse to attend to a little business and shall then return to new york mr talbot took out an evening paper and began to read mark prepared to look around him presently mr talbot arose i am going into the smokingcar to smoke a cigar he said have an eye on my grip while i am gone all right uncle hours passed the two travelers retired to their respective berths about two oclock mark was startled by a severe shock that nearly threw him out of his berth there was a confused shouting and mark heard some one crying whats happened leaning out of the berth he saw solon talbot standing in the aisle his face pale as a sheet there was a swaying movement of the car and a sudden lurch the car had gone over an embankment chapter xiv the telltale memorandum when mark came to himself he realized that he was lying on his back on the ground it was a bright moonlight night and he could see for some distance first of all he moved his arms and legs to ascertain whether any of his limbs were broken reassured on this point he felt next for the diamond pin to his great relief it was safe all about him was confusion he was just thinking of getting up when a man came along with a lantern and stooping over began to feel in the pockets of a prostrate figure lying near by instantly mark was on the alert for he felt sure that this man must be a thief intent on robbing the victims of the disaster he peered into the face of the robber who fancied himself unobserved and with a thrill of excitement he recognized the man whom he had met twice before in new york and who had called himself hamilton schuyler at the same time glancing at the upturned face of the recumbent figure he saw that it was his uncle solon talbot still insensible schuyler had just drawn mr talbots watch from his pocket when mark putting a whistle to his mouth blew a sharp note on it schuyler started let the watch drop and rose in a state of nervous alarm what was that he cried mr hamilton schuyler said mark calmly that gentleman will have occasion for his watch you had better let it alone i was only going to take care of it for him muttered schuyler youd take care of it well retorted mark who are you demanded schuyler and he stepped over to where mark lay and peered into his face by jingo if it isnt the telegraph boy he exclaimed how came you here by the train have you any more bogus diamonds about you inquired schuyler sarcastically i might have had if i had expected to meet you ill see what i can find at any rate as he spoke he leaned over and was about to feel in marks pockets when the telegraph messenger blew another blast on his whistle so loud that a relief party came running up in haste whats the matter asked the leader the matter is that here is a thief rifling the pockets of the passengers he was just feeling in mine schuyler started to run but was quickly captured what are you about you scoundrel asked his captor trying to relieve the victims of the disaster answered schuyler on my honor that is all i was doing is this true asked his captor turning to mark yes he was trying to relieve us of our valuables he had that gentlemans watch out of his pocket when i first whistled as you came up he was trying to rob me thats enough take him along two strong men tied schuylers hands together and marched him away ill get even with you for this you young rascal he exclaimed in a rage shaking his fist at mark just then solon talbot recovered consciousness where am i he groaned there has been an accident uncle solon said mark now on his feet we went over an embankment and were spilled out are you all right are any of your limbs broken i i dont think so but i have had a shock and my head is bruised youll do said a surgeon who was one of the relief party youll be as good as new in a day or two is there a hotel near by i want to be moved as soon as we can attend to the matter we are looking for the bad cases ill look after you uncle solon said mark see if you cant get up with much ado mr talbot arose and leaning on marks arm left the scene of the disaster mark procured a carriage and directed the driver to take them to the nearest hotel when they reached it the messenger ordered a room and helped his uncle up to it just look and see if youve lost anything he suggested i saw a thief trying to relieve you of your watch but i interrupted him and gave him in charge with a look of alarm solon talbot examined his pockets but ascertained to his relief that nothing was missing cant you stay with me mark he asked almost imploringly for the nervous alarm inspired by the accident had made him quite a different man for the time being there is another bed in the room and you can lie there i will stay with you till morning uncle solon but i shall have to leave you then as i have business to attend to what kind of business i dont care to mention it just now i am traveling for another party i had no idea there would be an accident said mr talbot good heavens we might have been in eternity by this time he added with a shudder i feel very much alive said mark laughing i suppose the accident will be in the new york morning papers so it will i must telegraph that i am all right or my mother will be frightened telegraph for me too said solon talbot all right tell me to whom to telegraph uncle solon and where to edgar i think few more words were spoken as mark and his uncle were both dead tired it was eight oclock when mark opened his eyes he dressed himself as quickly as possible and prepared to go downstairs as he was moving toward the door mark espied a scrap of paper it contained what appeared to be a memorandum in his uncles handwriting it was brief and a single glance revealed its purpose to mark it ran thus crane and lawton told me today that their agent writes them from nevada that the golden hope mine is developing great richness i shouldnt wonder if it would run up to one hundred dollars per share at this rate the shares i hold will make a small fortune c l advise holding on for at least six months it may be imagined that mark read this memorandum with interest he knew very well that the mining stock referred to belonged to his grandfathers estate but hitherto had been ignorant of the number of shares held by the same if there were four hundred and the price ran up to one hundred dollars per share this would make his mothers share twenty thousand dollars this would be a fortune indeed and it made his blood boil to think that his uncle proposed to cheat her out of it the munificent sum of twentyfive dollars was all that he had offered for a receipt in full that would give him a title to the whole value of the golden hope shares mark turned to the bed his uncle was fast asleep he was not a strong man and the shock and fatigue of the night previous had quite exhausted him what shall i do with the memorandum thought mark he felt that it was not quite the thing to keep a private paper belonging to his uncle yet under the circumstances considering that his uncle was deliberately seeking to defraud his mother and himself he decided that he was justified in doing so accordingly he put the memorandum carefully in his pocketbook and opening the chamber door prepared to go downstairs just then solon talbot opened his eyes where am i he asked in temporary bewilderment in the merchants hotel replied mark dont you remember the accident of last night oh yes answered solon shuddering where are you going out to telegraph to my mother you have my telegram yes mark went out and despatched two telegrams one to his mother and the second to mr swan the latter ran thus there has been a railroad accident but i am all right nothing lost the last two words were intended to assure the jeweler of the safety of the diamond pin mark ascertained that the next train westward would start at eleven oclock and so reported to his uncle i shall go by the next train he said as they went up to the office to pay their bills the clerk asked mr talbot do you pay for this young man as well as yourself solon talbot hesitated and looked confused no answered mark promptly i pay for myself he drew out a tendollar bill and tendered it to the clerk you seem to be well provided with money said his uncle curiously yes uncle solon i can pay my way replied mark it is very strange thought mr talbot how a common telegraph boy should have so much money he did not seem to miss the memorandum had he known that it was snugly reposing in marks pocketbook he would have felt disturbed chapter xv a railroad incident mark pushed on intent upon reaching cleveland he decided not to stop off at niagara till he was on his return he never for a moment forgot that a great responsibility rested upon him for the safe delivery of the valuable diamond pin intrusted to him by mr swan when it was safely out of his hands and in those of mrs loring he would feel relieved he was within a hundred miles of cleveland in a car well filled with passengers when his attention was called to a young lady sitting in the seat directly opposite him she seemed lively and was particularly attractive mark was too young to be deeply impressed by female beauty but he experienced like most persons a greater pleasure in looking at a beautiful than at an ugly object the young lady had been sitting alone when a tall man of about forty came up the aisle and paused by her seat is this seat occupied he asked softly no sir then i will presume to occupy it he must be a minister thought mark his clothes were of clerical cut he wore a white necktie and on his head was a brown straw hat with wide brim he folded his hands meekly on his knees and turned towards his young companion i am sorry to intrude upon you young lady mark heard him say it is no intrusion sir answered the girl pleasantly i have only paid for one seat and cannot expect to monopolize two nevertheless i am sorry if in any way i have intruded upon you i am as you may perhaps have inferred from my appearance a minister i thought you looked like one sir i am going to make an exchange with a clerical brother yes sir returned the young lady wondering what interest she could be expected to take in this circumstance i always like to get acquainted with young people i may perhaps have an opportunity of influencing them for good just so sir but i think such advice is better suited for sunday dont you i am accustomed to drop words of counsel in season and out of season i would rather listen to them when they are in season true i stand reproved the minister took from his pocket a small volume which he opened and began to read this volume he said contains the sermons of the excellent dr hooker if i had another copy i should be glad to offer it to you thank you i dont care to read just at present half an hour passed the minister put back his book into his pocket and bowing politely bade the young lady good morning i am pleased to have made your acquaintance he said thank you sir five minutes later the young lady put her hand into her pocket she uttered a cry of alarm what is the matter miss asked mark my purse is gone exclaimed the young lady in a state of nervous excitement when did you last see it asked the messenger boy about an hour ago i bought a copy of munseys magazine of the train boy and took out my purse to pay for it an hour ago you were sitting alone at the time yes did any one sit beside you except the old gentleman who has just left no you are sure it hasnt fallen on the floor i will look the young lady rose and looked about under the seat but the lost purse was not found i i dont see how i could have lost it i have been sitting here all the time an idea flashed upon mark it must have been taken by the man who just left you he said but that cant be he was a minister i know he was dressed as a minister but i dont believe he was one he looked just like one besides he was reading a volume of sermons i cant believe that he would rob me there was one thing that didnt look very ministerial what was that his nose do you not notice how red it was yes but i thought it might be some humor it was colored by whisky i think i know topers in new york who have noses exactly like his you may depend upon it that he has your purse i hope there wasnt much in it only about five dollars generally the loss would not inconvenience me but as it is and she looked anxious if if i can be of any service stammered mark i hope you wont mind saying so i can lend you five dollars the young lady looked grateful but seemed in doubt as to whether she ought to accept the offer i dont know whether i ought to accept such an offer from a young gentleman she said hesitating i am a very young gentleman said mark smiling i am only sixteen that is true and it does make a difference are you sure you can spare the money for a day or two quite so miss loring prompted the young lady are you related to mrs arabella loring of cleveland the young lady looked very much surprised she is my mother she replied but how in the world do you know of her i will tell you later answered mark he felt that it wouldnt be wise to mention the commission or let any one know that he had a diamond ring in charge are you going directly to cleveland miss loring yes but about thirty miles this side i have a young niece at a boarding school she will join me on the train and will expect me to pay her railroad fare but for that the loss of the money would have entailed no inconvenience mark drew from his pocket book a fivedollar bill and passed it to miss loring but how can i return this to you she asked i will call at your house i am going to cleveland also do so here is my card she took out a small card and tendered it to mark on it was inscribed miss florence loring no ѕ euclid avenue inquire for me when you call she said thank you it seems so strange that you should know my mother she continued evidently feeling curious mark smiled you will know in time he said if we were alone i would tell you now here there was a stop at some station and a shabby and dirtylooking man entered the car there was but one seat vacant the one next to florence loring mark hastily rose and sat down in it i thought he said apologetically you might prefer me to the man who has just entered the car by all means she answered with a bright smile i prefer you also to the clerical gentleman who rode with me earlier thank you when your niece joins you i will vacate the seat in her favor florence loring was perhaps nineteen three years older than mark she looked upon him quite as a boy and therefore felt under no constraint do you come from new york she asked yes you seem young to travel alone i dont think you can be much older than i said mark mercy i feel ever so much older i feel old enough to be your aunt i shouldnt mind having you for an aunt returned mark on the whole though it might prove to be too much of a responsibility you may be very hard to manage do you mind my calling you aunt well perhaps it might make me appear too venerable did you notice miss loring whether your clerical friend left the cars when he left the seat no i didnt feel any particular interest in him and did not give him a second thought perhaps he may still be on the train i have a great mind to go and see i dont think it would do any good we could not prove that he took my purse if you will excuse me for five minutes i will make a search mark went through the next car and entered the second one which was a smoking car he looked about him and in a seat about the middle of the car he saw the man of whom he was in search he recognized him by his white tie and his red nose he was smoking a cigar and gazing out of the car window the seat beside him being vacant mark went forward and sat down in it the gentleman with the white tie glanced at him carelessly but did not appear to think mark was worthy of attention he changed his mind when mark said in a low voice please give me the purse which you took from a young lady in the second car back chapter xvi mark as a detective the adventurer turned swiftly when he heard marks startling question he seemed astounded at the boys audacity what did you say he demanded with hauteur i asked you to return the purse which you took from a young lady in the second car back repeated mark calmly boy said the false minister you must be insane or drunk i dont think i am either returned mark what do you mean by such nonsense then are you aware that i am a minister of the gospel where do you preach it is of no consequence said the other loftily i am not in habit of being insulted by whippersnappers like you are you in the habit of taking young ladies purses mr rev mr buffington is my name young man then mr buffington will you answer my question i shall be tempted to forget my sacred profession and throw you out of the car said the pseudo minister looking very unclerical as he spoke i have no doubt you would like to do so you ought to be thrashed for your impertinence suppose you call the conductor and complain of me you may tell your story and i will tell mine this suggestion seemed fair enough but it did not appear to strike the rev mr buffington favorably i do not care to notice the foolish insolence of a half grown boy and the pseudo clergyman taking a paper from his lap half turned away from mark and began to read or appeared to do so mark however did not propose to be bluffed off in this manner mr buffington he said resolutely i am a boy but i know what i am about you took the young ladys purse before you sat down beside her she had it in her pocket when you left the car it was gone if i ever get you alone said buffington in a low tone of concentrated rage if you do i hope you wont forget your sacred profession i am a minister but i am also a gentleman and i shall resent an insult look here said mark getting out of patience either you give me back that purse for the young lady or i will call the conductor and lay the matter before him rev mr buffington tried to turn mark from his purpose by threats but he was evidently alarmed he was conscious of guilt and he knew how such an appeal would end for him mark saw him waver and followed up his advantage there was only about five dollars in the purse he said and it wont pay you to keep it if you give it up without further trouble i wont expose you what do you say mr buffington looked in marks resolute face and he saw that he was in serious earnest he felt that he was in the boys power and much as it galled him he decided that he must yield it is possible of course that the young lady in handling the purse may have dropped it into my pocket he said i will search for it and if that is the case it shall be returned he thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out the purse i wouldnt have believed it he murmured it is a most extraordinary incident is this the young ladys purse mark took it and opening it saw that it contained three dollars in bills and a dollar and seventyfive cents in silver yes sir he said this answers the description give it back to the young lady with my compliments said buffington with unabashed assurance express my regrets at the unfortunate mistake i now remember how it occurred i saw the purse on the floor where she had doubtless dropped it and supposing it to be my own put it into my pocket i was so busily engaged reading the volume of sermons which i carry with me that it made little impression on my mind i will tell her what you say mr buffington said mark gravely of course he might have expressed doubt of the accuracy of his companions statement but he had accomplished his purpose and did not care to humiliate buffington farther good morning young man said buffington with christian forgetfulness of marks errand good morning sir when mark had left the car buffingtons face underwent a change he looked absolutely ferocious to think i should have been trapped and worsted by a kid he said to himself the boy is about as cool and resolute as any i ever saw i hope i shall some day have a chance to get even with him mark returned to his own car and paused at miss lorings seat is this your purse he asked holding it up yes oh where did you get it from the party who took it is he on the smoking car still yes he is on the smoking car but didnt he object to surrendering it he made a decided objection but i succeeded in convincing him that it was for his interest to do so you are a remarkable boy said florence loring admiringly thank you miss loring you will make me vain if you flatter me but i am quite in earnest i am now able to return the money you so kindly lent me are you sure you will not need it quite sure the hours sped fast soon they reached the station where miss loring expected to see her niece she went to the door of the car and from the platform signaled to a child of eight who returned the greeting joyfully i was so afraid i should miss you auntie said the child i have been on the lookout for you gertie come in at once of course mark vacated his seat and aunt and niece were able to sit together the messenger boy secured a seat a little nearer the door he found the journey less interesting now that he was deprived of his fair companions company as they were leaving the train at the cleveland station florence said gertie this is mr mason who has been of great service to me during the journey gertie surveyed mark attentively she was an irrepressible young lady given to plain speaking he aint your beau is he aunt florence she asked florence smiled and blushed no she answered dont you see he is younger than i am he is better suited to be your beau ive got a beau already said the child unexpectedly indeed that is news whats his name dan sillis he is a nice boy how old is he about fifteen isnt that too old for you oh no husbands always are older than their wives both mark and florence laughed dont you think you could make room for another beau asked mark no but if i get tired of dan i wont mind taking you responded gertie with the most perfect gravity i will remember that if we should get married your aunt florence would be my aunt too can i do anything for you miss loring mark asked as they reached the exterior of the depot if you would be kind enough to call a cab mark did so and the two young ladies entered i suppose you will call if you have business with mother said florence yes i shall call tomorrow mark was in doubt where to go knowing nothing of the hotels in cleveland but seeing a stage bearing the name erie hotel decided to go there for obvious reasons i have not given the right name of the hotel this name will answer so far as our story goes he sprang in with his valise and in a few minutes was set down before a comfortable looking hotel of good size he entered and registering his name was assigned to room will you go upstairs at once mr mason asked the clerk yes sir mark followed the hall boy to a room on the third floor will dinner be ready soon he asked it is on the table now sir mark washed his hands and face combed his hair and went downstairs he had but one flight to descend the diningroom being on the second floor even if the dinner had been an indifferent one mark would have appreciated it for he was very hungry when he had satisfied his appetite he had a chance to look around what was his surprise when a little farther down the table on the same side he recognized his acquaintance of the smoking car mr buffington chapter xvii mark makes a call on euclid avenue mark was not altogether pleased to find that he had not got rid of the railroad adventurer he recognized him as a dangerous and unprincipled man as long as mark had the diamond pin in his possession the vicinity of such a fellow meant peril he decided that he had better lose no time in delivering the pin to mrs loring he had told florence that he would call the next day but really there was no reason why he should not deliver it at once about three oclock he called a cab and directed the driver to drive to no ѕ euclid avenue the distance was somewhat more than a mile and in fifteen minutes he found himself at his destination shall i wait for you asked the hackman no i may be in the house some time he paid for the cab and rang the doorbell is mrs loring at home asked mark of the servant who answered the bell yes sir but i dont know if she will see you tell her that i come from mr swan of new york she will see you said the servant returning after a short absence mark was ushered into the reception room and in a few minutes a pleasantlooking woman of middle age entered she seemed surprised when her glance rested upon mark surely you are not mr swans messenger she said yes madam and you have brought the pin here it is said mark producing it from his pocket mrs loring eagerly opened the casket and uttered an exclamation of delight it is beautiful just what i wanted she said mr swan said he thought he knew your taste did he mention the price a thousand dollars here is the bill i shall not dispute the price for i have perfect confidence in mr swan but isnt it strange that he should have selected so young a messenger she continued regarding mark with curiosity i agree with you said mark smiling but i feel confidence in mr swans judgment and did not object to come you might have been robbed if any evilminded person had known what you carried that is true but they would not be likely to think a boy would be intrusted with an article of great value that is certainly an important consideration how long have you been in mr swans employ about a week and he trusted you like this said the lady in astonishment i am really a telegraph boy mr swan had known me in that character he certainly paid you a great compliment and his confidence does not seem to have been misplaced shall i pay you for the pin you can give me a check payable to mr swan and i will forward it to him by mail i will do so can you wait oh yes mrs loring i had no business in cleveland except to deliver this ring at that moment florence loring entered the room and to her mothers surprise went up to mark and offered her hand i am glad to see you mr mason she said thank you miss florence is this call made on me partly answered mark smiling but i had some business with your mother how in the world did you two get acquainted asked mrs loring dont you remember mama what i told you about being robbed by a man who sat next to me and having my purse returned by a boy a young gentleman i dont mind being called a boy said mark i shall be one for some time yet well mr mason is the one who recovered my purse before that he kindly offered to loan me some money but what possible business can he have with you see what he has brought me from new york he comes from mr swan oh mama how lovely is it a present for me you know my birthday comes in eight months my dear child even if it came tomorrow i should hardly pay a thousand dollars for a birthday gift for you a thousand dollars it seems even more lovely now that i know the price remain here florence and entertain mr mason while i go to the library and write a check for the purchase money all right mama mr mason why didnt you tell me what business you had with mama i shouldnt have minded telling you but if some one else had heard your clerical friend for instance i might have been robbed that is true i hope i shall never see him again perhaps you may i have seen him you have seen him ejaculated florence in surprise where at the dinner table at my hotel do you think he is staying there i only know that i saw him at the table at what hotel are you staying at the erie hotel i hope you will be cautious he may do you an injury said florence with flattering earnestness it was because i saw him that i was anxious to deliver the pin as soon as possible but he wouldnt know you had it he would suppose i had some money for traveling expenses true and now you will have the large check my mother is to give you i shall not keep it in my possession i shall go back to the hotel at once and inclose it in a letter to mr swan you seem to be a remarkable boy i mean you are remarkably sharp for your age telegraph boys have to be sharp so you are a telegraph boy are there any telegraph girls not that i know of i am afraid we poor girls would be too easily imposed upon well have you entertained mr mason asked mrs loring reentering the room i have done my best mama what do you think he tells me that horrid man that stole my purse is staying at his hotel then i hope you wont send him an invitation to call here he would call fast enough suggested mark if he knew what a valuable diamond pin you have in the house then i hope he wont find out how did it happen florence you didnt watch him when he was sitting beside you how could you expect me to watch a man who was engaged in reading a volume of sermons they were the sermons of rev dr hooker perhaps that is where he learned hooking laughed mark thats a good joke said florence by the way mama have you tickets for the theater this evening yes but one wont be used louisa frost cant go then suppose you give it to mr mason i am sure he would enjoy the play well thought of florence wont you get one of the tickets you will find them on my bureau that is if our young friend has no other engagement i have none whatever said mark promptly you are very kind mrs loring you must thank florence if you were a few years older i should be afraid she had designs upon you it is leap year you know now mama what will mr mason think of me i am propriety personified mark concluded his call and left the house well pleased at having successfully carried out his instructions he went back directly to the hotel and sitting down in the reading room wrote the following letter to his employer henry swan esq dear sir i have delivered the diamond ring and inclose mrs lorings check for a thousand dollars in payment she is very much pleased with it and says it exactly suits her i have had a pleasant journey and expect to start on my return tomorrow yours respectfully mark mason as he was writing the address some one passed behind his chair and looked over his shoulder at the superscription it was the rev mr buffington as he called himself his eye lighted up as he saw to whom the letter was addressed so this boy is traveling for a new york jeweler he said to himself i am glad to know this he probably carries a stock of jewelry with him and if so i shall cultivate his acquaintance he passed out of the reading room without mark observing him mr buffington took care to keep out of the way and mark supposed he had left the hotel chapter xviii a midnight visit mark was confirmed in his belief that mr buffington had left the hotel because on looking over the book he found no such name it did not occur to him that lawrence perkins was his railroad friend under another alias mr buffington was rich in names and had masqueraded under at least a dozen he however had seen marks name in the register and noted carefully the number of his room the information seemed to him important especially after he had looked over marks shoulder and found that he represented a prominent jeweler in new york mark did not fail to keep his appointment at the theater he arrived first but five minutes later mrs loring florence and a young man cousin to the latter made their appearance florence smiled pleasantly and arranged the party so that mark should sit beside her now george she said to her cousin make yourself agreeable to mama and i will try to entertain mr mason no flirting florence cautioned her cousin did you ever know me to flirt asked florence in mock indignation well occasionally very well if i have the reputation i may as well deserve it and she proceeded to chat with mark in the gallery among the cheap seats sat mr buffington who wanted to while away the evening in a pleasant but economical manner he did not immediately discover mark below but after a time recognized him it is just as well i came here he reflected as the kid wont get to bed till late wonder who his friends are that young lady looks stylish buffington took good care when the play was over to keep out of the way of the throng issuing from the main entrance he made his way to the hotel by a devious course and on arriving went up to his room mark came in not long after him and went up to bed at once he felt quite tired but was well pleased with his experiences thus far he had got rid of his responsibility having delivered the diamond ring received pay therefor and forwarded the check to his principal in new york now i can have a comfortable nights rest he reflected he had nearly fifty dollars with him but this seemed a trifle compared with the diamond pin still he considered in what way he could secure this from chance of theft there seemed however to be very little danger he had locked the door inside leaving the key in the lock there was no door communicating with any other room after some consideration he decided to hide the wallet containing his money not under his pillow but under the sheet at the lower part of the bed where he could feel it with his feet i guess ill find it safe in the morning he said to himself now that he was relieved from all anxiety he composed himself to sleep and in less than ten minutes he was unconscious of all around him about an hour later mr buffington in bare feet stood in front of marks door through the open transom he could hear the boys peaceful breathing he is fast asleep he said to himself with satisfaction i know how boys sleep especially when they are tired i dont think there will be much risk in carrying out my scheme he had a skeleton key which would readily have opened the door had the key not been in the lock on the inside this fact he soon ascertained it will make it harder for me he reflected but there is the transom i shall have to make use of that mr buffington to use the name by which we first knew him had some experience as a gymnast he drew himself up to a level with the transom and then with considerable difficulty managed to get through the room was partially illuminated with moonlight first of all on descending on the other side he turned the key in the lock so as to afford himself a way of easy escape in case of need though he made some noise in landing mark was too sound asleep to be aware of it now where does the boy keep his valuables buffington asked himself he searched all marks pockets even to the vest but without finding anything next he turned his attention to the gripsack but that proved to contain only wearing apparel but mr buffington was sharp enough to understand the ways of wary travelers he went to the bed and gently slid his hand under the pillow that is the most common hidingplace for watches and other valuables but he made no discovery buffington paused to reflect on the situation the kid has certainly got a pocketbook he soliloquized he cant travel without money now where is it that is the question he had searched everywhere else he decided that it must be concealed somewhere about the bed finally he made a correct guess he approached the bed at the lower end and raising the covering began to feel about in the neighborhood of marks feet now as probably all my young readers know from personal experience the feet are very sensitive and there are few who are not ticklish mark who had been unconscious of the intruders presence till now speedily became aware that some one was fumbling about his feet on the impulse of the moment he drew one foot back and extended it suddenly in the act of kicking mr buffington withdrew his hand swiftly and looked anxiously at the sleeper marks eyes did not open and the burglar resolved after a suitable pause to continue his investigations but marks slumbers since the interruption were not as sound as before when the visitor continued his manipulations he woke suddenly and opening his eyes took in the situation he recognized mr buffingtons features and at once was wide awake but for the fact that the burglar was dangerously near the money he would have allowed him to keep on as it was he thought it time to interfere he gave a vigorous kick and called out whos there buffington understood that his scheme was defeated to rob mark when he was awake was to run too much risk he sprang for the door which he had unlocked as already noted and opening it dashed out into the corridor mark did not propose to facilitate his flight he sprang from the bed and called out in a loud tone help thieves now it so happened that the watchman attached to the hotel was just making his rounds and was not far off he ran to the spot caught sight of the flying figure of the departing burglar and caught him by the shoulder buffington was a strong man and could have got away from a man of ordinary muscles but the watchman was a man of more than average strength having served as porter before he had been transferred to the post of watchman and detective he gripped buffington in a viselike grasp no my man he said you dont get away so easy stand still and give an account of yourself i am a guest of the hotel said buffington sullenly then why are you not in bed because i had a severe headache and thought i would take a little walk in the corridor what made you come into my room demanded mark who now appeared on the scene i didnt know whose room it was i thought it was my own how did you get in the door was locked no it wasnt answered buffington boldly you thought you locked it but you didnt trying the knob it opened at once and i supposed it was my own which i had left unlocked is that true asked the watchman looking doubtfully at mark no it isnt i took special pains to lock the door for i knew that there was a possibility of my room being entered then he must have got through the transom we have had such cases before if you have finished asking foolish questions i will go back to bed said buffington with remarkable assurance wait a minute did you see this man in your room the question was addressed to mark yes i woke up while he was there what was he doing searching for my purse he was fumbling about the bedclothes at the foot of the bed was your money there yes buffingtons face contracted with disappointment he had been on the brink of success when mark unfortunately for him awoke and you spoke to him yes what then he sprang for the door and would have escaped if you had not caught him did you ever see the man before i saw him on the train coming here for the first time did anything happen on the train yes he stole a young ladys pocketbook i made him give it up buffington looked at mark menacingly he would have liked to wreak his vengeance upon him do you know his name he calls himself rev mr buffington the watchman laughed grimly sorry to disturb you reverend sir he said but i shall be obliged to lock you in your room till morning buffington shrugged his shoulders all right he said i shall at any rate secure a good nights sleep the watchman did as he suggested he shut the burglar in his room and locked the door from the outside now he said to mark you can sleep undisturbed for the balance of the night chapter xix at niagara falls although mark was inclined to pity any man deprived of his liberty he felt pleased to think that buffingtons career was cut short for a time there was little doubt that he would be imprisoned for a time more or less extended how much better it would be for him thought mark if he had earned his living in some honest way stealing may seem an easy way of obtaining money but the one who depends on it is likely to be brought up with a round term at last when mark went down in the morning the clerk said to him so you had a little excitement in your room last night the watchman tells me yes i had a visitor but fortunately he was caught without securing anything he was about to take my pocketbook when i woke up i was lucky for i might have found myself unable to pay my bill here we would have given you time we can tell by your face that you are honest thank you has buffington been taken from his room yet buffington i dont know any such name that is what he gave me as his name he is down on our books as lawrence perkins he seems to have more than one name he may have a dozen such gentry usually do i will send you a couple of policemen and have him taken round to the stationhouse two policemen were summoned and soon made their appearance they went upstairs preceded by the clerk he opened the door of the adventurers room and entered he isnt here he exclaimed in surprise turning to the two officers not here there was no need to ask how perkins or buffington whichever name he claimed had escaped he had made use of the fireescape and had disappeared he seems to have slept here remarked one of the policeman pointing to the bed yes he must have escaped early this morning i wonder i did not think of the fireescape he didnt call at the office and pay his bill i suppose no he was probably in too great a hurry if you will give us a description of him we can warn the public against him i didnt notice him particularly i have to deal with so many that i dont scrutinize any one closely unless there seems to be especial reason for doing so this boy pointing to mark saw him on the car and can describe him to you mark gave what information he could and then went to breakfast i hope i shant meet him again he reflected i am not anxious to keep up the acquaintance about noon he took a train for niagara falls and didnt leave it till he reached suspension bridge he arrived too late to see the cataract and proceeded at once to a modest hotel in the village where the price charged was two dollars per day he might have gone to the international hotel and would have been justified in doing so but he thought it right to be careful of his employers money he looked over the book half expecting to meet the name of buffington or perkins but found neither i hope i have seen my last of him he said to himself he did not feel obliged to take any extra precautions but slept peacefully and long after breakfast he started out to see the falls he was resolved to see them thoroughly no matter how much time might be required in the process i wish mother were here he thought some time if i can afford it i will bring her here this resolve gave him satisfaction though there seemed little prospect of his soon being in a condition to carry out his wish mark had no idea of meeting any one whom he knew he was but a boy and his acquaintance was limited already however it included three persons whom he would have been glad to be assured he would never meet again one of these was buffington the other two were hamilton schuyler and jack minton the nephew of old mrs mack who lived in the same tenement house in new york with his mother he supposed jack to be in new york and therefore his surprise may be imagined when he heard a hoarse voice behind him saying well ill be blowed if it isnt the kid how are you kid mark did not suppose that he was referred to but with natural curiosity he turned to observe the speaker he saw jack minton rough and uncouth as when he last met him advancing to meet him youre about the last bloke as i expected to see here kid observed jack his face still betraying surprise what brought you here business answered mark briefly they dont send telegraph boys as far as this do they well not often but i was sent here and i came what were you sent for that is my employers business and i dont feel at liberty to tell oh well i aint at all particlar to know but it seems good to meet a friend so far away how long have i been his friend thought mark i say kid well celebrate on that come in and have a drink they were passing a saloon and minton turned his steps towards it no thank you mr minton i am not thirsty oh hang it who cares whether you are thirsty or not you aint goin to turn against a friend are you it was clear that jack minton had already satisfied his thirst two or three times for his face was flushed and his step unsteady mark saw that his refusal would make minton angry and he accepted his invitation what will you have kid asked jack staggering to the counter a glass of sarsaparilla oh dont have sarsaparilla its only fit for old women and young children take whisky no it must be sarsaparilla or nothing just as you say barkeeper give me some whisky straight and give the kid sarsaparilla if he wants it the orders were filled jack tossed down a glass of fiery whisky which made his face even redder than before and then drawing from his pocket a roll of bills settled for both drinks mark was surprised at the abundance of money his companion seemed to have when they met in new york jack was very hard up and had only succeeded in obtaining twenty fivecents from his parsimonious aunt after drinking the whisky jack sank into a chair finding a sitting position more comfortable under the circumstances have you seen your aunt lately mr minton mark asked whos my aunt hiccoughed jack i aint got no aunt i mean mrs mack the old lady who lives in st marks place i dont know anything about bout mrs mack answered minton with a cunning look what shd i know of miss mrs mack shes your aunt isnt she she used to be but shes a bad old woman i dont want to see her again she would be very glad to hear that thought mark when did you come to niagara i dnow do you dont ask me any more of your fool questions answered jack with uncontrollable irritation did i pay you for the drinks he asked turning to the barkeeper yes you paid me thought i did didnt know as he spoke jack mintons head fell forward on the table and he closed his eyes the last potation was too much for him youd better take your friend away said the barkeeper eying jack without much favor i dont want him to go to sleep here hes no friend of mine answered mark didnt you come in with him didnt he treat you yes but i only accepted because he looked quarrelsome and i was afraid he might take offense if i refused if i let him stay here i shall charge him extra do as you like i never saw him but once before and i dont care to have anything to do with him i wish you would let me pay for that sarsaparilla i had i dont want to feel that he treated me he has paid and i cant take pay twice then take the money and return it to him mark without waiting to see if his proposal was accepted put a dime on the counter and left the saloon he met a newsboy with copies of a morning buffalo paper he bought one and turning to new york news his eyes fell upon a paragraph which surprised and excited him chapter xx a newspaper paragraph this was the paragraph that attracted marks attention this morning mrs rachel mack an old woman over seventy years of age living in an upper room at no st marks place was found insensible in her room as the result of an attack made by some person unknown when found she seemed very much frightened and was unable to give a coherent account of what had happened from marks upon her throat it was clear that her assailant had nearly strangled her his intention was obvious though living in a poor room amid squalid surroundings neighbors testified that mrs mack is comparatively rich being in fact a female miser and this was doubtless known to her assailant the old woman testified that she kept one hundred dollars in bills in the bureau drawer this sum was missing having evidently been taken by the person who attacked her she was not in a condition to throw much light upon the affair being dazed and confused when she recovers from her temporary stupefaction she may be able to give the police a clew that will lead to the arrest of the man who robbed her when mark read this paragraph he decided at once that jack minton mrs macks nephew was the old womans assailant jack had evidently left the city by the first outgoing train considering that at niagara he would be safe so indeed he might have been but for the chance that threw mark and himself together so it happened that the telegraph boy held in his hand the clew to the mysterious attack in his hand probably lay the liberty of minton what should he do while mark was not especially fond of the old woman he felt indignant with her burly nephew for attacking her and was clearly of the opinion that he ought to be punished after a little consideration he decided to call at the office of the local police and put the matter in their hands he inquired the way to the police office a pleasantlooking man in the uniform of a sergeant was on duty well young man what can i do for you he asked please read this paragraph sir and then i will tell you the sergeant read the newspaper notice attentively well he said inquiringly the man who i think committed the assault is in a saloon only a quarter of a mile distant who is it a nephew of the old lady but what makes you think he is the guilty party he has once before visited mrs mack and tried to extort money from her how do you know this because i live in the same house with mrs mack she occupies the room directly over where my mother and myself live then you live in new york yes sir how do you happen to be here i came on business for a new york jeweler what is the name of the party you suspect jack minton do you know anything of his character or antecedents he is a criminal he has been confined at sing sing prison for a term of years that alone is a ground of suspicion now how do you know he is here i met him less than an hour since did you speak to him yes state the particulars of your interview he recognized me and invited me into a saloon to take a drink and you accepted yes sir i hardly approve of a boy of your age accepting such an invitation i only drank a glass of sarsaparilla i am glad to hear it i have a son about your age and i should be sorry to have him drink whisky there is no danger of my doing that said mark quietly i have a good mother for her sake if not for my own i would not drink liquor that does you credit now as to your information it may prove important have you anything to corroborate your suspicion yes sir jack minton seemed to have plenty of money when he paid the barkeeper for our drinks i saw him pull out a roll of bills when he was in new york he had no money at all and succeeded in obtaining only twentyfive cents from his aunt this is an important bit of information i could order the arrest of minton however on your information without orders from new york i will telegraph to inspector byrnes and will act in accordance with any orders i may receive from him shall you need to see me again give me your name and address and i will communicate with you if necessary my name is mark mason and i am staying at the international hotel if convenient come here in about two hours all right sir two hours later mark returned to the police station oh here you are said the sergeant with a friendly nod well i have heard from new york have you sir asked mark eagerly from inspector byrnes yes what does he say here is his telegram mark took it in his hand and read these words hold the suspected party ask the boy to remain will send officer by next train byrnes you see that you are requested to remain can you do so yes sir i am glad of it as your testimony will be important now i will send a couple of officers with you to the saloon that you may identify minton we dont want to make any mistake all right sir of course there was a chance that minton might have left the saloon or been turned out by the proprietor but fortunately he was so stupefied that the latter had put him in an inner room and kept him there till he was in a better condition to move by direction of the officers mark entered the saloon alone he did not wish to excite suspicion and therefore going up to the bar ordered a glass of lemon soda while he was drinking it he asked is the man i came in with a little while ago still here yes and i wish you would get him out where is he inside he has been snoring till my regular customers asked me who i had in there very well if you will show me where he is i will get him out for you the barkeeper opened a door leading to an inner room on a settee lay jack minton breathing heavily his eyes were closed and he was quite unconscious of his position i dont believe you can stir him said the barkeeper i will call a friend then mark went to the door and beckoned to the two officers when they came in the barkeeper looked dismayed am i in trouble he asked no but we want the man what has he done committed a murderous assault on a party in new york well he looks as if he were capable of it you can take him i shall offer no resistance one of the officers went forward and shook jack minton vigorously whas the matter muttered jack not opening his eyes wake up and see im sleepy le me alone hiccoughed jack give a hand here said the officer signaling to his companion with no gentle hand they pulled jack from the settee and stood him up on his feet then for the first time he opened his eyes and stupefied as he was he realized that he was in the hands of policemen whas all this he muttered what have i done youre wanted in new york new york never was there in my life do you know an old lady named mack i i didnt do it i tell you i didnt do it it was somebody else mark and the officers looked at each other significantly the drunken man had unintentionally given himself away just then his glance fell on mark its the kid he said whats all this mean kid ill tell you mr minton your aunt mrs mack has been attacked and robbed is she dead asked jack eagerly no she is my aunt if she dies ill get all her money take me to a good hotel im sleepy it was clear that jack did not fully realize the situation next morning however when the two new york officers arrived he realized it fully and charged mark with betraying him they went to new york in the same train jack wearing handcuffs chapter xxi mark returns home welcome home mark exclaimed mrs mason with radiant face as the telegraph boy opened the door of their humble apartment then you have missed me said mark smiling it has seemed a long time since you went away did you have a successful trip yes indeed mr swan was so well satisfied that he gave me fifteen dollars besides paying the telegraph company for my services i shall be paid my regular wages by them also poor mrs mack has been attacked and robbed of a hundred dollars since you went away i read a paragraph about it copied from the new york papers how is she now she is confined to her bed the villain whoever he was nearly choked her and the shock was so great that it quite prostrated her were you at home when the attack took place no i had gone out on an errand meanwhile the rascal escaped i suppose it was her nephew i have brought him back to stand trial you exclaimed his mother in amazement yes i met him at niagara and on reading the paragraph i concluded that he was the thief especially as he seemed to be well provided with money on my information a telegram was sent to inspector byrnes and he was brought back on the same train with me go up and tell mrs mack it will do her good mark went upstairs with his mother the old lady looking unusually feeble was lying on the bed how do you feel mrs mack asked mark im almost dead groaned the old woman ive been robbed and almost murdered since you went away mark who did it who but that rascal jack minton and he my own nephew are you sure it was he yes i saw him and talked with him tell me about it he come in while i was sitting in the rocking chair and asked me for some money he begged and implored but i would give him nothing then he began to threaten and i said i would call you if you do ill kill the kid he said then he put his hand around my throat and almost choked me i fainted away and when i came to he was gone and a hundred dollars was taken from the bureau all i had to keep me from the poorhouse added the old woman whimpering but ill get even with him he thinks hell have the little i have to leave because he is my nephew hell find himself mistaken ill make a will ill mrs mack i have something to tell you that will please you has my money been found asked the old woman eagerly your nephew has been arrested and he is now in the hands of the police heaven be praised i dont mind the money now and where was he found i found him at niagara falls and had him arrested youre a good boy mark and you wont be sorry for helping a poor old woman no you wont be sorry tell me all about it mark told the story and it so cheered up the old woman that she got up from her bed and the next day was as well as ever she no longer complained of her loss of money her satisfaction in the retribution which had overtaken her nephew was so great that it overcame every other feeling when the trial came on she even succeeded in getting to the court room where she positively identified jack minton as her assailant and her evidence procured his conviction he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment at sing sing hell not trouble me again said mrs mack triumphantly as she walked out of court leaning on marks arm the prisoner glared at the pair and his hands were clenched if i could only get at em id kill em both he muttered but in his position his threats were futile two days afterwards mrs mason was surprised by another call from solon talbot he looked about him as he entered the room and his eyes lighted up with satisfaction as he noted the evidences of poverty though mark was now better off no new furniture had been bought he was waiting till he would feel justified in securing better apartments for his mother mrs mason looked surprised when her brotherinlaw entered have you moved into the city yet mr talbot she asked yes i arrived yesterday how is mary is she with you yes i should like to see her where are you located why the fact is we are not located yet i should be glad to see mary it is so long since we have met i cant ask you to call as we are so unsettled in a short time she will come and call upon you i hope so it is tantalizing to think she is in the same city and yet not to meet we all have our duties and her duty is to her husband and son i was surprised a few days since to meet mark on the central road yes he went to cleveland on business indeed has he returned yet he returned two days since for whom was he traveling i dont know that it is any secret he had a business commission from mr swan a broadway jeweler he must be a strange business man to select a boy to travel for him he made no mistake in selecting mark he professed himself well pleased with him humph it may have turned out right in a single instance when i select an agent i prefer to employ a man how is edgar he is well i am looking for a position for him i have hopes of getting him into the office of a prominent broker on wall street i shall be glad to hear that he is doing well he is about the age of mark true but their paths will lie apart my ahem position will secure for edgar an entrance into fashionable society while your son though doubtless a deserving boy must necessarily associate with his equals mark has some excellent friends said mrs mason nettled no doubt no doubt i have not a word to say derogatory of him except that he is inclined to be conceited i suppose edgar is quite free from that fault well no perhaps not but he has a social position to maintain however this is not what i came to talk about you remember that when i was last here i asked your signature to a statement that you had received your rightful portion of your fathers estate i remember it i offered you a small sum in consideration of this release as the administrator i find it desirable to have it in order that i may render a final account i remember the circumstances i think you made some objection a foolish one to which you were instigated probably by your son mark i remember that too no doubt the boy was honest in his advice but i need hardly suggest to you how incompetent a boy of his age is as an adviser in a serious business matter well i have come this morning on the same business but i wish to be liberal i think it only fair to take your circumstances into consideration i am ready to give you a hundred dollars if you will sign the paper i have here let me see the paper solon mr talbot took from his pocket a folded document which he placed before his sisterinlaw it ran thus i hereby acknowledge that i have received from solon talbot administrator of the estate of my late father elisha doane my full share in that estate and i hereby release him from all further claim on my part to said estate sign here if you please said solon suavely and i will give you the sum promised as he spoke he drew from his wallet a roll of ten tendollar bills which he judged would look tempting to a woman of mrs masons limited means if you will leave this paper here solon said the widow i will show it to mark when he gets home and ask his advice mr talbot frowned and looked vexed ask advice of a boy of sixteen he sneered surely you are better able to judge what is best than he i am not sure about that at any rate he is interested and i prefer to wait till i see him then the offer of a hundred dollars is withdrawn just as you think best solon i shall not sign without consulting mark well i will leave the paper then said talbot finding it hard to conceal his chagrin i hope for your sake that mark will advise you sensibly i think he will he is young but he has always shown good judgment confound the woman muttered talbot as he left the house it is most provoking to have her act in this way should she hear of the golden hope mine it would be most disastrous once let me obtain her release and i can sell it out for my own advantage chapter xxii a crafty schemer your uncle has been here mark said mrs mason when mark reached home i can tell you what business he came about mother he wanted my signature to a paper acknowledging that i had received my full share of fathers estate you didnt give it inquired mark anxiously no i would not take such an important step without your knowledge i feel much relieved i have not told you what i found on my journey to niagara what is it that uncle solon is trying to cheat you out of a large sum of money is that possible but father did not leave a fortune so we all supposed what if i should tell you that he left you enough to make you comfortable for life on your share mrs mason looked incredulous here read this memorandum mother and mark explained briefly how he came into possession of it tell me what it all means mark i have a poor head for business it means that grandfather owned four hundred shares of the golden hope mine in colorado probably he bought it for a small sum but it has proved unexpectedly rich and it will probably soon be worth one hundred dollars a share that means twenty thousand dollars for you mother and solon talbot wants me to relinquish my claim for a hundred dollars exclaimed mrs mason indignantly exactly so mother then i will give him a piece of my mind when he comes here this afternoon dont do it mother it is our policy to make him think we are ignorant of the existence of this important item in grandfathers estate only you must steadily refuse to sign a release i will i hope you will be here when he calls i will get off for the afternoon i wish to be here myself i have a little headache which will give me an excuse when solon talbot called on his sisterinlaw about three oclock in the afternoon he was rather disgusted to find mark at home he knew that mark was much more clearsighted than his mother and he feared that he would influence her to refuse her signature good afternoon ellen he said suavely take a seat mr talbot said mrs mason coldly how do you happen to be at home mark asked solon regarding mark with a slight frown i got excused for the afternoon i have a headache perhaps you wont mind going out for a few minutes i wish to speak to your mother on business do you wish me to go out mother asked mark no whatever affects you affects me besides i may want your advice i dont ask edgar for advice returned solon talbot dryly i suppose not you are a business man and can judge better than he i am not a business man you are older than mark i have always found mark a safe and good adviser you will spoil him by such flattery i am not afraid of it very well i will humor your prejudices mark may have more judgment than i give him credit for this he said because he saw that it was necessary under the circumstances to propitiate mark the telegraph boy understood his uncles object very well and was amused but remained outwardly grave thank you uncle he said briefly i will address myself then to both of you you will remember that i offered you a hundred dollars in cash i have the money with me he added tapping his pocket if you will sign acknowledgment that you have received your full share of your fathers estate it is a mere form but i want to wind the whole business up and have it off my hands i cant sign such a paper at present solon why not because i am not sure that i have received my full share dont you believe my assurance to that effect said solon talbot impatiently it is an important matter and i have no evidence but your word do you doubt my word in this matter your interests and mine might clash then let me tell you that you are getting more than your share that is when i have paid you the hundred dollars the fact is your father left a very small estate after paying his funeral expenses and debts there was scarcely anything over and off that little you have already had your share still i understand your position and sympathize with you in your poverty and therefore i am willing to strain a point and give you a hundred dollars if mr talbot expected his sisterinlaw to look grateful he was doomed to disappointment a hundred dollars he continued is a good deal of money especially in your circumstances i am sure mark will agree with me in this it is more than all the money we have replied mark precisely it will make things easy for you for a year to come by that time mark will probably be earning higher pay than at present and so your mind will be quite at ease you are very considerate solon but i think i would rather not sign why this is midsummer madness i am sure mark will not advise you to refuse i quite agree with my mother said mark well returned talbot angrily i have heard of foolish people but i must own that you two beat the record why are you so anxious that my mother should sign a release uncle solon asked mark quietly because i wish to have the whole matter settled and off my hands as i have told you i have business interests exclusively my own that demand my attention and i dont want to be bothered by this small matter i have no doubt you have good reasons for wishing mother to sign said mark what do you mean demanded solon suspiciously only that you are a good business man and understand your own interests i wish i could say the same for you retorted solon talbot sharply perhaps we do i ought not to be surprised at meeting opposition from a woman and a boy both ignorant of business as a rule those who know nothing think they know the most and are most suspicious however i can afford to overlook your unexpected obstinacy i will do what i had no idea of doing when i entered the room i will increase my offer to a hundred and twentyfive dollars that is certainly handsome and i shall not let mrs talbot and edgar know how foolishly i have acted illustration here is a pen he said you can sign at once page mark masons victory as he spoke he laid the paper before mrs mason here is a fountain pen he said you can sign at once i dont care to sign solon have you been talking to your mother mark demanded talbot sharply have you put her up to this we had a little talk together but i think she is just as determined on the subject as i am then said solon talbot i can only regard your refusal as an act of hostility evidently you want to break with me and mine it was my intention to invite you both to take dinner at my house tomorrow but as matters stand we cannot receive you and i shall forbid mrs talbot to call upon you i shall be sorry to be separated from my sister said mrs mason in a pained tone but i cannot sign away my own and my childrens rightful inheritance i dont know what you mean by this nonsense i have offered you more than your share of your rightful inheritance as you see fit to call it if you choose to return my kindness with ingratitude i can only leave you to the consequences of your own folly he looked first at mark and then at his mother to see how this speech affected them but both looked firm and there seemed to be nothing to do but to leave them he took his hat and strode to the door his hands trembling with nervous anger but at the door he paused if you come to your senses he said and desire to accept my offer mark can call on me i hate to see you so blind to your own interests after he had left the room mark and his mother looked at each other uncle solon seemed very much in earnest said mark yes i am now ready to believe that he is conspiring to cheat us it is shameful he is a rich man already and we are so poor but we shant be long mother you must take good care of that memorandum mark i shall carry it to a young lawyer whom i know well and ask his advice about it when the right time comes i shall bring it forward i will ask him to keep it in his safe very well mark i think that will be wise the next day mark received a letter at the office where he was employed on the lefthand upper corner was the imprint luther rockwell broker and banker he is going to take you into partnership said a d t if he does ill make you my officeboy said mark in a jocular tone i hope the old gentleman has quite recovered from his dynamite scare chapter xxiii marks good luck mark presented himself at mr rockwells office at eleven oclock the letter which he had received was a simple invitation to call signed by the banker himself is mr rockwell in he asked yes said the clerk smiling pleasantly for mark was a favorite in the office mark went over to the open door and stood on the threshold with his hat in his hand the banker looked up oh it is my young friend the messenger boy he said cordially holding out his hand i hope you are quite recovered sir said mark respectfully yes i believe so the visit of our dynamite friend was quite a shock to me and at my age it takes longer to recover from the effects of such an incident than at yours you must not think that i have forgotten what a service you rendered me i am very glad to have done you a service sir but i am afraid i must confess that i was thinking partly of myself i dont think any the less of you for your frankness still i am sensible that your promptness and presence of mind saved me from a terrible death i feel that i ought to do something to show my gratitude you have already repaid me sir by your kind words kind words are well enough but they are not practical i should like to take you into my employ but i have no vacancy and i do not like to discharge any of my old and trusted employees i should not be willing to displace any of them sir but there may be another way are your parents living my mother is living and i have a little sister and i suppose they are dependent upon you partly for support yes sir probably you are poor yes sir our means are very limited so i suppose what is your name mark mason mr rockwell turned to his desk and opening his check book deliberately filled up a check he tore it off and handed it to mark mark read it in amazement it was a check for one thousand dollars payable to the order of mark mason a thousand dollars he ejaculated yes does it seem to you a large amount i assure you that i value my life a great deal higher than this sum so i shall remain your debtor it seems a fortune to me mr rockwell how can i thank you for your generous gift my boy generosity is a variable quality i am blessed by fortune and for me it is a small sum to bestow in return for the heroic act would you like to have mr nichols go with you to identify you at the bank i dont think i should like to draw it all sir i should be afraid to have so much money in my possession then you can leave it with me as a deposit subject to your call how much of it would you like to draw now about fifty dollars sir i would like to buy a dress for my mother and sister and a new suit for myself well thought of will you call mr nichols the clerk made his appearance my young friend wishes to make a deposit with our house let him indorse the check then credit him with the entire amount and he will draw what sum he wishes you are in luck mark said the clerk when mark accompanied him into the main office you are in luck and i am heartily glad of it thank you mr nichols i feel rich it is a good beginning at any rate i am ten years older than you probably but i havent as much money as you but i dont envy you and i wont even ask for a loan when mark left the office and reappeared on broadway his face was flushed with pleasure and he walked with the elastic step of one whose spirits are light just as he stepped into the street he met his cousin edgar hello said edgar in a condescending tone so its you is it to the best of my knowledge it is my good cousin dont call me cousin said edgar hastily i wont answered mark promptly i am just as much ashamed of the relationship as you are i suppose that is a joke responded edgar haughtily if it is it is a poor one no joke at all where have you been to the office of mr rockwell my banker your banker sneered edgar how long has he been your banker i should like to know only since this morning i have just deposited some money with him indeed how much a thousand dollars you are too funny altogether if you are ever worth a thousand cents you will be lucky do you think so returned mark smiling i shouldnt be satisfied with so small a fortune as that my father tells me you and your mother have made him a very poor return for a kind offer he made you yesterday thats a matter of business edgar we didnt look upon it in the same way but i am afraid i must tear myself away from your company i shall be expected at the office go by all means it wouldnt do for you to be bounced you might starve if you lost your place i am not very much afraid of that at any rate i ought not to be talking with you father does not care to have me associate with you i hope he wont disinherit you that would be serious for you if he does come round to our house and we will take care of you you are too awfully funny i think it would be better for you if you were not quite so fresh mark laughed and went on his way wouldnt edgar be surprised he thought if he knew how large a sum i had on deposit with mr rockwell he thought i was joking when i was only telling the truth when mark went home to his supper he said mother i want you to buy a new dress for yourself and one for edith there are a good many things we would like mark but you must remember that we are not rich perhaps not but i think you can afford new dresses how much would they cost the material will cost from ten to twenty dollars i could make them up myself all right mother here are twenty dollars but mark can you spare that amount our rent comes due next week it is the last rent we shall pay here we will move to better quarters really mark i am afraid you are forgetting your prudence that is because you dont know how rich i am mother i have a thousand dollars on deposit with my banker or rather nine hundred and fifty for i drew fifty dollars this morning mrs mason surveyed her son with alarm a terrible suspicion entered her mind was he becoming mentally unbalanced mark understood her thoughts and was amused dont think i am crazy mother he said the fact is mr rockwell made me a present of a thousand dollars this morning is this really true you are not joking i was never more serious in my life he told me that i had saved his life and he didnt think he was overpaying me in giving me a thousand dollars he was right but i was afraid few men would have been so generous so i really have a rich son and i shall have a rich mother when she gets her share of her fathers estate oh by the way there is a letter for you edith get marks letter i guess its from a girl mark said his sister as she handed the messenger boy a dainty epistle in a square envelope mark opened it and read it aloud miss maud gilbert asks the favor of mr mark masons company at her residence on the evening of thursday sept d an invitation to a party said mark flashing with pleasure where mark at the house of miss maud gilbert shall you go yes i can go now for i shall have a nice suit you are getting to be fashionable mark who knows but you will be counted among the four hundred some time chapter xxiv the two sisters meet solon talbot had two strong desires one was to acquire wealth the other was to get into good society he had moved to the city of new york with the idea of helping himself in both these particulars he took a house on an uptown street at a considerable rental it was really beyond his means but he felt that he must make a good appearance he sent edgar to a fashionable school where he instructed him to be especially attentive to his wealthier schoolfellows though edgar made himself disagreeable to his poor relations he flattered and fawned upon the boys who he thought could help him socially for he like his father was ambitious to get into society thus he contrived to get invited to the party given by maud gilbert when he had compassed this he was greatly elated father he said on his return home i am invited to miss gilberts party next thursday evening do you mean the gilberts of west fortyfifth street yes i am very much pleased edgar mr gilbert is a wealthy merchant and stands very high in society how did you manage it through stanley rayburn who knows her brother have you made the acquaintance of miss gilbert yes i met her walking with stanley on fifth avenue he introduced me i should hardly think she would have invited you on such short acquaintance i got stanley to make a personal request of her she objected at first but finally came round stanley says she is very goodnatured and obliging luckily for you well i am glad you have the invitation it will be an entering wedge you must try to get acquainted with as many of her guests as possible trust me for that father i know on which side my bread is buttered i know you are sensible you quite accord with me in your views on this subject as for your mother she has no proper pride she would be contented to associate with persons in the same social position as mrs mason and mark this very morning she applied to me for permission to call upon her sister of course you refused of course not but i would consent if your aunt instigated by mark had not acted in such an extraordinary way about signing a release to me as administrator to your grandfathers estate what is her reason i suppose she thinks she ought to have more than she has received from it grandfather was very poor wasnt he i didnt think so when he lived but he left next to nothing after his debts were paid some people are very unreasonable of course i suppose mrs mason and mark think i ought to make up for their disappointment but you wont father certainly not i did offer them a hundred dollars out of pity for their poverty but they are standing out for more it is quite disgusting it is human nature i suppose said mr talbot leniently i dont know that i am surprised mrs talbot was very unlike her husband and son she was sincerely attached to her sister and her affection had not been diminished by mrs masons poverty it was her desire to call on her as soon as she arrived in the city but she stood somewhat in awe of her husband who had positively refused his consent so she unwillingly gave up the plan for the present hoping that the time would soon come when she and her sister could meet it came two days before the party with the money with which mark supplied her mrs mason went up town to the wellknown store of arnold constable intending to get dress patterns there she had made her purchases and received her bundle will you have it sent home asked the salesman courteously no thank you mrs mason shrank from having the parcel brought to her humble abode in st marks place she was turning to go when she heard her name called in glad and familiar accents why ellen do i meet you at last lucy exclaimed mrs mason as she clasped hands warmly with her sister this is a delightful surprise to me also i thought i should never see you again it is not my fault lucy no no i know it answered mrs talbot mr talbot is peculiar as you know he thinks everything of social rank now tell me how are you getting on very poorly till lately but now better you are not in want solon doesnt allow me much money but no lucy i want for nothing mark is a good boy and he has been fortunate you see i have just bought two dress patterns one for edith the other for myself i am glad indeed to hear it mark is a telegraph messenger is he not yes i shouldnt think that would pay very well it does not so far as wages go but some who have employed him have been liberal come out with me for a walk my purchases can wait we will go to sixth avenue as we are less likely to be seen together than on broadway for an hour the two sisters talked and it seemed delightful to both to be again together i must go home now said mrs mason as i left edith alone besides it is time for me to prepare supper for mark i wish you could go with me i would ellen but mr talbot would be angry do you think he is justified in keeping you away from your only sister no but ellen i am ready to make a sacrifice for a quiet life cant we meet again yes i will go to arnold constables next week on the same day and at the same hour i wish i could invite you to my house but you know how matters stand yes i know mr talbot appears to have increased his property yes i judge so though i receive no larger allowance but he tells me very little of his affairs he is more confidential with edgar than myself i have seen edgar he came to my rooms with his father some time since he is about the age of mark yes there is not over a months difference between them if mr talbot was different they would be company for each other i believe mark meets edgar occasionally in the street i hope edgar is a comfort to you he is my son and of course i love him but ellen i fear his father is not exercising a good influence upon him he is making him proud and arrogant i would not mention this except to you at this moment mark going uptown on an errand in a sixth avenue car saw his mother and his aunt together on the sidewalk he instantly left the car and joined them how do you do aunt lucy he said his face lighting up and this is mark said mrs talbot equally pleased how you have grown and how well you look thank you aunt i am tall enough to look over my mothers head as edgar is taller than i your mother tells me you meet edgar sometimes yes aunt lucy returned mark smiling but he doesnt care to be very intimate with his poor relations mrs talbot looked grave you wont suspect me of the same feeling mark she said no you are too much like mother i am glad to hear that you are doing well yes i have been fortunate i wish you were in a better position perhaps mr talbot might interest himself to get you a better place no aunt dont ask him i have other friends who will help me when i wish to make a change for the present i am content to remain as i am mark excused himself and boarded the next car as he did not wish to lose any time the sisters separated and mrs mason went home feeling cheered by her unexpected interview with mrs talbot when she returned to her humble home edith said mrs mack wants to see you i think she is very sick a gentleman came to see her but i dont know whether it was a doctor mrs mason went up stairs immediately the old lady was lying on the bed looking fatigued how do you do mrs mack said mrs mason kindly i feel tired but i am strong oh yes i am very strong i think i shall live ten years and the old woman peered anxiously into mrs masons face hoping for a confirmation of her opinion i hope you will if you desire it edith tells me you have had a visit from the doctor no it was not the doctor it was a lawyer i have made my will mrs mason looked surprised not that i have much to leave but i dont want my nephew to get anything if anything happens to me some years hence i would like you to call on my lawyer and tell him he has an office at nassau street mr page you will remember yes he has my will i didnt want to leave it here it might be stolen or mislaid and then jack minton would inherit youll put down the address i will do it at once that is all i think i will sleep now i wonder who will inherit the old ladys money thought mrs mason very probably she has left it to some charitable society i know of no other relation except jack minton chapter xxv maud gilberts party edgar talbot looked forward with eager anticipation to the evening of maud gilberts party it was to be his introduction into new york society he flattered himself that his appearance would win him favor though far from handsome he thought himself so a delusion not uncommon among boys and men he dressed himself very carefully and at the proper time set out for the house where the party was to be held he and stanley rayburn had agreed to go together on reaching the house they were directed to the room set apart for gentlemen to arrange their toilet and leave their coats the mansion was brilliantly decorated and as edgar went upstairs he felt a thrill of exultation at being a guest in such a house he inwardly resolved that he would take advantage of his slight acquaintance with the gilberts and push himself into intimate friendship in that way he would be in a position to extend his acquaintance among fashionable people but a surprise and a shock were in store for him as he entered the room he saw a boy standing in front of the mirror brushing his hair he started in surprise the figure looked familiar could it be yes it was his cousin mark mason mark mason handsomely dressed in party costume and with a rose in his buttonhole mark turned round to see who were the newcomers good evening edgar said mark you here exclaimed edgar in unqualified amazement yes i did not expect to have the pleasure of meeting you answered mark with an amused smile he understood edgars surprise and the reason of it meanwhile stanley rayburn stood by in silence introduce me to your friend edgar he said for he was attracted by marks frank handsome face mark mason stanley rayburn said edgar awkwardly he would have liked to decline introducing stanley to his poor cousin but there seemed to be no way of avoiding it i am glad to make your acquaintance mr mason said stanley cordially thank you but dont call me mr mason i would rather say mark any friend of edgar mark mason and i are only acquaintances said edgar hurriedly and in the worst possible taste i hope that we shall be friends said stanley with emphasis thinking that edgar was a cad i hope so too rejoined mark earnestly if after getting my character from edgar he added with a smile you still wish it stanley was a little puzzled not knowing how mark was regarded by his companion i think i shall go down at once said stanley i dont think i require any finishing touches to my toilet be ready to go with me to miss gilbert said edgar i will follow you in a minute very well now said edgar when he and his cousin were alone how do you happen to be here by miss gilberts invitation of course i suppose that is the case with you certainly does she know that you are a telegraph boy yes thats strange did you ever meet her oh yes i have spent the evening here two or three times thats queer by the way you seem to be very nicely dressed i am glad you like my suit yet you are as poor as poverty it was a crazy idea to run into debt for an expensive suit i didnt run into debt my suit is paid for yet your mother claims to be very poor we are getting along better now it would have been wiser for you to save the money you spent on this suit and keep it for rent and food your advice is very kind edgar but i really feel that i can manage my own business oh well if you choose to resent my good advice i dont i hope it springs from your interest in me during this conversation edgar was brushing his hair carefully and prinking before the glass for he was anxious to appear as fascinating as possible when he presented himself to miss gilbert shall we go down asked mark yes perhaps we may as well i suppose you would feel awkward entering the drawingroom alone perhaps so said mark smiling as the two presented themselves in the room below edgar looked about for stanley but did not see him i wonder where stanley has disappeared to he said in a tone of vexation he promised to go up with me to miss gilbert if he doesnt show up edgar i shall be glad to take his place as you have only recently come to the city i suppose you dont know her well i only met her once edgar admitted and she may not remember me then come with me almost against his wishes edgar found himself walking up to the other end of the room with his despised cousin he would not have believed it possible if this had been predicted to him an hour earlier good evening mark i am glad to see you here said maud gilbert with a pleasant smile let me present mr edgar talbot said mark after a suitable acknowledgment i had the pleasure of meeting you when in company with stanley rayburn explained edgar oh yes i remember and so you are also acquainted with mark yes answered edgar rather awkwardly i expected mr rayburn to present me you have found a sponsor equally good returned maud then the two walked on giving place to others you seem to know miss gilbert very well said edgar in a tone of curiosity yes it is strange i dont understand it edgar was relieved to find that mark did not claim him as a cousin though to his surprise he saw that mark stood particularly well with the young hostess how do you mark the speaker was a bright boy of sixteen the brother of miss gilbert how well you are looking thank you charlie if a young lady had told me that it would make me proud come along i will introduce you to a couple of nice girls who is that asked edgar of rayburn who had now come up dont you know that is charlie gilbert mauds brother so he knows mark too why shouldnt he because mark is you will be surprised to hear it a common telegraph boy he may be a telegraph boy but he certainly is not a common one he is a nicelooking fellow and i am glad to know him presently dancing began in his earlier days when his father was living mark had taken lessons from a teacher and though he was rather out of practise he ventured to go out on the floor having as his partner one of the prettiest girls in the room as there was space for but two sets of dancers edgar was obliged to sit still and see the others dance he felt very much dissatisfied especially as mark seemed to be enjoying himself thoroughly society in new york seems to be very much mixed he said to himself when telegraph boys can push in and make themselves so conspicuous in rich mens houses edgar got a chance to dance once later on but the girl he danced with was very small and insignificant in appearance well what kind of a time did you have asked solon talbot when his son returned home very good i suppose it was quite a brilliant affair said solon talbot complacently i am glad to have you invited to such a swell house did stanley rayburn take you up to miss gilbert no he promised to but when i looked for him he was not to be found that was awkward no i found a substitute a boy whom you and i both know i have no idea whom you can mean no you might guess all night but without success it was mark mason what you dont mean to say that mark mason was a guest at the party yes he was and he seemed very well acquainted too was he in his telegraph uniform no he had on a nice new suit as handsome as mine he had a rose in his buttonhole and looked quite like a dude how very extraordinary ejaculated solon i thought you would say so why they are living from hand to mouth steeped in poverty so i thought but it doesnt seem like it the boy must be very cheeky but even so i cant account for his success i shall have to call on his mother and ask what it means chapter xxvi an important commission a week later mark received the follow letter mark mason please call at my office as soon as convenient d gilbert this letter is from maud gilberts father said mark addressing his mother i wonder what he wants nothing disagreeable i am sure of course you will go i will call tomorrow morning mr gilbert was a commission merchant with an office in the lower part of the city west of broadway mark obtained leave of absence for an hour agreeing to pay the price usually charged to customers he had seen mr gilbert a stout portly man of fifty during his call at the house in fortyfifth street therefore when he was admitted to mr gilberts office he addressed him not as a stranger but as an old acquaintance i received your note mr gilbert and have called according to your request that is right mark sit down till i have finished looking over my letters you will find the morning herald on the table near you in ten minutes the merchant had finished with his letters and whirled round in his chair i believe you are a telegraph boy he said yes sir what pay do you receive i dont average over six dollars a week how old are you sixteen my daughter thinks you are unusually bright and intelligent i am very much obliged to miss maud for her good opinion said mark his face flushing with gratification how can you get along on six dollars a week you have a mother partially dependent upon you i believe i have lately had a present of a thousand dollars from mr luther rockwell the banker i was in his office when a dynamite crank threatened to blow us all up i heartily congratulate you mark you deserved the gift for your coolness and courage but it isnt every rich man who would make so generous an acknowledgment for your services thats true sir mr rockwell has been very kind how do you like the position of telegraph boy i would like to give it up it doesnt lead to anything but i dont want to throw myself out of work six dollars a week is a small income but it is better than nothing i approve your prudence but i think other and better employment can be obtained for you maud tells me that you were sent not long since to cleveland with some valuable jewelry yes sir you succeeded in your mission yes sir did you meet with any adventures while you were gone yes sir tell me briefly what they were mark did so dont think i am influenced by curiosity said mr gilbert the fact is i have a still longer journey for you if you dont object and i wished to assure myself that you were adequate to undertake it it may take six weeks or it may take two months i should advise you to give up your position as messenger and i will guarantee you an equally good place when you return thank you sir in that case i wont hesitate to give it up your week closes tomorrow i suppose yes sir then give notice at once where are you going to send me sir asked mark with pardonable curiosity to california mark looked amazed he knew that california was even further away than liverpool and having the love of travel and adventure natural to boys of his age he felt that he should thoroughly enjoy the trip i should like very much to go he said promptly now i must tell you why i send you a cousin of mine has just died in california leaving a young son of ten years of age he wrote me a letter from his deathbed commending the boy to my care i will gladly undertake the charge of the boy as i had a strong regard for his father who by the way had died poor but a difficulty presented itself the boy could not come east by himself and there seemed no one to bring him of course i cant leave my business and there is no one else in my family who can be sent under these circumstances maud has recommended me to send you i shall be glad to go sir you are a rather young guardian for a young boy but i think you possess the necessary qualification your experience as a telegraph boy has made you sharp and selfreliant and altogether i think you will acquit yourself to my satisfaction i will try to sir i need no assurance of that how am i to go by the union and central pacific road from omaha i will supply you with a through ticket shall you wish me to return immediately no you can stay in california two or three weeks and get acquainted with the boy i have never seen him but i think you wont find him troublesome are you fond of children very sir the poor boy will need a kind friend having lost his father so recently and now there is one thing more to be spoken of your compensation i shall be satisfied with whatever you think right then we will fix that after your return but you will need to leave some money with your mother to pay expenses while you are away i can draw from mr rockwell no if you have money in his hands let it remain i will advance you a hundred dollars to leave with your mother i may as well do that now on saturday evening when you are released from your present position call at the house and receive your ticket and final instructions thank you sir mr gilbert rang a little bell and a boy appeared go to the bank and get this check cashed said the merchant in a few minutes he returned with a roll of bills count them over and see if they are right mark yes sir they are correct very good remember that they are for your mother tell her also that if you remain longer than i anticipate and she gets short of money she can call at my office and i will supply her with more mark left the office in a state of joyful excitement he was to make a long journey across the continent he would see many states and cities and become acquainted with places which he now knew only by hearsay and after he returned his prospects would be brighter for mr gilbert had promised to find him a position at least equal to the one he resigned in the afternoon as mark was returning from an errand in west fiftieth street he saw edgar talbot in the neighborhood of bryant park hallo said edgar condescendingly are you on an errand yes ho ho how you will look in a telegraph boys uniform when you are a young man of twentyfive what makes you think i am going to be a telegraph boy so long because you are not fit for any other business mark smiled i am sorry for that he said for as it happens i have tendered my resignation you dont mean that you are going to leave the messenger service yes but how are you going to live it wont be any use to ask father for money i presume not perhaps suggested edgar hopefully you have been discharged i discharged myself have you got another position i am going to travel for a while edgar talbot was more and more perplexed in fact he had always found mark a perplexing problem how can you travel without money give it up i dont propose to have you got any money mark happened to have with him the roll of bills given him for his mother he drew it out do you mean to say that is yours how much is there a hundred dollars i dont believe it is yours it isnt it belongs to my mother but father said she was very poor at any rate this money belongs to her where are you going to travel out west this was all the information mark would give edgar reported the conversation to his father who was also perplexed mark mason is a strange boy he said i dont understand him chapter xxvii last instructions mark had intended to find a new and more comfortable place for his mother being dissatisfied with their humble rooms in st marks place but the journey he was called upon so unexpectedly to make led to a postponement of this plan you can move mother if you like said mark after placing the hundred dollars in her hands youll have money enough thats true mark but you wouldnt know how to address me and i might lose some of your letters i shall be satisfied to stay here till you return but do you think you had better go you are very young to cross the continent alone i am nearly sixteen mother and i have been in the habit of looking out for myself besides mr gilbert thinks i am old enough and if he has confidence in me i ought to have confidence in myself i suppose it is all right but i shall miss you terribly it is for my good and will be for yours mother i have long wanted to leave the messenger service and get into some steady position where i can push myself ahead and this seems to me my chance you will write often mark i will be sure to do that you dont think i will forget my mother on saturday evening mark went to mr gilberts to receive instructions i must tell you something about the boy of whom you are to be temporary guardian said mr gilbert perhaps it will be best for me to read you in the first place the letter i received from my poor cousin just before his death it was written at his dictation for he was already too weak to hold the pen he drew from a desk this letter which he proceeded to read aloud gulchville california oct my dear cousin when this letter reaches you i shall in all probability be in a better world i am dying of consumption i leave behind me a boy of ten my poor little philip i leave him to the mercies of a cold world for i am penniless i had a little property once but i speculated and lost all poor philip will be an orphan and destitute i know you are rich and prosperous wont you in your generosity agree to care for my poor boy he wont require much and i shall be content to have him reared plainly but i dont want him to suffer i am sick at the house of a cousin of my wife he is a mean man and his wife is also penurious and mean they have made my sickness still more bitter by their taunts they complain that i am an expense to them and they would turn me out of doors sick as i am i am convinced if they were not ashamed to do so poor philip will be left to their tender mercies but i hope only for a short time i can bear to suffer myself but i cant bear to think of his suffering he is a sensitive boy not over strong and illfitted to bear the buffetings of a cold and unkind world wont you send for him as soon as you can in your hands i am sure he will be safe and kindly cared for i am getting very tired and must stop god bless you your unfortunate cousin john lillis p s the man in whose house i am stopping is named nahum sprague you see mark your mission will be one of mercy the sooner the poor boy is rescued from such people as mr and mrs sprague the better for him by the way i dont want them to say my cousin has been an expense to them therefore i will authorize you to obtain from them an itemized account of what they have spent for him and the boy and pay it you will see that they dont impose upon me by presenting too large a bill yes sir i will look sharply after your interests i shall give you more than enough to get you to san francisco and i will give you a letter to a firm there authorizing you to draw upon them for any sum you may require up to a thousand dollars but that will be a great deal more than i shall need i presume so but i give you so large a credit to use in case of emergencies you are trusting me very far mr gilbert i am aware of that but i feel entirely safe in doing so thank you sir other directions were given and it was agreed that mark should start on his long journey on monday morning chapter xxviii mark at omaha some days later mark found himself at omaha here he was to transfer himself to the union pacific railroad at that time the only pacific road built with the exception of the central pacific which formed with it a continuous line to san francisco mark decided to remain in omaha for a single day and then take the train for his destination at the hotel mark found himself sitting next to a man with bronzed face and rough attire who embodied his ideas of a miner the stranger during the meal devoted himself strictly to business but going out of the diningroom at the same time with mark he grew sociable well young pard he said whats your trail mark looked puzzled i mean which way are you going east or west i am going to san francisco ever been there before mark shook his head i never was as far west as this before he answered i came from new york so i thought you look like a tenderfoot are you going out to stay only a short time i am going after a young boy i am going to carry him back with me a kid eh youre not much more than a kid yourself i guess i can take care of myself said mark with a smile shouldnt wonder you look like it nothing soft about you i hope i havent got a soft head as to my heart i hope that isnt hard good for you i reckon youre a likely kind of boy i suppose you have been to california said mark thinking it his turn to ask questions yes ive been on the coast for three years more or less how do you like it out there well ive had my ups and downs a year ago six months for that matter i was dead broke did your luck change not till i struck nevada then i got a small interest in the golden hope mine the golden hope mine exclaimed mark in excitement do you know anything of that mine youngster yes i have a a friend who owns some stock in it then your friend is in luck why do you know where the stock stands today no but i should like to know at marks eyes sparkled with joyous excitement is it possible he exclaimed its so ive got a block of a hundred shares myself which i bought eighteen months ago for a song i give you my word i didnt think it worth more than a dollar or two a share what i gave when i learned not long since that theyd struck it rich and i was no longer a pauper thats good news for me said mark slowly why have you got any of it my mother is entitled to two hundred shares from her fathers estate whew have you come out to see about it no that was not my object but i shall find out what i can about it youre in luck well perhaps so but my uncle is trying to cheat my mother out of it then he must be a rascal tell me about it the man looked sympathetic and trustworthy and mark without hesitation told him the story as it is already known to the reader do you think the stock has reached its highest point he asked anxiously no it will probably rise to two hundred then my uncle probably wont close it out just at present no he will hear how the matter stands and if he is sharp he will hold on i am glad of that for i want a little time to decide how to act i am going to stop at the mine on my way to frisco i will give you my address and ask you to write me a line to the care of my banker there letting me know what you can about the mine all right boy i like you and ill do it when do you start tomorrow well start together and ill get off the train in nevada chapter xxix nahum sprague and his orphan ward leaving mark on his way we will precede him and carry the reader at once to gulchville in california where he was to find the young boy of whom mr gilbert had requested him to take charge in an unpainted frame house lived mr nahum sprague in new england such a building would hardly have cost over five hundred dollars but here it had been erected at more than double the expense by the original owner when he became out of health and left california it was bought for a trifling price by nahum sprague the letter was a man of fortyfive with small eyes and a face prematurely wrinkled he was welltodo but how he had gained his money no one knew he and his wife however were mean and parsimonious they had one son a boy of fifteen who resembled them physically and mentally he was named oscar after a gentleman of wealth in the hope that at his death the boy would be remembered unfortunately for oscar the gentleman died without a will and his namesake received nothing the disappointed parents would gladly have changed the boys name but oscar would not hear of it preferring the name that had become familiar this was the family whose grudging hospitality had embittered the last days of john lillis and to them he was obliged to commit the temporary guardianship of his little son philip in the field adjoining philip lillis a small pale boy was playing when oscar sprague issued from the house come here you little brat he said harshly philip looked with a frightened expression what do you want of me he asked what do i want come here and see the little fellow approached he was received with a sharp slap in the face why do you hit me oscar philip asked tearfully because you didnt come quicker answered the young tyrant i didnt know you were in a hurry well you know it now you wouldnt have hit me when papa was alive said philip with a flash of spirit well he isnt alive see i know he isnt and i am alone in the world well dont snivel if anything makes me sick at the stomach it is to see a boy snivel maybe youd cry if your papa was dead there aint much fear the old mans too tough responded oscar who had no sentimental love for his father indeed it would have been surprising if he had shown any attachment to nahum sprague who was about as unattractive in outward appearance as he was in character and disposition you didnt tell me what you wanted me to do just wait till i tell you smarty do you see this bottle yes take it to the saloon and get it full of whisky papa didnt want me to go into a liquor saloon well your papa aint got nothing to do with you now see you just do as i tell you philip took the bottle unwillingly and started for the saloon mind you dont drink any of it on the way home called out oscar as if i would said philip indignantly i dont drink whisky and i never will oh youre an angel sneered oscar youre too good for this world aint you afraid youll die young as they say good boys do i dont believe youll die young oscar hey was that meant for an insult but never mind i dont pretend to be one of the goodygoody sundayschool kids now mind you dont loiter on the way oscar sat down on the doorstep and began to whittle the door opened and his father came out why didnt you go to the saloon as i told you he asked hastily its all the same i sent philip you sent that boy he aint fit to send on such an errand why aint he he can ask to have the bottle filled cant he what did he say was he willing to go he said his papa mimicked oscar didnt want him to go into a liquor saloon he did hey all the more reason for making him go his povertystricken father cant help him now why i am keeping the boy from starving are you going to keep him always dad i ought to turn him over to the town but folks would talk theres a man in new york that his father said would send for him i dont know whether he will or not theres a matter of fifty dollars due to me for burying john lillis thats the way i get imposed upon philip kept on his way to the saloon he was a timid sensitive boy and he shrank from going into the place which was generally filled with rough men two miners were leaning against the front of the wooden shanty used for the sale of liquor when philip appeared as he passed in one said to the other well ill be jiggered if here isnt a kid comin for his liquor i say kid what do you want some whisky answered philip timidly how old are you ten i say young un youre beginnin early i dont want it for myself returned philip half indignantly oh no of course not you wont take a sip yourself of course not no i wont my papa never drank whisky and he told me not to where is your papa gone to heaven the miner whistled then who sent you for whisky mr sprague old nahum his name is nahum i thought he was too mean to buy whisky do you live with him yes sir is he any kin to you no answered philip quickly does he treat you well i dont like to answer such questions said philip guardedly i suppose you are afraid to did your father leave any money no answered philip sadly then i understand how it is do you expect to keep on living with mr sprague papa wrote to a gentleman in new york i expect he will send for me i hope he will for your sake poor little chap well go on and get your whisky i dont want to take up your time as philip entered the first speaker remarked well bill i dont pretend to be an angel but i wouldnt send a kid like that for whisky i drink it myself but i wouldnt want a boy like that to go for it id go myself i agree with you said bill that sprague aint of much account any way id lick him myself for a dollar hes about as mean as they make em chapter xxx a circus in mr spragues yard philip timidly made known his request and the bottle was filled the saloonkeeper attended to the order in a matteroffact manner as long as he got his pay he cared very little whom he dealt with philip feeling ashamed of his burden came out with the bottle and set out on his return home he had been delayed by the conversation at the door and he had also had to wait to have the bottle filled there being several customers to attend to before him so it happened that when he got back mr sprague and oscar were awaiting him impatiently there the boy comes at last father said oscar hes creeping like a snail whisky was mr spragues one extravagance and he had waited longer than usual for his customary drink this made him irritable why dont you come along faster you young beggar he called out harshly ill start him up dad said oscar with alacrity do so oscar started down the road with a cruel light in his eyes he liked nothing better than to illtreat the unfortunate boy who had been left to the tender mercies of his father philip did not understand what oscars coming portended till the older boy seized him violently by the shoulders why dont you hurry up he demanded dont you know any better than to waste your time playing on the street i didnt waste any time i couldnt get waited on at first thats too thin you were walking like a snail any way ill see if i cant make you stir your stumps a little faster oscar pushed philip so violently that the little fellow stumbled and then came a catastrophe he was thrown forward the bottle came in contact with a stone and of course broke spilling the precious contents as nahum sprague thought them now youve done it exclaimed oscar i wouldnt be in your shoes young man pa will flog you within an inch of your life see what philip has done pa said oscar pointing to the broken bottle nahum sprague absolutely glared at the unfortunate boy his throat was dry and parched and his craving for whisky was almost painful in its intensity and now to have the cup dashed from his lips it would take time to get a fresh supply not to count the additional cost his wrath was kindled against the poor boy what made you break the bottle you young rascal he demanded harshly i didnt mean to answered philip pale with fright you didnt mean to i suppose it fell of itself retorted mr sprague with sarcasm oscar pushed me exclaimed philip he pushed me very hard or i wouldnt have dropped it now he wants to throw it all upon me pa aint you ashamed of yourself its true oscar and you know it returned philip with a show of spirit you said i didnt move fast enough its a wicked lie i just touched you on the shoulder and you broke the bottle out of spite i have no doubt oscar is right said nahum sprague severely you have destroyed my property you have broken the bottle as well as wasted the whisky you are a wicked and ungrateful boy here i have been keeping you out of charity because your lazy and shiftless father left you nothing dont you say anything against my father said philip his meek spirit aroused by this cruel aspersion of the only human being who had cared for him since his mothers death hoity toity heres impudence so i am not to say anything against your father after caring for him through his sickness and burying him at my own expense ill pay you back mr sprague indeed i will said philip his lip quivering youll pay me back you who are nothing but a beggar well heres cheek you talk as if you were rich instead of a pauper ill pay you some time i have no money now but ill work day and night when i am a man to pay you that all sounds very well but it dont pay me for the bottle of whisky i must give you a lesson for your carelessness oscar go and get the horsewhip ill do it dad said oscar joyfully he was naturally a cruel boy and the prospect of seeing philip flogged gave him the greatest pleasure there was a small outbuilding near the house which had once been used for a stable when mr sprague kept a horse but the last poor animal having pined away and died as it was believed from insufficient food it was no longer in use except as a store house for various odds and ends the horsewhip was saved over from the time when it was needed for its legitimate purpose oh dont whip me mr sprague pleaded philip frightened at the last words of his cruel guardian he was a sensitive boy one of the kind that thrives under kind influences and droops under illtreatment he had a delicate physical organization that shrank from pain which some boys bear with stoical fortitude it was not merely pain but the humiliation of a blow that daunted him mr sprague did not make any reply to his pleadings but waited impatiently for oscar to appear this was not long sent on a congenial errand oscar wasted no time but came out of the building promptly with the horsewhip in his hand here it is dad he said handing it to his father all this happened in open view of the house and of the public road mr sprague was so intent upon his plan of punishing philip that he did not notice the approach of two men walking with unsteady steps along the highway and now close at hand they were the two men who had talked with philip in front of the drinking saloon they had been drinking but had not reached the stage of helplessness i say joe said one looking towards nahum spragues house theres where old sprague lives hes a mean rascal hiccoughed the other id like to thrash him theres the kid the one he sent to buy some drink and theres old sprague with a whip in his hand ill be doggoned if he aint goin to lick him its a beastly shame i say suppose we take a hand all right bill meanwhile nahum sprague quite unaware that he was likely to be interfered with took the whip from the hand of his son he looked at philip very much as a cat looks at a mouse whom she is preparing to swallow now youre going to catch it he announced with a cruel gleam in his eyes now youre going to see what you get for spilling my whisky ill learn you oh please dont whip me mr sprague pleaded philip indeed i didnt mean to break the bottle illustration nahum brought the whip down with a swish on philips legs page mark masons victory thats too thin you didnt want to go for the whisky in the first place you said your papa with a mocking sneer didnt like to have you go to a saloon thats true but i went because you had to you are lazy and put on airs just as if you wasnt a beggar dependent on me for the bread you eat and the clothes you wear my father bought me these clothes said philip suppose he did when you have worn them out youll expect me to buy you some more what are you waiting for pa asked oscar impatiently if youre going to lick him why dont you do it im going to said nahum and raising the whip he brought it down with a swish around the legs of the poor boy philip cried with pain dancing up and down and oscar went into a fit of laughter at what he thought an amusing spectacle thats the talk dad exclaimed oscar you gave it to him good give it to him again i mean to said nahum grimly and he raised the whip a second time say joe are we going to stand this asked bill not by a long shot follow me pard mr spragues back was turned to the street and he did not see the quick approach of the two miners he was just about to bring down the whip again upon poor defenseless philip when he thought he was struck by a cyclone bill seized him by the collar while joe snatched the whip from his hand why why whats all this asked the astonished man in dismay two can play at your little game answered joe you can stand it better than the kid and he lashed the unfortunate nahum across the legs just as philip had suffered a short time before stop stop yelled nahum who was a coward at heart what do you mean ill have the law of you thats what you were doing to the kid ill give you a dose of your own medicine and mr sprague received a second stroke give me the whip joe cried bill give me a chance at him dont keep all the fun to yourself all right here it is bill used the whip quite as effectively as his friend joe you stop licking my pa exclaimed oscar not daring however to approach the scene of conflict i say kid what was he licking you for asked bill after the first blow he said i broke the bottle and spilled the whisky and did you yes but oscar pushed me and made me do it whos oscar that boy there oho so hes to blame for it its a lie retorted oscar it isnt i know the kids telling the truth he deserves a dose too bring him here joe joe advanced upon oscar and after a short chase seized him by the collar and brought him up to the selfappointed dispenser of justice hold him tight joe then oscar felt the whip lash coiling around his legs you quit that he howled in anger and dismay one more will do you good youre bigger than the kid and you can stand it better a second time the lash descended with even greater force and oscar jumped and danced as philip had done before him but somehow it didnt seem to impress him as so funny youd better give the old man more and then well let him go said joe ill have you arrested shrieked nahum sprague but in spite of his threat he received another dose of the same medicine when you want some more call on us said bill as he spoke he flung the whip out into the street and the two ministers of justice went off laughing if they try to lick you again kid come and tell us joe called back chapter xxxi philip finds a friend when the two unauthorized ministers of justice had departed oscar and his father looked at each other in anger and stupefaction its an outrage exclaimed nahum sprague id like to shoot them returned oscar id like to see them flayed within an inch of their lives so would i they are the most audacious desperadoes i ever encountered do you know them dad yes they are bill murphy and joe hastings they are always hanging round the drinking saloon we can lick philip at any rate said oscar with a furious look at poor phil he brought it on us but nahum sprague was more prudent he had heard the threat of bill and joe to repeat the punishment if philip were attacked and he thought it best to wait leave it to me he said ill flog him in due time aint you going to do anything to him dad asked oscar in disappointment yes come here you sir phil approached his stern guardian with an uncomfortable sense of something unpleasant awaiting him nahum sprague seized him by the collar and said follow me he pushed the boy before him and walked him into the house then up the stairs into an attic room where he locked him in just then the bell rang for dinner poor phil was hungry but nothing was said about dinner for him a dread suspicion came to him that he was to be starved but half an hour later the door opened and oscar appeared with two thin slices of bread without butter heres your dinner he said it was a poor enough provision for a hungry boy but phil ate them with relish oscar looking on with an amused smile is that all i am to have asked phil yes it is all you deserve i dont know what i have done you dont hey you broke the bottle and spilled the whisky i wouldnt have done it if you hadnt pushed me there you go laying it off on me youd better not but its true oscar no it isnt you broke the bottle to spite pa i wouldnt have dared to do it said philip you dared a little too much anyway didnt you get those men to follow you and interfere with what was none of their business no i didnt hadnt you spoken with them at the saloon yes i thought so they asked me who sent me for the whisky and i told them you didnt need to tell them if it hadnt been for that they wouldnt have come round to our place and assaulted pa and me theyll catch it pa says shouldnt wonder if theyd be put in prison for five years young as he was phil put no faith in this ridiculous statement but he thought it best not to make any comment how long is your father going to keep me here he asked maybe a month this opened a terrible prospect to poor phil who thought mr sprague quite capable of inflicting such a severe punishment if he does i wont live through it he said desperately you dont mean to kill yourself said oscar startled no but i shall starve i am awfully hungry now what after eating two slices of bread they were very thin and i have exercised a good deal then i advise you to make it up with pa if you get down on your knees and tell him you are sorry perhaps he will forgive you and let you out phil did not feel willing to humiliate himself in that way and remained silent there aint any bed for me to sleep on he said looking around you will have to sleep on the floor i guess youll get enough of it oscar locked the door on the outside and went downstairs disagreeable as he was phil was sorry to have him go he was some company and when left to himself there was nothing for him to do if there had been any paper or book in the room it would have helped him tide over the time but the apartment was bare of furniture there was one window looking out on the side of the house phil posted himself at this and soon saw oscar and his father leave the premises and go down the street nahum had a bottle in his hand and phil concluded he was going to the drinking saloon to get a fresh bottle of whisky phil continued to look out of the window presently he saw a boy pass whom he knew a boy named arthur burks he opened the window and called out eagerly arthur arthur turned round and looking up espied philip hello he cried what are you doing up there i am locked in what for i accidentally dropped a bottle of whisky and spilled it mr sprague got mad and locked me up here thats a shame how long have you got to stay oscar says he may keep me here a month hes only frightening you old sprague wouldnt dare to do it that isnt all i am half starved he only gave me two small slices of bread for dinner hes a mean old hunks i just wish you could come round to our house wed give you enough to eat i wish i were there now sighed philip ive got an idea said arthur brightening up what time do mr sprague and oscar go to bed very early about nine oclock would you run away if you could yes then ill tell you what ill do at halfpast nine albert frost and i will come around with a tall ladder mr frost has got one and well put it up against your window will you dare to get out of the window and come down yes ill do anything to get away but can you get the ladder yes albert will manage it do you think the old man will be likely to see or hear us no he sleeps on the other side of the house all right you can expect us i guess i had better go now for fear i may be seen and they might suspect something but where can i go when i leave here come to our house you can sleep with rob my little brother thank you arthur ill expect you philip felt a good deal more cheerful after arthur had gone he knew that in arthurs house he would be very differently treated from what he had been by nahum sprague he did not feel it wrong to leave the spragues as they were constantly complaining that he was a burden if mr burks would only let me live with him he thought i should be happy and i would be willing to work hard at halfpast five oscar came up to the room again this time accompanied by his father how do you like being locked up here asked nahum not very well get down on your knees and beg my pardon for your bad conduct and i will let you out i would rather not sir do you hear that oscar he would rather not i heard it pa it is only right that he should suffer the penalty of his headstrong conduct give him his supper and we will leave him to think of his sinfulness oscar produced two more thin slices of bread and a cup of very weak tea you are not entitled to tea said nahum it is only because we are kindhearted that i permitted mrs sprague to send up a cup i have not put in milk or sugar because i refuse to pamper you philip made no comment but disposed of the tea and bread in a very short space of time he felt ready to join in with oliver in dickenss immortal story when he asked for more but he knew it would be of no use now we will go down oscar all right pa i hope the house wont catch fire in the night he added with the laudable purpose of terrifying philip for we might not be able to come up and unlock the door philip felt uncomfortable but he reflected that before many hours if arthur burks kept his promise he would no longer be an inmate of mr spragues home hell have a sweet time sleeping on the floor pa said oscar as they went downstairs it will serve the little fool right returned nahum sprague grimly chapter xxxii nahum spragues surprise philip waited impatiently from suppertime till halfpast nine oclock fortunately mr sprague and oscar went to bed rather earlier than usual on account of philips being locked up some of the chores which he had been accustomed to do fell to the father and son so it happened that when it was twenty minutes to eight mr sprague said i feel sleepy i think i shall turn in now i am sleepy too pa said oscar i wonder how philip feels you can sleep with him if you want to said mr sprague jocosely thank you dad youre very kind but i dont care to sleep on the floor i guess the young beggar will feel pretty sore in the morning its his own fault said nahum grimly all the same youd better let him out tomorrow i dont care about doing his chores right along ill see about that whenever he will get down on his knees and beg my pardon he can go free by nine oclock mr and mrs sprague and oscar were in bed and by halfpast nine all were fast asleep the whole family were good sleepers and it may be added for the senior sprague that he was a good snorer also philip posted himself at the window about five minutes after the time agreed upon he saw in the moonlight his two boy friends approaching bearing between them a long ladder his heart leaped within him they had not forgotten him after all he stood at the open window and waved his hand there he is albert said arthur burks i guess hes glad to see us well soon have him out of there the two boys came under the window and called up softly has old sprague gone to bed yes answered phil i hear him snoring i hope they are all fast asleep said albert here arthur you just hold on to the ladder while i raise it do you think it is tall enough asked arthur ill risk it the two boys worked till they had the ladder raised and leaning against the window will you dare to get out of the window and get down asked arthur i guess so be very careful you dont want to fall cautiously phil put out one leg and placed his foot on one rung of the ladder then clutching firm hold of the side he put out the other and now he had both feet on the rung now come down carefully said albert phil followed directions he was only ten years old and he certainly did feel a little timid but he felt that behind him was a prison and before him was liberty and he did not hesitate so rung by rung he cautiously descended till he stood on the ground beside the ladder in the company of his two friends bravo phil said arthur burks youve done splendidly now albert lets get away before old sprague hears us the ladder was carefully taken down and the two boys walked off with it albert at the head and arthur at the foot while phil followed behind well go to your house first albert and take the ladder said arthur then phil will go home with me the two boys lived not far apart and this arrangement proved convenient i wonder what old sprague will say in the morning laughed albert hell wonder how in the world philip got away perhaps hell think he jumped out of the window how do you feel phil asked arthur i feel pretty hungry what did you have for supper two thin slices of bread and a cup of tea i guess well find something in the pantry at our house said arthur unless robs got out of bed and eaten it up by ten oclock the ladder was replaced and the several boys were safe at home arthur was as good as his word he got out some bread and butter some cold meat and a glass of milk and philip made a hearty meal i havent had as good a supper for a long time he said with a deep sigh of satisfaction thats why youre so skinny if we had you here wed soon fat you up now are you ready to go to bed yes arthur how kind you are to me i cant compare with your friend oscar phil i hope not oscars about as mean a boy as i know hes very different from you and albert meanwhile unconscious of the loss of one of their little household mr and mrs sprague and oscar slumbered on till after sunrise get up oscar called nahum sprague going to his sons room you must get up what must i get up for grumbled oscar because you will have to do philips chores this morning why dont you call him pa i dont see why i should do his work because he is locked up for punishment i am not ready to let him out yet it seems to me i am being punished he has nothing to do while i have to get up early and work would you be willing to change places with him be locked up all day live on bread and water and sleep on the hard floor well hes done it and now you might let him out and set him to work i have already said that i would let him out when he got down on his knees and begged my pardon and have i got to do his work till he begs your pardon i say that aint fair i begin to think oscar you are very lazy ill tell you what you may do when you are dressed you may go to the door of the attic room and ask philip if he is ready to apologize to me if he says yes ill go up and receive his apology and then he can come down and go to work all right pa ill do it i guess hes got enough by this time five minutes later oscar was at philips door he had forgotten to bring up the key which his father had taken downstairs the evening previous he put his mouth to the keyhole first rapping at the door to command attention i say you phil he called out there was no answer oscar rapped again philip lillis he called for reasons which we understand though oscar didnt there was no response oscar became angry and began to pound vigorously at the door there if he doesnt hear that he must be deaf he said to himself i say do you want to be let out no answer he hears me and wont answer out of pure spite reflected oscar indignantly he continued to pound look here you young beggar he cried if you dont answer me ill get pa to bring up the horsewhip and flog you within an inch of your life there wont be any barroom loafers to save you this time even this threat seemed to produce no effect and oscar quite out of temper descended the stairs well said mr sprague what does he say what does he say he wont say anything perhaps he didnt hear you suggested mr sprague if he didnt he must be as deaf as a post slickening is he thats about the size of it well we can cure him of that ill tell you what to do pa ill get the horsewhip and you can give him a good thrashing i told him you would there wont be any one to interfere up there thats true go and get the whip oscar no employment was more congenial oscar went downstairs with alacrity and soon reappeared with the whip by this time his father was dressed and ready for action heres the whip pa may i go up with you yes come up father and son ascended the stairs and stood before philips door speak to him first pa and see if he will answer you nahum sprague in a stern and authoritative tone called philip no answer didnt i tell you pa philip lillis again no reply i didnt think the boy would be so owdacious ill soon learn him mr sprague turned the key and opened the door entering the room with upraised whip he gave a gasp of surprise why he isnt here he ejaculated isnt here shouted oscar in amazement no and the winder is open exclaimed mr sprague he wouldnt dare to jump out would he nahum sprague advanced to the window and put his head out expecting to see philip on the ground beneath perhaps with a broken limb but no philip was visible chapter xxxiii a change for philip mr sprague and oscar looked at each other in complete stupefaction what does it mean where can the boy have gone ejaculated nahum ill be blest if i know returned oscar the door was locked he must have gone through the window there wasnt any rope in the room was there no and if he jumped out he would certainly have broken his neck or his limbs he wouldnt have dared to jump hes no braver than a mouse its the most mysterious thing i ever heard of said mr sprague wrinkling his brows what are you going to do about it dad i dont know im flabbergasted ill tell you what to do when you get him back suggested oscar give him a sound thrashing it will do him good you can depend upon that i think it may be well after breakfast for you to go round and inquire if he has been seen in the village what shall i say about his running away say hes a little touched in the upper story i guess hed better be touched somewhere else said oscar with a loud laugh at his own wit considerably to his disgust oscar was set to work doing some of philips chores directly after breakfast and it was nine oclock before he got ready to start in quest of philip even then he did not start for an open buggy stopped at the gate driven by a man from the village and containing as passenger a boy of sixteen this boy was mark mason as the reader will easily conjecture whos that oscar is it one of your friends asked nahum sprague no never saw him before in my life mark advanced directly to mr sprague is this mr nahum sprague he asked yes thats my name does a boy named philip lillis live with you and what if there does inquired mr sprague cautiously i am sent from new york to take charge of him you a boy like you exclaimed nahum in surprise why you aint over sixteen youve guessed my age exactly said mark with a smile who sends you mr david gilbert is he rich asked nahum curiously well hes pretty well off and he is willing to take care of the boy yes can i see philip well answered nahum sprague in an embarrassed tone you can pretty soon and why not now the fact is rather a curus thing happened last night the boy disappeared is that true asked mark with some suspicion yes fact is the boy aint quite right in his head i am sorry for that said mark gravely how long has he been affected that way only lately i dont think it will last please tell me the circumstances why we locked him in the attic for fear he might get out and come to some harm when he was lightheaded and this morning we couldnt find him please show me the room though a boy mark spoke with unconscious authority and mr sprague immediately complied with his request he led the way up into the attic and mark looked into the room he was struck at once with its bare unfurnished aspect did the boy spend the night here he asked abruptly yes where did he sleep mr sprague saw his mistake too late why the fact is he said hesitating the boy acted badly and i confined him here as a punishment expecting him to sleep on the floor well yes as a punishment how old is the boy ten years old then all i can say is that you treated him very cruelly that aint the way to talk to me blustered sprague i guess i know the way to treat boys youre only a boy yourself that is true but what has that got to do with it you should be more respectful to your elders suppose we get back to business mr sprague has philip ever run away before no and its very ungrateful for him to do it now why i have supported him ever since his fathers death and i paid the expenses of his fathers funeral i shall probably repay you for that when you find and deliver to me the boy this was welcome intelligence to mr sprague who straightway became very polite to mark thank you my dear young friend i wouldnt accept it if i was not a poor man i am very much attached to the boy and i wouldnt let him go if i could afford to keep him oscar go to the village at once and see if you can see anything of philip i will go with him mr sprague very well but be sure to come back before you take him away i certainly shall it would not be fair to you to do otherwise you may get ready the items of expense while i am gone thank you i will how provoking that philip should go away just at this time thought nahum it seems so mysterious too i do hope nothing has happened to the boy or this fellow who seems very sharp may not be willing to pay me my bill meanwhile oscar and mark went to the village do you live in new york asked oscar yes are you mr gilberts son no i am only his messenger and you actually came all the way from new york alone yes did he give you plenty of money for traveling well a pretty good sum answered mark smiling what do you think has become of philip blest if i know i dont see how he could get out of the window i hope he hasnt come to any harm oh i guess not said oscar indifferently do you like the boy asked mark keenly well i dont care much about kids answered oscar have you any idea where philip would be likely to go has he ever left home before no and he wouldnt now if he wasnt crazy at this moment they met albert frost do you know that boy asked mark perhaps he has seen philip i say albert said oscar have you seen anything of philip lillis why do you ask dont he live at your house yes but hes taken french leave something in alberts face led mark to suspect that he knew more of philip than he cared to tell also that he was a friend of the young boy i have come from new york to take philip with me he said significantly a friend of his father is going to adopt him is this sure asked albert yes i am very anxious to find the boy come here said albert perhaps i can put you on his track no not you this last was addressed to oscar now went on albert can i depend on your being a friend of philip yes you can the boy will be in good hands when he reaches new york he isnt now said albert i helped him escape from old spragues last night i can get him for you do so then you are sure sprague wont beat him yes i am to pay him some money and i wont do it if any harm comes to the boy go back with oscar said albert aloud and i will have philip at the house inside of half an hour where is he asked oscar curiously i dont know exactly but i can find him is he at your house no go back and you will soon see him nahum sprague was much pleased when the two boys brought home this intelligence he had prepared a bill for expenses amounting to a hundred dollars on which his profit would be considerable money with him was all powerful and though he would have been glad to give philip a good thrashing he cared still more for money when philip made his appearance accompanied by albert and arthur burks mr sprague greeted him with a genial smile i am almost tempted to call you a bad boy he said you have made me feel quite anxious this young gentleman has come here to take you to new york we shall miss you sadly mrs sprague and i but if it is for your good we wont complain are you willing to go with me philip asked mark philip looked up in marks face and did not hesitate a moment yes he said placing his hand in marks i am ready to go now i dont know whether your clothes are ready said mr sprague they may need washing poor philips appearance was such that mark felt that he would at once have to buy him a new outfit never mind about the clothes mr sprague he said i shall buy philip some new ones when they were preparing to start mr sprague ostentatiously wiped his eyes on a large bandana handkerchief pardon my emotion mr mason he said addressing mark but philip is very near and dear to me and so was his father i cannot part from him without a pang yet if he is to be better off i will not murmur philip my dear child dont forget your uncle nahum i shall remember you mr sprague said philip this at least he could say with truth thank you thank you i thought you would i say kid put in oscar my birthday comes the th of october if youre rich and prosperous you might send me a birthday gift philip smiled all this unwonted attention amused him i wont forget you oscar he said the buggy drove up and mark helped philip inside if you want to cry dont mind me he said to philip with a smile if i cry it will be for joy said philip i never want to see mr sprague or any of his family again chapter xxxiv on the way home at san francisco mark stopped over a day to buy some clothing for philip did mr sprague select your clothes philip asked mark if so i cant compliment him on his taste they are some old clothes of oscars answered philip they are the best i could get well see if san francisco cant furnish you with something better at a clothing store on market street mark bought a complete outfit for philip the latter was much pleased when he saw his transformation in a pier glass in the store now i shall have nothing to remind me of mr sprague he said do you want me to take the old clothes with me no we will leave them here they stopped at the russ house just after supper mark met an old acquaintance the bronzed miner whom he had seen in omaha the latter walked up eagerly and grasped marks hand it does me good to see you again young pard he said and is this the kid yes well upon my word he looks like a little gentleman he has improved in appearance since i made his acquaintance in gulchville said mark with a smile i have just bought him a new outfit so so well fine feathers make fine birds well my boy does mark make you call him father philip laughed heartily at the idea why hes only a boy he rejoined philip said mark with a warning finger you must treat me with proper respect shall i call you father no perhaps it will be more suitable to call me brother mark did you stop over in nevada mr dempsey yes i went to the mine what did you learn that a new york syndicate is trying to purchase the mine and this has carried up the price of stock to two hundred and fifty dollars marks eyes sparkled why that would make mothers share worth fifty thousand dollars he said i advise you to take measures to secure your mothers rights as soon as you reach home there is danger in delay i certainly will follow your advice mr dempsey shall you hold on to your shares no i think i will sell out i have an offer from a man in virginia city which i think i shall accept the stock may go higher but again it may go lower my shares will bring twentyfive thousand dollars and that will make a man like me rich i wish i had control of mothers stock now said mark i could realize a price which would make her comfortable for life the sudden rise in the value of the golden hope shares was already known in new york mr talbot on receiving the intelligence called on his brokers crane lawton would you advise me to sell now mr crane he asked wait a week mr talbot and you may realize a few more points then you had better unload i will be guided by your advice i am sure it is for the best there was still however a feeling of uneasiness in the mind of mr talbot who knew very well that mrs mason was the rightful owner of half the stock which he controlled he decided to call on his sister inlaw once more and urge her to sign a paper releasing him from further liability as executor of her fathers estate i wonder whether mark has got back he said to himself if not probably ellen is very short of money i will offer if necessary five hundred dollars for her signature i dont think she can resist that mrs mason had just finished washing her breakfast dishes when there was a knock at the door opening it she saw the familiar face of tom trotter dressed in the uniform of a western uniform telegraph boy what tom she exclaimed in surprise have you changed your business yes mrs mason answered tom complacently ive give up blackin boots and now im a messenger boy like mark you look very nice in your uniform tom theres another improvement i see what is that mrs mason your hands and face are both clean ive got to keep clean now said tom soberly it seems kind of strange but i guess ill get used do it when i look in the glass i dont hardly know myself dont you like it better well i guess i shall when i get used to it but i forgot ive got a message for you and tom drew out an official envelope it must be from mark said mrs mason in excitement and she tore open the dispatch and read as follows omaha sept shall be home on friday mark mark will be home on friday tom said the happy mother how glad i shall be hurray exclaimed tom thats good news come round and take dinner with us sunday tom well have a little feast in honor of marks return ill see mrs mason i was engaged to take dinner with jay gould but ill telegraph him i cant come i am afraid we cant give you as good a dinner as jay gould youll have mark here and thats better than the best dinner jay can give me shall i wear my swallow tail no your uniform will do tom trotter had hardly gone out when there was another knock at the door on opening it mrs mason was somewhat surprised to see her brotherinlaw solon talbots manner was very gracious and patronizing i hope you are well ellen he said extending his hand thank you i am quite well replied mrs mason and edith too mr talbot seldom took any notice of edith but he had an object to gain now yes edith is well she has just gone to school i think i heard that mark was absent from the city yes he is away he has been gone some time yes i should think you would miss him so i do i miss him constantly you must find it hard to get along without him financially i mean he left some money behind i am not in want ellen i am really sorry to see you living in such a poor way these humble rooms are not suitable for you mrs mason was rather astonished to hear these words from her brotherinlaw she did not understand that he was preparing the way for another offer it would certainly be pleasant for me to live better she said i hope to when mark gets older you had better not count too much upon that an office boys wages seldom amount to much how much does he earn he averaged about five dollars a week as a telegraph messenger so i supposed he may get a dollar or two more in a year or two but what is that it isnt much mrs mason admitted i was talking the matter over with mary the other day and it is largely on her account that i came here this morning to make a proposal to you now its coming thought mrs mason well she said and i have made up my mind to offer you five hundred dollars that is very kind said mrs mason demurely on condition that you sign this paper releasing me from all responsibility as executor of your fathers estate this seems important to you solon said mrs mason keenly it is a matter of form i shall present it at the probate court but it gives me an excuse for offering you a generous gift i will think it over solon think it over what thinking over do you need i am not sure that i can give you time for that as the gift is entirely voluntary on my part i have brought the money with me and in five minutes you can be a comparatively rich woman i have just had a telegram from mark saying that he will be home on friday i will wait till he comes if you will come round saturday i cant promise said talbot deeply disappointed you stand very much in your own light i can make no other answer solon confound that young meddler mark muttered talbot as he left the house but for him i should have no difficulty in obtaining his mothers signature chapter xxxv edgar gets into trouble while solon talbot was intent upon making money his son edgar was left to spend his time pretty much as he pleased his father had secured him a place with a firm of brokers in wall street in fact in the office of crane lawton through whom he intended to dispose of his mining stocks edgar received five dollars a week and this his father allowed him to keep for himself but five dollars a week in a city like new york wont go very far when a boy gives up his evenings to playing pool one night edgar made the acquaintance of a showy young man whom he ignorantly supposed belonged to a prominent new york family it was in fact our old acquaintance hamilton schuyler with whom mark had already had some experiences which did not impress him very much in the young mans favor schuylers attention was drawn to edgar at a poolroom in the neighborhood of fortysecond street and he made inquiries about him ascertaining that edgars father was supposed to be rich he cultivated his acquaintance and flattered him artfully you play a good game of billiards mr talbot he said oh fair answered edgar complacently do you mind having a game with me you probably play a good deal better than i do we can try and see by the way let me introduce myself and he handed edgar his card schuyler hamilton read edgar that is an old name is it not yes answered schuyler carelessly i am related to most of the old knickerbocker families i am very particular whom i associate with but i saw at once that you were a gentleman foolish edgar was very much flattered my father is a capitalist he said we used to live in syracuse but he thinks he can make more money in new york just so there are plenty of chances of making money here i made five thousand dollars in wall street last week myself you did exclaimed edgar dazzled yes sometimes i have made more i dont often lose which ball will you select the spot yes i suppose it takes considerable money to speculate in wall street oh no not on a margin i should like to make a strike myself i am in the office of crane lawton are you indeed i never did any business with them but i understand that they stand very high i think they are rich the game was played and resulted in the success of edgar really you play a strong game suppose just for the excitement of it we stake a dollar on the next game what do you say all right edgar had received his weeks pay in the afternoon and was well provided he flattered himself he could play better than schuyler and thought it would be very agreeable to win money in that way schuyler managed to let him win really he said with pretended annoyance i am afraid you are more than a match for me perhaps i was lucky said edgar elated at any rate i will try again let us call it two dollars very well assented edgar somehow this game was won by his opponent by five points edgar was annoyed for this took a dollar from his pocket and it had been arranged that the loser should pay for the use of the tables it was an accident however and he kept on at the close of the evening he was without a cent i have been unlucky he said trying to hide his mortification i have lost all the money i had with me that is too bad here give me a memorandum for two dollars and i will hand you back that amount some time when you are in funds you can pay me thank you said edgar in a tone of relief you are really a better player than i am went on schuyler but the balls happened to run in my favor another evening i shall be the loser this was the first of edgars acquaintance with schuyler hamilton but it was by no means the last they got into the way of meeting nearly every night and edgar ran more and more into schuylers debt however hamilton was very easy with him he accepted memorandums of indebtedness which somehow seemed a very easy way of paying debts edgar did not reflect that a day of reckoning must come at last at last hamilton schuyler thought it time to bring matters to a crisis do you know how much you are owing me edgar he said one evening no answered edgar uneasily seventyfive dollars it cant be exclaimed edgar incredulous these things increase faster than you think for said schuyler carelessly i suppose youll let it run remarked edgar with a troubled look i should be glad to do so my dear boy but i need the money i was hit rather hard at the races yesterday and the long and short of it is that you will have to pay me i cant pay you said edgar doggedly schuyler frowned what do you mean by that he demanded sternly i mean exactly what i say i havent got any money i only get five dollars a week and i cant spare any of that youve got to get the money you had no business to bet if you couldnt pay i never did bet till i got acquainted with you enough of this boy said hamilton waving his hand in a dignified manner i shall have to lay the matter before your father no dont do that he wouldnt let me keep my wages that is your affair not mine cant you tell him you want to pay a tailors bill and get the money that way no i get my clothes charged at his tailors oh well i dont care how you get it as long as you do get it doesnt your father leave any money lying about in his desk or in his bureau drawers no besides you dont want me to steal do you not if you can get the money any other way look here mr schuyler i thought you were rich how do you happen to be in want of seventyfive dollars anybody might be short of money one day when i was traveling in the adirondacks i met a rich man a millionaire who was in trouble i say schuyler he said to me can you loan me a hundred dollars i give you my word i am almost penniless and no one knows me here now i happened to have three hundred dollars in my pocketbook and i at once produced it and lent him the money you see even a millionaire can get into a money scrape who was the millionaire asked edgar who was not quite so credulous a believer of schuylers pictures as formerly i dont feel at liberty to tell it would not be honorable but to come back to our own business you must make some arrangement to pay me tell me how said edgar sulkily dont you deposit for your firm in the park bank yes always checks sometimes there are bank bills schuyler bent over and whispered in edgars ear edgar flushed and then looked nervous and agitated you ask me to do that he said yes there is no danger say you lost the bills in the street edgar was not a conscientious boy or a boy of high principle but this suggestion shocked him would you ruin me he asked i would have you pay me what you owe me if you dont there will be a fuss i wish i had never met you mr schuyler said poor edgar bitterly i have been disappointed in you said schuyler coldly i thought you were the son of a gentleman and a gentleman yourself who says i am not i dont i expect you to behave like one good night this interview took place on fifth avenue not far from delmonicos cafй when the two parted another boy who had been following at a little distance moved rapidly forward and placed his hand on edgars shoulder cousin edgar he said edgar turned mark he said not with his old hauteur for trouble had humbled his pride yes who was that you were walking with asked mark no one you know he is mr schuyler from one of the best new york families mark smiled i hope you have no business with him he said i owe him seventyfive dollars and i dont know how on earth i am going to pay him what do you owe him that for for bets on games of billiards this hamilton schuyler as he calls himself is an adventurer a swindler and a thief his family is not as good as yours or mine is this true asked edgar stupefied yes dont trouble yourself about what you owe him appoint a meeting for him tomorrow evening at the fifth avenue hotel i will go there and meet him with you ill get you out of your scrape do that mark and ill be your friend for life ill never treat you meanly again chapter xxxvi at the fifth avenue hotel on arriving in new york mark took his young charge at once to the house of mr gilbert it was at the close of the day and mr gilbert had returned from his office he received mark with great cordiality true and faithful as i expected he said how did you enjoy your trip very much sir i hope some day to visit california again so you are philip lillis my boy continued mr gilbert kindly do you think you shall like to live in new york yes sir were you sorry to leave california no sir mr sprague and oscar did not treat me well i would rather live with you your father was a cousin and dear friend i will try to make his boy comfortable and happy mark will you stay to supper i should like to very much but i have not yet seen my mother that is sufficient excuse your first duty is to her wait a moment i must express my acknowledgments to you in a substantial manner mr gilbert sat down at his desk and wrote a check which he inclosed in an envelope open it when you get home he said i have a balance of about forty dollars belonging to you mr gilbert from my expense money keep it i am sure it will be more useful to you than to me how kind you are mr gilbert i hope to continue so take a few days for rest and then come round to my countingroom and we will talk of your future prospects mrs mason gave mark a glad welcome i am so glad to see you she said i hope you did not want for money while i was gone no i still have half the money you gave me from mr gilbert when you went away shall i give it back to you no mother keep it for current expenses mr gilbert gave me a check just now but i dont know how much it is he opened the envelope and took out the check it is for two hundred dollars he exclaimed mother we are growing rich with the balance in my hands which mr gilbert told me to keep i have two hundred and forty dollars we have much to be thankful for mark compare our present state with three months since shall you go back to the telegraph office no mr gilbert will probably give me a place in his countingroom but i shall wait a few days first is there any news your uncle has been to see me again he offered me five hundred dollars if i would sign a release to him as executor you didnt do it no i am glad mother uncle solon is trying to swindle us out of a large sum i heard about the golden hope mine when i was away the shares are booming and i shall tomorrow call on my friend the lawyer and request him to communicate with mr talbot i leave the matter in your hands mark though you are so young you seem to have a judgment beyond your years thank you for the compliment mother i am afraid uncle solon would not agree with you that reminds me i have an engagement with edgar tomorrow evening indeed i thought you and edgar were not friendly he has got into a scrape and i have promised to help him out is it anything serious he owes an adventurer seventyfive dollars and the latter is trying to frighten him into paying it i know the man to be a swindler and shall be able to foil him in his plans if you can be of service to edgar i hope you will he has not treated you well but he is your cousin the next evening edgar talbot walked into the fifth avenue hotel he felt nervous for he did not understand how mark could help him it seemed strange to him that he should be indebted to his poor and almost despised cousin for help in his time of trouble a minute after mark entered looking cheerful and happy good evening edgar he said has our friend schuyler appeared not yet i dont want him to see me at first i will go into the reading room and when you get ready invite him in there first draw him out and see what he proposes to do marks confident manner somewhat allayed edgars alarm he was proud and arrogant but he had little courage he sat down on the sofa at the left hand side of the entrance and in about five minutes hamilton schuyler swaggered in he was carefully dressed and had a rose in his buttonhole i am going to the opera this evening with a fashionable party he said and i shall have to hurry up my business with you i am here on time said edgar i see well i suppose you have brought the money with you you mean the seventyfive dollars of course i do no mr schuyler i have not brought the money and why not i should like to know demanded schuyler with a dark frown because i have no means of getting it that isnt my lookout it is yours that money i must and will have edgar had been told by mark what to say and he replied then i think mr schuyler you will have to sue me nonsense i shall adopt quite a different course what is that i will lay the matter before your father edgar winced but he was prepared with a reply i dont think it will do you any good father wont pay such a bill as that at any rate it will get you into trouble with him yes it might said edgar nervously schuyler saw his advantage he must play upon the fears of his young dupe come edgar he said suppose we talk over this matter sensibly you are indebted to me in the sum of seventyfive dollars i never got any value for it it is the result of several fair and honest bets which you lost as a boy of honor you must pay me i have told you that i dont know where to get the money and i suggested a plan you suggested that i should appropriate some of the money i was given by my employer to deposit in the park bank hush said schuyler apprehensively dont blurt out secrets well you hinted at some such thing i dont care how you get the money if you know what is best for yourself youll get it somehow and somewhere i thought you were wealthy mr schuyler i didnt think you would press me like this i am wealthy but as i told you i have met with some losses recently or i would have given you more time on this debt suppose i cant pay you then you will have to take the consequences that means that you will go to my father not alone that i will let it be known everywhere that you have refused to pay a debt of honor and that will exclude you from the society of gentlemen edgar was unprepared to go further and he thought it time to obtain marks assistance let us go into the reading room he said perhaps we can settle the matter there all right i want to be easy with you and i will agree to take off ten dollars if you will pay me the balance i will see what i can do edgar led the way into the reading room at the rear of the office he saw mark sitting on a chair at the opposite side of the room and he led schuyler up to it schuyler was shortsighted and did not make out mark till edgar said mr schuyler let me introduce you to my cousin mark mason the telegraph boy ejaculated schuyler his face changing i see you know me mr schuyler said mark my cousin tells me you want him to pay you seventyfive dollars i dont know what you have to do with the matter said schuyler stiffly then i will tell you you have imposed yourself upon edgar as a respectable man of good social position while i know you to be an adventurer and a swindler do you mean to insult me demanded schuyler looking around the room nervously i mean to protect my cousin give him the memorandums you have or tear them up and cease to persecute him or i will call in a policeman hamilton schuyler looked furious but he knew mark and his resolute spirit and felt afraid he would do as he threatened you cub he hissed you are always interfering with me he turned upon his heel and left the reading room he wont trouble you any more edgar said mark how can i thank you mark said edgar gratefully you have got me out of a bad scrape that fellow has drained me of every cent i had to borrow five dollars of a clerk in the office to satisfy him and if i pay it i shall have nothing to spend for a week then let me be your banker edgar said mark as he drew a fivedollar note from his pocket and offered it to his cousin can you spare this mark asked edgar in surprise and relief yes i dont know when i can repay you take your own time pay a dollar a week if you like wont you call round at the house asked edgar thank you not this evening i hope the time will come when we can meet each other often mark is a good fellow thought edgar as he walked up fifth avenue i thought he was poor but he seems to be better off than i am chapter xxxvii solon talbots plans solon talbot was much elated by the great rise in the stock of the golden hope mine at two hundred and fifty dollars each the four hundred shares held by his fatherinlaws estate would bring one hundred thousand dollars while only half of this rightfully belonged to him he felt that he was safe in appropriating the whole as he imagined that mark and his mother had no clew to its real ownership he had an offer from crane lawton of a hundred thousand for the stock and this he could obtain at any time he had not thus far been able to obtain mrs masons signature to a release but this he reflected was only a matter of form and need not be regarded mr talbot lived in a flat but desired to own a house with the capital at his command when the mining stock was disposed of he felt sure that he could realize a large income in wall street by dealings in the stock market somehow he seemed to think that the great rise in golden hope stock reflected credit on his sagacity he went to the office of a prominent real estate broker and examined his list of houses for sale one especially pleased him a house on west fortyseventh street in excellent condition which he could buy for fortyfive thousand dollars you can pay twenty thousand dollars down said the broker and the balance can stand on mortgage at five per cent i shall probably pay cash down for the whole responded mr talbot with the air of a capitalist very well mr talbot said the broker respectfully that will of course be satisfactory so would the other arrangement i will decide in a day or two and let you know added talbot when he went home he could not help boasting a little of his proposed purchased mary he said what should you say if i bought a house in brooklyn no i must live here in new york my business will be here i thought new york property came high mr talbot so it does but i propose to go high i suppose you will have to pay as much as twenty thousand dollars for a desirable house twenty thousand dollars what are you thinking of why our house in syracuse was sold for ten thousand dollars and i thought you might have to pay twice as much here i should say so mrs talbot i am in treaty for a house costing fortyfive thousand dollars mrs talbot was astonished i had no idea you could afford to pay so much for a house solon she said my dear i am afraid you underrate my business abilities i havent said anything to you about my business success but i have been making money lately yes i feel that i can afford to pay fortyfive thousand dollars for a house where is the house situated in west fortyseventh street between fifth and sixth avenues thats a fine block a good many fashionable people live there i dont know whether i shall feel at home among them i mean mrs talbot that you shall take a high place in new york society as my wife you will be entitled to such i am not ambitious in that way i should rather be able to see ellen often than to receive fashionable people ahem mrs t you must remember that ellen lives in a very poor way and it would do you harm to have it known that she is your sister you would not have me repudiate my own sister said mrs talbot half indignantly well no not exactly repudiate her but you can receive her early in the morning when no one is likely to be here you must remember also that mark her son has been and perhaps still is a common telegraph boy whom we couldnt have coming freely to the house and claiming relationship with edgar i think mark is a pretty good fellow said edgar unexpectedly it was only the previous evening that mark had got him out of trouble this is a little surprising in you edgar said solon talbot arching his brow i thought you looked down upon him i did but i have changed my opinion of him he is a poor working boy he may be a working boy but he has more money than i he always seems to have plenty of it probably somebody has paid him some money and he carries it all around with him have you seen him since he returned from his journey yes father has he gone back to the telegraph office no he says he shant go back has he any position no he is not working just now he is a foolish boy he will spend the little money he has and then when he wants to go back to the telegraph office they wont receive him i am glad you are on better terms with mark edgar said mrs talbot regarding her son with unusual favor dont be influenced too much by what your mother says edgar said his father social distinctions must be observed for once edgar was not influenced by what his father said he was not wholly bad and marks friendly service in rescuing him from the clutches of hamilton schuyler had quite changed his feelings towards his cousin then the timely loan of five dollars had also its effect this was the day for the meeting of the two sisters at arnold constables mrs talbot informed her sister of her husbands plan i think mr talbot must be getting along very well she said he told me this morning that he is negotiating for a fine brown stone house on west fortyseventh street he is to pay fortyfive thousand dollars for it that is a large sum yes i had no idea when we lived in syracuse that solon was so rich he says that i underrated his business abilities do you know if he has met with any recent business success no he never tells me particulars mrs mason thought she could guess where the fortyfive thousand dollars were coming from and on her return she told mark what she had heard he must be going to sell the stock said mark can we stop him no as executor he would have the right to do this but we must arrange to share the proceeds i will see our lawyer and ask him what is best to be done at this moment there was a knock at the door mark opened it and there stood tom trotter in his new uniform ive got a message for you mark he said who is it from from mr rockwell let me see it the message was brief come round to my office i want to see you luther rockwell how did you happen to bring this message tom i know mr rockwell ive often blacked his boots i guess hes seen us together for when he saw me this morning he asked if i could tell him your address which he had lost ill go right around there said mark perhaps hes going to take you into partnership mark if he does tom ill find a good place in the office for you when mark entered the bankers office he was at once introduced into mr rockwells presence you sent for me sir yes i am thinking of purchasing a block of mining stock and as you have recently been to the pacific coast i thought you might have heard something about it whats the name of the mine sir the golden hope mine marks eyes lighted up yes sir he answered i can tell you a good deal about it from whom do you expect to purchase from crane lawton it is a block of four hundred shares at two hundred and sixty a share held by solon talbot how do you know because he is my uncle and half of the shares belong to my mother chapter xxxviii the mining stock is sold but i understood that you were poor said mr rockwell surprised at marks statement that we are so is because mr talbot as executor has concealed from my mother the existence of the stock as a part of grandfathers estate how long since your grandfather died nearly two years and the stock is only now to be sold yes my uncle had advices that it would be well to wait as it was likely to go up and your mothers share is half say two hundred shares yes sir then she will be comfortable for life at the price i am thinking of paying this will amount to over fifty thousand dollars now can you give me any information about the mine yes sir i made it my business to inquire it is confidently expected to go considerably higher it is growing richer every day i shall rely upon your statements and buy the stock after it is sold i advise you to take immediate steps to secure your share have you consulted a lawyer yes a young man in a matter of this importance an older and more experienced lawyer will be better i will give you a note to my own lawyer thank you sir i am now going to the office of crane lawton where i shall meet your uncle and conclude the business come here in less than two hours and i may be able to tell you the result i will do so solon talbot was much elated when informed by crane lawton that they had found a purchaser for his mining stock in the person of luther rockwell the wellknown banker do you think he would stand a higher price asked talbot it would not be wise to ask it he is very rich he could afford to pay more true but he became rich through prudence and shrewdness sell to him and you wont have to wait for your money no doubt you are right i will be guided by your advice when solon talbot was introduced to mr rockwell he made a deferential bow i am honored in making your acquaintance mr rockwell he said thank you sir the banker would have been more cordial but for what he had heard from mark how long have you owned this stock mr talbot inquired mr rockwell three years it is not held in your name no it belongs to the estate of my late fatherinlaw elisha doane i take it that you are the executor of the estate yes sir solon talbot would not have been so communicative if he had supposed that the banker was a friend to mark he had forgotten marks agency in protecting mr rockwell from the dynamite fiend the stock was probably purchased at a very low figure i presume so though i do not know what was paid for it indeed i never heard of it until i came to examine the items of my fatherinlaws estate he didnt have much else it is fortunate for his heirs yes answered talbot rather nervously he was afraid mr rockwell might inquire who were the other heirs had he done so he would have evaded the question or boldly declared that there was no other heirs except himself after half an hours conversation the purchase was made and a check for one hundred and four thousand dollars was handed to mr talbot i hope you will not have occasion to regret your purchase mr rockwell said solon i think i shall not from advices i have received about increasing richness at the time appointed mark called at mr rockwells office well mark said the lawyer i made the purchase at two hundred and sixty yes i congratulate you that is if i succeed in getting our share from my uncle i will give you a letter to my lawyer mr gerrish obtain a letter from him as your counsel and call tomorrow upon your uncle with a formal demand for your mothers share of the proceeds of the mining stock chapter xxxix conclusion solon talbot went home in high spirits it was only recently that he had become aware of the great value of the golden hope shares it had come to him as an agreeable surprise with what i was worth before he soliloquized i may now rate myself at one hundred and fifty thousand dollars that is very good for a beginning i can afford to buy the house in fortyseventh street for i shall still have a hundred thousand dollars over and in five years i mean to make it half a million he paced up and down his library in a state of joyous excitement no thought of giving his sisterinlaw her rightful due entered his mind how can she find out he reflected old mr doane never told any of us of his mining shares i presume he looked upon them as rather a risky investment it has proved to be a splendid speculation but it was rather a lucky accident than a shrewd purchase illustration mark exclaimed talbot what brings you here page mark masons victory it was after breakfast on the morning succeeding the sale of stock mr talbot was preparing to go over to the house which he proposed to purchase for a last examination before making up his mind when the servant entered the library there is a boy downstairs wishes to see you mr talbot he said perhaps a boy from crane lawton he reflected show him up directly afterwards mark mason entered the room mark exclaimed talbot what brings you here a matter of business uncle solon then you will have to wait for i am just going out the business is important said mark significantly well what is it i understand you sold yesterday the shares in the golden hope mine belonging to grandfathers estate what exclaimed solon talbot his face showing his surprise and dismay there were four hundred shares and they were sold to luther rockwell the banker who told you this have you had any communication from crane lawton no though i know the sale was made through them solon talbot paused long enough to pull himself together it would never do to surrender at discretion he would brazen it out to the last your information is partly true he said i did sell some shares of mining stock but they belonged to me you have nothing to do with them uncle solon said mark composedly it is useless to try to deceive me the four hundred shares were bought by my grandfather and belonged to his estate half of the proceeds rightfully belongs to my mother spots of perspiration stood on solon talbots brow should he allow fifty thousand dollars to slip from his grasp you audacious boy he exclaimed how dare you make such an assertion because i happen to know that the four hundred shares stood in the name of my grandfather elisha doane that is a lie may i ask where you got this information from the purchaser of the stock luther rockwell what do you know of luther rockwell demanded solon talbot incredulous he is one of my best friends before buying the shares of the golden hope mine he asked my advice do you expect me to believe such ridiculous stuff what could you know about the mine i have recently returned from california on the way i stopped in nevada and i have in my pocket a statement signed by the secretary of the company that four hundred shares of the stock stood in the name of my grandfather it was a series of surprises solon talbot walked up and down the library in a state of nervous agitation what do you expect me to do he added finally this letter will inform you uncle solon from whom is it from my lawyer george gerrish mr gerrish as mr talbot knew was one of the leaders of the bar he opened it with trembling hands and read the following mr solon talbot dear sir my client mark mason authorizes me to demand of you an accounting of the sums received by you as executor of the estate of his late grandfather elisha doane to the end that his mother coheiress with your wife may receive her proper shares of the estate an early answer will oblige yours respectfully george gerrish do you know mr gerrish well too asked talbot no sir but mr rockwell gave me a note to him i have had an interview with him say to him that he will hear from me mark bowed and withdrew within a week solon talbot had agreed to make over to his sisterinlaw mrs mason a sum of over fifty thousand dollars representing her share of her fathers estate he reconsidered his purpose of buying the house in west fortyseventh street and decided to remain in the flat which he then occupied mrs mason and mark took a handsome flat up town and henceforth were able to live as well as their pretentious relatives mark was advised by mr rockwell as to the investment of his mothers money and it has already increased considerably he is himself taking a mercantile course at a commercial college and will eventually enter the establishment of mr gilbert with whom he is as great a favorite as ever it never rains but it pours one morning mrs mack the aged miser was found dead in bed she left a letter directing mark to call on her lawyer to his surprise he found that he was left sole heir to the old ladys property amounting to about five thousand dollars what shall i do with it mother he asked i have no rightful claim to it she only left it to me that her nephew might not get it keep it till he gets out of prison and then help him judiciously if he deserves it meanwhile invest it and give the income to charity mark was glad that he was able to follow this advice jack minton is still in jail and it is to be feared that his prison life will not reform him but mark means to give him a chance when he is released through marks influence his old friend tom trotter has been taken into a mercantile establishment where his natural sharpness is likely to help him to speedy promotion mark has agreed to pay his mothers rent for the next three years and has given tom a present of two hundred dollars besides he is not one of those who in prosperity forget their humble friends and now after some years of privation and narrow means mrs mason and mark seem in a fair way to see life on its sunny side i hope my readers will agree that they merit their good fortune on the other hand mr talbot has lost a part of his money by injudicious speculation and his once despised sisterinlaw is now the richer of the two edgar has got rid of his snobbishness and through marks friendship is likely to grow up an
