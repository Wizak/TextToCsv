caution feeling her way past bay and promontory around her was none of that phosphorescent glow which lies above the open ocean even on the darkest night for the mountains ran down to the channel on either side in places they overhung and where they lay upturned against the dim sky it could be seen that they were mantled with heavy timber all day long the nebraska had made her way through an endless succession of straits and sounds now squeezing through an inlet so narrow that the somber spruce trees seemed to be within a short stonesthrow again plowing across some open reach where the pulse of the north pacific could be felt out through the openings to seaward stretched the restless ocean on across uncounted leagues to saghalien and the rim of russias prisonyard always near at hand was the deep green of the canadian forests denser darker than a tropic jungle for this was the land of plenty waters the hillsides were carpeted kneedeep with moss wet to saturation out of every gulch came a brawling stream whipped to milkwhite frenzy snow lay heavy upon the higher levels while now and then from farther inland peered a glacier like some dead monster crushed between the granite peaks there were villages too and fishingstations and mines and quarries these burst suddenly upon the view then slipped past with dreamlike swiftness other ships swung into sight rushed by and were swallowed up in the labyrinthine maze astern those passengers of the nebraska who had never before traversed the inside passage were loud in the praises of its picturesqueness while those to whom the route was familiar seemed to find an everfresh fascination in its shifting scenes among the latter was murray oneil the whole north coast from flattery to st elias was as well mapped in his mind as the face of an old friend yet he was forever discovering new vistas surprising panoramas amazing variations of color and topography the mysterious rifts and passageways that opened and closed as if to lure the ship astray the trackless confusion of islets the siren song of the waterfalls the silent hills and glaciers and snowsoaked forests all appealed to him strongly for he was at heart a dreamer yet he did not forget that scenery such as this lovely as it is by day may be dangerous at night for he knew the weakness of steel hulls on some sides his experience and business training had made him sternly practical and prosaic ships aroused no manner of enthusiasm in him except as means to an end railroads had no glamour of romance in his eyes for having built a number of them he had outlived all poetic notions regarding the iron horse and once the rails were laid he was apt to lose interest in them nevertheless he was almost poetic in his own quiet way interweaving practical thoughts with fanciful visions and he loved his dreams he was dreaming now as he leaned upon the bridge rail of the nebraska peering into the gloom with watchful eyes from somewhere to port came the occasional commands of the officer on watch echoed instantly from the inky interior of the wheelhouse up overside rose the whisper of rushing waters from underfoot came the rhythmic beat of the engines far below oneil shook off his mood and began to wonder idly how long it would be before captain johnny would be ready for his nightcap he always traveled with johnny brennan when he could manage it for the two men were boon companions oneil was wont to live in johnnys cabin or on the bridge and their nightly libation to friendship had come to be a matter of some ceremony the ships master soon appeared from the shadows a short trim man with gray hair come he cried its waiting for us oneil followed into brennans luxurious welllit quarters where on a mahogany sideboard was a tray holding decanter siphon and glasses together with a bottle of ginger ale the captain after he had mixed a beverage for his passenger opened the bottle for himself they raised their glasses silently now that youre past the worst of it remarked oneil i suppose youll turn in youre getting old for a hard run like this johnny captain brennan snorted old im a better man than you yet im a teetotaler thats why i discovered long ago that salt water and whiskey dont mix oneil stretched himself out in one of brennans easychairs really he said i dont understand why a ship carries a captain now of what earthly use to the line are you for instance except for your beauty which no doubt has its value with the women ill admit you preside with some grace at the best table in the diningsalon but your officers know these channels as well as you do they could make the run from seattle to juneau with their eyes shut indeed they could not and neither could i oh well of course i have no respect for you as a man having seen you without your uniform the captain grinned in thorough enjoyment of this raillery ill say nothing at all of my seamanship he said relapsing into the faintest of brogues but theres no denying that the master of a ship has many unpleasant and disgusting duties to perform he has to amuse the prominent passengers who cant amuse themselves for one thing and that takes tact and patience why some people make themselves at home on the bridge in the chartroom and even in my livingquarters to say nothing of consuming my expensive wines liquors and cigars meaning me im a brutal seafaring man and youll have to make allowances for my wellknown brusqueness maybe i did mean you but ill say that next to you curtis gordon is the worst grafter i ever saw you dont like gordon do you oneil queried with a change of tone i do not he went up with me again this spring and he had his widow with him too his widow you know who i mean mrs gerard they say its her money hes using in his schemes perhaps its because of her that i dont like him ahh i see you dont see or you wouldnt grin like an ape im a married man ill have you know and im still on good terms with mrs brennan thank god but i dont like men who use womens money and thats just what our friend gordon is doing what money the widow didnt put up hes grabbed from the schoolmaams and servantgirls and society matrons in the east what has he got to show them for it a railroad project a coppermine some coal claims bah a menagerie of wildcats you cant prove that whats your reason for distrusting him well for one thing he knows too much why he knows everything he does art literature politics law finance and draw poker have no secrets from him hes been everywhere and back twice he speaks a dozen different languages he outargued me on poultryraising and i know more about that than any man living he can handle a drill or a coachandfour he can tell all about the art of ancient babylon and he beat me playing cribbage which shows that he aint on the level hes the bestinformed man outside of a university and he drinks tea of an afternoon with his legs crossed and the saucer balanced on his heel now it takes years of hard work for an honest man to make a success at one thing but gordon never failed at anything i ask you if a living authority on all the branches of human endeavor and a man who can beat me at crib doesnt make you suspicious not at all ive beaten you myself i was sick said captain brennan the man is brilliant and well educated and wealthy its only natural that he should excite the jealousy of a weaker intellect johnny opened his lips for an explosion then changed his mind and agreed sourly hes got money all right and he knows how to spend it he and his valet occupied three cabins on this ship they say his quarters at hope are palatial my dear grampus the mere love of luxury doesnt argue that a person is dishonest would you let a hired man help you on with your underclothes demanded the mariner theres nothing criminal about it humph mrs gerard is different shes all class you dont mind her having a maid and speaking french when she runs short of english her daughter is like her i havent seen miss gerard if youd stir about the ship instead of wearing out my morris chair youd have that pleasure she was on deck all morning captain brennan fell silent and poked with a stubby forefinger at the ice in his glass well out with it said oneil after a moment id like to know the inside story of curtis gordon and this girls mother why bother your head about something that doesnt concern you the speaker rose and began to pace the cabin floor then in an altered tone inquired tell me are you going to land me and my horses at kyak bay that depends on the weather its a rotten harbor youll have to swim them ashore suppose it should be rough then well go on and drop you there coming back i dont want to be caught on that shore with a southerly wind and thats the way it usually blows i cant wait oneil declared a weeks delay might ruin me rather than go on id swim ashore myself without the horses i dont make the weather at kyak bay satan himself does that twenty miles offshore it may be calm and inside it may be blowing a gale thats due to the glaciers those icefields inland and the warm air from the japanese current offshore kick up some funny atmospheric pranks its the worst spot on the coast and well lose a ship there some day why the place isnt properly charted let alone buoyed thats nothing unusual for this coast true for you this is all a graveyard of ships and theres been many a good masters license lost because of halfbaked laws from washington think of a coast like this with almost no lights no beacons nor buoys and yet were supposed to make time its fine in clear weather but in the dark we go by guess and by god ive stood the run longer than most of the skippers but even as brennan spoke the nebraska seemed to halt to jerk backward under his feet oneil who was standing flung out an arm to steady himself the empty gingerale bottle fell from the sideboard with a thump loose articles hanging against the side walls swung to and fro the heavy draperies over captain johnnys bed swayed brennan leaped from his chair his ruddy face was mottled his eyes were wide and horrorstricken damnation he gasped the cabin door crashed open ahead of him and he was on the bridge with oneil at his heels they saw the first officer clinging limply to the rail from the pilothouse window came an excited burst of norwegian then out of the door rushed a quartermaster brennan cursed and met the fellow with a blow which drove him sprawling back get in there swan he bellowed and take your wheel the tide swung her in exclaimed the mate the tide my god sweet queen anne said brennan more quietly youve ripped her belly out it was the tide chattered the officer the steady muffled beating of the machinery ceased the ship seemed suddenly to lose her life but it was plain that she was not aground for she kept moving through the gloom from down forward came excited voices as the crew poured up out of the forecastle brennan leaped to the telegraph and signaled the engineroom he was calm now and his voice was sharp and steady go below mr james and find the extent of the damage he directed and a moment later the hull began to throb once more to the thrust of the propeller inside the wheelhouse swan had recovered from his panic and repeated the masters orders mechanically the second and third officers arrived upon the bridge now dressing as they came and they were followed by the chief engineer to them johnny spoke his words crackling like the sparks from a wireless in an incredibly short time he had the situation in hand and turned to oneil who had been a silent witness of the scene glory be exclaimed the captain most of our good passengers are asleep the jar would scarcely wake them tell me where and how i can help murray offered his first thought had been of the possible effect of this catastrophe upon his plans for time was pressing as for danger he had looked upon it so often and in so many forms that it had little power to stir him but a shipwreck which would halt his northward rush was another matter whether the ship sank or floated could make little difference now that the damage had been done she was crippled and would need assistance his fellowpassengers he knew were safe enough fortunately there were not many of them a scant two hundred perhaps and if worse came to worst there was room in the lifeboats for all but the nebraska had no watertight bulkheads and the plight of his twenty horses between decks filled him with alarm and pity there were no lifeboats for those poor dumb animals penned down yonder in the rushing waters brennan had stepped into the chartroom but returned in a moment to say theres no place to beach her this side of halibut bay how far is that five or six miles youll have to beach her im afraid so she feels queer up from the cabin deck came a handful of men passengers to inquire what had happened behind them a woman began calling shrilly for her husband we touched a rock the skipper explained briefly kindly go below and stop that squawking theres no danger there followed a harrowing wait of several minutes then james the first officer came to report he had regained his nerve and spoke with swift precision she loosened three plates on her port quarter and shes filling fast how long will she last snapped brennan not long sir half an hour perhaps the captain rang for full speed and the decks began to strain as the engine increased its labor get your passengers out and stand by the boats lie ordered take it easy and dont alarm the women have them dress warmly and dont allow any crowding by the men mr tomlinson you hold the steerage gang in check take your revolver with you he turned to his silent friend in whose presence he seemed to feel a cheering sympathy i knew it would come sooner or later murray he said but magnificent mummies to touch on a clear night with the sea like glass he sighed dolefully itll be tough on my missus oneil laid a hand upon his shoulder it wasnt your fault and there will be room in the last boat for you understand brennan hesitated and the other continued roughly no nonsense now dont make a damned fool of yourself by sticking to the bridge promise i promise now what do you want me to do keep those dear passengers quiet ill run for halibut bay where theres a sandy beach if she wont make it ill turn her into the rocks tell em they wont wet a foot if they keep their heads good ill be back to see that you behave yourself the speaker laughed lightly and descended to the deck where he found an incipient panic stewards were pounding on stateroom doors halfclad men were rushing about aimlessly pallid faces peered forth from windows and there was the sound of running feet of slamming doors of shrill hysterical voices oneil saw a waiter thumping lustily upon a door and heard him shout hoarsely everybody out the ship is sinking as he turned away murray seized him roughly by the arm and thrusting his face close to the others said harshly if you yell again like that ill toss you overboard god help us were going oneil shook the fellow until his teeth rattled his own countenance ordinarily so quiet was blazing theres no danger act like a man and dont start a stampede the steward pulled himself together and answered in a calmer tone very well sir i im sorry sir murray oneil was known to most of the passengers for his name had gone up and down the coast and there were few places from san francisco to nome where his word did not carry weight as he went among his fellowtravelers now smiling selfcontained unruffled his presence had its effect women ceased their shrilling men stopped their senseless questions and listened to his directions with some comprehension in a short time the passengers were marshaled upon the upper deck where the lifeboats hung between their davits each little craft was in charge of its allotted crew the electric lights continued to burn brightly and the panic gradually wore itself out meanwhile the ship was running a desperate race with the sea striving with every ounce of steam in her boilers to find a safe berth for her mutilated body before the inrush of waters drowned her fires that the race was close even the dullest understood for the nebraska was settling forward and plowed into the night head down like a thing maddened with pain she was becoming unmanageable too and oneil thought with pity of that little ironhearted skipper on the bridge who was fighting her so furiously there was little confusion little talking upon the upper deck now only a child whimpered or a woman sobbed hysterically but down forward among the steerage passengers the case was different these were mainly montenegrins polacks or slavs bound for the construction camps to the westward and they surged from side to side like cattle requiring tomlinsons best efforts to keep them from rushing aft oneil had employed thousands of such men in fact many of these very fellows had cashed his timechecks and knew him by sight he went forward among them and his appearance proved instantly reassuring he found his two hostlers and with their aid he soon reduced the mob to comparative order but in spite of his confident bearing he felt a great uneasiness the nebraska seemed upon the point of diving he judged she must be settling very fast and wondered that the forward tilt did not lift her propeller out of the water fortunately however the surface of the sound was like a polished floor and there were no swells to submerge her overside to starboard he could see the dim black outlines of mountains slipping past but where lay halibut bay or what distance remained to be covered he could but vaguely guess in these circumstances the wait became almost unbearable the race seemed hours long the mites stretched into leagues and with every moment of suspense the ship sank lower the end came unexpectedly there was a sudden startled outcry as the nebraska struck for a second time that night she rose slightly rolled and bumped grated briefly then came to rest captain brennan shouted from the bridge fill your lifeboats mr james and lower away carefully a cheer rose from the huddled passengers the boilerroom was still dry it seemed for the incandescent lights burned without a flicker even after the grimy oilers and stokers had come pouring up on deck oneil climbed to the bridge is this halibut bay he asked captain johnny it is but were piled up on the reef outside she may hold fast i hope so for theres deep water astern and if she slips off shell go down id like to save my horses said the younger man wistfully through all the strain of the past halfhour or more his uppermost thought had been for them but brennan had no sympathy for such sentiments hells bells he exclaimed dont talk of horses while weve got women and children aboard he hastened away to assist in transferring his passengers instead of following oneil turned and went below he found that the water was kneedeep on the port side of the deck where his animals were quartered which showed that the ship had listed heavily he judged that she must be much deeper by the head then he had imagined and that her nose was crushed in among the rocks until she settled at the stern therefore the case was not quite hopeless his appearance the sound of his voice were the signals for a chorus of eager whinnies and a great stamping of hoofs heads were thrust toward him from the stalls alert ears were pricked forward satin muzzles rubbed against him as he calmed their terror this blind trust made the mans throat tighten achingly he loved animals as he loved children and above all he cared for horses he understood them he spoke their language as nearly as any human can be said to do so quivering muscles relaxed beneath his soothing palm he called them by name and they answered with gentle twitching lips against his cheek some of them even began to eat and switch their tails contentedly he cursed aloud and made his way down the sloping deck to the square iron door or port through which he had loaded them but he found that it was jammed or held fast by the pressure outside and after a few moments work in water above his knees he climbed to the starboard side here the entrance was obstructed by a huge pile of baled hay and grain in sacks it would be no easy task to clear it away and he fell to work with desperate energy for the ship was slowly changing her level her stern which had been riding high was filling the sea stole in upon him silently it crept up toward him until the horses stabled on the lower side were bellydeep in it their distress communicated itself to the others oneil knew that his position might prove perilous if the hulk should slip backward off the reef yet he continued to toil hurling heavy sacks behind him bundling awkward bales out of the way until his hands were bleeding and his muscles ached he was perspiring furiously the commotion around him was horrible then abruptly the lights went out leaving him in utter blackness the last fading yellow gleam was photographed briefly upon his retina tears mingled with the sweat that drained down his cheeks as he felt his way slowly out of the place splashing stumbling groping uncertainly a horse screamed in a loud horribly human note and he shuddered he was sobbing curses as he emerged into the cool open air on the forward deck his eyes were accustomed to the darkness now and he could see something of his surroundings he noted numerous lights out on the placid bosom of the bay evidently lanterns on the lifeboats and he heard distant voices he swept the moisture from his face then with a start he realized his situation he listened intently his eyes roved back along the boatdeck there was no doubt about it the ship was deserted stepping to the rail he observed how low the nebraska lay and also that her bow was higher than her stern from somewhere beneath his feet came a muffled grinding and a movement which told him that the ship was seeking a more comfortable berth he recalled stories of explosions and of the boiling eddies which sometimes accompany sinking hulls turning he scrambled up to the cabindeck and ran swiftly toward his stateroom ii how a girl appeared out of the night oneil felt for the little bracketlamp on the wall of his stateroom and lit it by its light he dragged a lifepreserver from the rack overhead and slipped the tapes about his shoulders reflecting that alaskan waters are disagreeably cold then he opened his travelingbags and dumped their contents upon the white counterpane of his berth selecting out of the confusion certain documents and trinkets the latter he thrust into his pockets as he found them the former he wrapped in handkerchiefs before stowing them away the ship had listed now so that it was difficult to maintain a footing the lamp hung at a grotesque angle and certain articles had become dislodged from their restingplaces from outside came the gentle lapping of waters a gurgling and hissing as of air escaping through the decks he could feel the ship strain he acknowledged that it was not pleasant thus to be left alone on a sinking hulk particularly on an inkblack night all at once he whirled and faced the door with an exclamation of astonishment for a voice had addressed him there clinging to the casing stood a woman a girl evidently drawn out of the darkness by the light which streamed down across the sloping deck from his stateroom plainly she had but just awakened for she was clothed in a silken nightrobe which failed to conceal the outlines of her body the swelling contour of her bosom the ripened fullness of her limbs she had flung a quilted dressinggown of some sort over her shoulders and with one bare arm and hand strove to hold it in place he saw that her pink feet were thrust into soft heeless slippers that her hair black in this light cascaded down to her waist and that her eyes which were very dark and very large were fixed upon him with a stare like that of a sleepwalker it is so dark so strange so still she murmured what has happened god didnt they waken you he cried in sharp surprise is the shipsinking her odd bewilderment of voice and gaze puzzled him he nodded we struck a rock the passengers have been taken off were the only ones left in heavens name where have you been i was asleep he shook his head in astonishment how you failed to hear that hubbub i heard something but i was ill my head i took something to ease the pain ah medicine it hasnt worn off yet i see you shouldnt have taken it drugs are nothing but poison to young people now at my age there might be some excuse for resorting to them but you he was talking to cover the panic of his thoughts for his own predicament had been serious enough and her presence rendered it doubly embarrassing what in the world to do with her he scarcely knew his lips were smiling but his eyes were grave as they roved over the cabin and out into the blackness of the night are we going to drown she asked dully nonsense he laughed in apparent amusement showing his large strong teeth she came closer glancing behind her and shrinking from the oily waters which could be seen over the rail and which had stolen up nearly to the sill of the door she steadied herself by laying hold of him uncertainly involuntarily he turned his eyes away for he felt shame at profaning her with his gaze she was very soft and white a fragile thing utterly unfit to cope with the night air and the freezing waters of halibut bay im wretchedly afraid she whispered through white lips none of that he said brusquely i ll see that nothing happens to you he slipped out of his lifepreserver and adjusted it over her shoulders first drawing her arms through the sleeves of her dressinggown and knotting the cord snugly around her waist just as a matter of precaution he assured her we may get wet can you swim she shook her head never mind i can he found another lifebelt fitted it to his own form and led her out upon the deck the scuppers were awash now and she gasped as the sea licked her bare feet cold isnt it he remarked but theres no time to dress and its just as well perhaps for heavy clothes would only hamper you she strove to avoid the icy waters and finally paused moaning i cant i cant go on slipping his arm about her he bore her to the door of the main cabin and entered he could feel her warm soft body quivering against his own she had clasped his neck so tightly that he could scarcely breathe but lowering her until her feet were on the dry carpet he gently loosed her arms now my dear child he told her you must do exactly as i tell you come calm yourself or i wont take you any farther he held her off by her shoulders i may have to swim with you you mustnt cling to me so he heard her gasp and felt her draw away abruptly then he led her by the hand out upon the starboard deck and together they made their way forward to the neighborhood of the bridge the lights he had seen upon coming from the forward hold were still in view and he hailed them at the top of his voice but other voices were calling through the night some of them comparatively close at hand others answering faintly from far inshore the boats first launched were evidently landing and those in charge of them were shouting directions to the ones behind some women had started singing and the chorus floated out to the man and the girl pull for the shore sailor pull for the shore it helped to drown their cries for assistance oneil judged that the ship was at least a quarter of a mile from the beach and his heart sank for he doubted that either he or his companion could last long in these waters it occurred to him that brennan might be close by waiting for the nebraska to sink it would be unlike the little captain to forsake his trust until the last possible moment but he reasoned that the cargo of lives in the skippers boat would induce him to stand well off to avoid accident he called lustily time after time but no answer came meanwhile the girl stood quietly beside him cant we make a raft she suggested timidly when he ceased to shout ive read of such things theres no time he told her are you very cold she nodded please forgive me for acting so badly just now it was all so sudden and so awful i think i can behave better oh what was that she clutched him nervously for from the forward end of the ship had come a muffled scream like that of a woman its my poor horses said the man and she looked at him curiously prompted by the catch in his throat there followed a wait which seemed long but was in reality of but a few minutes for the ship was sliding backward and the sea was creeping upward faster and faster at last they heard a shuddering sigh as she parted from the rocks and the air rushed up through the deck openings with greater force the nebraska swung sluggishly with the tide then when her upper structure had settled flush with the sea murray oneil took the woman in his arms and leaped clear of the rail the first gasping moment of immersion was fairly paralyzing after that the reaction came and the two began to struggle away from the sinking ship but the effect of the reaction soon wore off the water was cruelly cold and their bodies ached in every nerve and fiber oneil did his best to encourage his companion he talked to her through his chattering teeth and once she had recovered from the mental shock of the first fearful plunge she responded pluckily he knew that his own heart was normal and strong but he feared that the girls might not be equal to the strain had he been alone he felt sure that he could have gained the shore but with her upon his hands he was able to make but little headway the expanse of waters seemed immense it fairly crushed hope out of him the lights upon the shore were as distant as fixed stars this was a country of heavy tides he reflected and he began to fear that the current was sweeping them out he turned to look for the ship but could see no traces of her and since it was inconceivable that the nebraska could have sunk so quietly her disappearance confirmed his fears more than once he fancied he heard an answer to his cries for help the rattle of rowlocks or the splash of oars but his ears proved unreliable after a time the girl began to moan with pain and terror but as numbness gradually robbed her of sensation she became quiet a little later her grip upon his clothing relaxed and he saw that she was collapsing he drew her to him and held her so that her face lay upturned and her hair floated about his shoulders in this position she could not drown at least while his strength lasted but he was rapidly losing control of himself his teeth were clicking loosely his muscles shook and twitched it required a great effort to shout and he thought that his voice did not carry so far as at first therefore he fell silent paddling with his free arm and kicking to keep his blood stirring several times he gave up and floated quietly but courage was ingrained in him deep down beneath his consciousness was a vitality an inherited stubborn resistance to death of which he knew nothing it was that unidentified quality of mind which supports one man through a great sickness or a long period of privation while another of more robust physique succumbs it was the same quality which brings one man out from desert wastes or the white silence of the polar ice while the bodies of his fellows remain to mark the trail this innate power of supreme resistance is found in chosen individuals throughout the animal kingdom and it was due to it alone that murray oneil continued to fight the tide long after he had ceased to exert conscious control at length there came through the mans dazed sensibilities a sound different from those he had been hearing it was a human voice mingled with the measured thud of oars in their sockets it roused him like an electric current and gave him strength to cry out hoarsely some one answered him then out of the darkness to seaward emerged a deeper blot which loomed up hugely yet proved to be no more than a lifeboat banked full of people it came to a stop within an oarslength of him from the babble of voices he distinguished one that was familiar and cried the name of johnny brennan his brain had cleared now a great dreamlike sense of thanksgiving warmed him and he felt equal to any effort he was vaguely amazed to find that his limbs refused to obey him his own name was being pronounced in shocked tones the splash from an oar filled his face and strangled him but he managed to lay hold of the blade and was drawn in until outstretched hands seized him an oarsman was saying be careful there we cant take him in without swamping but brennans voice shouted make room or ill bash in your bloody skull another protest arose and oneil saw that the craft was indeed loaded to the gunwales take the girl quick he implored ill hang on you can tow me the limp form was removed from his side and dragged over the thwarts while a murmur of excited voices went up can you hold out for a minute murray asked brennan yes i think so id give you my place but youre too big to be taken in without danger go ahead chattered the man in the water look after the girl before its too late the captains stout hand was in his collar now and he heard him crying pull you musclebound heathens everybody sit still now away with her men keep up your heart murray my boy remember it takes more than water to kill a good irishman its only a foot or two farther and theyve started a fire serves you right you big idiot for going overboard with all those boats man dear but youre pulling the arm out of me its stretched out like a garden hose hey cover up that girl and you lady rub her feet and hands good move over please so the men can bail the next oneil knew he was feeling very miserable and very cold notwithstanding the fact that he was wrapped in dry clothing and lay so close to a roaring spruce fire that its heat blistered him brennan was bending over him with eyes wet he was swearing too in a weak faltering way calling upon all the saints to witness that the prostrate man was the embodiment of every virtue and that his death would be a national calamity others were gathered about men and women and among them oneil saw the doctor from sitka whom he had met on shipboard as soon as he was able to speak he inquired for the safety of the girl he had helped to rescue johnny promptly reassured him man dear shes doing fine a jigger of brandy brought her to gasping like a blessed mermaid was anybody lost praise god not a soul but its lucky i stood by to watch the old tub go down or wed be mourning two youll be well by morning for theres a cannery in the next inlet and ive sent a boats crew for help and now my boy lay yourself down again and take a sleep wont you it ll be doing you a lot of good but oneil shook his head and struggled to a sitting posture thanks johnny said he but i couldnt i can hear those horses screaming and besides i must make new plans iii the irish prince as dawn broke the cannery tender from the station near by nosed her way up to the gravelly shore where the castaways were gathered and blew a cheering toottoot on her whistle she was a flatbottomed wetsterned craft and the passengers of the nebraska trooped to her deck over a gangplank as captain brennan had predicted not one of them had wet a foot with the exception of the two who had been left aboard through their own carelessness by daylight halibut bay appeared an idyllic spot quite innocent of the terrors with which the night had endowed it a pebbled halfmoon of beach was set in among rugged bluffs the verdant forest crowded down to it from behind tiny crystal wavelets lapped along the shingle swaying the brilliant sea mosses which clung to the larger rocks altogether the scene gave a strong impression of peace and security yet just in the offing was one jarring contrast the masts and funnel of the nebraska slanting up out of the blue serenity where she lay upon the sloping bottom in the edge of deep water the reaction following a sleepless night of anxiety had replaced the first feeling of thankfulness at deliverance and it was not a happy cargo of humanity which the rescuing boat bore with her as the sun peeped over the hills many of the passengers were but half dressed all were exhausted and hungry each one had lost something in the catastrophe the men were silent the women hysterical the children fretful murray oneil had recovered sufficiently to go among them with the same warm smile which had made him friends from the first in the depths of his cool gray eyes was a sparkle which showed his unquenchable celtic spirit and before long smiles answered his smiles jokes rose to meet his pleasantries it was his turn now to comfort captain johnny brennan who had yielded to the blackest despair once his responsibility was over she was a fine ship murray the master lamented staring with tragic eyes at the nebraskas spars she was a tin washtub and rusted like a sieve jeered oneil but think of me losing her on a still night im not sure yet that it wasnt a jellyfish that swam through her humph i suppose her cargo will be a total loss two hundred thousand dollars insured for three hundred no doubt ill warrant the company will thank you its kind of you to cheer me up said brennan a little less gloomily especially after the way i abandoned you to drown but the missus wont allow me in the house at all when she hears i left you in pickle thank god the girl didnt die anyway ive got that to be thankful for curtis gordon would have broken me gordon sure man dear dont you know who you went bathing with shes the daughter of that widow gerard and the most prominent passenger aboard outside of your blessed self aint that luck if i was a jap id split myself open with a breadknife but fortunately youre a sensible harp of old ireland ill see that the papers get the right story o buck up do you think for a minute that mrs brennan will understand why i didnt hop out of the lifeboat and give you my place not at all im ruined nautically and domestically in the course of the next ten years i may live it down but meanwhile ill sleep in the woodshed and speak when im spoken to murray knew that miss gerard had been badly shaken by her ordeal hence he made no attempt to see her even after the steamer had reached the fishingvillage and the rescued passengers had been taken in by the residents instead he went directly to the one store in the place and bought its entire stock which he turned over to the sufferers it was well he did so for the village was small and although the townspeople were hospitable both food aad clothing were scarce a southbound steamer was due the next afternoon it was learned and plans were made for her to pick up the castaways and return them to seattle at the same time oneil discovered that a freighter for the westward was expected some time that night and as she did not call at this port he arranged for a launch to take him out to the channel where he could intercept her the loss of his horses had been a serious blow it was all the more imperative now that he should go on since he would have to hire men to do horses work during the afternoon miss gerard sent for him and he went to the house of the cannery superintendent where she had been received the superintendents wife had clothed her and she seemed to have recovered her poise of body and mind oneil was surprised to find her quite a different person from the frightened and disheveled girl he had seen in the yellow lamplight of his stateroom on the night before she was as pale now as then but her expression of terror and bewilderment had given place to one of reposeful confidence her lips were red and ripe and of a somewhat haughty turn she was attractive certainly despite the disadvantage of the borrowed garments and though she struck him as being possibly a little proud and cold there was no lack of warmth in her greeting for her part she beheld a man of perhaps forty of commanding height and heavy build he was gray about the temples his eyes were gray too and rather small but they were extremely animated and kindly and a myriad of little lines were penciled about their corners these were evidently marks of expression not of age and although the rugged face itself was not handsome it had a degree of character that compelled her interest his clothes were good and in spite of their recent hard usage they still lent him the appearance of a man habitually well dressed she was vaguely disappointed having pictured him as being in the first flush of vigorous youth but the feeling soon disappeared under the charm of his manner the ideal figure she had imagined began to seem silly and schoolgirlish unworthy of the man himself she was pleased too by his faint though manifest embarrassment at her thanks for she had feared a lack of tact above all things she abhorred obligation of any sort and she was inclined to resent masculine protection this mans service filled her with real gratitude yet she rebelled at the position in which it placed her she preferred granting favors to receiving them but in fact he dismissed the whole subject so brusquely that he almost offended her and when she realized how incomplete had been her acknowledgment she said with an air of pique you might have given me a chance to thank you without dragging you here against your will im sorry if i seemed neglectful she fell silent for a moment before asking do you detest me for my cowardice i couldnt blame you for never wanting to see me again you were very brave you were splendid he declared i simply didnt wish to intrude i was terribly frightened she confided but i felt that i could rely upon you thats what every one does isnt it you see you have a reputation they told me how you refused to be taken into the boat for fear of capsizing it that was fine oh there was nothing brave about that i wanted to get in badly enough but there wasnt room jove it was cold wasnt it his ready smile played whimsically about his lips and the girl felt herself curiously drawn to him since he chose to make light of himself she determined to allow nothing of the sort they have told me how you bought out this whole funny little place she said and turned it over to us is it because you have such a royal way of dispensing favors that they call you the irish prince thats only a silly nickname i dont think so you give people food and clothes with a careless wave of the hand you give me my life with a shrug and a smile you offer to give up your own to a boatful of strangers without a moments hesitation i i think you are a remarkable person youll turn my head with such flattery if you arent careful he said with a slight flush please talk of something sensible now for an antidote your plans for instance my plans are never sensible and what few i have are as empty as my pockets to tell the truth i have neither plans nor pockets she laughed since this is a borrowed gown pockets in gowns are entirely matters of hearsay anyhow i doubt if they exist you are going back to seattle oh i suppose so it seems to be my fate but im not a bit resigned im one of those unfortunate people who cant bear to be disappointed you can return on the next ship at the companys expense no mother would never allow it in fact when she learns that im out here shell probably send me back to new york as fast as i can go doesnt she know where you are indeed no she thinks im safely and tamely at home uncle curtis wouldnt object to my visit i fancy at any rate ive been counting on his good offices with mother but its too late now im like you he said i cant brook disappointment im going on in answer to her questioning look he explained his plan of intercepting the freightsteamer that night whereupon her face brightened with sudden hope cant i go too she implored eagerly she was no longer the haughty young lady he had met upon entering the room but a very wistful child im afraid thats hardly oh if only you knew how much it means if only you knew how badly i want to im not afraid of discomforts its not that please please be a real prince and grant me this boon wont you my heart is set upon it it was hard to resist her imploring eyes eyes which showed they had never been denied it was hard for oneil to refuse anything to a woman if your uncle is willing he began hesitatingly he isnt my really uncle i just call him that well if mr gordon wouldnt object perhaps i can manage it provided of course you promise to explain to your mother miss gerards frank delight showed that she was indeed no more than a child her changed demeanor awakened a doubt in the mans mind it will mean that youll have to sit up all night in an open launch he cautioned her ill sit up for a week with the creepy water all about and big black mountains frowning at you oh fiddle she exclaimed youll be there if i get frightened rising impulsively she laid her hand on his arm and thanked him with an odd mingling of frankness and shyness as if there could be no further doubt of his acquiescence he saw that her eyes were the color of shaded woodland springs and that her hair was not black but of a deep rich brown where the sun played upon it the hue of very old mahogany with the same bloodred flame running through it he allowed himself to admire her in silence until suddenly she drew back with a startled exclamation what is it i forgot i have no clothes her words came with a doleful cadence the universal complaint of your sex he said smiling allow me to talk with your hostess im sure she will let you walk out with your borrowed finery just like cinderella youll need a nice thick coat too but this is her very very best dress she shall receive on the next ship a big box all lined with tissuepaper with the imprint of the most fashionable dressmaker in seattle ill arrange all that by cable you dont know how she loves it the girl said doubtfully come call her in if im to be a prince you mustnt doubt my power nor did the event prove him overconfident before he had fairly made known his request the good lady of the house was ready to surrender not only her best sunday gown but her fluttering heart as well murray oneil had a way of making people do what he wanted and women invariably yielded to him iv how a journey ended at hope to natalie gerard the trip down the bay and into the sound that night was a wonderful adventure she remembered it afterward far more vividly than the shipwreck which became blurred in retrospect so that she soon began to think of it as of some halfforgotten nightmare to begin with the personality of murray oneil intrigued her more and more the man was so strong so sympathetic and he had such a resistless way of doing things the stories she had heard of him were romantic and the superintendents wife had not allowed them to suffer in the telling natalie felt elated that such a remarkable person should exert himself on her behalf and the journey itself impressed her imagination deeply although it was nine oclock when they boarded the launch it was still light the evening was yellow with the peculiar diffused radiance of high latitudes lending a certain somberness to their surroundings the rushing tide the ragged rockteeth which showed through it the trackless unending forests that clothed the hills in every direction awed her a little yet gave her an unaccustomed feeling of freedom and contentment the long wait out between the lonely islands where the tiny cockleshell rolled strangely although the sea seemed as level as a floor held a subtle excitement darkness crept down out of the unpeopled gorges and swallowed them up thrilling her with a sense of mystery when midnight came she found that she was ravenously hungry and she was agreeably surprised when oneil produced an elaborate lunch there were even thermos bottles filled with steaming hot coffee more delicious she thought than anything she had ever before tasted he called the meal their aftertheater party pretending that they had just come from a broadway melodrama of shipwreck and peril the subject led them naturally to talk of new york and she found he was more familiar with the city than she i usually spend my winters there he explained then you have an office in the city oh yes ive maintained a place of business there for years where is it on wall street no he smiled on upper fifth avenue its situated in the extreme southwest corner of the mens cafe at the holland house it consists of a round mahogany table and a leather settee really thats where im to be found at least four months out of every twelve they told me you built railroads i do when im lucky enough to underbid my competitors but that isnt always and railroads arent built every day mr gordon is building one so im told oneil marveled at the trick of fortune which had entangled this girl and her mother in the web of that brilliant and unscrupulous adventurer perhaps it will be a great success like your famous north pass yukon railway let us hope so he was tempted to inquire what use gordon had made of that widely advertised enterprise in floating his own undertaking but instead he asked your mother has invested heavily has she not not in the railroad her fortune and mine too is all in the coal mines oneil smothered an exclamation what is it she demanded nothing only are you sure oh quite sure the mines are rich arent they there are no mines he informed her thanks to our misguided lawmakers at washington there are vast deposits of fine coal which would make mines if we were allowed to work them but we are not allowed we are you a a coal person like us yes i was one of the first men in the kyak fields and i invested heavily i know mr gordons group of claims well i have spent more than a hundred thousand dollars trying to perfect my titles and im no nearer patent now than i was to begin with not so near in fact i fancy gordon has spent as much and is in the same fix it is a coal matter which brings me to alaska now i hardly understand of course not and you probably wont after i explain you see the government gave us gave everybody who owns coal locations in alaska three years in which to do certain things then it extended that time another three years but recently a new secretary of the interior has come into office and he has just rescinded that later ruling without warning which gives us barely time to comply with the law as it first stood for my part ill have to hustle or lose everything i have put in you see thats why i hated to see those horses drown for i intended to use them in reaching the coalfields now ill have to hire men to carry their loads no doubt mr gordon has arranged to protect your holdings but there are hundreds of claimants who will be ruined i supposed the government protected its subjects said the girl vaguely one of the illusions taught in the elementary schools laughed oneil we alaskans have found that it does exactly the opposite we have found it a harsh and unreasonable landlord but im afraid im boring you he wrapped her more snugly in her coverings for a chill had descended with the darkness then strove to enliven her with stories garnered from his rich experience stories which gave her fascinating glimpses of great undertakings and made her feel personally acquainted with people of unfamiliar type whose words and deeds mirthful or pathetic were always refreshingly original of certain individuals he spoke repeatedly until their names became familiar to his hearer he called them his boys and his voice was tender as he told of their doings these men are your staff she ventured yes every one who succeeds in big work must have loyal hands to help him where are they now oh scattered from canada to mexico each one doing his own particular work theres mellen for instance hes in chihuahua building a cantilever bridge hes the best steel man in the country mckay my superintendent is running a railroad job in california happy tom slater the funny man with the blues exactly he was at work on a hydraulic project near dawson the last i heard of him dr gray is practising in seattle and parker the chief engineer has a position of great responsibility in boston he is the brains of our outfit you understand it was really he who made the north pass yukon possible the others are scattered out in the same way but theyd all come if i called them the first note of pride she had detected crept into his voice when he said my boys are never idle they dont have to be after working with me and what is your part of the work asked the girl i oh im like marcelline the clown at the hippodrome always pretending to help but forever keeping underfoot when it becomes necessary i raise the money to keep the performance going do you really mean that all those men would give up their positions and come to you if you sent for them by the first train or afoot if there were no other way theyd follow me to the philippines or timbuctoo regardless of their homes and their families that is splendid you must feel very proud of inspiring such loyalty said natalie but why are you idle now surely there are railroads to be built somewhere yes i was asked to figure on a contract in manchuria the other day i could have had it easily and it would have meant my everlasting fortune but but what i found it isnt a white mans country its sickly and unsafe some of my boys would die before we finished it and the game isnt worth that price no ill wait something better will turn up it always does as natalie looked upon that kindly squarehewn face with its tracery of lines about the eyes its fine strong jaw and its indefinable expression of power she began to understand more fully why those with whom she had talked had spoken of murray oneil with an almost worshipful respect she felt very insignificant and purposeless as she huddled there beside him and her complacence at his attentions deepened into a vivid sense of satisfaction thus far he had spoken entirely of men she wondered if he ever thought of women and thrilled a bit at the intimacy that had sprung up between them so quickly and naturally it confirmed her feeling of prideful confidence in the man that the northbound freighter should punctually show her lights around the islands and that she should pause in her majestic sweep at the signal of this pigmy craft the ship loomed huge and black and terrifying as the launch at length drew in beneath it its sides towered like massive unscalable ramparts there was a delay there seemed to be some querulousness on the part of the officer in command at being thus halted some doubt about allowing strangers to come aboard but the girl smiled to herself as the voices flung themselves back and forth through the night once they learned who it was that called from the sea their attitude would quickly change sure enough in a little while orders were shouted from the bridge she heard men running from somewhere and a rope ladder came swinging down oneil was lifting her from her warm nest of rugs now and telling her to fear nothing the launch crept closer coughing and shuddering as if in terror at this close contact there was a brief instant of breathlessness as the girl found herself swung out over the waters then a short climb with oneils protecting hand at her waist and she stood panting radiant upon steel decks which began to throb and tremble to the churning engines one further task remained for her protectors magic powers it appeared that there were no quarters on the ship for women but after a subdued colloquy between murray and the captain she was led to the cleanest and coziest of staterooms high up near the bridge over the door she glimpsed a metal plate with the words first officer lettered upon it oneil was bidding her good night and wishing her untroubled rest then almost before she had accustomed herself to her new surroundings an immaculate though sleepy japanese steward stood before her with a tray he was extremely cheerful for one so lately awakened being still aglow with pleased surprise over the banknote which lay neatly folded in his waistcoat pocket natalie sat crosslegged on her berth and munched with the appetite of a healthy young animal at the fruit and biscuits and lovely heavy cake which the steward had brought she was very glad now that she had disobeyed her mother it was high time indeed to assert herself for she was old enough to know something of the world and her judgment of men was mature enough to insure perfect safety that much had been proved she felt that her adventure had been a great success practically and romantically she wanted to lie awake and think it over in detail but she soon grew sleepy just before she dozed off she wondered drowsily if the irish prince had found quarters for himself then reflected that undoubtedly the captain had been happy to tumble out of bed for him or perhaps he felt no fatigue and would watch the night through even now he might be pacing the deck outside her door at any rate he was not far off she closed her eyes feeling deliciously secure and comfortable in one way the southern coast of alaska may be said to be perhaps a million years younger than any land on this continent for it is still in the glacial period the vast alluvial plains and valleys of the interior are rimmed in to the southward and shut off from the pacific by a wellnigh impassable mountain barrier the top of which is capped with perpetual snow its gorges for the most part run rivers of ice instead of water europe has nothing like these glaciers which overflow the alaskan valleys and submerge the hills for many of them contain more ice than the whole of switzerland this range is the andes of the north and it curves westward in a magnificent sweep hugging the shore for a thousand leagues against it the sea beats stormily its frozen crest is played upon by constant rains and fogs and blizzards but over beyond lies a land of sunshine of long dry golden summer days into this chaos of cliff and peak and slanting canyon midway to the westward is let king phillip sound a sheet of water dotted with islands and framed by forests it reaches inland with long crooked tentacles which end like talons in living ice hidden some forty miles up one of these upon the moraine of a receding glacier sits cortez a thriving village and long the point of entry to the interior the commencement of the overland trail to the golden valleys of the yukon and the tanana the government wagon trail winds in from here tracing its sinuous course over one pass after another until it emerges into the undulating prairies of the inside country looking at the map one would imagine that an easier gateway to the heart of alaska would be afforded by the valley of the salmon river which enters the ocean some few miles to the eastward of king phillip sound but there are formidable difficulties the stream bursts the last rampart of the coast range asunder by means of a canyon down which it rages in majestic fury and up which no craft can navigate then it spreads itself out through a dozen shallow mouths across a fortymile delta of silt and sand and glacial wash as if nature feared her arctic strongbox might still be invaded by this route she has placed additional safeguards to the approach in the form of giant glaciers through the very bowels of which the salmon river is forced to burrow in the early days of the klondike rush men had attempted to ascend the valley but they had succeeded only at the cost of such peril and disaster that others were warned away the region had become the source of many weird stories and while the icefields could be seen from the kyak coalfields and on still days their cannonading could be heard far out at sea there were few who had ventured to cross the fortymile morass which lay below them and thus attempt to verify or to disprove the rumors it was owing to these topographical conditions that cortez had been established as the point of entry to the interior it was because of them that she had grown and flourished with her sawmills and her ginmills her docks and her dives but at the time when this story opens alaska had developed to a point where an overland outlet by winter and a circuitous inlet by way of bering sea and the crooked yukon in summer were no longer sufficient there was need of a permanent route by means of which men and freight might come and go through all the year the famous north pass yukon railway far to the eastward afforded transportation to dawson city and the canadian territory and had proven itself such a financial success that builders began to look for a harbor more to the westward from which they could tap the great heart of alaska thus it was that cortez awoke one morning to find herself selected as the terminus of a new line other railway propositions followed flimsy promotion schemes for the most part but among them two that had more than paper and hot air behind them one of these was backed by the copper trust which had made heavy mining investments two hundred miles inland the other by curtis gordon a promoter who claimed new york as his birthplace and the world as his residence gordon had been one of the first locaters in the kyak coalfields and he had also purchased a copper prospect a few miles down the bay from cortez where he had started a town which he called hope there were some who shook their heads and smiled knowingly when they spoke of that prospect but no one denied that it was fast assuming the outward semblance of a mine under gordons direction he had erected a fine substantial wharf together with buildings bunkhouses cottages and a spacious residence for himself and daily the piles of debris beneath the tunnel entries to his workings grew he paid high wages he spent money lavishly and he had a magnificent and compelling way with him that dazzled and delighted the good people of cortez when he began work on a railroad which was designed to reach far into the interior his action was taken as proof positive of his financial standing and his critics were put down as pessimists who had some personal grudge against him it was up to the raw new village of hope with its odor of freshcut fir and undried paint that the freightsteamer with natalie gerard and the irish prince aboard came gingerly one evening oneil surveyed the town with some curiosity as he approached for gordons sensational doings had interested him greatly he was accustomed to the rapid metamorphoses of a growing land it was his business in fact to win the wilderness over to order and therefore he was not astonished at the changes wrought here during his absence but he was agreeably surprised at the businesslike arrangement of the place and the evidence that a strong and practised hand had guided its development even before the ship had tied up he had identified the tall impressive man on the dock as the genius and founder of hope and the darkhaired wellformed woman beside him as natalies mother it was not until they were close at hand that the daughter made her presence known then unable to restrain herself longer she shrieked her greeting down over the rail mrs gerard started then stared upward as if at an apparition she stretched out a groping hand to gordon who stood as if frozen in his tracks they seemed to be exchanging hurried words and the man appeared to be reassuring his companion it looked very odd to oneil but any suspicion that natalie was unwelcome disappeared when she reached the dock her mothers dark eyes were bright with unshed tears of gladness her face was transfigured she showed the strong repressed emotion of an undemonstrative nature as they embraced natalie clung to her laughing crying bombarding her with questions begging forgiveness and babbling of her adventures their resemblance was striking and in point of beauty there seemed little to choose between them they might have been nearly of an age except that the mother lacked the girls restless vivacity oneil remained in the background like an uncomfortable bridegroom conscious meanwhile of the searching and hostile regard of curtis gordon but at last his protegee managed to gasp out in a more or less coherent manner the main facts of the shipwreck and her rescue whereupon gordons attitude abruptly altered my god he ejaculated you were not on the nebraska yes yes yes cried natalie the lifeboats went off and left me all alone in the dark with the ship sinking mr oneil saved me he took me up and jumped just as the ship sank and we were all night in the freezing water we nearly died didnt we he fainted and so did i mummie dear it was so cold he held me up until we were rescued though and then there wasnt room in the lifeboat for both of us but he made them take me in just the same while he stayed in the water he was unconscious when he reached the shore oh it was splendid oneils identity being established and the nature of his service becoming apparent curtis gordon took his hand in a crushing grip and thanked him in a way that might have warmed the heart of a stone gargoyle the man was transformed now that he understood he became a geyser of eloquence he poured forth his appreciation in rounded sentences his splendid musical voice softened and swelled and broke with a magnificent and touching emotion through it all the irish contractor remained uncomfortably silent for he could not help thinking that this fulsome outburst was aroused rather by the man who had built the north pass a crowd was collecting round them but gordon cleared it away with an imperious gesture come he said this is no place to talk mr oneils splendid gallantry renders our mere thanks inane he must allow us to express our gratitude in a more fitting manner please dont exclaimed oneil hastily you are our guest the hospitality of our house is yours hope would be honored to welcome you sir at any time but under these circumstances im going right on to cortez the ship will remain here for several hours discharging freight and we insist that you allow us this pleasure meanwhile you shall spend the night here then perhaps you will feel inclined to prolong your stay all that cortez has we have in double proportion i say it with pride cortez is no longer the metropolis of the region hope well i may say that cortez is of all alaskan cities the most fortunate since it has realized its hope he laughed musically this town has come to stay we intend to annex cortez eventually if you feel that you must go on i shall deem it a pleasure to send you later in my motorboat she makes the run in fifteen minutes but you must first honor our house and our board you must permit us to pledge your health in a glass we insist please said mrs gerard do come your highness natalie urged from the shelter of the elder womans arms youre more than kind said oneil and together the four turned their faces to the shore v wherein we see curtis gordon and others curtis gordons respect for his guest increased as they walked up the dock for before they had taken many steps out from the crowd which had gathered to watch the ships arrival stepped one of his foremen this fellow shook hands warmly with oneil whereupon others followed one by one miners day laborers roughnecks of many nationalities they doffed their hatssomething they never did for gordon and stretched out grimy hands their faces lighting up with smiles oneil accepted their greetings with genuine pleasure and called them by name we just heard you was shipwrecked said gordons foreman anxiously you wasnt hurt was you not in the least god be praised theres a lot of the old gang at work here so i see heres shorty that you may remember from the north pass the speaker dragged from the crowd a redfaced perspiring ruffian who had hung back with the bashfulness of a small boy hes the fellow you dug out of the slide at twentyeight connors cried oneil warmly im glad to see you and how are the two arms of you better n ever they was the both av them mr connors blushed doubled his fists and flexed his bulging muscles an why shouldnt they be when you set em both with your own hands misther oneil twas as good a job as doc gray ever done in the hospittle i hope youre doin well sir he pulled his forelock placed one foot behind the other and tapped it on the planking grinning expansively very well indeed thank you oneils progress was slow for half the crowd insisted upon shaking his hand and exchanging a few words with him clumsy swedes bobbed their heads darkbrowed foreign laborers whose nationality it was hard to distinguish showed their teeth and chattered words of greeting bless my soul gordon exclaimed finally you know more of them than i do yes i seldom have to fire a man then you are favored of the gods labor is my great problem it is the supreme drawback of this country these people drift and blow on every breeze like the sands of the sahara with more and better help i could work wonders here unexpected as these salutations had been oneils greatest surprise came a moment later as he passed the first of the company buildings there he heard his name pronounced in a voice which halted him and in an open doorway he beheld a huge loosehung man of tremendous girth with a warbag in his hand and a wide black hat thrust back from a shiny forehead why tom he exclaimed tom slater gordon groaned and went on with the women saying come up to the house when you escape mr oneil i shall have dinner served mr slater came forward slowly dragging his clothesbag with him the two shook hands what in the world are you doing here tom nothing said slater he had a melancholy cast of feature utterly out of keeping with his rotund form in his eye was the somber glow of a soul at war with the flesh nothing i had a good job putting in a power plant for his nibs he indicated the retreating gordon with a disrespectful jerk of the thumb but i quit not enough pay best wages i ever got he pays well poor grub grubs fine what made you quit i havent exactly quit but im going to when i saw you coming up the dock i said theres the chief now hell want me so i began to pack the speaker dangled his partly filled warbag as evidence in an even sourer tone he murmured aint that just me i aint had a days luck since lincoln was shot the minute i get a good job along you come and spoil it i dont want you laughed oneil but slater was not convinced he shook his head oh yes you do youve got something on or you wouldnt be here ive been drawing pay from you now for over five minutes oneil made a gesture of impatience no no in the first place i have nothing for you to do in the second place i probably couldnt afford the wages gordon is paying you thats the hell of it gloomily agreed happy tom where are your grips ill begin by carrying them i havent any ive been shipwrecked seriously tom i have no place for you the repetition of this statement made not the smallest impression upon the hearer youll have one soon enough he replied then with a touch of spirit do you think id work for this fourflusher if you were in the country hush oneil cast a glance over his shoulder by the way how do you happen to be here i thought you were in dawson i finished that job i was working back toward ma and the children i havent seen them for two years you think gordon is a false alarm happy tom spat with unerring accuracy at a crack then said hes talking railroads railroads why ive got a boy back in the state of maine fourteen years old willie yes my son willie could skin curtis gordon at railroadbuilding and willie is the sickly one of the outfit but ill hand it to gordon for one thing hes a moneygetter and a moneyspender he knows where the loose stone in the hearth is laid and he knows just which lilac bush the family savings are buried under those penurious pilgrim fathers in my part of the country come up and drop their bankbooks through the slot in his door every morning hes the first easy money i ever had id get rich off of him but slater sighed of course you had to come along and wrench me away from the till dont quit on my account urged his former chief im up here on coal matters i cant take time to explain now but ill see you later suit yourself only dont keep me loafing on full time im an expensive man ill be packed and waiting for you oneil went on his way somewhat amused yet undeniably pleased at finding his boss packer here instead of far inland for slaters presence might after all fit well enough into his plans the irish prince had gained something of a reputation for extravagance but he acknowledged himself completely outshone by the luxury with which curtis gordon had surrounded himself at hope the promoter had spoken of his modest livingquarters in reality they consisted of a handsome twentyroom house furnished with the elegance of a newport cottage the rugs were thick and richly colored the furniture was of cathedral oak and mahogany in the library were deep leather chairs and bookcases filled mainly with the works of french and german authors of decadent type the mans taste in art was revealed by certain pictures undeniably clever but a little too daring he was undoubtedly a sybarite yet he evidently possessed rare energy and executive force it was an unusual combination the dinner was notable mainly for its lavish disregard of expense there were strawberries from seattle fresh cream and butter from gordons imported cows cheese prepared expressly for him in prance and a champagne the date of which he took pains to make known on the whole he played the part of host agreeably enough and his constant flow of talk was really entertaining his anecdotes embraced three continents his wit though teutonic was genial and mirthprovoking when mrs gerard took time from her worshipful regard of her daughter to enter the conversation she spoke with easy charm and spontaneity as for natalie she was intoxicated with delight she chattered she laughed she interrupted with the joyful exuberance of youth under such circumstances the meal should have proved enjoyable yet the guest of honor had never been more ill at ease precisely what accounted for the feeling he could not quite determine somewhere back in his mind was a suspicion that things were not as they should be here in this house of books and pictures and incongruities he told himself that he should not be so narrowminded as to resent gloria gerards presence here particularly since she herself had told him that her friendship for gordon dated back many years nevertheless the impression remained to disturb him you wonder perhaps why i have been so extravagant with my livingquarters said gordon as they walked into the library but it is not alone for myself you see i have people associated with me who are accustomed to every comfort and luxury and i built this house for them mrs gerard has been kind enough to grace the establishment with her presence and i expect others of my stockholders to do likewise you see i work in the light mr oneil i insist upon the broadest publicity in all my operations and to that end i strive to bring my clients into contact with the undertaking itself for instance i am bringing a party of my stockholders all the way from new york at my own expense just to show them how their interests are being administered i have chartered a special train and a ship for them and of course they must be properly entertained while here quite a scheme said oneil i wanted to show them this marvelous country gods wonderland of opportunity they will return impressed by the solidity and permanence of their investment certainly the man knew how to play his game no more effective means of advertising no more profitable stockjobbing scheme could be devised than a free trip of that sort and a tour of alaska under the watchful guidance of curtis gordon if any member of the party returned unimpressed it would not be the fault of the promoter if any one of them did not voluntarily go out among his personal friends as a missionary it would be because gordons magnetism had lost its power oneil felt a touch of unwilling admiration i judge from what you say that the mine gives encouragement he ventured eying his host curiously through a cloud of tobacco smoke encouragement is not the word before many years hope consolidated will be listed on the exchanges of the world along with amalgamated and the other great producers we have here mr oneil a tremendous mountain of ore located at tide water on one of the worlds finest harbors the climate is superb we have coal near at hand for our own smelter the mine only requires systematic development under competent hands i was in cortez when lars anderson made his first discovery here and i had an option on all this property i believe the price was twelve hundred dollars at any rate it was i who drove those tunnels you found when you bought him out gordons eyes wavered briefly then he laughed my dear sir you have my sincere sympathy your poison my meat as it were eh you became discouraged too soon another hundred feet of work and you would have been justified in paying twelve hundred thousand dollars this eldorado which the copper trust has bought has a greater surface showing than hope i grant but it lies two hundred miles inland and there is the allimportant question of transportation to be solved the ore will have to be hauled or smelted on the ground while we have the kyak coalfields at our door the heidlemanns are building a railroad to it which will parallel mine in places but the very nature of their enterprise foredooms it to failure indeed how so my route is the better by a rigid economy of expenditure by a careful supervision of detail i can effect a tremendous saving over their initial cost i hope to convince them of the fact and thus induce them to withdraw from the field or take over my road at a reasonable figure negotiations are under way at this talk of economy from curtis gordon oneil refrained from smiling with difficulty he felt certain that the mans entire operations were as unsound as his statement that he could bring the trust to terms yet gordon seemed thoroughly in earnest either he expected to fool his present hearer or else he had become hypnotized by the spell of his own magnificent twaddle oneil could not tell which who laid out your rightofway he asked with some interest a very able young engineer dan appleton an excellent man but unreliable in certain things i had to let him go this very afternoon in fact for insubordination but i discharged him more for the sake of discipline than anything else hell be anxious to return in a few days now tell me gordon fixed his visitor with a bland stare which failed to mask his gnawing curiosity what brings you to king phillip sound are we to be rivals in the railroad field no there are enough projects of that sort in the neighborhood for the present five all told but only one destined to succeed im bound for the kyak coalfields to perfect and amend my surveys under the new ruling ah ive heard about that ruling heard about it exclaimed oneil good lord havent you complied with it not yet you surely intend to do so oh yes i suppose so if you dont youll lose im not sure we can ever win nonsense im not sure that its wise to put more good money into those coal claims said gordon this ruling will doubtless be reversed as the others have been one never knows what the land office policy will be two days at a time you know your own business oneil remarked after a pause but unless you have inside information or a bigger pull in washington than the rest of us id advise you to get busy ill be on my way to kyak in the morning with a gang of men gordons attitude puzzled him for he could not bring himself to believe that such indifference was genuine we have been treated unfairly by the government granted we have been fooled cheated hounded as if we were a crowd of undesirable aliens and im heartily sick of the injustice i prefer to work along lines of least resistance i feel tempted to let uncle sam have my coal claims since he has lied to me and gone back on his promise and devote myself to other enterprises which offer a certainty of greater profits but gordon smiled deprecatingly i dare say i shall hold on as you are doing until that fossilized bureau at washington imposes some new condition which will ruin us all remembering natalies statement that her own and her mothers fortunes were tied up in the mines oneil felt inclined to go over gordons head and tell the older woman plainly the danger of delay in complying with the law but he thought better of the impulse her confidence in this man was supreme and it seemed incredible that gordon should jeopardize her holdings and his own more likely his attitude was just a part of his pose designed to show the bigness of his views and to shed a greater luster upon his railroad project it was difficult to escape from the hospitality of hope and oneil succeeded in doing so only after an argument with natalie and her mother they let him go at last only upon his promise to return on his way back from the coalfields and they insisted upon accompanying him down to the dock whither gordon had preceded them in order to have his motorboat in readiness as they neared the landing they overheard the latter in spirited debate with happy tom slater but my dear fellow he was saying i cant lose you and appleton on the same day you cant why youve done it the fat man retorted gruffly i refuse to be left in the lurch this way you must give more notice slater shrugged and without a word tossed his bulging war bag into the motorboat which lay moored beneath him his employers face was purple with rage as he turned to murray and the ladies but he calmed himself sufficiently to say this man is in charge of important work for me yet he tells me you have hired him away tom exclaimed oneil i never said that protested slater i only told you i was working for murray well i hired myself he didnt have anything to say about it i do all the hiring firing and boosting in my department i appeal to you oneil im shorthanded gordon cried i tell you he dont have a word to say about it slater declared with heat natalie gave a little tinkling laugh she recognized in this man the melancholy hero of more than one tale the irish prince had told her murray did his best but knowing happy toms calm obstinacy of old he had no real hope of persuading him you see how it is he said finally hes been with me for years and he refuses to work for any one else while im around if i dont take him with me hell follow mr slater nodded vigorously then imparted these tidings its getting late and my feet hurt he bowed to the women then lowered himself ponderously yet carefully over the edge of the dock and into the leather cushions of the launch once safely aboard he took a package of wintergreen chewinggum from his pocket and began to chew staring out across the sound with that placid speculative enjoyment which reposes in the eyes of a cow at sunset curtis gordons face was red and angry as he shook hands stiffly with his guest and voiced the formal hope that they would meet again im glad to be gone slater observed as the speedboat rushed across the bay im a family man and ive got principles gordons got neither it was outrageous for you to walk out so suddenly it embarrassed me oh hed let me go without notice if he felt like it he fired dan appleton this afternoon just for telling the truth about the mine thats what id have got if id stayed on much longer i was filling up with words and my skin was getting tight id have busted sure inside of a week isnt the mine any good it aint a mine at all its nothing but an excavation filled with damn fools and owned by idiots still i spose it serves gordons purpose after a pause he continued they tell me that snakes eat their own young gordon ought to call that mine the anaconda for itll swallow its own dividends and all the money those eastern people can raise im sorry for mrs gerard slater emitted a sound like the moist exhalation of a porpoise as it rises to the surface what do you mean by that snort asked murray its funny how much some people are like animals now the ostrich thinks that when his head is hid his whole runninggear is out of sight gordons an ostrich as for you you remind me of a mud turtle a turtle dont show nothing but his head and when its necessary he can yank that under cover gordon dont seem to realize that he sticks up above the underbrush either that or else he dont care who sees him he and that woman never mind her exclaimed oneil quickly im sure youre mistaken mr slater grunted once more then chewed his gum silently staring mournfully into the twilight after a moment he inquired why dont you show these people how to build a railroad murray no thank you i know the country back of here its not feasible the copper trust is doing it all the more reason why i shouldnt there are five projects under way now and there wont be more than enough traffic for one slater nodded every man who has two dollars a clean shirt and a friend at washington has got a railroad scheme up his sleeve it will cost thirty million dollars to build across those three divides and into the copper country when the road is done it will be one of heavy grades and no wonder you didnt get the contract from the heidlemanns if your estimate was thirty million i didnt put in a figure tom looked surprised why didnt you you know them i was like the little boy who didnt go to the party i wasnt asked the speakers expression showed that his pride had been hurt and discouraged further questioning well hire our men and our boats tonight he announced ive arranged for that freighter to drop us off at omar on her way out well have to row from there to kyak i expected to land my horses at the coast and pack in from kyak bay but that shipwreck changed my plans poor brutes after my experience ill never swim horses in this water again an elevenoclock twilight enveloped cortez when the two men landed but the town was awake the recent railway and mining activity in the neighborhood had brought a considerable influx of people to king phillip sound and the strains of music from dancehall doors the click of checks and roulette balls from the saloons gave evidence of an unusual prosperity oneil had no difficulty in securing men once he was recognized the scenes at hope were reenacted and there was a general scramble to enlist upon his payroll within an hour therefore his arrangements were made and he and tom repaired to callahans hotel for a few hours sleep a stud game was going on in the barroom when they entered and oneil paused to watch it while slater spoke to one of the players a cleancut blond youth of whimsical countenance when the two friends finally faced the bar for their nightcap tom explained thats appleton the fellow gordon fired today i told him id left the old man flat is he a friend of yours sure nice boy good engineer too umph that game is crooked no happy tom displayed a flash of interest yes cortez is fast becoming a metropolis i see the man in the derby hat is performing a little feat that once cost me four thousand dollars to learn id better split dan away said tom hastily wait education is a good thing even if it is expensive at times i fancy your friend is bright enough to take care of himself lets wait a bit aint that just my blamed luck lamented slater now if they were playing faro i could make a killing id copper appletons bets and open the ones he coppered oneil smiled for happy toms caution in money matters was notorious you know you dont believe in gambling he said its not a belief its a disease declared the fat man i was born to be a gambler but the business is too uncertain now that im getting so old and feeble i cant work any more id take it up only i broke three fingers and when i try to deal i drop the cards what are we going to do just wait said oneil vi the dreamer unobserved the two friends watched the poker game which for a time proceeded quietly but suddenly they saw appleton lean over the table and address the man with the derby hat then thrusting back his chair he rose declaring in a louder tone i tell you i saw it i thought i was mistaken at first his face was white and he disregarded the efforts of his righthand neighbor to quiet him dont squeal smiled the dealer ill leave it to the boys if i did anything wrong you pulled that king from the bottom it may not be wrong but its damned peculiar forget it one of the others exclaimed denny wouldnt doublecross you hardly agreed mr denny evenly youre in a hundred and eighty dollars but if youre sore you can have it back appleton flung his cards into the middle of the table and turned away disgustedly its a hard thing to prove and im not absolutely sure i saw straight or id take it back fast enough denny shrugged and gathered in the discarded hand youve been drinking too much thats all your eyesight is scattered appletons face flushed as he beheld the gaze of the company upon him and heard the laughter which greeted this remark he turned to leave when oneil who had continued to watch the proceedings with interest crossed to the group and touched denny on the shoulder saying quietly give him his money eh the smile faded from the fellows face he looked up with startled inquiry what give him his money in the momentary hush which followed happy tom slater who had frequently seen his employer in action and understood storm signals sighed deeply and reached for the nearest chair with a wrench of his powerful hands he loosened a leg although mr slater abhorred trouble he was accustomed to meet it philosophically a lifetime spent in construction camps had taught him that of all weapons the one best suited to his use was a pickhandle second to that he had come to value the hardwood leg of a chair but in the present case his precaution proved needless for the dispute was over before he had fairly prepared himself without waiting for oneil to put his accusation into words denny had risen swiftly and in doing so he had either purposely or by accident made a movement which produced a prompt and instinctive reaction murrays fist met him as he rose met him so squarely and with such force that he lost all interest in what followed the other cardplayers silently gathered mr denny in their arms and stretched him upon a disused roulette table the bartender appeared with a wet towel and began to bathe his temples appleton dazed by the suddenness of it all found a stack of gold pieces in his hand and heard oneil saying in an everyday tone come to my room please id like to talk to you something commanding in the speakers face made the engineer follow against his will he longed to loiter here until denny had regained his senses but oneil had him by the arm and a moment later he was being led down the hall away from the lobby and the barroom as slater who had followed closed the door behind them dan burst forth by jove why didnt you tell me i knew he was crooked but i couldnt believe sit down said oneil he wont pull himself together for a while and i want to get to bed are you looking for a job the engineers eyes opened wide yes do you know the kyak country pretty well i need a surveyor your wages will be the same that gordon paid and they begin now if its agreeable it certainly is good well leave at six oclock sharp bring your bedding and instruments thanks i this is a bit of a surprise who are you im oneil oh mr appletons expression changed quickly youre murray he stammered an instant it was very good of you to take my part after id been fool enough to well i didnt want to see you make a total idiot of yourself the young man flushed slightly then in a quieter voice he asked how did you know i was out of work mr gordon told me he recommended you highly he did he said you were unreliable disloyal and dishonest coming from him i took that as high praise there was a moments pause then appleton laughed boyishly thats funny im very glad to know you mr oneil you dont and you wont for a long time tom tells me you didnt think well of gordons enterprise and so he fired you thats right i suppose i ought to have kept my mouth shut but it has a way of flying open when it shouldnt he is either a fool or a crook and his mine is nothing but a prospect i couldnt resist telling him so and his railroad appleton hesitated oh its as good a route as the trusts i worked on the two surveys personally i think both outfits are crazy to try to build in from here i had to tell gordon that too you see im a volunteer talker i should have been born with a stutter it would have saved me a lot of trouble oneil smiled you may talk all you please in my employ so long as you do your work now get some sleep for we have a hard trip and by the way the youth paused with a hand on the doorknob dont go looking for denny appletons face hardened stubbornly i cant promise that sir oh yes you can you must remember youre working for me and youre under orders i cant have the expedition held up on your account the engineers voice was heavy with disappointment but a vague admiration was growing in his eyes as he agreed very well sir i suppose my time is yours good night when he had gone happy tom inquired now why in blazes did you hire him we dont need a highpriced surveyor on this job of course not but dont you see hed have been arrested sure besides hes irish and i like him humph then i spose hes got a job for life said tom morosely you make friends and enemies quicker than anybody i ever saw youve got curtis gordon on your neck now on account of this boy nonsense not altogether denny is gordons right bower i think he calls him his secretary anyhow he does gordons dirty work and theyre thicker than fleas first you come along and steal me underhanded then you grab his pet engineer before he has a chance to hire him back again just to top off the evening you publicly brand his confidential understrapper as a card cheat and thump him on the medulla oblongata are you sure it wasnt the duodenum well you hit him in a vital spot and gordon wont forget it late on the following morning oneils expedition was landed at the deserted fishingstation of omar thirty miles down the sound from cortez from this point its route lay down the bay to open water and thence eastward along the coast in front of the salmon river delta some forty miles to kyak this latter stretch would have been wellnigh impossible for open boats but for the fact that the numerous mud bars and islands thrown out by the river afforded a sheltered course these inside channels though shallow were of sufficient depth to allow small craft to navigate and had long been used as a route to the coalfields appleton smiling and cheerful was the first member of the party to appear at the dock that morning and when the landing had been effected at omar he showed his knowledge of the country by suggesting a short cut which would save the long row down to the mouth of the sound and around into the delta immediately back of the old cannery which occupied a gap in the mountain rim lay a narrow lake and this he declared held an outlet which led into the salmon river flats by hauling the boats over into this body of water a task made easy by the presence of a tiny tramway with one dilapidated pushcar which had been a part of the cannery equipment it would be possible to save much time and labor ive heard there was a way through oneil confessed but nobody seemed to know just where it was i know the young man assured him we can gain a day at least and i judge every day is valuable so valuable that we cant afford to lose one by making a mistake said his employer meaningly leave it to me i never forget a country once ive been through it accordingly the boats were loaded upon the handcar and transferred one at a time in the interval oneil examined his surroundings casually he was surprised to find the dock and buildings in excellent condition notwithstanding the fact that the station had lain idle for several years a solitary norwegian with but a slight suspicion of english was watching the premises and managed to make known his impression that poor fishing had led the owners to abandon operations at this point he too had heard that omar lake had an outlet into the delta but he was not sure of its existence he was sure of nothing in fact except that it was very lonesome here and that he had run out of tobacco five days before but dan appleton was not mistaken a two hours row across the mirrorlike surface of omar lake brought the party out through a hidden gap in the mountains and afforded them a view across the level delta to their left the range they had just penetrated retreated toward the canon where the salmon river burst its way out from the interior and beyond that point it continued in a coastward swing to kyak their destination between lay a flat trackless tundra cut by sloughs and glacial streams with here and there long tongues of timber reaching down from the high ground and dwindling away toward the seaward marshes it was a desolate region the breedingplace of sea fowl the huntingground for the great brown bear oneil had never before been so near the canon as this and the wild stories he had heard of it recurred to him with interest he surveyed the place curiously as the boats glided along but could see nothing more than a jumble of small hills and buttes and beyond them the deadgray backs of the twin glaciers coming down from the slopes to east and west beyond the foothills and the glaciers themselves the main range was gashed by a deep valley through which he judged the river must come and beyond that he knew was a country of agricultural promise extending clear to the fabulous copper belt whither the railroads from cortez were headed still farther inland lay the tanana and then the yukon with their riches untouched what a pity what a mockery it was that this obvious entrance to the country had been blocked by nature just at his back was omar with its deep and sheltered harbor the lake he had crossed gave a passage through the guardian range and this tundra oneil estimated that he could lay a mile of track a day over it led right up to the glaciers once through the coast range building would be easy for the upper salmon was navigable and its banks presented no difficulties to tracklaying he turned abruptly to appleton who was pulling an oar what do you know about that canyon he asked not much nobody knows much for those fellows who went through in the gold rush have all left the country gordons rightofway comes in above and so does the trusts from there on i know every foot of the ground i suppose if either of them gets through to the salmon the rest will be easy dead easy it would be shorter and very much cheaper to build from omar through this way of course but neither outfit knew anything about the outlet to omar lake until i told them and they knew there was the canon to be reckoned with well appleton shook his head look at it does it look like a place to build a railroad i cant tell anything about it from here i suppose a road could be built if the glaciers were on the same side of the river but theyre not they face each other and theyre alive too listen the oarsmen ceased rowing at dans signal and out of the northward silence came a low rumble like the sound of distant cannonading we must be at least twenty miles away in an air line the ice stands up alongside the river hundreds of feet high and it breaks off in chunks as big as a new york officebuilding youve been up there no but everybody says so and ive seen glacier ice clear out here in the delta theyre always moving too the glaciers themselves and theyre filled with crevasses so that its dangerous to cross them on foot even if one keeps back from the river how did those men get their outfits through in oneil queried im blessed if i know maybe they flew after a moment dan added perhaps they dodged the pieces as they fell oneil smiled he opened his lips to speak then closed them and for a long time kept his eyes fixed speculatively in the direction of the canyon when he had first spoken of a route from omar he had thrown out the suggestion with only a casual interest now suddenly the idea took strong possession of his mind it fascinated him with its daring its bigness he had begun to dream the world owes all great achievements to dreamers for men who lack vivid imaginations are incapable of conceiving big enterprises no matter how practical the thing accomplished it requires this faculty no less than a poem or a picture every bridge every skyscraper every mechanical invention every great work which man has wrought in steel and stone and concrete was once a dream oneil had no small measure of the imaginative power that makes great leaders great inventors great builders he was capable of tremendous enthusiasm his temperament forever led him to dare what others feared to undertake and here he glimpsed a tremendous opportunity the traffic of a budding nation was waiting to be seized to him who gained control of alaskan transportation would come the domination of her resources many were striving for the prize but if there should prove to be a means of threading that salmon river canon with steel rails the man who first found it would have those other railroad enterprises at his mercy the trust would have to sue for terms or abandon further effort for this route was shorter it was level it was infinitely cheaper to improve the stakes in the game were staggering the mere thought of them made his heart leap the only obstacle of course lay in those glaciers and he began to wonder if they could not be made to open why not no one knew positively that they were impregnable for no one knew anything certainly about them until the contrary had been proven there was at least a possibility that they were less formidable than rumor had painted them camp was pitched late that night far out on the flats during the preparation of supper murray sat staring fixedly before him deaf to all sounds and insensible to the activities of his companions he had lost his customary breeziness and his good nature he was curt saturnine unsmiling appleton undertook to arouse him from this abstraction but slater drew the young man aside hurriedly with a warning dont do that son or youll wear splints for the rest of the trip whats the matter with him anyhow dan inquired he was boiling over with enthusiasm all day but now why hes asleep sitting up he hasnt moved for twenty minutes tom shook his head dislodging a swarm of mosquitoes walk on your toes my boy walk on your toes i smell something cooking and it aint supper when food was served oneil made a pretense of eating but rose suddenly in the midst of it with the words ill stretch my legs a bit his voice was strangely listless in his eyes was the same abstraction which had troubled appleton during the afternoon he left the camp and disappeared up the bank of the stream nice place to take a walk the engineer observed hell bog down in half a mile or get lost among the sloughs not him said slater nevertheless his worried eyes followed the figure of his chief as long as it was in sight after a time he announced something is coming but what it is or where its going to hit us i dont know their meal over the boatmen made down their beds rolled up in their blankets and were soon asleep appleton and tom sat in the smoke of a smudge gossiping idly as the twilight approached from the south came the distant voice of the sea out of the north rolled the intermittent thunder of those falling bergs from every side sounded a harsh chorus of waterfowl ducks whirred past in bulletlike flight honkers flapped heavily overhead a pair of magnificent snowwhite swans soared within easy gunshot of the camp an hour passed another and another the arctic night descended and through it all the mosquitoes sang their blood song and stabbed the watchers with tongues of flame happy tom sang his song too for it was not often that he obtained a listener and it proved to be a song of infinite hard luck mr slater it seemed was a creature of many ills the wretched abidingplace of aches and pains of colics cramps and rheumatism he was the target of misfortune and the sport of fate his body was the gallopingground of strange disorders which baffled diagnosis his financial affairs were dominated by an evil genius which betrayed him at every turn to top it all he suffered at the moment a violent attack of indigestion aint that just my luck he lamented old indys got me good and there aint a bit of soda in the outfit appleton who was growing more and more uneasy at the absence of his leader replied with some asperity instead of dramatizing your own discomforts youd better be thinking of the boss im going out to look for him now dont be a dam fool slater advised it would be worth a broken leg to annoy him when hes in one of these fits youd make yourself as popular as a smallpox patient at a picnic when hes dreamed his dream hell be back when will that be no telling maybe tonight maybe tomorrow night and what are we going to do in the mean time sit tight mr slater chewed steadily and sighed no soda in camp and this gum dont seem to lay hold of me thats luck darkness had settled when oneil reappeared he came plunging out of the brush drenched muddy stained by contact with the thickets but his former mood had disappeared and in its place was a harsh explosive energy tom he cried you and appleton and i will leave at daylight the men will wait here until we get back his voice was incisive its tone forbade question the youthful engineer stared at him in dismay for only his anxiety had triumphed over his fatigue and daylight was but four hours away oneil noted the expression and said more gently youre tired appleton i know but in working for me youll be called upon for extraordinary effort now and then i may not demand more than an extra hour from you then again i may demand a week straight without sleep ill never ask it unless its necessary and unless im ready to do my share yes sir the sacrifice is big but the pay is bigger loyalty is all i require im ready now sir we cant see to travel before dawn help tom load the lightest boat with rations for five days if we run short well siwash it he kicked off his rubber boots upended them to drain the water out then flung himself upon his bed of boughs and was asleep almost before the two had recovered from their surprise five days or longer slater said gloomily as he and dan began their preparations and me with indigestion what does it mean queried appleton it means ill probably succumb no no whats the meaning of this change of plan i cant understand it you dont need to happy tom informed him curtly there was a look of solicitude in his face as he added i wish id made him take off his wet clothes before he went to sleep lets wake him up but slater shook his head id sooner wake a rattlesnake said he oneil roused the members of his expedition while the sky was reddening faintly for he had a mind which worked like an alarmclock all except appleton had worked for him before and the men accepted his orders to await his return with no appearance of surprise with the first clear light he and his two companions set out rowing up the estuary of the salmon until the current became too swift to stem in that manner then landing they rigged a bridle for the skiff fitted their shoulders to loops in a ninetyfoot tow rope and began to track their craft up against the stream it was heartbreaking work frequently they were waistdeep in the cold water long sweepers with tips awash in the flood interfered with their efforts the many branches of the stream forced them to make repeated crossings for the delta was no more than an endless series of islands through which the current swirled when dusk overtook them they were wet weary and weak from hunger with the dawn they were up and at it again but their task became constantly more difficult because of the floating glacier ice which increased with every mile they were obliged to exercise the extremest caution hour after hour they strained against the current until the ropes bit into their aching flesh bringing raw places out on neck and palm hour after hour the ice went churning past and through it all came the intermittent echo of the caving glaciers ahead of them dan appleton realized very soon whither the journey was leading and at thought of actually facing those terrors which loomed so large in conjecture his pulses began to leap he had a suspicion of oneils intent but dared not voice it though the scheme seemed mad enough its very audacity fascinated him it would be worth while to take part in such an undertaking even if it ended in failure and somehow against his judgment he felt that his leader would find a way for the most part oneil was as silent as a man of stone and only on those rare occasions when he craved relief from his thoughts did he encourage dan to talk then he sometimes listened but more frequently he did not slater had long since become a dumb draught animal senseless to discomfort except in the hour of relaxation when he monotonously catalogued his ills are you a married man oneil inquired once of dan not yet sir family sure a great big fine one consisting of a sister but shes more than a family shes a religion receiving encouragement from his employers look of interest he continued we were wiped out by the san francisco earthquake and stood in the bread line for a while we managed to save four thousand dollars from the wreck which we divided equally then we started out to make our fortunes it was her idea you came to cortez yes money was so easy for me that i lost all respect for it the town rang with my mirth for a while i was an awful fool education now its my ambition to get settled and have her with me i havent had a good laugh a hearty meal or a christian impulse since i left her what did she do with her half of the fortune invested it wisely and went to work i bought little round celluloid disks with mine she bought land of some sort with hers shes a newspaper woman and the best in the world or at least the best in seattle she wrote that big snowslide story for the review last fall she tells em how to raise eight babies on seven dollars a week or how to make a full set of library furniture out of three beer kegs a packingcase and an epileptic icebox she runs the domestic economy column and shes the sweetest the cleverest the most stunning appletons enthusiastic tribute ceased suddenly for he saw that oneil was once more deaf and that his eyes were fixed dreamily upon the canon far ahead as the current quickened the progress of the little party became slower and more exhausting their destination seemed to retreat before them the river wound back and forth in a maddening series of detours some of the float ice was large now and these pieces rushed down upon them like charging horses keeping them constantly on the alert to prevent disaster it seemed impossible that such a flat country could afford so much fall happy tom at length suggested that they tie up and pack the remaining miles overland but oneil would not hear to this they had slept so little their labors had been so heavy that they were dumb and dull with fatigue when they finally reached the first bluffs and worked their boat through a low gorge where all the waters of the salmon thrashed and icebergs galloped past like a pallid host in flight here they paused and stared with wondering eyes at what lay before a chill damp breath swept over them and a mighty awe laid hold of their hearts come on said oneil other men have gone through well do the same on the evening of the sixth day a splintered battered polingboat with its seams open swung in to the bank where oneils men were encamped and its three occupants staggered out they were gaunt and stiff and heavyeyed even tom slaters full cheeks hung loose and flabby but the leader was alert and buoyant his face was calm his eyes were smiling humorously youll take the men on to the coalfields and finish the work he told his boss packer later that night appleton and i will start back to cortez in the morning when you have finished go to juneau and see to the recording aint that my luck murmured the dyspeptic me for kyak where there aint a store and my gum all wet chew it paper and all advised appleton cheerfully oh the good has all gone out of it now slater explained meet me in seattle on the fifteenth of next month his employer directed ill be there if old indy spares me but dyspepsia with nothing to eat except beans and pork bosom will probably lay me in my grave long before the fifteenth however ill do my best now do you want to know what i think of this proposition of yours he eyed his superior somberly sure i want all the encouragement i can get and your views are always inspiriting well i think its nothing more nor less than hydrophobia these mosquitoes have given you the rabies and you need medical attention you need it bad still youll help me wont you oh yes said tom ill help you but its a pity to see a man go mad vii the dream the clerk of the leading hotel in seattle whirled his register about as a man deposited a weatherbeaten warbag on the marble floor and leaned over the counter to inquire is murray oneil here this question had been asked repeatedly within the last two hours but heretofore by people totally different in appearance from the one who spoke now the man behind the desk measured the stranger with a suspicious eye before answering he saw a ragged loosehung fat person of melancholy countenance who was booted to the knee and chewing gum mr oneil keeps a room here by the year he replied guardedly show me up said the newcomer as if advancing a challenge a smart reply was on the lips of the clerk but something in the others manner discouraged flippancy you are a friend of mr oneils he asked politely friend umm no im just him when he aint around in a loud tone he inquired of the girl at the newsstand have you got any wintergreen mr oneil is not here the fat man stared at his informant accusingly aint this the fifteenth he asked it is then hes here all right mr oneil is not in the clerk repeated gazing fixedly over mr slaters left shoulder well i guess his room will do for me i aint particular his room is occupied at present if you care to wait you will find precisely what it was that he was to find tom never learned for at that moment the breath was driven out of his lungs by a tremendous whack and he turned to behold dr stanley gray towering over him an expansive smile upon his face look out slater coughed and seized his adams apple you made me swallow my cud the two shook hands warmly weve been expecting you tom said the doctor were all here except parker and he wired hed arrive tomorrow wheres murray hes around somewhere slater turned a resentful smoldering gaze upon the hotel clerk and looked about him for a chair with a detachable leg but the object of his regard disappeared abruptly behind the keyrack this ratbrained party said he hadnt come he arrived this morning but weve barely seen him i left appleton in juneau hell be down on the next boat appleton whos he dr gray inquired oh hes a new member of the order initiated last month hes learning to be a sleephater like the rest of us hes recording the rightofway whats in the air none of us know we didnt even know murrays whereabouts thought he was in kyak until he sounded the tocsin from new york the other boys have quit their jobs and ive sold my practice its a railroad dr gray grinned well thats the tone i use when i break the news that its a girl instead of a boy its a railroad slater repeated up the salmon river good lord what about those glaciers oh it aint so much the glaciers and the floating icebergs and the raging chasms and the quaking tundra murray thinks he can overcome them its the mosquitoes and the copper trust that are going to figure in this enterprise one of em will be the death of me and the other will bust murray s if he dont look out say my neck is covered with bumps till it feels like a dogcollar of seed pearls do you think well have a fight asked the doctor hopefully a fight itll be the worst massacre since the little big horn were surrounded already and no help in sight oneil found his boys awaiting him when he returned to his room there was mellen lean gaunt and seriousminded with the dust of chihuahua still upon his shoes there were mckay the superintendent who had arrived from california that morning sheldon the commissary man elkins doc gray and happy tom slater parker the chief engineer alone was absent i sent appleton in from cortez he told them to come down the river and make the preliminary survey into omar he cables me that he has filed his locations and everything is o k on my way east i stopped here long enough to buy the omar cannery docks buildings and town site its all mine and it will save us ninety days work in getting started what do you make of that tundra between omar and the canon queried mckay who had crossed the salmon river delta and knew its character its like calfsfoot jelly a man bogs down to his waist in it well fill and trestle said oneil we couldnt move a piledriver twenty feet its frozen solid in winter mckay nodded well have to drive steam points ahead of every pile i suppose and well need eskimos to work in that cold but i guess we can manage somehow that country is like an apple pie said tom slater its better cold than hot theres a hundred inches of rainfall at omar in summer well all have web feet when we get out sheldon the lighthearted commissary man spoke up if its as wet as all that well need finns instead of eskimos he was promptly hooted into silence i understand those glaciers come down to the edge of the river the superintendent ventured they do oneil acknowledged and theyre the liveliest ones i ever saw tom can answer for that one of them is fully four hundred feet high at the face and four miles across theyre constantly breaking too lumps bigger than this hotel supplemented slater its quite a sight equal to anything in the state of maine oneil laughed with the others at this display of sectional pride and then explained the problem of passing them sounds difficult but in reality it isnt if those other engineers had looked over the ground as i did instead of relying entirely upon hearsay we wouldnt be meeting here today of course i realized that we couldnt build a road over a moving river of ice nor in front of one for that matter but i discovered that nature had made us one concession she placed her glaciers on opposite sides of the valley to be sure but she placed the one that comes in from the east bank slightly higher upstream than the one that comes in from the west they dont really face each other although from the sea they appear to do so you see the answer his hearers nodded vigorously if we cross the river low down by a trestle and run up the east bank past jackson glacier until we are stopped by garfield the upper one then throw a bridge directly across and back to the side we started from we miss them both and have the river always between them and us above the upper crossing there will be a lot of heavy rock work to do but nothing unusual and once through the gorge we come out into the valley where the other roads run in from cortez they cross three divides while we run through on a onepercent grade that will give us a downhill pull on all heavy freight sounds as simple as a pair of suspenders doesnt it inquired slater but wait till you see it the gorge below niagara is stagnant water compared with the cataract above those glaciers it takes two looks to see the top of the mountains and those glaciers themselves well language just gums up and sticks when it comes to describing them mellen the bridgebuilder spoke for the first time and the others listened as i understand it we will cross the river between the glaciers and immediately below the upper one exactly he shook his head we cant build piers to withstand those heavy bergs which you tell me are always breaking off ill explain how we can said oneil youve hit the bullseye the tender spot in the whole enterprise while the river is narrow and rapid in front of jackson the lower glacier opposite garfield there is a kind of lake formed i suppose when the glacier receded from its original position now then here lies the joker the secret of the whole proposition this lake is deep but there is a shallow bar across its outlet which serves to hold back all but the small bergs this gives us a chance to cross in safety at first i was puzzled to discover why only the ice from the lower glacier came downriver then when i realized the truth i knew i had the key to alaska in my hands well cross just below this bar understand of course it all depends upon parkers verdict but im so sure his will agree with mine that ive made my preparations bought omar and gathered you fellows together were going to spring the biggest coup in railroad history wheres the money coming from slater inquired bluntly im putting in my own fortune how much is that im dead to all sense of modesty you see about a million dollars said oneil humph that wont get us started ive raised another million in new york the chief was smiling and did not seem to resent this inquisitiveness in the least nothing but a shoestring my dear happy laughed the builder i dont intend to complete the road then why in blazes are you starting it demanded slater in a bewilderment which the others evidently shared its one thing to build a railroad on a contractors commission but its another thing to build it and pay your own way as you go along half a railroad aint any good once my rightofway is filed it will put those projects from cortez out of business no one but an imbecile would think of building in from there with the omar route made possible before we come to that salmon river bridge the copper trust will have to buy us out thats language said happy tom in sudden admiration those are words i understand i withdraw my objections and give my consent to the deal you are staking your whole fortune on your judgment as i understand it mckay ventured every dollar of it murray answered say chief thats gambling some young sheldon remarked with a wondering look they were deep in their discussion when the telephone broke in noisily sheldon being nearest to the instrument answered it theres a newspaper reporter downstairs to interview you he announced after an instant i dont grant interviews oneil said sharply he could not guess by what evil chance the news of his plans had leaked out nothing doing sheldon spoke into the transmitter he turned again to his employer operator says the party doesnt mind waiting oneil frowned impatiently throw him out sheldon directed brusquely then suddenly dropped the receiver as if it had burnt his fingers hell its a woman murray shes on the wire she thanks you sweetly and says shell wait a woman a newspaper woman oneil rose and seized the instrument roughly his voice was freezing as he said hello i refuse to be interviewed yes theres no use his tone suddenly altered miss appleton i beg your pardon ill be right down turning to his subordinates he announced with a wry smile this seems to terminate our interview shes dan appletons sister and therefore he shrugged resignedly now run along ill see you in the morning his boys made their way down to the street talking guardedly as they went all were optimistic save slater whose face remained shrouded in its customary gloom cheer up happy dr gray exhorted him its the biggest thing we ever tackled wait just wait till youve seen the place tom said dont you think it can be done nope come come its impossible of course well do it but its impossible just the same it will mean a scrap too like none of us ever saw and i was raised in a loggingcamp where fighting is the general recreation if i was young like the rest of you i wouldnt mind but im old and my digestions gone i cant hardly take care of myself any more doc im too feeble to fight or he signaled a passing car it failed to stop and he rushed after it dodging vehicles with the agility of a rabbit and swinging his heavy warbag as if it weighed no more than a good resolution oneil entered the ladies parlor with a feeling of extreme annoyance expecting to meet an inquisitive bold young woman bent upon exploiting his plans and his personality in the usual inane journalistic fashion he was surprised and offended that dan appleton in whom he had reposed the utmost faith should have betrayed his secret publicity was a thing he detested at all times and at present he particularly dreaded its effect but he was agreeably surprised in the girl who came toward him briskly with hand outstretched miss appleton was her brothers double she had his frank blue eyes his strawgold hair his humorous smile and wideawake look she was not by any means beautiful her features were too irregular her nose too tiptilted her mouth too generous for that but she seemed crisp cleancut and wholesome what first struck oneil was her effect of boyishness from the crown of her plain straw sailor to the soles of her sensible walkingboots there was no suggestion of feminine frippery she wore a plain shirtwaist and a tailored skirt and her hair was arranged simply the wave in its pale gold was the only concession to mere prettiness yet she gave no impression of deliberate masculinity she struck one as merely not interested in clothes instinctively expressing in her dress her own boyish directness and her businesslike absorption in her work youre furious of course anybody would be she began then laughed so frankly that his eyes softened and the wrinkles at their corners deepened i fear i was rude before i learned you were dans sister he apologized but you see im a bit afraid of newspaper people i knew youd struggle although dan described you as a perfectly angelic person indeed but im a real reporter so i wont detain you long i dont care where you were born or where you went to school or what patent breakfastfood you eat tell me are you going to build another railroad i hope so im always building roads when my bids are low enough to secure the contracts thats my business are you going to build one in alaska possibly there seems to be an opportunity there but dan has probably told you as much about that as i am at liberty to tell hes been over the ground she pursed her lips at him you know very well or you ought to know that dan wouldnt tell me a thing while hes working for you he hasnt said a word but is that why you came in frowning like a thundercloud did you think he set me on your trail i think i do know that he wouldnt do anything really indiscreet murray regarded her with growing favor there was something about this boyish girl which awakened the same spontaneous liking he had felt upon his first meeting with her brother he surprised her by confessing boldly i am building a railroad to the interior of alaska ive been east and raised the money my men are here well begin operations at once thats what mr gordon told me about his scheme but he hasnt done much so far my line will put his out of business also that of the trust and the various wildcat promoters where does your road start from the town of omar on king phillip sound near hope and cortez it will run up the salmon river and past the glaciers which those other men refused to tackle if i weep it is for joy said the girl i dont like curtis gordon i call him simon legree why well he impresses me as a real oldtime villain with the ridingboots and the whip and all that uncle toms cabin is my favorite play its so funny this is a big story youve given me mr oneil i realize that it has the biggest news value of anything alaskan which has broken for some time i think you are a very nice person to interview after all wait i dont want you to use a word of what ive told you miss appletons clearly penciled brows rose inquiringly then why didnt you keep still you asked me i told you because you are dan appletons sister nevertheless i dont want it made public lets sit down said the girl with a laugh to tell you the truth i didnt come here to interview you for my paper im afraid ive tried your patience awfully a faint flush tinged her clear complexion i just came really to get some news of dan hes perfectly well and happy and youll see him in a few days miss appleton nodded so he wrote but i couldnt wait now wont you tell me all about him not anything about his looks and his health but little unimportant things that will mean something you see im his mother and his sister and his sweetheart oneil did as he was directed and before long found himself reciting the details of that trying trip up the salmon river he told her how he had sent the young engineer out to run the preliminary survey for the new railroad and added he is in a fair way to realize his ambition of having you with him all the time im sure that will please you and it is my ambition to make enough money to have him with me she announced with an air of some importance she continued ill tell you a secret im writing for the magazines stories she sat back awaiting his enthusiasm when she saw that it was not forthcoming she exclaimed my how you do rave over the idea i congratulate you of course but now dont tell me that you tried it once of course you did i know its a harmless disease like the measles and that everybody has it when theyre young above all dont volunteer the information that your own life is full of romance and would make a splendid novel they all say that murray oneil felt the glow of personal interest that results from the discovery in another of a congenial sense of humor i didnt suppose you had to write he said dan told me you had invested your fortune and were on easy street that was poetic license i fictionized slightly in my report to him because i knew he was doing so well then your investment didnt turn out fortunately miss appleton hesitated you seem to be a kindly trusting person im tempted to destroy your faith in human nature please dont yes i shall my experience may help you to avoid the pitfalls of high finance well then it was a very sad little fortune to begin with like a boy in grammarschool just big enough to be of no assistance but even a boyssize fortune looked big to me i wanted to invest it in something sure no nationalbank stock subject to the danger of an absconding cashier mind you no government bonds with the possibility of war to depreciate them but something stable and agricultural with the inexhaustible resources of nature back of it this isnt my own language i cribbed it from the appleman appleman yes he had brown eyes and a silky mustache and a big irrigation plan over east of the mountains you gave him your money and he gave you a perfectly good receipt then he planted little apple trees he nursed them tenderly for five years after which he turned them over to you with his blessing and you lived happily for evermore at least that was the idea you couldnt fail to grow rich for the water always bubbled through his little ditch and it never froze nor rained to spoil things i used to love apples and then there was my name which seemed a good omen but lately ive considered changing appleton to berry or plummer or some other kind of fruit i infer that the scheme failed oneils eyes were half closed with amusement yes it was a good scheme too except for the fact that the irrigation ditch ran uphill and that there wasnt any water where it started from and that apples never had been made to grow in that locality because of something in the soil and that browneyed bettys title to the land wouldnt hold water any more than the ditch otherwise im sure hed have made a success and id have spent my declining years in a rockingchair under the falling apple blossoms eating pippins and jonathans and northern spies i cant bear to touch them now life at my boardinghouse is one long battle against apple pies apple puddings apple tapioca ugh i hate the very word i can understand your aversion laughed oneil i wonder if you would let me order dinner for both of us provided i taboo fruit perhaps ill think of something more to tell you about dan im sure he wouldnt object oh my card is all the chaperon i need it takes me everywhere and renders me superior to the smaller conventionalities she handed him one and he read eliza v appleton the review may i ask what the v stands for he held up the card between his thumb and finger miss appleton blushed for all the world like a boy then answered stiffly it stands for violet but that isnt my fault and im doing my best to live it down viii in which we come to omar miss appleton said the editor of the review would you like to take a vacation is that your delicate way of telling me im discharged inquired eliza you know very well we wouldnt fire you but you havent had a vacation for three years and you need a rest i thought i was looking extremely well for me were going to send you on an assignment to alaska if youll go im thinking of quitting newspaperwork for good the magazines pay better and im writing a book i know perhaps this will just fit in with your plans for it has to do with your pet topic of conservation those forestry stories of yours and the article on the water power combination made a hit didnt they i judge so anyhow the magazine people want more good heres your chance to do something big for yourself and for us those alaskan coal claimants have been making a great effort in washington to rush their patents through and there seems to be some possibility of their succeeding unless the public wakes up we want to show up the whole fraudulent affair show how the entries were illegal and how the agents of the trust are trying to put over the greatest steal of the century its the heidlemanns that are back of it and a few fellows like murray oneil oneil you know him dont you yes i interviewed him a year ago last spring when he started his railroad hes fighting for one of the biggest and richest groups of claims hes backed by some eastern people its the psychological moment to expose both the railroad and the coal situation for the thieves are fighting among themselves gordon oneil and the heidlemanns mr oneil is no thief said the girl shortly of course not hes merely trying to snatch control of an empire and to grab ten million dollars worth of coal for nothing thats not theft its financial genius fortunately however the public is rousing itself coming to regard its natural resources as its own and not the property of the first financier who lays hold of them call it what you will but give us the true story of the kyak coal and above all the story of the railroad battle things are growing bitter up there already and theyre bound to get rapidly worse give us the news and well play it up big through our eastern syndicate you can handle the magazine articles in a more dignified way if you choose a few good vigorous fearless newspaper stories written by some one on the ground will give congress such a jolt that no coal patents will be issued this season and no government aid will be given to the railroads you get the idea certainly but it will take time to do all that spend a year at it if necessary the review is fighting for a principle it will back you to any extent isnt it worth a year two years of hard labor to awaken the american people to the knowledge that they are being robbed of their birthright i have several men whom i could send but i chose you because your work along this line has given you a standing this is your chance eliza to make a big reputation and to perform a real service to the country its a chance that may never come your way again will you go of course ill go i knew you would youre all business and thats what makes a hit in this office youre up against a tough proposition but i can trust you to make good on it you cant fail if you play one interest against the other for theyre all fighting like kilkenny cats the heidlemanns are a bunch of bandits gordon is a brilliant unscrupulous promoter oneil is a cold shrewd schemer with more brains and daring than any of the others he showed that when he walked in there and seized the salmon river canon he broke up all their plans and set the copper trust by the ears but i understand theyve got him bottled up at last heres your transportation on saturdays steamer the editor shook miss appletons hand warmly as she rose good luck eliza remember we wont balk no matter how lively your stuff is the hotter the better and thats what the magazines want too if i were you id gumshoe it theyre a rotten crowd and they might send you back if they got wise i think not said eliza quietly the town of omar lay drenched in mist as the steamer bearing the representative of the review drew in at the dock the whole region was sodden and rainsoaked verdant with a lush growth no summer sun shone here to bake sprouting leaves or sear tender grasses beneath the sheltering firs a blanket of moss extended over hill and vale kneedeep and treacherous to the foot the mountain crests were white and down every gully streamed water from the melting snows the country itself lay on end as if crumpled by some giant hand and presented a tropical blend of colors there was the gray of fog and lowswept clouds the dense dark green of the spruces underlaid with the richer lighter shades where the summer vegetation rioted and running through it all were the shimmering silent reaches of the sound omar itself was a mushroom city sprung up by magic as if the dampness at its roots had caused it to rise overnight a sawmill shrieked complainingly a noisy switchengine shunted rows of flat cars back and forth tooting lustily the rattle of steamwinches and the cries of stevedores from a discharging freighter echoed against the hillsides close huddled at the waterfront lay the old cannery buildings greatly expanded and multiplied now and glistening with fresh paint back of them again lay the town its stumpy halfgraded streets terminating in the forest like the warty feelers of a stranded octopus everywhere was hurry and confusion and over all was the everpresent shroud of mist which thickened into showers or parted reluctantly to let the sun peep through dan appleton his clothing dewy from the fog his cheeks bronzed by exposure was over the rail before the ship had made fast and had eliza in his arms crushing her with the hug of a bear come up to the house sis quick he cried when the first frenzy of greeting was over your house and mine his eyes were dancing his face was alight with eagerness but danny she laughed squeezing his arm tenderly you live with mr oneil and all those other men in a horrible crawling bunkhouse oh do i ill have you know that our bunkhouses dont crawl and besides but wait its a sprise a sprise she queried eagerly for me he nodded tell me what it is quick you know i never could wait for sprises well its a brandnew ultrastylish residence for just you and me when the chief heard you were coming he had a cottage built danny it was only five days ago that i cabled you thats really ten days for us for you see we never sleep it is finished and waiting and your room is in white and the paint will be dry tomorrow hes a wonder remembering the nature of her mission eliza demurred im afraid i cant live there dan you know she hesitated i may have to write some rather dreadful things about him what dans face fell you are going to attack the chief i had no idea of that he looked genuinely distressed and a little stern she laid a pleading hand upon his arm forgive me dan she said i knew how you would feel and to tell the truth i dont like that part of it one bit but it was my big chance the sort of thing i have been waiting years for i couldnt bear to miss it there was a suspicion of tears in her eyes i didnt think it all out i just came things get awfully mixed dont they of course i wouldnt attack him unfairly but i do believe in conservation and what could i do but come here to you dan smiled to reassure her perhaps you wont feel like excoriating him when you learn more about things i know you wouldnt be unfair youd flunk the job first wait till you talk to him but you cant refuse his kindness for a time at least theres nowhere else for you to stay and murray would pick you up and put you into the cottage muckrake and all if i didnt he had to go out on the work this morning or hed have been here to welcome you he sent apologies and said a lot of nice things which ive forgotten well eliza still looked troubled all right but wait she cried with a swift change of mood ive made a little friend the dearest the most useless creature we shared the same stateroom and were sisters she actually says im pretty so of course im her slave for life she hurried away in the midst of dans loyal protestations that she was pretty more beautiful than the stars more pleasing to the eye than the orchids of brazil a moment later she reappeared to present natalie gerard dan greeted the new arrival with a cordiality in which there was a trace of shyness unusual with him weve made quite a change since you were up here miss gerard he remarked the ships stop first at omar now you see i trust it wont inconvenience you not in the least said natalie i shall arrive at hope quite soon enough omar khayyam is out in the wilderness somewhere eliza informed her girl friend with his book of verses and his jug of wine i suppose mr oneil yes but hell be back soon and meanwhile you are to come up and see our paradise it looks terribly wet natalie ventured perhaps wed better wait until the rain stops please dont dan laughed it wont stop until autumn and then it will only change to snow we dont have much sunshine you must youre tanned like an indian his sister exclaimed thats rust oneil wanted to get a record of the bright weather in omar so he put a man on the job to time it but the experiment failed how so we didnt have a stopwatch in town now come nobody ever catches cold here there isnt time he led the two girls ashore and up through the town to a mossgreen bungalow its newness attested by the yellow sawdust and fresh shavings which lay about amid their exclamations of delight he showed them the neatly furnished interior and among other wonders a bedroom daintily done in white with white curtains at the mullioned windows and a suite of wicker furniture where he dug all that up i dont know dan said pointing to the bed and dresser and chairs he must have had it hidden out somewhere eliza surveyed this chamber with wondering eyes it makes me feel quite ashamed she said though of course he did it for dan when he discovers my abominable mission hell probably set me out in the rain and break all my leadpencils but isnt he magnificent he quite overwhelms one natalie agreed back in new york hes been sending me american beauties every week for more than a year its his princely way she colored slightly despite the easy frankness of her manner oh hes always doing something like that dan informed them whereupon his sister exclaimed you see natalie the man is a viper if he let his beard grow im sure wed see it was blue you shall have an opportunity of judging came oneils voice from behind them and he entered with hands outstretched smiling at their surprise when he had expressed his pleasure at natalies presence and had bidden both her and eliza welcome to omar he explained ive just covered eighteen miles on a railroad tricycle and my back is broken the engines were busy but i came anyhow hoping to arrive before the steamer now what is this i hear about my beard it was elizas turn to blush and she outdid natalie they were raving about your gallantry said dan with all a brothers ruthlessness until i told them it was merely a habit of mind with you then sis called you a bluebeard oneil smiled stroking his stubbly chin you see its only gray i dont see said eliza still flushing furiously you would if i continued to let it grow hmm i think myself its a sort of bluish gray said dan you are still working miracles natalie told oneil an hour later while he was showing his visitors the few sights of omar miracles of kindness as usual dan and his sister were following at a distance arm in arm and chattering like magpies no no that cottage is nothing miss appleton had to have some place to stop this all seems like magic natalie paused and looked over the busy little town and to think you have done it in a year it was not i who did it the credit belongs to those boys of whom i told you they are all here by the way parker mckay mellen sheldon doc gray he has the hospital you know and mr slater oh we couldnt exist without happy tom no the only miracle about all this is the loyalty that has made it possible it is that which has broken all records in railroadbuilding thats what has pushed our tracks forward until were nearly up to one of natures real miracles you shall see those glaciers one of these days sometimes i wonder if even the devotion of those men will carry us through the final test but you shall meet them all tonight my whole family i cant the ship leaves this afternoon ive arranged to send you to hope in my motorboat just as mr gordon sent me on my way a year ago you will stay with the appletons tonight and help at the housewarming then dan will take you on in the morning women are such rare guests at omar that we refuse to part with them you agree how can i refuse your word seems to be law here ill send word to mother by the ship that i am detained by royal decree she spoke with a gaiety that seemed a little forced and at mention of her departure a subtle change had come over her face oneil realized that she had matured markedly since his last meeting with her there was no longer quite the same effect of naive girlishness this was a very unhappy year for your loyal subject mr oneil im sorry he declared with such genuine kindliness that she was moved to confide in him mother and i are ruined will you tell me about it its merely those wretched coal claims i have a friend in the land office at washington and remembering what you said i asked him to look them up i knew no other way to go about it he tells me that something was done or was not done by us and that we have lost all we put in i urged gordon to obey that ruling last spring natalie saw that his face was dark with indignation and the knowledge that he really cared set her heart to pounding gratefully she was half tempted to tell about that other that greater trouble which had stolen in upon her peace of mind and robbed her of her girlhood but she shrank from baring her wounds above all a wound so vital and so personal as this does your mother know he queried no i preferred to tell her in mr gordons presence murray noticed that she no longer called the man uncle but now that the time has come im frightened never allow yourself to be afraid fear is something false it doesnt exist it seems to me he was unfaithful to his trust am i right that is something you must judge for yourself he told her gravely you see i dont know anything about the reasons which prompted him to sacrifice your rights he may have had very good reasons i dare say he had in building this railroad i have felt but one regret that is the indirect effect it may have upon you and your mother your affairs are linked closely with gordons and the success of my enterprise will mean the failure of his you mustnt feel that way im sure it wont affect us at all for we have nothing more to lose sometimes i think his judgment is faulty erratic wonderful man though he is mother trusts him blindly of course and so do i yet i hardly know what to do it is impossible that he did worse than make a mistake her dark eyes were bent upon murray and they were eloquent with the question which she could not bring herself to ask he longed to tell her frankly that curtis gordon was a charlatan or even worse and that his fairest schemes were doomed to failure by the very nature of his methods but instead he said im deeply distressed i hope things are not as bad as you think and that mr gordon will be able to straighten them out for you if ever i can be of service you must be sure to call upon me her thanks were conventional but in her heart was a deep warm gratitude for she knew that he meant what he said and would not fail her dan appleton eying natalie and his chief from a distance exclaimed admiringly shes a perfect peach sis she registered a home run with me the first time at bat she is nice you know a fellow gets mighty lonely in a place like this shed make a dandy sisterinlaw for you wouldnt she forget it said eliza sharply thats rank insubordination omar khayyam snatched her from the briny and tried to die for her he has bought her two acres of the most expensive roses and he remembers the date of her birthday just you keep your hands off how does she feel about him oh she heroizes him of course i dont know just how deep the feeling goes but i got the impression that it was pretty serious two women cant borrow hairpins and mix powder puffs for a week and remain strangers then as for daniel appleton ce good night exclaimed her brother ruefully if i were a woman id marry him myself provided i could get ahead of the rush but being a male of the species i suppose i shall creep out into the jungle and sulk righto dont enter this race for im afraid youd be a bad loser personally i cant see anything in him to rave about what scares me pink is the knowledge that i must tell him the wretched business that brings me here if he strikes me danny remember im still your sister when the big gong gave the signal for luncheon appleton conducted natalie and eliza to the company messroom where the field and office force dined together and presented them to his fellowlieutenants at suppertime those who had been out on the line during the day were likewise introduced and after a merry meal the whole party escorted the two girls back to the green bungalow why heres a piano eliza exclaimed upon entering the parlor i borrowed it for the evening from the elite saloon oneil volunteered its a dissipated old instrument and some of its teeth have been knocked out in drunken brawls im afraid but the owner vouched for its behavior on this occasion it knows only one tune i wont go home until morning dan declared mckay however promptly disproved this assertion by seating himself at the keyboard and rattling off some popular melodies with music and laughter the long twilight fled for oneils boys flung themselves into the task of entertaining his guests with wholesouled enthusiasm so successful were their efforts that even happy tom appeared to derive a mild enjoyment from them which was a testimonial indeed his pleasure was made evident by no word of praise nor faintest smile but rather by the lightened gloom in which he chewed his gum and by the fact that he complained of nothing in truth he was not only entertained by the general gaiety but he was supremely interested in miss appleton who resembled no creature he had ever seen he had met many girls like natalie and feared them but eliza with her straightforward airs and her masculine mannerisms was different she affected him in a way at once pleasant and disagreeable he felt no diffidence in speaking to her for instance a phenomenon which was in itself a ground for suspicion then too her clothes he could not take his eyes off her clothes were almost like dans that seemed to show common sense but was probably only the sign of an eccentric domineering nature on the other hand the few words she addressed to him were gracious and her eyes had a merry twinkle which warmed his heart she must be all right he reluctantly concluded being dans sister and oneils friend but deep down in his mind he cherished a doubt at her first opportunity eliza undertook to make that confession the thought of which had troubled her all the afternoon drawing oneil aside she began with some trepidation have you any idea why im here i supposed either you or dan had achieved your pet ambition far from it i have a fell purpose and when you learn what it is i expect you to move the piano out thats what always happens in the play when the heroine is dispossessed well then ive been sent by the review to bare all the disgraceful secrets of your life im delighted to learn youll be here so long you cant possibly finish that task before next spring his manner though quizzical was genuinely hearty dont laugh said the girl theres nothing funny about it i came north as a spy then youre a northern spy apples she cried you remembered didnt you i never supposed men like you could be flippant well here goes for the worst she outlined her conversation with the editor of her paper so you think im trying to steal alaska he said when she had concluded that seems to be the general idea its a pretty big job whoever controls transportation will have the country by the throat yet somebody must build railroads since the government wont did it ever occur to you that there is a great risk involved in a thing of this sort and that capital must see a profit before it enters a new field i wonder if you know how badly this country needs an outlet and how much greater the benefit in dollars and cents will be to the men in the interior than to those who finance the road but i perceive that you are a conservationist rabid eliza bridled a little at the hint of amused superiority in his voice im a suffragist too i dare say that adds to your disgust nonsense he protested i have no quarrel with conservation nor with votes for women neither have i anything to conceal im only afraid that like most writers you will be content with halfinformation incomplete facts are responsible for most misunderstandings if you are in earnest and will promise to take the time necessary to get at all the facts ill make an agreement with you i promise time and a typewriter are my only assets i dont intend to be hurried dan approached drawn by the uncomfortable knowledge of his sisters predicament and broke in oh sis has time to burn shes going to write a book on the salmon canneries while shes here its bound to be one of the six best smellers oneil waved him away with the threat of sending him out among the mosquitoes ill agree to show you everything were doing even to the coalfields even to them you shall know everything then you can write what you please and when ive exposed you to the world as a commercial pickpocket as a looter of the public domain after congress has appropriated your fabulous coal claims will you nail up the door of this little cottage and fire dan no will you still be nice to me my dear child you are my guest come and go when and where you will omar is yours so long as you stay and when you depart in triumph leaving me a broken discredited wretch i shall stand on the dock and wave you a bon voyage now its bedtime for my boys since we rise at five oclock heavens five why the sun isnt up at that time the sun shines very little here thats why we want you to stay at omar i wish we might also keep miss natalie when the callers had gone eliza told natalie and dan he took it so nicely that i feel more ashamed than ever one would think he didnt care at all do you suppose he does theres no denying that you appeared at an unfortunate time said her brother why well im not sure well ever succeed with this project parker says the glacier bridge can be built but the longer he studies it the graver he gets its making an old man of him what does mr oneil say oh hes sanguine as usual he never gives up but he has other things to worry him money its money money all the time he wasnt terribly rich to begin with and he has used up all his own fortune besides what the other people put in you see he never expected to carry the project so far he believed the trust would buy him out well it hasnt and it evidently doesnt intend to when it learned of his plan its engineers beat it out to the glaciers and looked them over then they gave up their idea of building in from cortez but instead of making terms with us they moved their whole outfit down to kyak bay right alongside of the coalfields and now it has become a race to the glaciers with gordon fighting us on the side just to make matters lively the trust has the shorter route but we have the start why didnt mr oneil take kyak as a terminus instead of omar he says its not feasible kyak is an open harbor and he says no breakwater can be built there to withstand the storms he still clings to that belief although the trust is actually building one if they succeed were cooked meanwhile hes rushing work and straining every nerve to raise more money now you come along with a proposal to advertise the whole affair to the public as a gigantic graft and set congress against him i think he treated you mighty well under the circumstances i wont act against my convictions eliza declared firmly even if it means calamity to everybody natalie spoke for the first time her voice tuned to a pitch of feeling that contrasted oddly with their conversational tones if you hurt my irish prince she said i shall hate you as long as i live ix wherein gordon shows his teeth affairs at hope were nearly if not quite as prosperous as those at omar for curtis gordons advertising had yielded large and quick returns his experiment during the previous summer of bringing his richest stockholders north had been a great success they had come ostensibly at his expense and once on the ground had allowed themselves to be fairly hypnotized they had gone where he led had seen what he pointed out had believed what he told them their imaginations were fired with the grandeur of an undertaking which would develop the vast resources of the north country for the benefit of the struggling pioneers of the interior and humanity in general incidentally they were assured over and over again in a great variety of ways that the profits would be tremendous gordon showed them hope and its halfcompleted mine buildings he showed them the mountain behind it was a large mountain they noticed there were trees on the sides of it and snow on its top they marveled he said its heart was solid copper ore and they gasped had he told them in the same impressive manner that the hill contained a vein three inches thick they would have exhibited the same astonishment they entered the dripping tunnels and peered with grave approval at the drills the rockcars and the montenegrin miners they rambled over the dumps to the detriment of shoeleather and shins filling their suitcases with samples of perfectly good country rock they confessed to each other with admirable conservatism that the proposition looked very promising very promising indeed and they listened with appreciation to gordons glowing accounts of his railroad enterprise the physical evidence of which consisted of a mile or two of track which shrank along the steep shorefront and disappeared into a gulch as if ashamed of itself he had a wonderful plan to consolidate the mining and railroad companies and talked of a giant holding corporation which would share in the profits of each the details were intricate but he seemed to see them all with perfect clearness and his victims agreed he entertained them on a scale that was almost embarrassing and when they returned to their homes they outdid one another in their praise of the financial genius who was leading them to the promised land of profits and preferred stock as a matter of course they one and all advised their friends to buy vouching for the fabulous richness of hope consolidated and since their statements were backed by a personal examination of the property subscriptions came pouring in all in all the excursion had proven so profitable that gordon had arranged for another designed to accommodate new investors and promising prospects preparations for their welcome were under way when natalie arrived the girl and her mother talked late that evening and gordon saw on the following morning that gloria at least had passed a trying night but he gave himself no uneasiness emotional storms were not unusual he always disregarded them as far as possible and usually they passed off quietly during breakfast he informed them i received a letter from miss golden in yesterdays mail she is to be one of the new party did you invite her to return this summer mrs gerard inquired yes i remember her well said natalie too well in fact i thought her very bold she is one of our largest investors and she writes she would enjoy spending a fortnight here after the others go back will you allow it allow it my dear gloria i cant possibly refuse in fact it would be the height of inhospitality not to urge her to do so she is welcome to stay as long as she chooses for these quarters are as much hers as ours i hope you will be nice to her mrs gerard made no answer but later in the morning sought gordon in his private office i preferred not to discuss the golden woman before natalie she explained coldly but you dont really intend to have her here do you most assuredly then i shall have to tell her she is not welcome you will do nothing of the sort my dear you will assume the duties of hostess for which no one is more charmingly qualified mrs gerards lips were white with anger as she retorted i shall not allow that woman under the same roof with natalie as usual you choose the most inconvenient occasion for insisting upon your personal dislikes my dislike has nothing to do with the matter i overlooked her behavior with you last year as i have overlooked a good many things in the past but this is asking too much gordons coldness matched her own as he said i repeat this is no time for jealousy jealousy its an insult to natalie miss golden is one of our largest stockholders thats not true i had denny look up the matter so gordon flared up angrily denny has been showing you the books eh he had no more right to do that than you had to pry into my affairs while miss goldens investment may not be so large as some others she has influential friends she did yeoman service in the cause and i cant allow your foolish fancies to interfere with my plans fancies cried the woman furiously you behaved like a schoolboy with her it was disgraceful i refuse to let her associate with my daughter arent we drawing rather fine distinctions gordons lip curled in the first place natalie has no business here since she came uninvited for the second time she must put up with what she finds i warned you last summer that she might suspect she did she does she discovered the truth a year ago mrs gerards usually impassive face was distorted and she voiced her confession with difficulty the devil ejaculated gordon the woman nodded she accused me last night i tried to lie but god how i have lived through these hours ill never know hmm gordon reflected briefly perhaps after all its just as well that she knows she would have found it out sooner or later and theres some satisfaction in knowing that the worst is over never before had his callous cynicism been so frankly displayed it chilled her and made the plea she was about to voice seem doubly difficult i wish i looked upon the matter as you do she said slowly but other people havent the same social ideas as we im crushed and she poor child i dont know how she had the courage to face it now that she has heard the truth from my own lips im afraid it will kill her gordon laughed nonsense natalie is a sensible girl disillusionment is always painful but never fatal sooner or later the young must confront the bald facts of life and i venture to say she will soon forget her schoolgirl morality let me explain my views of never cried the woman aghast if you do i shall she checked herself and buried her face in her hands i feel no regrets for myself for i drifted with my eyes open but this this is different dont you understand i am a mother or are you dead to all decent feeling my dear im the most tenderhearted of men of course i shall say nothing if you prefer for i am subservient to your commands in all things but calm yourself what is done cannot be undone in more even tones mrs gerard said you seem to think the matter is ended but it isnt natalie will never allow us to continue this way and it isnt just to her that we should we cant go on curtis you mean i must marry you she nodded he rose and paced the room before answering i always supposed you understood my views on that subject believe me they are unalterable and in no way the result of a pose nevertheless for my sake and natalies you will do it i cant lose the one thing i love best in the world it would seem that natalie has filled your head with silly notions he exclaimed impatiently she has awakened me i have her life to consider as well as my own we are all individuals supreme in ourselves responsible only to ourselves we must all live our own lives she cannot live yours nor you hers i am familiar with your arguments mrs gerard said wearily but i have thought this all out and there is no other way he frowned in his most impressive manner and his chest swelled ominously i will not be coerced you know i cant be bullied into a thing i deny that you have any right to demand im not demanding anything i merely ask this this favor the first one i have ever asked you see my pride is crumbling dont answer now lets wait until we are both calmer the subject came up at least she approached it by asking about the coal claims she is worried about them indeed she was told by a friend in the land office that our rights had been forfeited i assured her i refused to heed the absurd rulings of the department if that is what she refers to then we have lost mrs gerards pallor increased technically yes in reality i shall show that our titles were good and that our patents should issue but the womans bloodless fingers were tightly interlaced all i have all natalie has is in those claims yes and it would require another fortune the size of both to comply with the senseless vagaries of the interior department and to protect your interests i grew weary of forever sending good hardearned dollars after bad ones merely because of the shifting whim of some theorist five thousand miles away then i am afraid mrs gerards voice trailed out miserably it is all we have and you told me gordon broke in irritably my dear gloria spare me this painful faultfinding if i can win for you i shall do so and then you will agree that i acted wisely if i lose it will merely be the luck of the average investor we played for big returns and of course the risks were great but mr oneil told her his claims gordons blazing eyes warned her oneil eh so he is the friend in the land office no doubt he also gave natalie the suggestion that led to her scene with you tell her to occupy herself less with affairs which do not concern her and more with her own conduct her actions with that upstart have been outrageous what about your own actions with the golden woman cried mrs gerard reverting with feminine insistence to the subject of their first difference what are you going to do about her nothing remember i refuse to share the same roof with her you wouldnt ask it of your wife now this second reference to a disagreeable subject was unfortunate gordon was given to the widest vagaries of temper and this interview had exasperated him beyond measure for he was strained by other worries he exploded harshly please remember that you are not my wife my ideas on matrimony will never change you ought to know by this time that i am granite i cant give up natalie i would give up much for we women dont change but a fallacy he laughed disagreeably pardon me gloria if i tell you that you do change that you have changed that time has left its imprint upon even you a cruel fact but true he took a savage pleasure in her trembling for she had roused all the devils in him and they were many you are growing tired not at all but you have just voiced the strongest possible argument against marriage we grow old age brings its alterations i have ever been a slave to youth and beauty and the years bring to me only an increasing appreciation a more critical judgment of the beautiful if i chose to marry well frankly the mature charms of a woman of my own age would have slight attraction for me then i will go said mrs gerard faintly not by any wish of mine he assured her you are quite welcome to stay things will run along in the usual way more smoothly perhaps now that we have attained a complete understanding you have no place to go nor means with which to insure a living for yourself and natalie i would hate to see you sacrifice yourself and her to a puritanical whim for i owe you much happiness and im sure i should miss you greatly some one must rule and since nature has given me the right i shall exercise it we will have no more rebellion mrs gerard left the room dazed and sick with despair we must go we must go she kept repeating but her tragic look alarmed natalie far more than her words yes yes the girl took her in her arms and tried to still the ceaseless trembling which shook the mothers frame while her own tears fell unheeded we must go now yes dearest but where you love me still asked gloria i suppose you need me too dont you i hadnt thought of that every hour the round young arms pressed her closer you wont think of of leaving me mrs gerard shook her head slowly no i suppose that must be part of the price but penniless friendless where can we go mr oneil my irish prince faltered the daughter through her tears perhaps he would take us in omar khayyam said eliza appleton entering oneils office briskly you are the general trouble man so prepare to listen to mine wont the kitchen flue draw or has a hinge come off the bungalow door murray smiled he was harassed by endless worries a dozen pressing matters called for his instant attention yet he showed no trace of annoyance if so ill be right up and fix it the kitchen chimney has a draught that threatens to draw dans salary out with the smoke every time i cook a meal and the house is dandy this is a real manssize tribulation so of course i run to you simon legree is at his tricks again legree the girl nodded her blond head vigorously yes hes stolen mrs st claires slaves and she and little eva are out in the cold what the deuce are you talking about gordon of course and the two gerards natalie and gloria town hall tonight come one come all oh oneils eyes brightened there have been terrible goingson over at hope i went up yesterday in my official capacity to reconnoiter the enemys position and to give him a preliminary skirmish but the great man was sulking in his tent and sent word by a menial for me to begone or look out for the bloodhounds isnt he the haughty thing i dont like to begone i refuse to git when im told so of course i paid my respects to natalie and her mother but what do you think i found mrs st claire desolated eva dissolved in tears and her hair down will you talk sense just try a little nonsense and see well the great eruption has taken place and the loss of life was terrible among those buried in the cinders are the duskyeyed heroine and her friend mother it seems eva had a hand in the overseers exposure yes yes its about those coal claims i knew it was coming she told her mother of the horrid treachery and mother lugged the complaint to gordon and placed it in his lap result confession and defiance from him even the family jewels are gone is gordon broke hes weltering in money but the coal claims are lost and he wants to know what theyre going to do about it the women are ruined he magnanimously offers them his bounty but of course they refuse to accept it hasnt he made any provision for them coffee and cakes three times a day thats all he wont even provide transportation and the troupe cant walk home they refuse to stay there but they cant get away ive cabled the review overdrawing my salary scandalously and dan is eager to help but the worst of it is neither of those women knows how to make a living natalie wants to work but the extent of her knowledge is the knack of frosting a layer cake and her mother never even sewed on a button in all her life it would make a lovely sunday story and it wouldnt help curtis gordon with his stockholders you wont write it of course oh i suppose not but its maddening not to be able to do something since theres a law against manslaughter the pencil is my only weapon id like to jab it clear through that ruffian elizas animated face was very stern her generous mouth was set firmly you can leave out the personal element he told her theres still a big story there if you realize that it runs back to washington and involves your favorite policy of conservation those claims belonged to natalie and her mother i happen to know that their locations were legal and that there was never any question of fraud in the titles hence they were entitled to patents years ago gordon did wrong of course in refusing to obey the orders of the secretary of the interior even though he knew those orders to be senseless and contradictory but the women are the ones to suffer the government froze them out this is only one instance of what delay and indecision at headquarters has done ill show you others before we are through as for those two you say they want to do something its not a question of wanting theyve got to do something or starve they would scrub kitchens if they knew how why didnt they come to me do you need a cook and a dishwasher murray frowned our new hotel is nearly finished perhaps mrs gerard would accept a position as as hostess hostess in a railroadcamp hotel who ever heard of such a thing eliza eyed him incredulously oneils flush did not go unnoticed as he said quietly it is unusual but well try it she might learn to manage the business with a competent assistant the salary will be ample for her and natalie to live on eliza laid a hand timidly upon his arm and said in an altered tone omar khayyam youre a fine old persian gentleman i know what it will mean to those two poor women and i know what it will mean to you for of course the salary will come out of your pocket he smiled down at her its the best i can offer and im sure you wont tell them of course not i know how it feels to lose a fortune too for ive been through the mill dont laugh you have a load on your shoulders heavier than mr sinbads and its mighty nice of you to let me add to the burden i i hope it wont break your poor back now im going up to your bungalow and lock myself into your white bedroom and have a good cry he said noting the suspicious moisture in her eyes certainly not eliza exclaimed indignantly im not the least bit sentimental x in which the doctor shows his wit oneils talk with mrs gerard upon her arrival from hope was short and businesslike neither by word nor look did he show that he knew or suspected anything of the real reason of her break with gordon toward both her and natalie he preserved his customary heartiness and their first constraint soon disappeared mrs gerard had been plunged in one of those black moods in which it seems that no possible event can bring even a semblance of happiness but it was remarkable how soon this state of mind began to give way before oneils matteroffact cheerfulness he refused to listen to their thanks and made them believe that they were conferring a real favor upon him by accepting the responsibility of the new hotel pending the completion of that structure he was hard pressed to find a lodgingplace for them until eliza and her brother insisted that they share the bungalow with them a thing oneil had not felt at liberty to ask under the circumstances nor was the tact of the brother and sister less than his they received the two unfortunates as honored guests gradually the visitors began to feel that they were welcome that they were needed that they had an important task to fulfil and the sense that they were really of service drove away depression night after night they lay awake discussing the wonderful change in their fortunes and planning their future natalie at least had not the slightest doubt that all their troubles were at an end one morning they awoke to learn that oneil had gone to the states leaving dr gray in charge of affairs at omar during his absence the physician who was fully in his chiefs confidence gravely discussed their duties with them and so discreet was he that they had no faintest suspicion that he knew their secret it was typical of oneil and his boys that they should show this chivalry toward two friendless outcasts it was typical of them also that they one and all constituted themselves protectors of natalie and her mother letting it be known through the town that the slightest rudeness toward the women would be promptly punished while oneils unexpected departure caused some comment no one except his trusted lieutenants dreamed of the grave importance of his mission they knew the necessities that hounded him they were well aware of the trembling insecurity in which affairs now stood but they maintained their cheerful industry they pressed the work with unabated energy and the road crept forward foot by foot as steadily and as smoothly as if he himself were on the ground to direct it many disappointments had arisen since the birth of the salmon river northwestern many misfortunes had united to retard the development of its builders plans the first obstacle oneil encountered was that of climate during the summer unceasing rains mists and fogs dispirited his workmen and actually cut their efficiency in half he had made certain allowances for this of course but no one could have foreseen so great a percentage of inefficiency as later developed in winter the cold was intense and the snows were of prodigious depth while outside the shelter of the omar hills the winds howled and rioted over the frozen delta chilling men and animals and paralyzing human effort under these conditions it was hard to get workmen and thrice harder to keep them so that progress was much slower than had been anticipated then too the physical difficulties of the country were almost insurmountable the morass which comprised the salmon river plain was in summer a bottomless ooze over which nothing could be transported yet in winter it became sheathed with a steelhard armor against which piling splintered it could be penetrated at that season only by the assistance of steam thawers which involved delay and heavy expense these were but samples of the obstacles that had to be met and every one realized that the work thus far had been merely preparatory the great obstruction upon the conquest of which the success of the whole undertaking hinged still lay before them but of all handicaps the most serious by far was the lack of capital murray had foreseen as inevitable the abandonment by the trust of its cortez route but its change of base to kyak had come as a startling surprise and as an almost crushing blow personally he believed its present plan to be even more impracticable than its former one but its refusal to buy him out had disheartened his financial associates and tightened their pursestrings into a knot which no argument of his could loose he had long since exhausted his own liquid capital he had realized upon his every available asset and his personal credit was tottering he was obliged to finance his operations upon new money a task which became ever more difficult as the months passed and the trust continued its work at kyak yet he knew that the briefest flagging even a temporary abandonment of work meant swift and utter ruin his track must go forward his labor must be paid his supplies must not be interrupted he set his jaws and fought on stubbornly certain of his ultimate triumph if only he could hold out a hundred miles to the westward was a melancholy example of failure in railroadbuilding in the form of two rows of rust upon a weedgrown embankment it was all that remained of another enterprise which had succumbed to financial starvation and the wasted millions it represented was depressing to consider thus far oneils rivalry with the trust had been friendly if spirited but his action in coming to the assistance of mrs gerard and her daughter raised up a new and vigorous enemy whose methods were not as scrupulous as those of the heidlemanns gordon was a strangely unbalanced man he was magnetic his geniality was really heartwarming yet he was perfectly coldblooded in his selfishness he was cool and calculating but interference roused him to an almost insane pitch of passion fickle in most things he was uncompromising in his hatreds oneils generosity in affording sanctuary to his defiant mistress struck him as a personal affront it fanned his dislike of his rival into a consuming rage it was with no thought of profit that he cast about for a means of crippling oneil he was quite capable of ruining himself not to speak of incidental harm to others if only he could gratify his spleen denny his trusted jackal resisted stoutly any move against the irish prince but his employer would not listen to him or consent to any delay therefore a certain plausible shiftyeyed individual by the name of linn was despatched to omar on the first steamer landing at his destination mr linn quietly effaced himself disappearing out the rightofway where he began moving from camp to camp ostensibly in search of employment it was a few days later perhaps a week after oneils departure that eliza appleton entered the hospital and informed dr gray ive finished my first story for the review the big physician had a rapid forceful habit of speech well i suppose you uncorked the vitriol bottle he said brusquely no since you are now the fount of authority here i thought id tell you that i have reserved my treachery for another time i havent learned enough yet to warrant real fireworks as a matter of fact ive been very kind to mr oneil in my story let me thank you for him now dont be sarcastic i could have said a lot of nasty things if he hadnt been so nice to me i suppose it is the corrupting influence of his kindness he really will be grateful the doctor assured her seriously newspaper publicity of the wrong sort might hurt him a great deal just now in every big enterprise there comes a critical time when everything depends upon one man strong as the structure seems hes really supporting it you see the whole thing rests ultimately on credit and confidence an illconsidered word a little unfriendly shove and down comes the whole works then some financial power steps in reorganizes the wreckage and gets the result of all the other fellows efforts for nothing dan tells me the affairs of the s r n are in just such a tottering condition yes were up against it for the time being our cards are on the table and you have it in your power to do us a lot of harm dont put it that way said eliza resentfully you and mr oneil and even dan make it hard for me to do my duty i wont let you rob me of my liberty ill get out and siwash it in a tent first the physician laughed dont mistake leafmold for muck thats all we ask oneil is perfectly willing to let you investigate him exactly and i could bite off his head for being so nice about it not that ive discovered anything against him for i havent i think hes fine but i object to the principle of the thing hell never peep no matter what you do or say it makes me furious to know how superior he is i never detested a mans virtues as i do his gordon is the sort i like for he needs exposing and expects it wait until i get at him and the trust the trust too eh of course now what have the heidlemanns done its not what they have done its what theyre going to do theyre trying to grab alaska dr gray shook his head impatiently but before he could make answer tom slater entered and broke into the conversation by announcing ive spotted him doc his name is linn and hes gordons hand hes at mile and fifty men are quitting from that camp that makes two hundred so far said the doctor hes offering a raise of fifty cents a day and transportation to hope gray scowled and eliza inquired quickly whats wrong uncle tom dont call me uncle tom slater exclaimed irritably i aint related to you miss appleton smiled at him sweetly i had a dear friend once you remind me of him he was such a splendid big man she said tom eyed her suspiciously he chewed gum incessantly too and declared that it never hurt anybody it never did asserted slater we pleaded we argued we did our best to save him but she shook her blond head sadly what happened to him what always happens he lingered along for a time stubborn to the last then turning abruptly to dr gray she asked who is this man linn and what is he doing hes an emissary of curtis gordon and hes hiring our men away from us snapped the physician why dan tells me mr oneil pays higher wages than anybody so he does but linn offers a raise we didnt know what the trouble was till over a hundred men had quit the town is full of them now and its becoming a stampede cant you meet the raise that wouldnt do any good tom agreed gordon dont want these fellows hes doing it to get even with murray for those wo he bit his words in two at a glance from gray what happened to the man that chewed gum he demanded abruptly oh yes poor fellow we warned him time and again but he was a sullen brute he wouldnt heed advice why dont you bounce this man linn why dont you run him out of camp fine counsel from a champion of equal rights smiled gray you forget we have laws and gordon has a press bureau it would antagonize the men and cause a lot of trouble in the end what oneil could do personally he cant do as the president of the s r n it would give us a black eye weve go to do something dam quick said slater or else the work will be tied up that would crab murrays deal ive got a pickhandle thats itching for linns head the speaker coughed hollowly and complained ive got a bad cold on my chest feels like pneumonia to me wouldnt that just be my luck do you have pains in your chest inquired the girl solicitously terrible but im so full of pains that i get used to em it isnt pneumonia slater flared up at this for he was jealous of his sufferings its gumbago eliza declared dr grays troubled countenance relaxed into a grin as he said ill give you something to rub on those leather lungs harnessoil perhaps is this labor trouble really serious asked the girl serious it may knock us out completely go away now and let me think pardon my rudeness miss appleton but slater paused at the door dont think too long doc he admonished him for theres a ship due in three days and by that time there wont be a roughneck left on the job itll take a month to get a new crew from the states and then it wouldnt be any good till it was broke in when he was alone the doctor sat down to weigh the news happy tom had brought but the more squarely he considered the matter the more alarming it appeared thus far the s r n had been remarkably free from labor troubles to permit them to creep in at this stage would be extremely perilous the briefest cessation of work might and probably would have a serious bearing upon oneils efforts to raise money gray felt the responsibility of his position with extraordinary force for his chiefs fortunes had never suffered in his hands and he could not permit them to do so now but how to meet this move of gordons he did not know he could think of no means of keeping these men at omar as he had to eliza to meet the raise would be useless and a new scale of wages once adopted would be hard to reduce successful or unsuccessful in its effect it would run into many thousands of dollars the physician acknowledged himself dreadfully perplexed he racked his brain uselessly yearning meanwhile for the autocratic power to compel obedience among his men he would have forced them back to their jobs had there been a way and the fact that they were duped only added to his anger it occurred to him to quarantine the town a thing he could easily do as port physician in case of an epidemic but omar was unusually healthy and beyond a few surgical cases his hospital was empty his meditations were interrupted by tom slater who returned to say give me that dope doc im coughing like a switch engine gray rose and went to the shelves upon which his drugs were arranged while the fat man continued that appleton girl has got me worried with her foolishness maybe i am sick anyhow i feel rotten what i need is a good rest and a nurse to wait on me the physicians eyes in running along the rows of bottles encountered one labeled oleum tiglii and paused there you need a rest eh he inquired mechanically if i dont get one ill wing my way to realms eternal i aint been dried off for three months gray turned to regard his caller with a speculative stare his fingers toyed with the bottle if it wasnt for this man linn id lay off id go to jail for him but i cant do anything with one foot always in the grave the doctors face lightened with determination tom youve been sent from heaven dyou mean ive been sent for from heaven the invalids red cheeks blanched into his mournful eyes leaped a look of quick concern say am i as sick as all that this will make you feel better gray uncorked the bottle and said shortly take off your shirt what for im going to rub your chest and arms slater obeyed with some reluctance pausing to inquire doubtfully you aint stripping me down so you can operate nonsense im feeling pretty good again its well to take these things early they all look alike at the beginning what things grippe gumbago smallpox godlmighty exclaimed slater with a start i havent got anything but a light cold then this liniment ought to be just the thing humph it dont smell like liniment tom declared after a moment but the doctor had fallen to work on him and he submitted with resignation perhaps an hour later dr gray appeared at the appleton bungalow and surprised eliza by saying ive come to you for some help youre the only soul in omar that i can trust have you gone raving mad she inquired no i must put an end to linns activity or well be ruined these workmen must be held in omar and you must help me do it they have the right to go where they please of course but gordon will let them out as soon as he has crippled us tell me would you like to be a trained nurse no i would not declared eliza vehemently im neither antiseptic nor prophylactic nevertheless youre going to be one tom needs you tom what ails him nothing at this moment but wait until tomorrow the physicians eyes were twinkling and when he had explained the cause of his amusement eliza laughed of course ill help she said but it wont hurt the poor fellow will it not in the least unless it frightens him to death toms an awful coward about sickness thats why i need some one like you to take care of him hell be at the hospital tomorrow at three if youll arrange to be there well break the news to him gently i darent tackle it alone tom was a trifle embarrassed at finding eliza in dr grays office when he entered on the next afternoon the boss packer seemed different than usual he was much subdued his cough had disappeared but in its place he suffered a nervous apprehension his cheeks were pale the gloom in his eyes had changed to a lurking uneasiness just dropped in to say im all right again he announced in an offhand tone thats good said gray you dont look well however im feeling fine mr slater hunched his shoulders as if the contact of his shirt was irksome to the flesh youd better let me rub you why are you scratching yourself i aint scratching you were the doctor was sternly curious he had assumed his coldest and most professional air well if i scratched i probably itched thats why people scratch aint it let me look you over i cant spare the time doc wait grays tone halted the speaker as he turned to leave im not going to let you out in this weather until i rub you this time there was no mistaking happy toms pallor i tell you i feel great he declared in a shaking voice i havent felt so good for years come come step into the other room and take off your shirt not on your life what do you mean i dont want no more of your dam liniment why because im because i dont then i suppose ill have to throw and hogtie you the physician rose and laid a heavy hand upon his patients arm at which tom exclaimed ouch leggo gimme the stuff and ill rub myself tom the very gravity of the speakers voice was portentous alarming mr slater hesitated his gaze wavered he scratched his chest unconsciously eliza shook her head pityingly she uttered an inarticulate murmur of concern you couldnt get my shirt off with a steamwinch i tell you im feeling grand why will you chew the horrid stuff miss appleton inquired sadly im just a little broke out thats all ah youre broken out i feared so said the doctor the grave concern in those two faces was too much for slaters sensitive nature his stubbornness gave way his selfcontrol vanished and he confessed wretchedly i spent an awful night doc ill bust into flame if this keeps up what is it anyhow is there an eruption of the arms and chest theyre all erupted to hell dr gray silently parted the shirt over slaters bosom hmm said he tell him what it is urged eliza in whom mirth and pity were struggling for mastery it has every appearance ofsmallpox the victim uttered a choking cry and sat down limply sweat leaped out upon his face beads appeared upon his round bald head i knew i was a sick man ive felt it coming on for three months but i fought it off for murrays sake say its chickenpox he pleaded never mind its seldom serious eliza endeavored to comfort the stricken man you wanted a good rest i dont i want to work ill have to quarantine you tom slater was in no condition for further resistance a complete collapse of body and mind had followed the intelligence of his illness he began to complain of many symptoms none of which were in any way connected with his fancied disease he was racked with pains he suffered a terrible nausea his head swam he spoke bravely of his destitute family and prepared to make his will when he left the hospital an hour later it was on a stretcher between four straining bearers that evening a disturbing rumor crept through the town of omar it penetrated the crowded saloons where the laborers who had quit work were squandering their pay and it caused a brief lull in the ribaldry but the mere fact that tom slater had come down with smallpox and had been isolated upon a fishingboat anchored in the creek seemed after all of little consequence some of the idlers strolled down the street to stare at the boat and upon their return verified the report they also announced that they had seen the yellowhaired newspaper woman aboard all dressed in white it was considered high time by the majority to leave omar for an epidemic was a thing to be avoided and a wager was made that the whole force would quit in a body as soon as the truth became known on the second day dr gray undertook to allay the general uneasiness but upon being pressed reluctantly acknowledged that his patient showed all the signs of the dread disease this hastened the general preparations for departure and when the incoming steamer hove in sight every laborer was at the dock with his kitbag it excited some idle comment among them to note that dr gray had gone down the bay a short distance to meet the ship and his efforts to speak it were watched with interest and amusement obviously it would have been much easier for him to wait until she landed for she came right on and drew in toward the wharf it was not until her bow line was made fast that the physician succeeded in hailing the captain then the deserters were amazed to hear the following conversation i cant let you land captain johnny came from dr grays launch and why cant you demanded brennan from the bridge of his new ship have you some prejudice against the irish the stern hawser was already being run out and the crowd was edging closer waiting for the gangplank there is smallpox here and as health officer ive quarantined the port there came a burst of elizabethan profanity from the little skipper but it was drowned by the shout from shore as the full meaning of the situation finally came home then the waiting men made a rush for the ship she had not touched as yet however and the distance between her and the pier was too great to leap above the confusion came brennans voice through a megaphone commanding them to stand back some one traitorously cast off the loop of the bow line the ships propellers began to thrash and the big steel hull backed away inch by inch foot by foot until amid curses and cries of rage she described a majestic circle and plowed off up the sound toward hope by a narrow margin the physician reached his hospital ahead of the infuriated mob and it was well that he did so for they were in a lynching mood but once within his own premises he made a show of determined resistance that daunted them and they sullenly retired that night omar rang with threats and deepbreathed curses and eliza appleton in the garb of a nurse tended her patient cheerfully to the delegation which waited upon him the next morning dr gray explained the nature of his duties as health officer informing them coolly that no living soul could leave omar without incurring legal penalties since he could prevent any ships from landing and inasmuch as the united states marshal was present to enforce the quarantine he seemed to be master of the situation how long will we be tied up demanded the spokesman of the party that is hard to say well were going to leave this camp the man declared darkly indeed where are you going were going to hope you might as well let us go we wont stand for this the physician eyed him coldly you wont may i ask how you are going to help yourselves were going to leave on the next steamer oh no youre not the marshal spoke up see here doc theres over two hundred of us and we cant stay here well go broke gray shrugged his broad shoulders sorry he said but you see ive no choice in the matter i never saw a case of smallpox that looked worse its a frameup growled the spokesman tom hasnt got smallpox any more than i have you cooked it to keep us here there was an angry second to this whereupon the doctor exclaimed you think so eh then just come with me where out to the boat where he is ill show you you wont show me no smallpox asserted one of the committee then you come with me the physician urged the leader so you can bottle me up too no thank you get the town photographer with his flashlight well help him make a picture then you can show it to the others i promise not to quarantine you after some hesitation the men agreed to this the photographer was summoned and joined the party on its way to the floating pesthouse it was not a pleasant place in which they found tom slater for the cabin of the fishingboat was neither light nor airy but eliza had done much to make it agreeable the sick man was propped up in his bunk and playing solitaire but he left off his occupation to groan as the newcomers came alongside when the cause of the visit had been made known however he rebelled i wont pose for no camera fiend he declared loudly it aint decent and im too sick dyou take me for a bearded lady or a living skeleton these men think youre stalling dr gray told him who me slater rolled an angry eye upon the delegation i aint sick eh i spose im doing this for fun i wish you had it thats all the three members of the committee of investigation wisely halted at the foot of the companionway stairs where the fresh air fanned them they were nervous and ill at ease drawing his covers closer slater shouted close that hatch you boneheads im blowing away the photographer ventured to remonstrate its mighty close in here doc is it safe to breathe the bugs perfectly safe gray assured him at least miss appleton hasnt suffered yet as a matter of fact the patient betrayed no symptoms of a wasting illness for his cheeks were ruddy he had eaten three hearty meals each day and the enforced rest had done him good so the committee saw nothing about him to satisfy their suspicions but when tom weakly called upon them for assistance in rising they shrank back and one of them exclaimed i wouldnt touch you with a fishpole eliza came forward however she permitted her charge to lean upon her while she adjusted the pillows at his back but when dr gray ordered him to bare his breast and arms slater refused positively he blushed he stammered he clutched his nightrobe with a horny hand which would have required a cold chisel to loosen and not until eliza had gone upon deck would he consent to expose his bulging chest but miss appleton had barely left the cabin when she was followed by the most timid member of the delegation he plunged up the stairs gasping ive saw enough hes got it and got it bad a moment later came the dull sound of the exploding flashlight then a yell and out of the smoke stumbled his two companions the spokesman it appeared had also seen enough too much for with another yell he leaped the rail and made for shore fortunately the tide was out and the water low he left a trail across the mud flat like that of a frightened hippopotamus when the two conspirators were finally alone upon the deck they rocked in each others arms striving to stifle their laughter meanwhile from the interior of the cabin came the feeble moans of the invalid that evening hastily made photographs of the sick man were shown upon the streets nor could the most skeptical deny that he presented a revolting sight and one warranting dr grays precautions in spite of this evidence however threats against the physician continued to be made freely but when eliza expressed fears for his safety he only smiled grimly and he stalked through the streets with such defiance written on his heavy features that no man dared raise a hand against him day after day the quarantine continued and at length some of the men went back to work as others exhausted their wages they followed in a fortnight omar was once more free of its floating population and work at the front was going forward as usual meanwhile the patient recovered in marvelous fashion and was loud in his thanks to the physician who had brought him through so speedily yet gray stubbornly refused to raise the embargo finally the cause of the whole trouble appeared at the hospital and begged to be released you put it over me said mr linn ive had enough and i want to get out i dont know what youre talking about answered the doctor no one can leave here now i know it wasnt smallpox at all but it worked just the same ill leave your men alone if youll let me go out on the next seattle steamer but i thought you came from hope gray said blandly mr linn shifted his eyes and laughed uneasily i did and im going to keep coming from hope you dont think id dare to go back after this do you why not gordon would kill me so mr gordon sent you you know he did but ive got to get out now im broke i didnt think it of gordon the doctor shook his head sadly how underhanded of him linn exploded desperately dont lets fourflush you were too slick for him and you sewed me up ive spent the money he gave me and now im flat you look strong we need men gordons emissary turned pale say you wouldnt set me to work why those men would string me up i think not ive spoken to the shift boss at mile and hell take care youre not hurt so long as you work hard and keep your mouth shut an hour later mr linn cursing deeply shouldered his pack and tramped out the grade nor could he obtain food or shelter until he had covered those thirty weary miles once at his destination he was only too glad to draw a numbered tag and fall to work with pick and shovel but at his leisure he estimated that it would take him until late the following month to earn his fare to the states xi the two sides of eliza violet appleton dan appleton entered the bungalow one evening wet and tired from his work to find eliza pacing the floor in agitation whats the matter sis he inquired with quick concern his sister pointed to a copy of the review which that days mail had brought look at that she cried read it oh your story eh read it he read a column and then glanced up to find her watching him with angry eyes gee thats pretty rough on the chief kid i thought you liked him he said gravely i do i do dont you understand dummy i didnt write that theyve changed my story distorted it im furious dan whistled softly i didnt suppose theyd try anything like that but they did a good job while they were at it why youd think oneil was a grafter and the s r n nothing but a landgrabbing deal how dared they the girl cried the actual changes arent so many just enough to alter the effect of the story but thats what makes it so devilish for instance i described the obstacles and the handicaps mr oneil has had to overcome in order to show the magnitude of his enterprise but drake has altered it so that the physical conditions here seem to be insuperable and he makes me say that the road is doomed to failure thats the way he changed it all through it may topple the chiefs plans over theyre very insecure it plays right into the hands of his enemies too and of course gordons press bureau will make the most of it heavens i want sympathy not abuse wailed his sister its all due to the policy of the review drake thinks everybody up here is a thief i dare say they are but how can i face mr oneil dan shook the paper in his fist are you going to stand for this he demanded hardly i cabled the office this morning and heres drakes answer she read stuff colorless dont allow admiration warp judgment can you beat that he thinks youve surrendered to murray like all the others i hate him cried eliza i detest him who oneil or drake both mr oneil for putting me in the position of a traitor and drake for presuming to rewrite my stuff im going to resign and im going to leave omar before murray oneil comes back dont be a quitter sis if you throw up the job the paper will send somebody who will lie about us to suit the policy of the office show em where theyre wrong show em what this country needs you have your magazine stories to write eliza shook her head bother the magazines and the whole business im thinking about mr oneil i i could cry i suppose ill have to stay and explain to him but then ill go home no youll stay right here and go through with this thing i need you you what for you can perform a great and a signal service for your loving brother hes in terrible trouble whats wrong danny elizas anger gave instant place to solicitude you you havent stolen anything lord no what put that into your head i dont know except thats the worst thing that could happen to us i like to start with the worst i cant sulk in the jungle any more im a rotten loser sis oh you mean natalie you like her for a writer you select the most foolish words like love adore worship words are no good anyway im dippy im out of my head ive lost my reason im deliriously happy and miserably unhappy i thats enough the girl exclaimed i can imagine the rest it was a fatal mistake for her to come to omar and to this very house of all places where i could see her every day i might have recovered from the first jolt if id never seen her again but he waved his hands hopelessly im beginning to hate oneil you miserable traitor gasped eliza yep thats me im dead to loyalty lost to the claims of friendship ive fought myself until im black in the face but its no use i must have natalie shes crazy about oneil seems to be for a fact but that doesnt alter my fix i cant live this way you must help me or ill lose my reason nonsense you havent any or you wouldnt talk like this what can i do its simple be nice to murray and and win him away from her eliza stared at him as though she really believed him daft then she said mockingly is that all just make him love me dan nodded that would be fine if you could manage it why you you i she gasped uncertainly for terms in which to voice her indignant surprise idiot she finally exclaimed thanks for such glowing praise dan said forlornly i feel a lot worse than an idiot an idiot is not necessarily evil at heart he may be likable and pathetic and merely unfortunate you simply cant be in earnest i am though he turned upon her eyes which had grown suddenly old and weary with longing you poor foolish boy in the first place mr oneil will hate me for this story in the second place no man would look at me im ugly i think youre beautiful with my snub nose and big mouth and you can make him laugh and when a woman can make a fellow laugh the rest is easy in the third place im mannish and vulgar and besides i dont care for him of course you dont or i wouldnt ask it you see were taking no risks you can at least take up his attention and and when you see him making for natalie you can put out your foot and trip him up it wouldnt be honorable danny possibly but that doesnt make any difference with me you may as well realize that ive got beyond the point where nice considerations of that sort weigh with me if youd ever been in love youd understand that such things dont count at all its your chance to save the reason and happiness of an otherwise perfectly good brother there is nothing i wouldnt do for your happiness nothing but oh its preposterous dan relapsed into gloomy silence and they had a very uncomfortable meal unable to bear his continued lack of spirits eliza again referred to the subject and tried until late in the evening to argue him out of his mood but the longer they talked the more plainly she saw that his feeling for natalie was not fanciful but sincere and deep she continued to scout his suggestion that she could help him by captivating oneil and stoutly maintained that she had no attraction for men nevertheless when she went to her room she examined herself critically in her mirror this done she gave herself over to her favorite relaxation first she exchanged her walkingskirt her prim shirtwaist and jacket for a rosepink wrapper which she furtively brought out of a closet it was a very elaborate wrapper all fluffy lace and ruffles and bows and it had cost eliza a sum which she strove desperately to forget she donned silk stockings and a pair of tiny bedroom slippers then seating herself once more at her dresser she let down her hair she invariably wore it tightly drawn back so tightly in fact that dan had more than once complained that it pulled her eyebrows out of place on this occasion however she crimped it she curled it she brought it forward about her face in soft riotous puffs and strands patting it into becoming shape with dexterous fingers until it formed a golden frame for her piquant features now this was no unusual performance for her in the midnight solitude of her chamber she regularly gave rein to the feminine side of her nature by day she was the severe matteroffact businesslike eliza appleton deaf to romance lost to illusion and unresponsive to masculine attention but deep in her heart were all the instincts and longings of femininity and at such times as this they came uppermost her bedroom had none of the puritanical primness which marked her habit of dress it was in no way suggestive of the masculine character which she so proudly paraded upon the street on the contrary it was a bower of daintiness and was crowded with all the senseless fripperies of a schoolgirl carefully hidden away beneath her starched shirtwaists was much lingerie bewildering creations to match the pink wrapper and this she petted and talked to adoringly when no one could hear eliza read much when she was unobserved romances and improbable tales of fine ladies and gallant squires there were times too when she wrote chewing her pencil in the perplexities of vividly colored love scenes but she always destroyed these manuscripts before the curious sun could spy upon her labors in such ecstatic flights of fancy the beautiful heroine was a languorous brunette with hair of raven hue and soulful eyes in which slumbered the mystery of a tropic night she had a grecian nose moreover and her name was violet from all this it may be gathered that eliza appleton was by no means the extraordinary person she seemed beneath her false exterior she was shamelessly normal in the days before oneils return she suffered constant misgivings and qualms of conscience but the sight of her brother reveling expanding fairly bursting into bloom beneath the influence of natalie gerard led her to think that perhaps she did have a duty to perform dans cause was hers and while she had only the faintest hope of aiding it she was ready to battle for his happiness with every weapon at her command the part she would have to play was not exactly nice she reflected but the ties of sisterhood were strong and she would have made any sacrifice for dan she knew that natalie was fond of him in a casual friendly way and although it was evident that the girl accorded him none of that heroworship with which she favored his chief eliza began to think there still might be some hope for him since we are all prone to argue our consciences into agreement with our desires she finally brought herself to the belief that oneil was not the man for natalie he was too old too confirmed in his ways and too selfcentered to make a good husband for a girl of her age and disposition once her illusions had been rubbed away through daily contact with him she would undoubtedly awaken to his human faults and unhappiness would result for both what natalie needed for her lasting contentment was a boy her own age whose life would color to match hers so argued eliza with that supreme satisfaction which we feel in arranging the affairs of others to suit ourselves she was greatly embarrassed nevertheless when she next met oneil and tried to explain that story in the review he listened courteously and smiled his gentle smile my dear said he finally i knew there had been some mistake so lets forget that it ever happened now tell me about the smallpox epidemic when i heard what linn was doing with our men i was badly worried for i couldnt see how to checkmate him but it seems you and doc were equal to the occasion he cabled me a perfectly proper announcement of toms quarantine and i believed we had been favored by a miracle it wasnt a miracle at all eliza said in a matteroffact tone it was croton oil nobody has dared tell him the truth he still believes he could smell the tuberoses oneil seemed to derive great amusement from her account of what followed he had already heard dr grays version of the affair but eliza had a refreshing way of saying things i brought you a little present he said when she had finished she took the package he handed her exclaiming with a slight flush of embarrassment a sprise nobody but dan ever gave me a present then her eyes darkened with suspicion did you bring me this because of what i did now dont be silly i knew nothing about your part in the comedy until doc told me you are a most difficult person slowly she unwrapped the parcel and then with a gasp lifted a splendidly embroidered kimono from its box ohh her eyes were round and astonished ohh its for me it was a regal garment of heavy silk superbly ornamented with golden dragons each so cunningly worked that it seemed upon the point of taking wing why their eyes glitter and theyd breathe fire if i jabbed them ohh she stared at the gift in helpless amazement is it mine honestly he nodded wont you put it on over these things never again miss appleton blushed for she recalled that she had prepared for his coming with extraordinary care her boots were even stouter than usual her skirt more plain her waist more stiff and her hair more tightly smoothed back it would take a fluffy person to wear this ill always keep it of course and ill worship it but im not designed for pretty clothes ill let natalie wear natalie has one of her own done in butterflies and i brought one to her mother also and you bought this for me after you had seen that fiendish story over my signature certainly he quickly forestalled her attempted thanks by changing the subject now then dan tells me you are anxious to begin your magazinework so im going to arrange for you to see the glaciers and the coalfields it will be a hard trip for the track isnt through yet but oh ill take care of myself i wont get in anybodys way she said eagerly i intend to see that you dont by going with you so make your preparations and well leave as soon as i can get away when he had gone the girl said aloud eliza voilet this is your chance its underhanded and mean but youre a mean person and the finger of providence is directing you she snatched up the silken kimono and ran into her room locking the door behind her hurriedly she put it on then posed before the mirror next down came her hair amid a shower of pins she arranged it loosely about her face and ripping an artificial flower from her party hat placed it over her ear then swayed grandly to and fro while the golden dragons writhed and curved as if in joyous admiration a dozen times she slipped out of the garment and gathering it to her face kissed it a dozen times she donned it strutting about her little room like a peacock her tiptilted nose was red and her eyes were wet when at last she laid it out upon her bed and knelt with her cheek against it gee if only i were pretty she sighed i almost believe he likes me tom slater laboriously propelled himself up the hill to the bungalow that evening and seated himself on the topmost step near where eliza was rocking she had come to occupy a considerable place in his thoughts of late for she was quite beyond his understanding she affected him as a mental gadfly stinging his mind into an activity quite unusual at times he considered her a nice girl though undoubtedly insane then there were other moments when she excited his deepest animosity again on rare occasions she completely upset all his preconceived notions by being so friendly and so sympathetic that she made him homesick for his own daughter in his idle hours therefore he spent much time at the appleton cottage where have you been lately uncle tom she began slater winced at the appellation but ignored it ive been out on the delta hustling supplies ahead heard the news no curtis gordon has bought the mcdermott outfit in kyak that tells me nothing who is mcdermott hes a shoestringer he had a wildcat plan to build a railroad from kyak to the coalfields but he never got farther than a row of alder stakes and a book of press clippings does that mean that gordon abandons his hope route yep hes swung in behind us and the heidlemanns now its a threesided race with us in the lead mellen just brought in the news half an hour ago he was on his way down from the glaciers when he ran into a field party of gordons surveyors looks like trouble ahead if they try to crowd through the canon alongside of us he must believe kyak bay will make a safe harbor dont say it if hes right were fried to a nice brown finish on both sides and its time to take us off the stove im praying for a storm the prayers of the wicked are an abomination unto the lord quoted eliza sure but i keep right on praying just the same its a habit now the news has set the chief to jumping sideways which translated i suppose means that he is disturbed or words to that effect too bad they changed that newspaper story of yours yes it put a crimp in him how do you mean he had some california capitalists tuned up to put in three million dollars but when they read that our plan was impracticable their fountainpens refused to work oh eliza gasped faintly slater regarded her curiously then shook his head funny how a kid like you can scare a bunch of hardheaded bankers aint it he said doc gray explained that it wasnt your fault but it doesnt take much racket to frighten the big fish what will mr oneil do oh hell fight it out i spose the first thing is to block gordon say i brought you a present this is my lucky day smiled eliza as tom fumbled in his pocket im sure i shall love it it aint much but it was the best in the crate and i shined it up on my towel mr slater handed eliza a fine red apple of prodigious size at sight of which the girl turned pale i dont like apples she cried faintly never mind theyre good for your complexion id die before id eat one then ill eat it for you my complexion aint what it was before i had the smallpox when he had carried out this intention and subjected his teeth to a process of vacuumcleaning he asked say what happened to your friend who chewed gum well he was hardly a friend miss appleton said if he had been a real friend he would have listened to my warning gum never hurt anybody slater averred argumentatively not ordinary gum but you see he chewed nothing except wintergreen thats what i chew elizas tone was one of shocked amazement not really oh well some people would thrive on it i dare say but he had indigestion me too thats why i chew it the girl eyed him during an uncomfortable pause finally she inquired do you ever feel a queer gnawing feeling like hunger if you go without your breakfast unhhunh dont you i wouldnt alarm you for the world uncle tom i aint your uncle you might chew the stuff for years and not feel any bad effects but if you wake up some morning feeling tired and listless ive done that too slaters gloomy eyes were fixed upon her with a look of vague apprehension is it a symptom certainly pepsinpoisoning its called this fellow i told you about was a charming man and since we had all tried so hard to save him we felt terribly at the end then he died umm yes and no remind me to tell you the story sometime here comes dan in a great hurry young appleton came panting up the hill goodby sis he said im off for the front in ten minutes anybody hurt slater asked quickly not yet but somebodys liable to be gordon is trying to steal the canon and murray has ordered me out with a car of dynamite to hold it dynamite why dan his sister exclaimed in consternation we have polingboats at the lower crossing and well be at the canon in two days im going to load the hillside with shots and if they try to come through ill set em off theyll never dare tackle it dans eyes were dancing his face was alive with excitement but suppose they should eliza insisted quietly then send doc gray with some stretchers i owe one to gordon and this is my chance drawing her aside he said in an undertone youve got to hold my ground with natalie while im gone dont let her see too much of murray ill do the best i can she answered him but if he seems to be in earnest ill renig no matter what happens to you danny he kissed her affectionately and fled xii how gordon failed in his cunning the socalled canon of the salmon river lies just above the twin glaciers scenically these are by far the more impressive and they present a more complex engineering problem yet the canon itself was the real strategic point in the struggle between the railroadbuilders the floor of the valley immediately above garfield glacier though several miles wide was partly filled with detritus which had been carried down from the mother range on the east and this mass of debris had forced the stream far over against the westward rim where it came roaring past the foot wall in a splendid cataract some three miles long to the left of the river looking upstream at this point the mountains slanted skyward like a roof until lost in the hurrying scud four thousand feet above to the right however was the old moraine just mentioned consisting of a desolate jumble of rock and gravel and silt overlaying the ice foot on account of its broken character and the unstable nature of its foundation this bank was practically useless for roadbuilding and the only feasible route for steel rails was along the steep west wall oneil on his first reconnaissance had perceived that while there was room for more than one bridge across the salmon between the upper and the lower ice masses there was not room for more than one track alongside the rapids some miles above that point he knew moreover that once he had established his title to a rightofway along the west rim of the cataract it would be difficult for a rival to oust him or to parallel his line without first crossing back to the east bank an undertaking at once hazardous and costly he had accordingly given dan appleton explicit instructions to be very careful in filing his survey that no opportunity might be left open for a later arrival the engineer had done his work well and oneil rested secure in the belief that he held possession of the best and least expensive route through to the open valleys above he had had no cause to fear a clash with the heidlemann forces for they had shown a strict regard for his rights and seemed content to devote themselves to developing their terminus before trying to negotiate the canon they were wise in taking this course for their success would mean that oneils project would fall of its own weight kyak was nearer seattle by many miles than omar it was closer to the coal and copper fields and the proven permanence of their breakwater would render useless further attempts to finance the s r n but in the entrance of curtis gordon into the field oneil recognized danger gordon was swayed by no such business scruples as the heidlemanns he was evidently making a desperate effort to secure a footing at any cost in purchasing the mcdermott holdings he had executed a coup of considerable importance for he had placed himself on equal footing with the trust and in position to profit by its efforts at harborbuilding without expense to himself if therefore he succeeded in wresting from oneil the key to that upper passageway he would be able to block his personal enemy and to command the consideration of his more powerful rival no one not even the trust had taken the mcdermott enterprise seriously but with curtis gordon in control the wildcat suddenly became a tiger in view of all this it was with no easy mind that oneil despatched appleton to the front and it was with no small responsibility upon his shoulders that the young engineer set out in charge of those wooden boxes of dynamite murray had told him frankly what hung upon his success and dan had vowed to hold the survey at any cost steam was up and the locomotive was puffing restlessly when he returned from his farewell to eliza a moment later and the single flat car carrying his party and its dangerous freight was being whirled along the shores of omar lake on it rushed shrieking through the night out from the gloomy hills and upon the tangent that led across the delta ten minutes after it had rolled forth upon the trestle at the lower crossing the giant powder had been transferred to polingboats and the long pull against the current had begun oneil had picked a crew for dan men upon whom he could depend they were on double pay and as they had worked upon the north pass yukon appleton had no doubt of their loyalty the events of that trip were etched upon the engineers mind with extraordinary vividness for they surpassed in peril and excitement all his previous experiences the journey resembled nothing but the mad scramble of a gold stampede the stubborn boats with their cargoes which had to be so gently handled the everincreasing fury of the river the growing menace of those ghastly racing icebergs the tauthauled towinglines and the straining sweating men in the loops all made a picture hard to forget then too the uncertainty of the enterprise the crying need of haste the knowledge of those other men converging upon the same goal lent a gnawing suspense to every hour it was infinitely more terrible than that first expedition when he and tom slater and oneil had braved the unknown it was vastly more trying than any of the trips which had followed even with the winter hurricane streaming out of the north as from the mouth of a giant funnel dan had faced death in various forms upon this delta during the past year and a half he had seen his flesh harden to marble whiteness under the raging north wind his eyes and lungs had been drifted full of sand in summer storms which rivaled those of the sahara with transit on his back he had come face to face with the huge brown grizzly he had slept in mud he had made his bed on moss which ran water like a sponge he had taken danger and hardship as they came yet never had he punished himself as on this dash through his confusion of impressions his intense preoccupation with present dangers and future contingencies the thought of natalie floated now and then vaguely but comfortingly he had seen her for a moment before leaving barely long enough to explain the nature of his mission but her quick concern her unvoiced anxiety had been very pleasant and he could not believe that it was altogether due to her interest in the fortunes of oneil dan knew that mellens crew was camped at the upper crossing busied in drilling for the abutments and foundations of the bridge but he reasoned that they would scarcely suspect the object of gordons party and that in any case they were not organized or equipped to resist it moreover the strategic point was four miles above the bridge site and the surveying corps would hardly precipitate a clash particularly since there was ample room for them to select a crossingplace alongside it was after midnight of the second day when he and his weary boatmen stumbled into sight of the camp appleton halted his command and stole forward approaching the place through the tangled alders which flanked it he had anticipated that the rival party would be up to this point by now if not even farther advanced and he was both angered and relieved to sight the tops of other tents pitched a few hundred yards beyond mellens outfit so they were here he had arrived in time after all a feeling of exultation conquered the deathly fatigue that slowed his limbs although he still had to pass the invaders camp and establish himself at the canon the certainty that he had made good thus far was ample reward for his effort a dog broke into furious barking as he emerged from cover and he had a moments anxiety lest it serve as warning to the enemy but a few quick strides brought him to the tent of mellens foreman going in he roused the man who was sleeping soundly hello cried the foreman jumping up and rubbing his eyes i thought curtis gordon had taken possession hush dont wake them up dan cautioned oh theres no danger of disturbing them with this infernal cannonading going on all the time the night resounded to a rumbling crash as some huge mass of ice split off perhaps two miles away when did they arrive night before last theyve located right alongside of us gee we were surprised when they showed up they expect to break camp in the morning he yawned widely hmm theyre making tracks arent they were they friendly oh sure so were we there was nothing else to do was there we had no orders i have two dozen men and four boatloads of dynamite with me im going to hold that mountainside then youre going to fight all vestige of drowsiness had fled from the mans face not if we can help it who is in charge of this crew gordon himself gordon yes and hes got a tough gang with him armed sure this is a bear country you know listen i want you to tell him as innocently as you can that were on the job ahead of him tell him weve been there for a week and have loaded that first rock shoulder and expect to shoot it off as soon as possible you can tell him too that im up there and hed better see me before trying to pass through ive got you but that wont stop him perhaps now have you any grub in camp no we threw ours overboard to make time send up anything you can spare were played out itll be nothing but beans and theyre moldy we can fight on beans and well eat the paper off those giant cartridges if we have to dont fail to warn gordon that the hillside is mined and warn him loud enough for his swampers to hear appleton hastened back to his boats where he found his men sprawled among the boulders sleeping the sleep of complete exhaustion they were drenched half numbed by the chill air of the glacier and it was well that he roused them gordons men are camped just above he told them but we must get through without waking them no talking now until were safe silently the crew resumed their towlines fitting them to their aching shoulders gingerly the boats were edged out into the current it was fortunate that the place was noisy and that the voice of the river and the periodic bombardment from the glaciers drowned the rattle of loose stones dislodged by their footsteps but it was a trying halfhour that followed dan did not breathe easily until his party had crossed the bar and were safely out upon the placid waters of the lake with the last stage of the journey ahead of them about midforenoon of the following day curtis gordon halted his party at the lower end of the rapids and went on alone to his right lay the cataract and along the steep slope against which it chafed wound a faint footpath scarcely wide enough in places for a man to pass this trail dipped in and out wound back and forth around frowning promontories it dodged through alder thickets or spanned slides of loose rock until three miles above it emerged into the more open country back of the parent range it had been worn by the feet of wild animals and it followed closely the rightofway of the s r n to the left the hills rose swiftly in great leaps to the sky to the right so close that a false step meant disaster roared the cataract muddy and foamflecked as gordon neared the first bluff he heard above the clamor of the flood a faint metallic taptaptap as of hammer and drill and drawing closer he saw dan appleton perched upon a rock which commanded a view in both directions just around the shoulder in a tiny gulch or gutter from the slopes above were pitched several tents from one of which curled the smoke of a cookstove close at hand were moored four battered polingboats look out appleton shouted from on high gordon flushed angrily and kept on scanning the surroundings with practised eye hey you dan called for a second time keep back were going to shoot still heedless of the warning gordon held stubbornly to his stride he noted the heads of several men projecting from behind boulders and his anger rose how dared this whippersnapper shout at him he felt inclined to toss the insolent young scoundrel into the rapids then suddenly his resentment gave place to a totally different emotion the slanting bank midway between him and appleton lifted itself bodily in a chocolatecolored upheaval and the roar of a dynamite blast rolled out across the river it was but a feeble echo of the majestic reverberations from the glacier across the lake but it was impressive enough to send curtis gordon scurrying to a place of safety he wheeled in his tracks doubling himself over and his long legs began to thresh wildly reaching the shelter of a rock crevice he hurled himself into it while over his place of refuge descended a shower of dirt and rocks and debris when the rain of missiles had subsided he stepped forth his face white with fury his big hands twitching his voice was hoarse as he shouted his protest appleton scrambled carefully down from his perch in the warm sunshine and approached with insolent leisure say do you want to get your fool self killed he cried then in an altered tone oh is it you gordon you knew very well it was i gordon swallowed hard and partially controlled his wrath what do you mean by such carelessness he demanded you ought to be hung for a thing like that he brushed the dirt from his expensive huntingsuit i yelled my head off you must be deaf you saw me coming dont say you didnt fortunately i wasnt hurt in a tone of command he added youll have to stop blasting until i go through with my party sorry every day counts with us appleton grinned you know how it is short season and ail that come come dont be an idiot i have no time to waste then youll have to go around said dan this isnt a public road you know gordon had come to argue to pacify to gain his ends by lying if necessary but this impudent jackanapes infuriated him his plans had gone smoothly so far and the unexpected threat of resistance momentarily provoked him beyond restraint you scoundrel he cried youd have blown me into the river if you could but ill go through this canon go as far and as fast as you like dan interrupted with equal heat only take your own chances and have a net spread at the lower end of the rapids to catch the remains they eyed each other angrily then gordon said more quietly this is ridiculous you cant stop me maybe i cant and maybe i can im under orders to rush this work and i dont intend to knock off to please you ive planted shots at various places along our rightofway and ill set em off when it suits me if youre so anxious to go upriver why dont you cross over to the moraine theres a much better trail on that side youll find better walking a few miles farther up and youll run no danger of being hurt i intend to run a survey along this hillside there isnt room we beat you to it the law provides law jove id forgotten there is such a thing why dont you go to law and settle the question that way well have our track laid by the time you get action and im sure mr oneil wouldnt place any obstacles in the way of your free passage back and forth hes awfully obliging about such things gordon ground his fine white even teeth dont you understand that im entitled to a rightofway through here under the law of common user he asked with what patience he could command if youre trying to get a legal opinion on the matter why dont you see a lawyer im not a lawyer neither am i a public speaker nor a pianotuner nor anything like that im an engineer dont get funny i cant send my men in here if you continue blasting so it seems to me but you appear to be hell bent on trying it dan was enjoying himself and he deliberately added to the others anger by inquiring as if in the blinding light of a new idea why dont you bridge over and go up the other side he pointed to the forbidding broken country which faced them across the rapids gordon snorted how long do you intend to maintain this preposterous attitude he asked as long as the powder lasts and theres a good deal of it the promoter chewed his lip for a moment in perplexity then said with a geniality he was far from feeling appleton youre all right i admire your loyalty even though it happens to be for a mistaken cause i always liked you i admire loyalty its something i need in my business what i need i pay for and i pay well so your man linn told us i never really discharged you in fact i intended to reemploy you for i need you badly you can name your own salary and go to work any time in other words you mean youll pay me well to let you through fix your own price and ill double it will you come with me up this trail a little way dan inquired certainly theres a spot where id like to have you stand ill save you the trouble of walking back to your men youll beat the echo there was a pause while gordon digested this better think it over he said at length ill never let oneil build his road not if it breaks me and youre merely laying yourself open to arrest by threatening me please come with me urged appleton youll never know what hit you with a curse the promoter wheeled and walked swiftly down the trail by which he had come get ready to shoot dan ordered when he had returned to his vantagepoint a few moments later he saw the invading party approach but he withheld his warning shout until it was close at hand evidently gordon did not believe he would have the reckless courage to carry out his threat and had determined to put him to the test the engineer gauged his distance nicely and when the newcomers had fairly passed within the danger zone he gave the signal to fire a blast heavier than the one which had discouraged gordons advance followed his command and down upon the newcomers rained a deluge which sent them scurrying to cover fortunately no one was injured an hour later the invaders had pitched camp a mile below and after placing a trusted man on guard appleton sent his weary men to bed it was curtis gordon himself who brought oneil the first tidings of this encounter for seeing the uselessness of an immediate attempt to overcome dans party by force he determined to make formal protest he secured a boat and a few hours later the swift current swept him down to the lower crossing where mckay put a locomotive at his disposal for the trip to omar by the time he arrived there he was quite himself again suave selfpossessed and magnificently outraged at the treatment he had received oneil met him with courtesy your man appleton has lost his head gordon began ive come to ask you to call him off he is following instructions to the letter do you mean that you refuse to allow me to run my rightofway along that hillside impossible his voice betokened shocked surprise i am merely holding my own survey i cant quit work to accommodate you but my dear sir i must insist that you do oneil shrugged then there is but one way to construe your refusal it means that you declare war you saved me that necessity when you sent linn to hire my men away gordon ignored this reference you must realize oneil said he that i am merely asking what is mine i have the right to use that canonside the right to use your track at that point in fact if it proves impracticable to parallel it under the law of common user you are an experienced contractor you must be familiar with that law yes i looked it up before beginning operations and i found it has never been applied to alaska gordon started thats a ridiculous statement perhaps but its true alaska is not a territory its a district and it has its own code until the law of common user has been applied here youll have to use the other side of the river that would force me to bridge twice in passing the upper glacier we shall see what the courts have to say thanks i shall be grateful for the delay gordon rose with a bow the interview had been short and to the point oneil put an engine at his service for the return trip and after a stiff adieu the visitor departed inwardly raging it was his first visit to omar and now that he was here he determined to see it all but first another matter demanded his attention a matter much in his mind of late concerning which he had reached a more or less satisfactory decision during his journey he went directly to the new hotel and inquired for gloria gerard beneath the widows coldness when she came to meet him he detected an uncertainty a frightened indecision which assured him of success and he set himself to his task with the zest he always felt in bending another to his will it has been the greatest regret of my life that we quarreled he told her when their strained greeting was over i felt that i had to come and see with my own eyes that you are well i am quite well two people who have been to each other as much as we have been cannot lightly separate their lives cannot be divided without a painful readjustment he paused then reflecting that he could afford a little sentimental extravagance added flowers cannot easily be transplanted and love after all is the frailest of blooms i think it is perennial have you missed me her dark eyes were strained and curious my dear you can never know how much nor how deeply distressing this whole affair has been to me he managed to put an affecting pathos into words sufficiently banal for he was an excellent actor i find that i am all sentiment under the shell of the hardheaded business man beats the heart of a schoolboy the memory of the hours we have spent together the places we have seen the joys and discouragements we have shared haunts me constantly memory can glean but never renew joys recollection is no longer joy while sorrows memory is sorrow still the spell of his personality worked strongly upon her recollection is the only paradise from which we cannot be turned out she said you read that to me once but i didnt dream that my own happiness would some day consist of recollection why should it gloria hope is ready to welcome you your home stands open my arms are outstretched no she exclaimed with a shake of her dark head there is some one besides myself to consider natalie is happy here no one seems to know or to care what i have done but surely you are not satisfied with this he ran his eye critically over the garish newness of the little hotel parlor it was flimsy cheap fresh with paint very different from the surroundings he had given her at hope i wonder that he presumed to offer you this after what you have had a hotelkeeper a landlady i was glad to get even this for i have no pride now she returned coldly at least the house is honest and the men who come here are the same mr oneil is especially kind to natalie and she thinks a great deal of him i presume he wants to marry her i pray that he will i dont intend her to make the mistake i did gordon received this announcement with grim satisfaction it was what he had suspected and it fitted perfectly into his plans i shant allow this to continue gloria he said our difference has gone far enough and i shant permit oneil to put me in his debt we have come to a final understanding he and i while my views on the holiness of the marriage relation have not changed in the least still i am ready to follow your wishes you mean it she queried breathlessly i do come home gloria wait i must tell natalie she rose unsteadily and left the room while he reflected with mingled scorn and amusement upon the weakness of human nature and the gullibility of women a moment later mother and daughter appeared arm in arm both very pale is this true natalie demanded quite true you and gloria seem to think i owe something i never shirk a debt mrs gerards fingers tightened painfully upon her daughters arm as he continued there is only one condition upon which i insist you must both return to hope at once and have done with this this man natalie hesitated but the look in her mothers eyes decided her with some difficulty she forced herself to acquiesce and felt the grip upon her arm suddenly relax when will the wedding take place she asked at the earliest possible moment gordon declared with wellfeigned seriousness once we return to gods country no cried natalie we cant go back to hope until she is married it would be scandalous why more scandalous to accept my protection than that of a stranger do you care what these people think he demanded with an air of fine scorn yes i care very much is there any reason for waiting mrs gerard inquired many too many to enumerate it is my condition that you both leave omar at once gloria gerard looked at her daughter in troubled indecision but natalie answered firmly we cant do that so you have your own plans no doubt and it doesnt trouble you that you are standing in the way of your mothers respectability his voice was harsh his sneer open bless my soul is the generosity to be all on my side or has this man oneil forbidden you to associate with me i dont trust you natalie flared up im afraid you are trying it is my condition and i am adamant believe me oneil knows of your disgrace or will learn of it in time it would be well to protect your name while you can turning to the other woman he said loudly gloria the girl is ready to sacrifice you to her own ends wait natalies nerves were tingling with dislike of the man but she said steadily i shall do exactly as mother wishes be it said to the credit of gloria gerard that she did not hesitate i shall be here when you are ready she told him with an exclamation of rage gordon rose and strode out of the room xiii we journey to a place of many wonders curtis gordons men broke camp upon his return from omar and by taking the east bank of the salmon river pressed through to the upper valley here they recrossed to the west side and completed their survey with the exception of the threemile gap which dan appleton held gordon continued to smart under the sting of his defeat however oneil had gotten the better of him in argument and natalies simplicity had proved more than a match for his powers of persuasion at no time had he seriously considered making mrs gerard his wife but he had thought to entice the two women back under his own roof in order to humble both them and their selfappointed protector he felt sure that natalies return to hope and her residence there would injure her seriously in the eyes of the community and this would be a stab to oneil although he had failed for the moment he did not abandon the idea his display of anger upon leaving the hotel had been due mainly to disappointment at the checkmate but knowing well the hold he possessed upon the older woman he laid it away for later use when the fight grew hot and meanwhile devoted himself to devising further measures by which to harass his enemy and incidentally advance his own fortunes gordons business career had consisted of a series of brilliant manipulations whereby with little to go upon he had forced financial recognition for himself no one knew better than he the unstable foundation beneath his alaskan enterprises yet more than once he had turned as desperate ventures into the semblance of success by his present operations he sought not only to hamper oneil but to create an appearance of opposition to both him and the trust that could be coined into dollars and cents there are in the commercial world money wolves who prey upon the weak and depend upon the spirit of compromise in their adversaries gordon was one of these he had the faculty of snatching at least half a victory from apparent defeat and for this reason he had been able to show a record sufficiently impressive to convince the average investor of his ability by purchasing for a song the mcdermott rights at kyak he had placed himself in position to share in the benefits of the heidlemann breakwater and by rapidly pushing his tracks ahead he made his rivalry seem formidable as a means of attack upon oneil he adopted a procedure common in railroadbuilding he amended his original survey so that it crossed that of the s r n midway between the lower bridge over the salmon river and the glaciers and at that point began the hasty erection of a grade it was at the cost of no little inconvenience that he rushed forward a large body of men and supplies and began to lay track across the s r n rightofway if appleton could hold a hillside he reasoned he himself could hold a crossing if not permanently at least for a sufficient length of time to serve his purpose his action came as a disagreeable surprise to omar these battles for crossings have been common in the history of railroading and they have not infrequently resulted in sanguinary affrays long after the ties are spiked and the heads are healed the legal rights involved have been determined but usually amid such a tangle of conflicting testimony and such a confusion of technicalities as to leave the justice of the final decision in doubt in the unsettled conditions that prevailed in the salmon river valley physical possession of a rightofway was at least ninetenths of the law and oneil realized that he must choose between violence and a compromise not being given to compromise he continued his construction work and drew closer day by day to the point of contact reports came from the front of his opponents preparations for resistance gordon had laid several hundred yards of light rails upon his grade and on these he had mounted a device in the nature of a godevil or skip which he shunted back and forth by means of a donkeyengine and steel cable with this in operation across the point of intersection like a shuttle interference would be extremely dangerous in addition he had built blockhouses and breastworks of ties and in these it was reported he had stationed the pick of his hired helpers armed and well provisioned toward this stronghold murray oneils men worked laying his roadbed as straight as an arrow and as the intervening distance decreased anxiety and speculation at omar increased among those who hung upon the rumors of the approaching clash with greatest interest was eliza appleton since dans departure for the front she had done her modest best to act the part he had forced upon her and in furtherance of their conspiracy she had urged oneil to fulfil his promise of taking her over the work she felt an evergrowing curiosity to see those glaciers about which she had heard so much and she reflected though not without a degree of selfcontempt that nothing could be more favorable to her design than the intimacy of several days together on the trail nothing breeds a closer relationship than the open life nothing brings people more quickly into accord or hopeless disagreement although she had no faintest idea that murray could or would ever care seriously for her she felt that there was a bare possibility of winning his transient interest and in that way perhaps affording her brother time in which to attain his hearts desire of course it was all utterly absurd yet it was serious enough to dan and her own feelings well they didnt matter she was greatly excited when oneil announced one evening im ready to make that trip to the front if you are i have business at kyak so after weve seen the glaciers we will go down there and you can take in the coalfields how long shall we be gone ten days perhaps well start in the morning im ready to leave at a moments notice then perhaps youd better help natalie natalie exclaimed eliza seeing all her welllaid plans tottering is she going oh yes its an opportunity she shouldnt miss and i thought it would be pleasanter for you if she went with us eliza was forced to acknowledge his thoughtfulness although it angered her to be sacrificed to the proprieties her newspaper training had made her feel superior to such things and this of all occasions was one upon which she would have liked to be free of mere conventions but of course she professed the greatest delight oneil had puzzled her greatly of late for at times he seemed wrapped up in natalie and at other times he actually showed a preference for elizas own company he was so impartial in his attentions that at one moment the girl would waver in her determination and in the next would believe herself succeeding beyond her hope the game confused her emotions curiously she accused herself of being overbold and then she noted with horror that she was growing as sensitive to his apparent coldness as if she were really in earnest she had not supposed that the mere acting of a sentimental role could so obsess her to counteract this tendency she assumed a very professional air when they set out on the following morning she was once more eliza appleton the reporter and oneil in recognition of this fact explained rapidly the difficulties of construction which he had met and overcome as she began to understand there came to her a fuller appreciation of the man and the work he was doing natalie however could not seem to grasp the significance of the enterprise she saw nothing beyond the even gravel roadbed the uninteresting trestles and bridges and cuts and fills the like of which she had seen many times before and her comment was childlike oneil however appeared to find her naivete charming and eliza reflected bitterly if my nose was perfectly chiseled and my eyebrows nice he wouldnt care if my brain was the size of a rabbits here am i talking like a human being and really understanding him while she sits like a greek goddess wondering if her hat is on straight if ever i find a girl uglier than i am ill make her my bosom friend she jabbed her pencil viciously at her notebook the track by this time had been extended considerably beyond the lower crossing a circumstance which rendered their boat journey to the glaciers considerably shorter than the one dan had taken with his cargo of dynamite when the engine finally stopped it was in the midst of a tent village beside which flowed one of the smaller branches of the salmon in the distance the grade stretched out across the level swamps like a thin lately healed scar and along its crest graveltrains were slowly creeping an army of men like a row of ants were toiling upon it and still farther away shone the white sides of another encampment oh thats gordons track eliza cried quickly why youre nearly up to him how do you intend to get across oneil nodded at the long thin line of moiling men in the distance theres a loose handle in each one of those picks he said somebody will be killed in that kind of a racket that rests with gordon im going through suppose he had said that when dan stopped him at the canon if hed said it and meant it hed probably have done it he bluffs i dont i have to go on he didnt now lunch is served and since this is our last glimpse of civilization i advise you to fortify yourselves from here on we shall see nothing but the wilderness he led them to a spotless tent which had been newly erected at the edge of the spruce it was smoothly stretched upon a framework of timber its walls and floor were of dressed lumber and within were two cots all in clean linen there were twin washstands also and dressers and rockingchairs a table and a stove on the floor beside the beds lay a number of deep soft bearrugs a meal was spread amid glass and figured china and fresh new napery how cozy why its a perfect dear of a house exclaimed natalie you will leave everything but your necessaries here for we are going light murray told them you will stop here on our way back to kyak and ill warrant youll be glad to see the place by that time you built this just for us eliza said accusingly yes but it didnt take long i phoned this morning that you were coming he ran a critical eye over the place to see that its equipment was complete then drew out their chairs for them a whitecoated cookboy served a luncheon in courses the quality of which astonished the visitors for there was soup a roast delicious vegetables crisp salad a camembert which oneil had imported for his private use and his own particular blend of coffee the girls ate with appetites that rivaled those of the men in the messtent near by their presence in the heart of a great activity the anticipation of adventure to come the electric atmosphere of haste and straining effort on every hand excited them eliza began to be less conscious of her secret intention and natalie showed a gaiety rare in her since the shadow of her mothers shame had fallen upon her life the boat crews were waiting when they had finished and they were soon under way a mile of comparatively slack water brought them out into one of the larger estuaries of the river and there the long uphill pull began oneil had equipped his two companions with high rubber boots which they were only too eager to try as soon as they got ashore they began to romp and play and splash through the shallows quite like unruly children they spattered him mischievously they tugged at the towingropes with a great show of assistance they scampered ahead of the party keeping him in a constant panic lest they meet with serious accident it was with no little relief that he gave the order to pitch camp some hours later after sending them off to pick wild currants with a grave warning to beware of bears he saw to the preparations for the night they returned shortly with their hats filled and their lips stained then much to his disgust they insisted upon straightening out his tent with their own hands once inside its low shelter they gleefully sifted sand between his blankets and replaced his pillow with a rock then they induced the cook to coil a wet string in his flapjack when supper was over and the campfires of driftwood were crackling merrily they fixed themselves comfortably where their feet would toast and made him tell them stories until his eyes drooped with weariness it was late summer and oneil had expected to find the glaciers less active than usual but heavy rains in the interior and hot thawing weather along the coast had swelled the salmon until many bergs clogged it while the reverberations which rolled down the valley told him that both garfield and jackson were caving badly it was not the safest time at which to approach the place he reflected but the girls had shown themselves nimble of foot and he put aside his uneasiness short though the miles had been and easy as the trip had proved eliza soon found herself wondering that it should be possible to penetrate this region at all the snarling river the charging icebergs the caving banks and the growing menace of that noisy gap ahead began to have their effect upon her and natalie and when the party finally rounded the point where murray and dan had caught their first glimpse of the lower glacier they paused with exclamations of amazement they stood at the upper end of a gorge between low bluffs and just across the hurrying flood lay the lower limit of the giant icefield the edge perhaps six hundred feet distant was sloping and mudstained for in its slow advance it had plowed a huge furrow lifting boulders trees acres of soil upon its back the very bluff through which the river had cut its bed was formed of the debris it had thrown off and constituted a bulwark protecting its flank farther upstream the slope became steeper then changed to a rugged perpendicular face showing marks of recent cleavage this palisade extended on and on around the nearest bend following the contour of the salmon as far as they could see the sun was reflected from its myriad angles and facets in splendid iridescence mammoth caves and caverns gaped in spots the ice was white opaque in other places it was a light cerulean blue which shaded into purple ribbons and faint striations meandered through it like the streaks in an agate but what struck the beholders with overwhelming force was the tremendous the unbelievable bulk of the whole slowly moving mass it reared itself sheerly three hundred feet high and along its foot the river hurried dwarfed to an insignificant trickle here and there it leaned outward threateningly bulging from the terrific weight behind at other points the muddy flood recoiled from vast heaps which had slid downward and half dammed its current back of these piles the fresh cleavage showed dazzlingly on upward back into the untracked mountains it ran through mile upon mile of undulations until at last it joined the icecap which weighted the plateau as far as the eye could follow the river ahead it stood solidly across its entire face it was dripping a thousand little rills and waterfalls ate into it and over it swept a cool dank breath the effect of the first view was overwhelming nothing upon the earth compares in majesty and menace to these dulleyed monsters of bygone ages nothing save the roots of mountains can serve to check them nothing less than the ceaseless energy of mighty rivers can sweep away their shattered fragments murray oneil had seen jackson glacier many times but always he experienced the same feeling of awe of personal insignificance as when he first came stumbling up that gorge more than a year before for a long time the girls stood gazing without a word they seemed to have forgotten his presence well he said at last isnt it big natalie faltered with round eyes will it fall over on us he shook his head the river is too wide for that but when a particularly big mass drops it makes waves large enough to sweep everything before them this bank on our right is sixty feet high but ive seen it inundated turning to eliza he inquired what do you think of it her face as she met his was strangely glorified her eyes were shining her fingers tightly interlocked i id like to cry or or swear she said uncertainly why eliza natalie regarded her friend in shocked amazement but murray laughed it affects people differently he said i have men who refuse to make this trip theres something about jackson that frightens them perhaps it is its nearness you see theres no other place on the globe where we pygmies dare come so close to a live glacier of this size how can we go on natalie asked we must work our boats along this bank if the ice begins to crack anywhere near us i want you both to scamper up into the alders as fast as your rubber boots will carry you what will you do eliza eyed him curiously oh ill follow never fear if its not too bad ill stay with the boats of course but were not likely to have much difficulty at this season eliza noted the intensity with which the boatmen were scanning the passage ahead and something in oneils tone told her he was speaking with an assurance he did not wholly feel you have lost some men here havent you she asked yes but the greater danger is in coming down then we have to get out in the current and take our chances id like to do that her lips were parted her eyes were glowing but natalie gave a little cry of dismay its an utterly new sensation oneil admitted ive been thinking of sending you up across the moraine but the trail is bad and you might get lost among the alders and miss any part of this i wouldnt do it for worlds elizas enthusiasm was irresistible and the expedition was soon under way again progress was more difficult now for the rivershore was paved with smooth round stones which rolled under foot and the boats required extreme attention in the swift current the farther they proceeded the more the ice wall opposite increased in height until at last it shut off the mountains behind then as they rounded the first bend a new prospect unfolded itself the size of jackson became even more apparent the gravel bank under which they crept was steeper and higher also in places it was undercut by the action of the waves which periodically surged across at such points murray sent his charges hurrying on ahead while he and his men tracked the boats after them in time they found themselves opposite the backbone of the glacier where the salmon gnawed at the foot of a frozen cliff of prodigious height and now although there had been no cause for apprehension beyond an occasional rumble far back or a splitting crack from near at hand the men assumed an attitude of strained watchfulness and kept their faces turned to the left they walked quietly as if they felt themselves in some appalling presence at last there came a sound like that of a cannonshot and far ahead of them a fragment loosened itself and went plunging downward although it appeared small a ridge promptly leaped out from beneath the splash and came racing down the rivers bosom toward them better go up a bit oneil called to his charges the men at the ends of the towlines scrambled part way up the shelving beach and braced themselves then wrapped the ropes about their waists like anchormen on a tugofwar team their companions waded into the flood and fended the boats off the rocks the wave came swiftly lifting the skiffs high upon the bank then it sucked them back amid a tangle of arms and legs a portion of the riverbottom suddenly bared itself and as suddenly was submerged again the boats plunged and rolled and beat themselves upon the shore wrenching the anchormen from their posts they were half filled with water too but the wave had passed and was scudding away downstream eliza appleton came stumbling back over the rockstrewn bank for during that first mad plunge she had seen oneil go down beneath one of the rearing craft a man was helping him out nothing but my ankle he reassured her when she reached his side i was dragged a bit and jammed among the boulders he sank down and his lips were white with pain but his gray eyes smiled bravely the boatman removed his chiefs boot and fell to rubbing the injury while the girls looked on helplessly come come we cant stay here murray told them he drew on the boot again to check the swelling can you walk they asked him anxiously certainly two feet are really unnecessary a man can get along nearly as well on one he hurried his men back to their tasks and managed to limp after them although the effort brought beads of sweat to his lips and brow it was well that he insisted upon haste for they had not gone far when the glacier broke abreast of the spot they had just left there came a rending crack terrifying in its loudness a tremendous tower of ice separated itself from the main body leaned slowly outward then roared downward falling in a solid piece like a skyscraper undermined not until the arc described by its summit had reached the rivers surface did it shiver itself then there was a burst as of an exploded mine the saffron waters of the salmon shot upward until they topped the main rampart and there separated into a cloud of spray which rained down in a deluge out from the fallen mass rushed a billow which gushed across the channel thrashed against the high bank then inundated it until the alder thickets on its crest whipped their tips madly a giant charge of fragments of every size flew far out across the flats or lashed the waters to further anger in its fall the prostrate column lay like a wingdam half across the stream and over it the salmon piled itself disintegration followed bergs heaved themselves into sight and went rolling and lunging after the billow which was rushing downstream with the speed of a locomotive they ground and clashed together in furious confusion as the river spun them the greater ones upended themselves casting off muddy cascades from the depths of the flood came a grinding and crunching as ice met rock spellbound the girls watched that first wave go tearing out of sight filling the river bankfull with exclamations of wonder they saw the imprisoned waters break the huge dam to pieces finally the last shattered fragment was hurried out of sight the flood poured past unhampered and overhead the glacier towered silent unchanged staring at them balefully like a blind man with filmed eyes there remained nothing but a gleaming scar to show where the cataclysm had originated if id known the river was so high id never have brought you oneil told them its fortunate we happened to be above that break you see the waves cant run up against the current he turned to his men and spurred them on it was not until the travelers had reached the camp at the bridge site that all the wonders of this region became apparent then the two girls in spite of their fatigue spent the late afternoon sightseeing at this point they were able to gain a comprehensive view for at their backs lay jackson glacier which they had just passed and directly fronting them across a placid lake was garfield even larger and more impressive than its mate thirty forty miles it ran back broadening into a frozen sea out of which scarred mountain peaks rose like bleak islands and on beyond the range of vision was still more ice they were surrounded by ragged ramparts the salmon river ran through a broken chalice formed by the encircling hills and over the rim of the bowl or through its cracks peered other and smaller ice bodies the lake at its bottom was filled by as strange a navy as ever sailed the sea for the ships were bergs and they followed each other in senseless ceaseless manoeuvers towed by the currents which swept through from the cataract at its upper end they formed long battlelines they assembled into flotillas they filed about the circumference of a devils whirlpool at the foot of the rapids gyrating bobbing bowing until crowded out by the pressure of their rivals some of them were grounded like hulks defeated in previous encounters and along the guardian bar which imprisoned them at the outlet of the lake others were huddled a mass of slowly dissolving wreckage oneil was helped into camp and when his boot had been cut away he sent news of his arrival to dan who came like an eager bridegroom xiv how the truth came to eliza appleton found his employer with one foot in a tub of hot water and his lap full of blueprints oneil explained briefly the condition of affairs down the river i want some one to make that crossing he said a volunteer asked dan with quickened pulses yes will i do i sent for you to give you the first chance youve been chafing so at your idleness we must have steel laid to this point before snow flies every hour counts i darent risk mellen or mckay for they might be disabled i intended to take charge myself but i wont be able to walk now for some time he swore a little and dan nodded sympathetically i wouldnt send anybody where id refuse to go myself you understand of course if either mckay or mellen were hurt i couldnt build the bridge and the bridge must be built if gordon stands pat somebody may be hurt i dont look for anything worse than a few broken heads but of course i cant tell ill stand behind you with my last dollar no matter what happens dan laughed as i understand the situation you wont have a dollar unless we make the crossing right oneil smiled cheerfully the life of the s r n depends upon it id give ten thousand dollars for your right ankle you can have it for nothing chief id amputate the whole leg and present it to you dan declared earnestly murray took his hand in a hearty grip perhaps ill be able to serve you some time he said simply anyhow ill look out for the chance now spend the evening with the girls and leave in the morning ill be down as soon as i can travel to watch the fight from the sidelines oneils voice was level but his teeth were shut and his fingers were clenched with rage at his disability dan hurried away highly elated but when he told eliza of the part he had undertaken she stormed indignantly why the brute he has no right to send you into danger this isnt war sis dear its my chance he cant stand and he darent risk his righthand men so he sacrifices you i wont permit it your life and safety are worth more than all his dollars let his old railroad go to smash wait more than my safety depends on this he said hed wait for a chance to pay me back if i do this hell owe me more than any man on the job and when he learns that i love natalie dan exclaimed his sister oh hell make good why youre worse than he the idea of suggesting such a thing dont preach ive had nothing to do lately but think of her shes always in my mind the loneliness up here has made me feel more than ever that i cant exist without her the river whispers her name her face looks at me from the campfire the wind brings me her messages fiddlesticks she saves her messages for him when a man reaches the poetical stage hes positively sickening youll be writing verses next ive written em dan confessed sheepishly oceans of mush fancy thank heaven one of us is sane our dispositions were mixed when we were born eliza youre unsentimental and hardheaded im romantic youll never know what love means if you are a sample i hope not elizas nose assumed an even higher tilt than usual well if i knew i had no chance with natalie id let gordons men put an end to me thats how serious it is but i have a chance i know i have bosh youve lived in railroad camps too long i know a dozen girls prettier than she eying him with more concern she asked seriously you wouldnt really take advantage of a service to murray oneil to to tell him the nature of your insanity i might not actually tell him but id manage it so hed find out dont you think natalie has something to say dont you think she is more than a piece of baggage waiting to be claimed by the first man who comes along sputtered miss appleton in fine disgust at this attitude she has more sense and determination than any girl any pretty girl i ever saw thats one reason why i hate her so theres no use trying to select a husband for her when the time comes shell do the selecting herself shell knock over all our plans and walk blushingly up to the altar with oneil leaving us out on the sidewalk to cheer im sorry i ever tried to help you im going to quit and get back my selfrespect youll do no such thing youll continue to help your poor redheaded brother to the finish say when im alone im just bursting with optimism when im with you i wither with despair when im with natalie i become as heavy and stupid as a frog full of buckshot i just sit and blink and bask and revel in a sort of speechless bliss if she ever saw how really bright and engaging i am you eliza sniffed youre as uninteresting as i am now that youve pledged your undying support here goes for some basking said dan and he made off hastily in search of miss gerard eliza had really made up her mind to wash her hands of the affair but she wavered and as usual she gave in she did go to oneil to protest at dans selection for the post of danger but after talking with him she began to see the matter in a new light and her opposition weakened he showed her that the s r n had an individuality of its own an individuality greater than murray oneils or dan appletons or that of any man connected with it she began to understand that it was a living thing and that oneil was merely a small part of it a person driven by a power outside himself the head servant of a great undertaking upon whom rested a heavy responsibility she saw for the first time that the millions invested in the project imposed upon those concerned with its management a sacred duty and that failure to defend the companys rights would be the worst sort of treachery she began to appreciate also how men may be willing to lay down their lives if necessary to pave the way for the march of commerce i never looked at it in this way she told him when he had finished i dont like to take that view of it even now but i suppose i must try not to worry about dan he said sympathetically well start back as soon as im able to move around and ill do my best to see that he isnt hurt its tough to be laid up this way theres another sick man in camp by the way who the indian boy who helps the cook he was hunting and shot himself in the arm they told me he was doing well oh he is but the pain has kept the poor fellow awake until hes nearly out of his head there are no drugs here none this side of the end of the track cant we do something we can give dan a note to happy tom in the morning and have whatever you want sent up tom will be there and perhaps if you ask him hell despatch a man on foot at once seizing pen and paper from the table eliza wrote a note which she read aloud dear uncle tom there is a sick indian here wont you please send up an opiate by special messenger and receive the blessing of your affectionate eliza better change the word opiate oneil advised i dont think tom is equal to that he might send overalls so eliza substituted something to put him to sleep this message dan promised faithfully to deliver murray had expected to begin the return journey within twentyfour hours after his arrival but his injury mended slowly and when the time came he was still unable to stand this interval the girls spent in watching the glaciers of which they never seemed to tire and in spoiling many films it was late on the second day when a tired and sodden messenger bearing the marks of heavy travel appeared at oneils tent and inquired for miss appleton to her he handed a threefoot bundle and a note from tom slater which read dear madam here is the best thing i know of to put an indian to sleep thos slater theres some mistake surely said the girl as she unrolled the oddlooking package then she cried out angrily and oneil burst into laughter for inside the many wrappings was a pickhandle elizas resentment at happy toms unsympathetic sense of humor was tempered in a measure by the fact that the patient had taken a turn for the better and really needed no further medical attention but she was not accustomed to practical jokes and she vowed to make toms life miserable if ever the occasion offered as the days wore on and murray remained helpless his impatience became acute and on the fourth morning he determined to leave at whatever cost in pain or danger to the injury he gave orders therefore to have a boat prepared and allowed himself to be carried to it the foreman of the bridge crew he delegated to guide the girls down across the moraine where he promised to pick them up the men who had come with him he sent on to the cataract where dan had been arent you coming with us asked natalie when they found him seated in the skiff with an oarsman its rough going id have to be carried so i prefer this he told them then well go with you eliza promptly declared natalie paled and shook her dark head is it safe she ventured no it isnt run along now ill be down there waiting when you arrive if its safe enough for you its safe enough for us said eliza climbing into the boat she plumped herself down with a look which seemed to defy any power to remove her her blue eyes met oneils gray ones with an expression he had never seen in them until this moment nonsense child he said dont be silly dont you try to put me out ill hang on and kick dont you say please either she warned him i must he protested please dont insist she scowled like an angry boy and seized the gunwales firmly her expression made him smile despite his annoyance and this provoked her the more im going she asserted darkly this outing had done wonders for both girls the wind and the sunshine had tanned them the coarse fare had lent them a hearty vigor and they made charming pictures in their trim short skirts and sweaters and leatherbanded hats very well if youre going take off your boots commanded oneil what for we may be swamped and have to swim for it you see the man has taken his off murray pointed to the rawboned norwegian oarsman who had stripped down as if for a footrace eliza obeyed now your sweater natalie had watched this scene with evident concern she now seated herself upon a boulder and began to tug at her rubber boots here here youre not going too oneil exclaimed yes i am im frightened to death but i wont be a coward her shaking hands and strained voice left no doubt of her seriousness she cant swim said eliza and oneil put an end to this display of heroism with a firm refusal youll think im afraid natalie expostulated bless you of course we will because you are so am i and so is eliza for that matter if you cant swim youd only be taking a foolish risk and adding to our danger besides eliza doesnt know the feel of cold water as we do natalie smiled a little tremulously at recollection of the shipwreck id much rather walk of course she said and then to eliza it it will be a lovely ramble for us but eliza shook her head this is material for my book and ill make enough out of it to to buy another orchard murray suggested feeling more resigned now that the adventure had taken on a purely financial color natalie at length allowed herself to be dissuaded and eliza settled herself in her seat with the disturbing consciousness that she had made herself appear selfish and rude in oneils eyes nevertheless she had no notion of changing her mind when the other girl had gone the oarsman completed his preparations by lashing fast the contents of the skiff a proceeding which eliza watched with some uneasiness oneil showed his resentment by a pointed silence which nettled her and she resolved to hold her seat though the boat turned somersaults word was finally given and they swung out into the flood oneil stood as best he could on his firm leg and steered by means of a scullingoar while the norwegian rowed lustily bits of drift patches of froth fragments of ice accompanied them bobbing alongside so persistently that eliza fancied the boat must be stationary until glancing at the riverbanks she saw them racing past like the panoramic scenery in a melodrama the same glance showed her that they were rushing directly toward the upper ramparts of jackson glacier as if for an assault out here in the current there were waves and these increased in size as the bed of the salmon grew steeper until the polingboat began to rear and leap like a frightened horse the gleaming wall ahead rose higher with every instant it overhung a giant crumbling cliff imposing treacherous then the stream turned at right angles they were swept along parallel with the ice face and ahead of them for three miles stretched the gauntlet the tottering wall seemed almost within reaching distance its breath was cold and damp and clammy oneil stood erect and powerful in the stern swaying to the antics of the craft his weight upon the sweep his eyes fixed upon the thing overhead the norwegian strained at his oars while the sweat ran down into his open shirt the boat lunged and wallowed desperately rising on end falling with prodigious slaps drenching the occupants with spray it was splendid terrifying eliza clung to her seat and felt her heartbeats smothering her occasionally the oarsman turned staring past her with round frightened eyes and affording her a glimpse of a face working with mingled fear and exultation thus far the glacier had not disputed their passage it maintained the silence and the immobility of marble nothing but the snarl of the surging flood reechoed from its face but with the suddenness of a rifleshot there came a detonation louder sharper than any blast of powder the norwegian cursed the helmsman dropped his eyes to the white face in the bow and smiled half a mile ahead of them a mass of ice came rumbling down and the whole valley rocked with the sound onward the little craft fled a dancing speck beneath the majesty of that frozen giant an atom threatened by the weight of mountains at last through the opening of the gorge below came a glimpse of the flats that led to the sea a moment later the boat swung into an eddy and came to rest bumping against the boulders oneil sat down wiping his wet face well was it worth your trouble miss kickover thetraces he asked oh it was glorious ill never forget it elizas cheeks were burning now her aching hands relaxed their hold and she drew a deep breath the first of which she had been conscious since the start fifteen minutes before now on with your boots and your sweater well have an hours wait for natalie she gave a cry of surprise and offered him a glimpse of a trim ankle and a dripping foot see theyre wet and i wriggled my toes right through my stockings i never was so excited the boatman fastened the painter and resumed his outer clothing oneil lit a cigar and asked tell me why did you insist on coming i was afraid something might happen to you he raised his brows and she flushed dont you understand dan would never have forgiven me and and i just had to come thats all its corking material for me i thought you might upset and i i dont know why i insisted she bent over her stubborn boots hiding her face she was flaming to the ears for suddenly she knew the reason that had prompted her it rushed upon her like a sense of great shame she recalled the desperate grip at her heart when she had seen him ready to leave the wildness of her longing to share his danger the black fear that he might meet disaster alone it had all come without warning and there had been no time for selfconsciousness but now she realized the truth the poignant pain of it made her fingers clumsy and sent that flood of scarlet to her neck and ears when natalie arrived they cast off and the remaining miles were made in a few hours appleton joined them for lunch in the tent they remembered so well and professed to be shocked at the report of his sisters foolhardiness but whatever may have been natalies fear of ridicule it promptly disappeared under his complete indorsement of her wisdom in refraining from such a mad adventure as if to put her even more at ease oneil was especially attentive to her and eliza reflected gloomily that men after all dislike bravado in women that a trapeze artist or a lady balloonist inspires only a qualified admiration during oneils absence work had progressed steadily on his return he found the grade completed to within a few yards of gordons rightofway although he was still unable to walk he insisted upon going to the front whither he was helped by appleton and happy tom into the narrow space between the end of his embankment and that of his rivals a graveltrain was spilling its burden and a hundred pickandshovel men were busy the opposing forces also seemed hard at work but their activity was largely a pretense and they showed plainly that they were waiting for the clash they were a hardlooking crew and their employer had neglected no precaution he had erected barricades for their protection until his grade looked like a military work they havent showed any guns yet but im sure theyre armed appleton told his chief how is the place lighted by night oneil inquired oil torches slater answered ah weve been recognized that comes from being fat i spose as he spoke a donkeyengine at the right of the proposed crossing set up a noisy rattling a thin steel cable whipped into view between the rails and from the left there appeared a contrivance which oneil eyed curiously it was a sort of drag and rode back and forth upon the rails humph theyd better not put much trust in that murray grunted grimly dont fool yourself its no rubbertired babycarriage said slater our men are afraid of it after watching the device scuttle back and forth for a few moments oneil said shortly post a notice at once offering a thousand dollars for any man who cuts that cable a thousand appleton gasped why ill do it let me no you wont slater broke in ill take that on myself i spoke first its my first chance dan cried its my job im going wait a minute oneil silenced the two who were glaring at each other angrily dont lets have any fighting there will be enough of that later i spoke first dan repeated stubbornly i had my mouth puckered to spit thats why the fat man explained a fellow has to spit id rather you wouldnt volunteer dan said oneil why you might get hurt happy tom nodded his agreement certainly never send a boy on a mans errand and i dont want you to do it either tom for the same reason slater mumbled some sort of sour acquiescence but dan would not be denied you made the offer and i took it up he told oneil somebody has to make the first move and i have a particular need for exactly one thousand dollars if they start a rumpus it will give us the excuse were looking for ive been studying that godevil through fieldglasses for two days now and ill guarantee to put it out of commission before gordons men know what im about just forget the reward if you like and give me a chance whats your plan slater inquired eagerly but appleton shook his head no you dont tommy he said im wise to you murray hesitated briefly then gave his permission id rather youd let one of the roughnecks take the chance but if you insist i do then get your sisters consent slater swore mournfully as if from a heart filled with black despair aint that my luck one cud of gum cost me a thousand dollars hell it would take a millionaire to afford a habit like that he expelled the gum violently and went grumbling off up the track sis wont object said dan lightly shed offer to do the trick herself for shes getting the spirit of the work when oneil had managed to regain the camp he began preparations for an attack that very night using the telephone busily news of the coming affray quickly spread and both the day and night shifts discussed it excitedly at suppertime nor was the excitement lessened when a loaded graveltrain rolled in and dr gray descended from it with his emergency kit and two helpers from the hospital at omar up to this point both eliza and natalie had hoped that the affair might not after all turn out to be very serious but the presence of the grimfaced surgeon and the significant preparations he set about making boded otherwise eliza undertook to reason with her brother but her words refused to come as a matter of fact deep down in her heart was a great rebellion at the fate which had made her a woman and thus debarred her from an active part in the struggle natalie on the other hand was filled with dread and she made a much more vigorous attempt to dissuade dan from his purpose than did his sister but he refused to heed even her and soon hurried away to finish his preparations after supper the camp settled itself to wait for darkness night was slow in coming and long before appleton signified his readiness speculation was rife with the approach of twilight the torches along gordons grade began to glow brightly then dan set his watch with happy toms kissed eliza and made off across the tundra he left the s r n at right angles and continued in that direction for a mile or more before swinging about in a wide circle which brought him well to the rear of gordons encampment the gloom now covered his movements and by taking advantage of an alder thicket he managed to approach very closely to the enemys position but the footing was treacherous the darkness betrayed him into many a fall and he was wet muddy and perspiring when he finally paused not more than two hundred feet from the scene of the proposed crossing xv the battle of gordons crossing curtis gordon was not in charge of his field forces having left the command to his favorite jackal denny beneath his apparent contempt for the law there lurked a certain caution he knew his rivals necessity he appreciated his cunning but wishing to guard against the possibility of a personal humiliation he retired to kyak where he was prepared to admit or to deny as much responsibility as suited him denny had not forgotten oneils exposure of his dishonesty and his zeal could be relied upon he personally knew all the men under him he had coached them carefully and he assured gordon of his ability to hold his ground dan appleton from his covert measured the preparations for resistance with some uneasiness reflecting that if denny had the nerve to use firearms he would undoubtedly rout oneils men who had not been permitted to carry guns by the bright torchlight he could see figures coming and going along the grade like sentinels and from within the barricades of ties he heard others talking the camp itself which lay farther to the left was lighted and black silhouettes were painted against the canvas walls and roofs some one was playing an accordion and its wailing notes came to him intermittently he saw that steam was up in the boiler which operated the godevil although the contrivance itself was stationary it was upon this that he centered his attention consulting his watch nervously at last ten oclock came bringing with it a sound which startled the nearby camp into activity it was a shrill blast from an s r n locomotive and the grinding of carwheels the accordion ceased its complaint men poured out of the lighted tents appleton moved cautiously out from cover he stumbled forward through the kneedeep mud and moss bearing slightly to his right counting upon the confusion to mask his approach he timed it to that of the graveltrain which came slowly creaking nearer rocking over the uneven tracks then down upon the halfsubmerged rails which terminated near the opposing grade it stopped finally with headlight glaring into the faces of denny and his troops and from the highheaped flat cars tumbled an army of pickandshovel men during this hullabaloo appleton slipped out of the marsh and climbed the gravelbed in time to see the steel cable of the skip tighten carrying the drag swiftly along the track the endless cable propelling the contrivance ran through a metal block which was secured to a deadhead sunk between the ties and up to this post dan hastened he carried a coldchisel and hammer but he found no use for them for the pulley was roped to the deadhead drawing his knife he sawed at the manila strands men were all around him but in their excitement they took no notice of him not until he had nearly completed his task was he discovered then some one raised a shout the next instant they charged upon him but his work had been done with a snap the ropes parted the cable went writhing and twisting up the track the unwieldy apparatus came to a stop dan found himself beset by a halfdozen of the enemy who having singled him out of the general confusion as the cause of disaster came at him headlong but by this time oneils men were pouring out of the darkness and overrunning the grade so rapidly that there was little opportunity for concerted action appleton had intended as soon as he had cut the cable to beat a hasty retreat into the marsh but now with the firm gravel roadbed under his feet and the battle breaking before his eyes he changed his mind he carried a light heart and the love of trouble romped through his veins he lowered his head therefore and ran toward his assailants he met the foremost one fairly and laid him out he vanquished the second then closed with a burly black man who withstood him capably they went down together and dan began to repent his haste for blows rained upon him and he became the target not only of missiles of every kind but of heavy hobnailed shoes that were more dangerous than horses hoofs the engineer dearly loved a fair fight even against odds but this was entirely different he was trampled stamped upon kicked he felt himself being reduced to a pulp beneath the overpowering numbers of those savage heels the fact that the black man received an equal share of the punishment was all that saved dan over and over between the ties the two rolled scorning no advantage regarding no rules of combat each striving to protect himself at the others expense they were groveling there in a tangle of legs and arms when happy tom came down the grade leading a charge which swept the embankment clean the boss packer had equipped his command with pickhandles and now set a brilliant example in the use of this his favorite weapon for once the apathetic slater was fully roused he was tremendous irresistible in his capable grasp the oaken cudgel became both armor and flail in defense it was as active as a fencingmasters foil in offense as deadly as the kick of a mule beneath his formless bulk were the muscles of a gladiator his eye had all the quickness of a prizefighter there was something primeval appallingly ferocious about the fat man too he fought with a magnificent enthusiasm a splendid abandon and yet in spite of his rage he was clearheaded and his ears were sensitively strained for the sound of the first gunshotsomething he dreaded beyond measure he was sobbing as much from anxiety as from the violence of his exertions when he tore appleton from the clutch of the black man and set him on his feet are you hurt son he gasped sure im hurt like hell dan spat out a mouthful of blood and sand gimme a club go back yonder tom directed swiftly nail denny before he gets em to shooting kill him if you have to ill take care of these fellers the younger man saw that the engagement at this end of the line was no longer general but had become a series of individual combats so he made what haste he could toward the scene of the more serious encounter to the right of the crossing he judged that the issue was still in doubt there although he could make out little in the confusion on account of the glaring headlight which dazzled him as he ran however he discovered that the s r n forces were in possession of the middle ground having divided the enemys ranks like a wedge and this encouraged him out of the darkness to right and left came shouts curses the sounds of men wallowing about in the kneedeep tundra they were gordons helpers who had been routed from their positions now that appleton had time to collect himself he too grew sick with suspense for he knew that arms had been stacked inside the barricades any instant might bring them into play he began to wonder why denny withheld the word to fire as a matter of fact the explanation was simple although it did not appear until later mr denny at that moment was in no condition to issue orders of any kind the reason being as follows when preparations for the advance were made dr gray who understood perhaps more fully than any one else except oneil the gravity of the issue and the slender pivot upon which the outcome balanced had taken his place in the vanguard of the attacking party instead of in the background as befitted his calling the first rush had carried him well into the fray but once there he had shown his good judgment by refusing to participate in it instead he had selected denny out of the opposing ranks and bored through the crowd in his direction heedless of all efforts to stop him his great strength had enabled him to gain ground he had hurled his assailants aside upsetting them bursting through the press as a footballplayer penetrates a line and when the retreat had begun he was close at the heels of his victim he had overtaken denny beside one of the barricades just as denny seized a rifle and raised it with one wrench he possessed himself of the weapon and the next instant he had bent the barrel over its owners head then as the fight surged onward he had gathered the limp figure in his arms and borne it into the light of a gasolenetorch where he could administer first aid he was kneeling over the fellow when appleton found him as he came stumbling along the grade but the decisive moment had come and gone now and without a leader to command them gordons men seemed loath to adopt a more bloody reprisal they gave way therefore in a halfhearted hesitation that spelled ruin to their cause they were forced back to their encampment over the ground they had vacated picks and shovels began to fly rails were torn up and relaid gravel rained from the flat cars the blockhouses were razed and above the rabble the locomotive panted and wheezed its great yellow eye glaring through the night when it backed away another took its place the grade rose to the level of the intersection then as morning approached it crept out beyond by breakfasttime a long row of flats extended across the line which curtis gordon had tried to hold in defiance of the law dan appleton very dirty very tired but happy found natalie and eliza awaiting him when he limped up to their tent in the early morning light one of his eyes was black and nearly closed his lips were cut and swollen but he grinned cheerfully as he exclaimed say it was a great night wasnt it eliza cried out in alarm at his appearance you poor kid youre a sight she ran for hot water and soap while natalie said warmly you were perfectly splendid dan i knew youd do it did you he tried to smile his appreciation but the effort resulted in a leer so repulsive that the girl looked dismayed you ought to have seen the shindy seen it maybe we didnt honestly did you think we could stay behind we sneaked along with the cookhouse gang and one of them helped us up on the gravelcars he smelled of dishwater but he was a hero we screamed and cried and eliza threw stones until mr oneil discovered us and made us get down he was awfully mean hes a mean man he isnt he was jumping around on one leg like a crippled grasshopper i made a thousand dollars said dan guess what im going to do with it how can i guess im going to buy an engagement ring once more he leered repulsively how nice said natalie coolly congratulations guess who its for i couldnt really its for you oh no it isnt natalies voice was freezing you have made a mistake a very great mistake dan i like you but we wont even mention such things if you please elizas entrance saved her further embarrassment and she quickly made her escape dan groaned so deeply as his sister bathed his injuries that she was really concerned goodness danny she said are you as badly hurt as all that im worse he confessed ive just been shot through the heart slow music and flowers for me arrange for the services and put a rose in my hand sis nonsense ill put a beefsteak on your eye she told him unfeelingly under dr grays attention oneils ankle began to mend and by the time the track had been laid far enough beyond the crossing to insure against further interference from gordon he declared himself ready to complete the journey to kyak which he and the girls had begun nearly three weeks before during the interval eliza had occupied herself in laying out her magazine stories and now she was eager to complete her investigations so as to begin the final writing her experience in the north thus far had given her an altered outlook upon the railroad situation but as yet she knew little of the coal problem that after all was the more important subject and she expected it to afford her the basis for a sensational exposure she had come to alaska sharing her newspapers views upon questions of public policy looking upon murray oneil as a daring promoter bent upon seizing the means of transportation of a mighty realm for his own individual profit upon gordon as an unscrupulous adventurer and upon the copper trust as a greedy corporation reaching out to strangle competition and absorb the riches of the northland but she had found oneil an honorably ambitious man busied like others in the struggle for success and backing his judgment with his last dollar she had learned moreover to sympathize with his aims and his splendid determination awoke her admiration her idea of the trust had changed likewise for it seemed to be a fair and dignified competitor she had seen no signs of that conscienceless grasping policy usually imputed to big business in regard to gordon alone her first conviction had remained unchanged he was in truth as evil as he had been reputed the readjustment of her ideas had been disappointing in a way since it robbed her of a large part of her ammunition but she consoled herself with the thought that she had not yet reached the big vital story which most deeply concerned the welfare of the north she was a bit afraid to pursue her inquiries into the coal subject for her ideas were fixed and she feared that oneils activities merited condemnation in his railroadbuilding she believed he was doing a fine work but the coal was another matter obviously it belonged to the people and he had no right to lay hands upon their heritage she wondered if it would not be possible to omit all mention of him in her coal stories and center attention upon the trust it was impossible for her to attack him now since she had come to understand her feelings toward him even so she reflected with horror that if her articles created the comment she anticipated their effect would be to rob him of his holdings but she took her work very seriously and her sense of duty was unwavering she was one of the few who guide themselves by the line of principle straight through all other considerations she would write what she found true for that was her mission in life if murray proved culpable she would grieve over his wrongdoing and continue to love him oneil had recognized her sincerity and on the broad subject of conservation he had done nothing to influence her views he preferred to let her see the workings of the principle and after actually meeting some of those who had suffered by it form her own conclusions it was for this reason mainly that he had arranged the trip to kyak the journey in a small boat gave eliza a longedfor opportunity to discuss with him the questions which troubled her he was uncommunicative at first but she persisted in her attempt drawing him out in the hope of showing him the error of his ways at last she provoked him to a vigorous defense of his views conservation is no more than economy he declared and no one opposes that its the misapplication of the principle that has retarded alaska and ruined so many of us the situation would be laughable if it werent so tragic of course you blame your troubles on the government thats one thing governments are for our ancestors blamed king george for their troubles more than a hundred years ago and a war resulted but every abuse they suffered is suffered by the people of alaska today and a lot more besides certainly england never violated her contracts with the colonies half so flagrantly as our government has violated its contracts with us of course you exaggerate i dont judge for yourself the law offers every citizen the chance in fact it invites him to go upon the public domain and search for treasure if he is successful it permits him to locate the land in blocks and it agrees to grant him a clear title after he does a certain amount of work and pays a fixed price further it says in effect realizing that you may need financial assistance in this work we will allow you to locate not only for yourself but also for your friends through their powers of attorney and thus gain their cooperation for your mutual advantage these are the rules and they are binding upon all parties to this agreement you keep your part we will keep ours now then some pioneers at risk of life and health came to kyak and found coal they located it they did all the law required them to do but did the government keep its word not at all it was charged that some of them hadnt conformed strictly to the letter of the agreement and therefore all the claims were blacklisted because one man was alleged to have broken his contract the government broke its contract with every man who had staked a coal claim not only at kyak but anywhere else in alaska guilty and innocent were treated alike i was one of the latter was our money returned to us no the government had it and it kept it along with the land weve been holding on now for years and the interior department has tried by various means to shake us off the law has been changed repeatedly at the whim of every theorist who happened to be in power it has been changed without notice to us even while we were out in the wilderness trying to comply with the regulations already imposed you can see how it worked in the case of natalie and her mother the government succeeded in shaking them off thats only one side of the question said eliza you lose sight of the fact that this treasure never really belonged to you but to the public the coallands were withdrawn from entry because men like you and the agents of the heidlemanns were grabbing it all up oneil shook his head frowning thats what the papers say but it isnt true there are twenty million acres of coal in alaska and not more than thirty thousand acres have been located the law gave me the right to locate and buy coal claims and i took advantage of it now it tells me that i have money enough and takes back what it gave if it did the right thing it would grant patents to those who located under the law as it then existed and withdraw the rest of the land from entry if advisable this country needs two things to make it prosper transportation and fuel we are doing our best to supply the first in spite of hindrance from washington but the fuel has been locked away from us as if behind stone walls rich men must be brave to risk their dollars here under existing conditions for they are not permitted to utilize the mines the timber or the waterpower except upon absurd and unreasonable terms why ive seen timber lying four layers deep and rotting where it lies the government wont save it nor will it allow us to do so thats been its policy throughout it is strangling industry and dedicating alaska to eternal solitude railroads are the keys by which this realm can be unlocked coal is the strength by which those keys can be turned the keys are fitted to the lock but our fingers are paralyzed for eight years alaskas greatest wealth has lain exposed to view but the government has posted the warning hands off some one among you is a crook meanwhile the law has been suspended the country has stagnated men have left dispirited or broken towns have been abandoned the cost in dollars to me for instance has been tremendous im laying my track alongside rich coalfields but if i picked up a chunk from my own claim to throw at a chipmunk id become a lawbreaker i import from canada the fuel to drive my locomotives past my own coalbeds which i have paid for and i pay five times the value of that fuel forty percent of which is duty i haul it two thousand miles while there are a billion tons of better quality beneath my feet do you call that conservation i call it waste fraud was practised at the start and of course it takes time to find out just where it lay thats the excuse but after all these years no fraud has been proved in administering the criminal law there is an axiom to the effect that it is better for ninetynine guilty men to escape than for one innocent man to suffer but the land office says that ninetynine innocent alaskans shall suffer rather than that one guilty man shall escape the cry of fraud is only a pretense raised to cover the main issue theres something sinister back of it what do you mean a conspiracy of the eastern coaloperators and the transcontinental freightlines how ridiculous cried eliza you think so listen since all the highgrade coal of the pacific coast must come from the east who then would discourage the opening of local fields but those very interests every ton we burn means a profit to the eastern miner and the railroad man yes and twenty per cent of the heat units of every ton hauled are consumed in transportation isnt that waste every two years it costs our navy the price of a battleship to bring coal to the pacific fleet while we have plenty of better fuel right here on the ground our coal is twentyfive hundred miles nearer to the philippines than san francisco and twelve thousand miles nearer than its present source if alaskan coalbeds were opened up we wouldnt have this yearly fight for battleship appropriations wed make ourselves a present of a firstclass navy for nothing no our claims were disputed and the dispute was thrown into politics to keep us out of competition with our eastern cousins we alaskans sat in a game with high stakes but after the cards were dealt the rules were changed you argue very well said eliza who was a bit dazed at this unexpected forceful counterattack but you havent convinced me that this coal should be thrown open to the first person who comes along i didnt expect to convince you its hard to convince a woman whose mind is made up it would take hours to cover the subject but i want to open your eyes to the effect of this newfangled national policy any great principle may work evil if it isnt properly directed and in kyak youll see the results of conservation ignorantly applied youll see how it has bound and gagged a wonderful country and made loyal americans into ragged bitter traitors who would spit upon the flag they used to cherish is that the only reason why you came along just to make sure that i saw all this no i want to look at the heidlemann breakwater my fortune hangs upon it its as serious as that oneil shrugged im waiting for the wind my coal is in the hands of the bureaucracy at washington my railroad is in the hands of the wind god incidentally id much rather trust the god than the government natalie who had listened so far without the least sign of interest now spoke up if the storm doesnt come to your help will you be ruined she asked murray smiled cheerfully no man is ruined as long as he keeps his dreams money isnt much after all and failure is merely a schooling but i wont fail autumn is here the tempest is my friend and he wont be long in coming now hell arrive with the equinox and when he does hell hold my fortune in his hand why the equinoctial storm is due said eliza exactly thats why im going to meet it and to bid it welcome the village of kyak lay near the mouth of the most easterly outlet of the salmon and it was similar in most respects to hope and to omar save that it looked out across a shallow unprotected bay to the open reaches of the north pacific the shores were low a pair of rocky islets afforded the only shelter to its shipping and it was from these as a startingpoint that the copper trust had built its breakwater a trestle across the tideflats connected the work with the mainland and along this rocktrains crawled adding their burdens to the strength of the barrier protected by this arm of steel and stone and timber lay the terminal buildings of the alaska northern as the heidlemann line was called and there also lay the terminus of the old mcdermott enterprise into which curtis gordon had infused new life both places showed plenty of activity when oneil and his two companions arrived late one afternoon kyak they found was inferior to omar in its public accommodations and murray was at a loss to find shelter for the girls until his arrival was made known to the agents of the alaska northern then mr trevor the engineer in charge looked him up and insisted upon sharing his quarters with the visitors in trevors bearing was no suggestion of an enmity like gordons he welcomed his rival warmly and indeed the trust had never been small in its opposition oneil accepted the invitation gratefully after dinner he took natalie with him to see the sights while eliza profited by the opportunity to interview trevor in her numerous tilts with oneil she had not been oversuccessful from the point of view of her magazine articles but here at her hand was the representative of the power best known and best hated for its activities in the northland and he seemed perfectly willing to talk surely from him she would get information that would count understand im on the side of your enemies she warned him so is everybody else mr trevor laughed but thats because were misunderstood the intentions of any trust warrant suspicion he shrugged the heidlemanns are just ordinary business men like oneil looking for investment they heard of a great big copperfield hidden away back yonder in the mountains and they bought what they considered to be the best group of claims they knew the region was difficult of access but they figured that a railroad from tidewater would open up not only their own properties but the rest of the copperbelt and the whole interior country they began to build a road from cortez when some shoestringer raised the cry that they had monopolized the worlds greatest copper supply and had doublecinched it by monopolizing transportation also that started the fuss they needed cheap coal of course just as everybody else needs it but somebody discovered the danger of a monopoly of that and set up another shout ever since then the yellow press has been screaming the government withdrew all coallands from entry and it now refuses to grant patents to that which had been properly located we dont own a foot of alaskan coalland miss appleton on the contrary we haul our fuel from british columbia just like oneil and gordon those who would like to sell local coal to us are prevented from doing so it sounds well to hear you tell it said eliza but the minute the coal patents are issued you will buy what you want then freeze out the other people you expect to control the mines the railroads and the steamship lines but public necessities like coal and oil and timber and waterpower should belong to the people there has been an awakening of the public conscience and the day of monopolized necessities is passing as long as men own coalmines they will sell them here we are faced not by a question of what may happen but of what has happened if you agreed to buy a city lot from a realestate dealer and after you paid him his price he refused to give you a deed youd at least expect your money back wouldnt you well thats the case of uncle sam and the alaskan miners he not only refuses to deliver the lot but keeps the money and forces them to pay more every year i represent a body of rich men who because of their power are regarded with suspicion but if they did anything so dishonest as what our government has done to its own people they would be jailed no doubt there has been some injustice but the great truth remains that the nation should own its natural resources and should not allow favored individuals to profit by the public need you mean railroads and coalfields and such things i do trevor shook his head if the people of alaska waited for a government railroad theyd die of old age and be buried where they died for lack of transportation the government owns telegraphlines here but it charges us five times the rates of the western union no miss appleton were not ready for government ownership and even if we were it wouldnt affect the legality of what has been done through fear that the heidlemanns might profit this whole country has been made to stagnate alaska is being depopulated houses and stores are closed people are leaving despondent alaskans are denied selfgovernment in any form theories are tried at their expense but they are never consulted not only does congress fail to enact new laws to meet their needs but it refuses to proceed under the laws that already exist if the same policy had been pursued in the settlement of the middle west that applies to this country the buffalo would still be king of the plains and chicago would be a frontier town you seem to think that coal is the most important issue up here but it isnt transportation is what the country needs for the main riches of alaska are as useless today as if hidden away in the chasms of the moon oneil had the right idea when he selected the salmon river route but he made an error of judgment and he lost he hasnt lost cried eliza in quick defense of her friend your breakwater hasnt been tested yet oh it will hold trevor smiled it has cost too much money not to hold wait until the storms come the girl persisted thats what were doing and from present indications we wont have much longer to wait weather has been breeding for several days and the equinox is here of course im anxious but i built that breakwater and it cant go out when oneil and natalie returned they found the two still arguing havent you finished your tiresome discussions asked natalie mr trevor has almost convinced me that the octopus is a noble creature filled with high ideals and writhing at the thrusts of the muckrakers eliza told them but at that the engineer protested no no he said i havent half done justice to the subject there are a dozen men in kyak tonight who could put up a much stronger case than i theres mccann for instance he was a prospector back in the states until he made a strike which netted him a hundred thousand dollars he put nearly all of it into kyak coal claims and borrowed seventy thousand more he got tired of the interminable delay and finally mined a few tons which he sent out for a test in the navy it had better steaming qualities than the eastern coal now being used but six weeks later an agent of the land office ordered him to cease work until his title had been passed upon that was two years ago and nothing has been done since no charges of irregularity of any sort have ever been filed against mccann or his property the government has had his money for five years and still he cant get a ruling hes broke now and too old to make a living hes selling pies on the street he borrowed a dollar from me just now said oneil who was staring out of a window suddenly he turned and addressed his host trevor its going to storm his voice was harsh his eyes were eager his tone brought the engineer to his side together they looked out across the bay the southern sky was leaden the evening had been shortened by a rack of clouds which came hurrying in from the sea let it storm said trevor after a moment im ready have you ever seen it blow here the oldtimers tell me i havent but ive seen some terrible storms of course the place is unusual in what way eliza inquired the whole country back of here is icecapped this coast for a hundred miles to the east is glacial the cold air inland and the warm air from the japanese current are always at war there is a peculiar difference in airpressures too oneil explained over the warm interior it is high and over the coast range it is low so every valley becomes a pathway for the wind but that isnt where the hurricanes come from theyre born out yonder he pointed out beyond the islands from which the breakwater flung its slender arm this may be only a little storm trevor but some day the sea and the air will come together and wipe out all your work then youll see that i was right you told me that more than a year ago but i backed my skill against your prophecy oneil answered him gravely men like you and me become overconfident of our powers we grow arrogant but after all were only pygmies if nature beats me here im a ruined man said the engineer and if you defeat her im ruined oneil smiled at him lets make medicine the way the indians did and call upon the spirit of the wind to settle the question eliza suggested with a womans quick instinct for relieving a situation that threatened to become constrained she and natalie ran to trevors sideboard and seizing bottle and shaker brewed a magic broth while the two men looked on they murmured incantations they made mystic passes then bore the glasses to their companions as the men faced each other natalie cried to the wind yes more power to it eliza echoed trevor smiled i drink defiance in my glass i see hope and confidence said oneil may the storm profit him who most deserves help despite their lightness there was a certain gravity among the four and as the night became more threatening they felt a growing suspense the mens restlessness communicated itself to the girls who found themselves listening with almost painful intentness to the voice of the wind and the rumble of the surf which grew louder with every hour by bedtime a torrent of rain was sweeping past the roof strained the windows were sheeted with water now and then the clamor ceased only to begin with redoubled force trevors guests were glad indeed of their snug shelter as natalie prepared for bed she said it was fine of mr trevor to treat murray oneil so nicely no one would dream that they were rivals or that ones success means the others ruin now gordon she turned to see her friend kneeling at the bedside and apologized quickly eliza lifted her face and said simply im praying for the wind natalie slipped down beside her and bowed her dark head close to the light one they remained there for a long time while outside the rain pelted the surf roared and the wind came shrieking in from the sea xvi the fruit of the tempest neither oneil nor his host was in sight when the girls came to breakfast the men had risen early it seemed and were somewhere out in the storm a wilder day would be hard to imagine a hurricane was raging the rain was whirled ahead of it like charges of shot the mountains behind kyak were invisible and to seaward was nothing but a dimly discernible smother of foam and spray for the crests of the breakers were snatched up and carried by the wind the town was sodden the streets were running mud stovepipes were down tents lay flattened in the mire and the board houses were shaking as if they might fly to pieces at any moment the darkness was uncanny and the tempest seemed to be steadily growing in violence when an hour or two had passed with no word from the men eliza announced her intention of looking them up she had spent the time at a window straining her eyes through the welter while natalie had curled up cozily with a book in one of trevors armchairs but dearie youll be drenched natalie looked up in surprise mr oneil is all right of course he is im not going out to spank him and bring him in i want to look at the storm so do i but it wont do any good i cant make it blow any harder by getting my feet wet you read your novel and talk to mr trevor when he comes back he knows were to blame for this storm so you must be nice to him i cant she clad herself in raincoat souwester and boots and hurried out walking was difficult enough even in the shelter of the village but not until she had emerged upon the beach did she meet the full strength of the gale here it wrapped her garments about her limbs until she could scarcely move the rain came horizontally and blinded her the wind fairly snatched her breath away and oppressed her lungs like a heavy weight she shielded herself as best she could and by clinging to stationary objects and watching her chance she managed to work her way onward at last she caught sight of oneil standing high above the surf facing the wind defiantly as if daring it to unfoot him he saw her and came in answer to her signal but to breast that wind was like stemming a rushing torrent and when he reached her side he was panting child what are you doing here he demanded i couldnt wait any longer she shouted back youve been out since daylight you must be wet through he nodded i lay awake all night listening so did trevor hes beginning to worry already already if the breakwater stands this the storm hasnt half started come well watch it together he took her hand and they lunged into the gale battling their way back to his point of vantage he paused at length and with his arm about her pointed to the milkwhite chaos which marked trevors handiwork the rain pelted against their faces and streamed from their slickers the breakwater lay like a reef and over it the sea was pounding in mighty wrath high into the air the waters rose only to disappear upon the bosom of the gale they engulfed the structure bodily they raced along it with thunderous detonations bursting in a lather of rage out beyond the billows appeared to be sheared flat by the force of the wind yet that ceaseless upheaval of spume showed that the ocean was in furious tumult for moments at a time the whole scene was blotted out by the scud then the curtain would tear asunder and the wild scene would leap up again before their eyes eliza screamed a question at her companion but he did not seem to hear his eyes roved back and forth along that lacewhite ridge of rock on the weakness of which depended his salvation she had never seen him so fierce so hawklike so impassive the gusts shook him his garments slatted viciously every rag beneath his outer covering was sodden yet he continued to face the tempest as indifferently as he had faced it since the dawn the girl thrilled at thought of the issue these mighty forces were fighting out before her eyes and of what it meant to the man beside her his interests became hers she shared his painful excitement her warm flesh chilled as the moisture embraced her limbs but her heart was light for oneils strong arm encircled her and her body lay against his after a long time he spoke see its coming up he said she felt no increase in the wind but she noted that particles of sand and tiny pebbles from the beach were flying with the salt raindrops her muscles began to tremble from the constant effort at resistance and she was relieved when murray looked about for a place of refuge she pointed to a pile of bridge timbers but he shook his head theyll go flying if this keeps up he dragged her into the shelter of a little knoll here the blasts struck them with diminished force the roaring in their ears grew less and the labor of breathing was easier rousing himself from his thoughts the man said gently poor kid you must be cold im freezing but please dont send me back the face that met his was supplicating the eyes were bluer than a spring day he patted her dripping shoulder not until youre ready this is grander than our trip past the glacier that was merely dangerous but this means something there may be danger here if we expose ourselves look at that high up beyond reach of the surf a dory had been dragged and left bottom up under this the wind found a fingerhold and sent it flying over and over it rolled until a stronger gust caught it and sent it in huge leaps end over end it brought up against the timber pile with a crash and was held there as if by a mighty suction then the beams began to tremble and lift the pile was disintegrated bit by bit although it would have required many hands to move any one of its parts even where the man and the woman crouched the wind harried them like a hound pack but by clinging to the branches of a gnarled juniper bush they held their position and let the spray whine over their heads farther west ive seen houses chained to the earth with ships cables he shouted in her ear to think of building a harbor in a place like this i prayed for you last night i prayed for the wind to come said the girl after a time oneil looked at her curiously startled then he looked out at the sea once more all in a moment he realized that eliza was beautiful and that she had a heart it seemed wonderful that she should be interested in his fortunes he was a lonely man beneath his open friendliness lay a deep reserve a curiously warm feeling of gratitude flamed through him now and he silently blessed her for bearing him company in the deciding hour of his life noon came and still the two crouched in their halfshelter drenched chilled stiff with exposure watching kyak bay lash itself into a boiling smother the light grew dim night was settling the air seemed full of screaming furies then oneil noticed bits of driftwood racing in upon the billows and he rose with a loud cry its breaking up he shouted its breaking up eliza lifted herself and clung to him but she could see nothing except a misty confusion in a few moments the flotsam came thicker splintered piling huge squarehewn timbers with fragments of twisted iron or broken bolts came floating into sight a confusion of wreckage began to clutter the shore and into it the sea churned the spindrift tore asunder at length and the watchers caught a brief glimpse of the tumbling ocean the breakwater was gone over the place where it had stood the billows raced unhindered poor trevor said oneil poor trevor he did his best but he didnt know he looked down to find eliza crying whats this ive kept you here too long no no im just glad so glad dont you understand ill take you back i must get ready to leave leave where for new york ive made my fight and ive won his eyes kindled feverishly ive won in spite of them all i hold the key to a kingdom its mine mine i hold the gateway to an empire and those who pass through must pay the girl had never seen such fierce triumph in a face i saw it in a dream only it was more than a dream the wind snatched oneils words from his lips but he ran on i saw a deserted fishingvillage become a thriving city i saw the glaciers part to let pass a great traffic in men and merchandise i saw the unpeopled north grow into a land of homes of farms of miningcamps where people lived and bred children i heard the mountain passes echo to steam whistles and the whir of flying wheels it was a wonderful vision that i saw but my eyes were true they called me a fool and it took the sea and the hurricane to show them i was right he paused ashamed of his outburst and taking the girls hand in his went stumbling ahead of the storm their limbs were cramped their teeth chattered they wallowed through mire and more than once they fell nearing trevors house they saw what the storm had done kyak was nearly razed roofs had been ripped off chimneys were down glass was out none but the most substantial log cabins had withstood the assault and men were busied in various quarters trying to repair the damage they found natalie beside herself with anxiety for their safety and an hour later trevor came in soaked to the skin he was very tired and his face was haggard well she went out he said i saw a million dollars swallowed up in that sea they tried to comfort him but the collapse of his work had left him dazed god i didnt think it could blow like this and it isnt over yet the town is flat im sorry you understand i sympathize said murray and the engineer nodded you told me it blew here and i thought i knew what you meant but nothing could withstand those rollers nothing youll go east and see our people i suppose at once tell them what you saw theyll never understand from my reports theyre good people if theres anything i can do oneil took his hand warmly two days later murray bade the girls goodby and left traveling light they remained in kyak so that eliza might complete her investigations of all those who suffered by the storm curtis gordon took his misfortune hardest this had been a black season for him indeed beginning with oneils rivalry everything had gone against him he had dropped his coal interests at kyak in favor of the coppermine because they failed to yield quick profits then he had learned that the mine was valueless and realized that it could not serve him much longer as a means of raising funds still he had trusted that by taking a vigorous part in the railroad struggle he would be able either to recoup his fortunes or at least to effect a compromise in the shadow of which his fiasco at hope would be forgotten as yet the truth about hope consolidated was not generally known to his stockholders but a certain restlessness among them had become troublesome the stream of money had diminished alarmingly and it was largely because of this that he had bought the mcdermott rightofway and moved to kyak and now just as he had his affairs in shape for another and a greater campaign of stockflotation the storm had come to ruin him the bitterest element in his defeat was the realization that oneil who had bested him at every turn was destined to profit by the very blow which crushed him defeat at the hands of the copper trust he would have accepted with a fairly good grace but the mere thought that murray oneil whom he considered in every way his inferior had gained the upper hand was intolerable it was in keeping with gordons character that instead of blaming his own judgment he became furiously angry at the trust for the mistake of its engineers and held them responsible for his desperate situation that it was truly desperate he very soon realized since disaster to his railroad project meant that his stockholders would be around his ears like a swarm of hornets and once they understood the true state of affairs at hope the complete collapse of his fortunes would surely follow during the days succeeding the storm he scarcely knew where to turn so harassed was he yet he never for a moment wavered in his resolve to make oneil pay for his interference and to exact a reckoning from gloria gerard natalies presence in kyak confirmed his belief that oneil was interested in her and he began to plan a stroke by which he could take revenge upon all three it did not promise in any way to help him out of his financial straits but at least it would give him a certain satisfaction he sent word to the girl that he would like to see her xvii how the prince became a man gordon found his erstwhile ward greatly improved by her recent life she was brown vigorous healthy her physical charms quickened his pulses you must have a very good reason for coming to see me she began i dont flatter myself that it is from affection there you wrong me he assured her with the warm earnestness he so easily assumed i have always regarded you as a daughter i have no faith in you exactly and the knowledge distresses me you and gloria were a large part of my life i cant bear to lose you i hope and i believe that her regard for me has changed no more than mine for her it remains for me to regain yours that is impossible you had the chance my dear you cant know my reasons for acting as i did at omar but those reasons no longer exist just what do you mean by that stammered natalie i mean what i say im ready to marry your mother when at once you shall plead my cause for me you shall add your voice to mine that isnt necessary you know mother is only waiting for you it means so much to her that she couldnt refuse doesnt it mean anything to you natalie nodded it means more to me than to any one else perhaps i have been carrying a great burden almost more than i can bear sometimes ive wished i were a man for just long enough to make you pay oh yes she continued as he started to protest dont let us begin this new life with any false conceptions you may as well know that i shall always hate you we shall see very little of each other nonsense i cant let you feel like that i shant rest until i win back your love and confidence she eyed him searchingly for a moment then opened her lips to speak but closed them well he prompted her let us be frank with each other im merely wondering how greatly your decision has been influenced by the storm and the fight at the railroad crossing i understand how you feel toward mr oneil and i know that he means to crush you oh gordons face lighted yes he has never said so but i can feel it i wonder if you have snatched us up in your extremity as a defense ridiculous your suspicions are insulting i have nothing to fear from him for he is broken his credit is gone he is in desperate straits are you in any better condition how long can you fool your people with that pretense of a mine gordon flushed but affected scorn so have you and gloria begun to balance my wealth against my love if so you know she would marry you if you were penniless i hope so and indeed i cant believe her mercenary well i shall say goodby to kyak without idle regret and we three shall return to hope where i can attack my problems with fresh courage i can well afford my loss here if by doing so i gain the woman of my desires you want me to go with you of course you cant stay in omar knowing what you do about oneil remember i shall be in the position of a father to you very well it is the least i can do miss appleton and i are returning to omar in a few days will you go with us i shall be delighted my dear he smiled upon her in his most fatherly fashion but she was far from feeling the assurance he meant to convey the eighteenhour train from chicago bore murray oneil into new york on time and he hastened directly to the holland house where the clerk greeted him as if he had run in from yonkers instead of from the wilderness of the far northwest his arrival was always the forerunner of great prosperity for the bellboys and there was the customary struggle for his baggage an hour later having bathed and changed his linen he was whizzing toward lower broadway with the roar of the subway in his ears new york looked very good to oneil for this time he came not as a suppliant but as a conqueror and a deep contentment rested in his heart more than once during the last two years he had made this flying trip across an ocean and a continent but heretofore he had been burdened with worries and responsibilities always he had needed to gather his wits for some supreme effort always there had been the urgent necessity of raising money as the s r n had grown his obligations had increased and while he had never returned emptyhanded no one but he knew at what cost of time and strength he had succeeded in financing his venture invariably he had left new york mentally and physically exhausted and his days in the open had barely served to replenish his store of nervous energy for the next campaign as he looked back upon it all he was amazed at his daring in attempting to finance a railroad out of his own pocket but he had won and the trust had met with a sharp reverse in attempting to beat him at his own game he held the winning card and he looked out upon the world through eyes which were strained and weary but complacent mr herman heidlemann was expecting him you have the most confident way of arranging appointments from the other side of the world he began as oneil entered his office steamships and railroads appear to be your obedient servants not always i find railroads very troublesome at times well youre on time to the minute said heidlemann now tell me about kyak trevor cables that you were there during the storm which ruined us the head of the copper syndicate did not look like a man facing ruin in fact he seemed more curious to hear of the physical phenomena of that hurricane than of its effect upon his fortunes kyak was a great mistake he admitted when oneil had given him the particulars he asked for were all agreed on that point some of our associates feel that the whole alaskan enterprise has been a mistake mines and all your mines are as good as they ever were but kyak is a long way from wall street and you relied too much upon other peoples judgment we have to rely upon our experts of course but that country must have a railroad must heidlemann lifted his brows it has done very well without one so far our friends call us crazy for trying to build one and our enemies call us thieves you cant afford to give up no theres an element of pride in the matter and i really believe the country does need transportation you cant understand how badly it needs it yet its a heavy load to carry said heidlemann with conviction for a road will lose money for many years we were willing to wait until the agriculture and the mining developed even though the profit came only to our children but we have been misunderstood abused by the press and the public even congress is down on us however i suppose you came to tell me once more that omar is the gateway and that we need it oneil smiled thats hardly necessary now is it i own every inch of waterfront at that point and theres no other harbor my track will be laid to the glaciers by the time snow flies trevor reports that a bridge is possible although expensive it will cost two million dollars i dont see how it can be built to withstand the ice ill guarantee to build it so it will hold what is your proposition asked heidlemann ill sell the srn for five million dollars and contract to complete the road within two years on a tenpercent commission it has cost you about three million dollars i believe that would leave you a handsome profit one million for me one million for my associates what will the remaining hundred miles cost about ten millions that will give me another million profit as contractor my force and equipment is on the ground i can save you money and a years time mr heidlemann drummed upon the top of his desk for a moment youre a highpriced man oneil he said finally youve had experience with the other kind counting the money weve already sunk the road would stand us about twenty million dollars completed it will cost thirty to build from cortez and take two years longer mr heidlemann seemed to consider this for a moment weve had this matter before us almost constantly since the report of the storm he said at length and after deliberation our directors have voted to do nothing just yet oneil opened his eyes in amazement i dont understand its this way our engineers first recommended cortez as a startingpoint and we spent a fortune there then you attacked the other route and we sent trevor up to find if you were right and we were wrong he recommended the salmon river valley and told us he could build a breakwater at kyak you know the result we relied upon him for he seemed to be the best man in the country but as a matter of precaution we later sent other engineers their reports came in not three months ago and while all seemed confident that the breakwater could be built none of them were certain about the bridge one in fact condemned it absolutely now on the heels of their statements comes the news that the very work they united in declaring feasible has been undone naturally we dont know where we are or whom to believe they simply didnt know the conditions at kyak argued oneil and they evidently havent studied the bridge as i have but youll have to go at the breakwater again or build in from cortez or give up no we have decided to mark time until that crossing is proved feasible understand i voice the sentiment of the majority if i build that bridge you may find it more difficult to buy me out said oneil quietly well have to take our medicine mr heidlemann replied without heat we cannot afford another mistake this is definite oh absolutely were going slow for a time a blow in the face could not have affected oneil more disagreeably than this statement fortune had seemed within his grasp when he entered the room now ruin was more imminent than it had ever been before the ground seemed to be slipping from beneath his feet he discovered that he was dizzy he felt himself utterly incapable of raising the two million dollars necessary to carry his road to a point where the trust would consider a purchase yet to fail meant the loss of all he had put in he knew also that these men would never recede from a position once taken hasnt this public clamor had something to do with your determination he asked a great deal we had the best intentions when we started we still have but its time to let the general sentiment cool we thought we were doing a fine thing for the country in opening alaska but it seems were regarded as thieves and grafters one gets tired of abuse after a while will you take an option on the s r cant help you oneil but rest assured we wont do anything to hinder you you have treated us fairly we will reciprocate once you have built your bridge we can discuss a purchase and the abandonment of our original enterprise but meanwhile we must proceed cautiously it is unfortunate for us all especially for me you need money badly dont you im worse than broke oneil admitted id really be sorry to take over the wreck of your enterprise heidlemann said earnestly for you have made a good fight and your ideas were better than ours id much prefer to pay your price than to profit by your misfortune needless to say we dont feel that way about gordon there would be no uncertainty about the bridge if i had the money with your means i could build a road to the moon and doubletrack it although murray felt that further effort was useless he continued to argue the matter from various angles hoping against hope to sway heidlemanns decision but he gave up at last out in the marble hall which led to the elevators he discovered that all his vigor of an hour ago had passed the spring was out of his limbs he walked slowly like an old man a glimpse of his image in the mirrors of the car as he shot downward showed him a face grave and haggard the crowds jostled him but he was hardly conscious of them the knowledge that his hardest fight was yet to come filled him with sickening apprehension he was like a runner who toes the mark for a final heat knowing himself to be upon the verge of collapse the magnitude of the deal narrowed his field of operations alarmingly and he had already learned what a serious effect upon capital the agitation about alaska had produced more than once he had found men who were willing to invest but feared the effect of public sentiment popular magazines newspapers like the review and writers like eliza appleton had been largely to blame for the wrong they had misunderstood the problem and misinterpreted the spirit of commercial progress but strangely enough he felt no bitterness at thought of eliza on the contrary his heart softened in a sort of friendly yearning for her company he would have liked to talk the matter over with her looking the situation squarely in the face he realized that he must face a crash or raise two million dollars within the next month that meant seventy thousand dollars a day it was a mansized task he bought himself a cigar at the corner hailed a taxicab and was driven all the way up town to the holland house once there he established himself in that corner of the mens cafe which he always frequented the waiter who served him lingered to say its good to see you back in your office again youve been a long time away sir oneil smiled as he left a silver dollar on the tray its good to be back joe he said this time i may not leave xviii how the man became a prince again oneil had the faculty of sleeping well in spite of the most tormenting worries he arose on the morning after his interview with mr heidlemann ready to begin the struggle with all his normal energy and confidence but the day brought him only discouragement he had a large acquaintance the mention of his name in quarters where he was not personally known gained him respectful attention but he found himself working in the shadow of the copper trust and its silent influence overcame his strongest arguments one banker expressed the general attitude by saying if the heidlemanns were not in the field we might help you but it would be financial suicide to oppose them theres no opposition about it murray assured him if i build that bridge theyll buy us out at this his hearer very naturally wished to know why if the bridge were indeed feasible the heidlemanns delayed action and oneil had to fall back upon a recital of the facts realizing perfectly that they failed to carry conviction no one it seemed cared to risk even a semblance of rivalry with that monstrous aggregation of capital for the interlacing of financial interests was amazingly intricate and financiers were fearful of the least misstep everywhere oneil encountered the same disheartening timidity his battle it seemed had been lost before it was begun days passed in fruitless endeavors evenings found oneil in his corner of the holland house cafe racking his brain for some way out of his perplexities usually he was surrounded by friends for he continued to entertain in the lavish fashion for which he had gained a reputation but sometimes he was alone and then his solitude became more oppressive than it had ever been even in the farthest wastes of the northland he was made to feel his responsibility with dreadful keenness for his associates were in a panic and bombarded him with daily inquiries vexatious and hard to answer he had hoped that in this extremity they might give him some practical help and they did make a few halfhearted attempts only to meet the same discouragements as he at last they left him to carry the burden alone a week two weeks went by he was in constant cable communication with omar but not even the faithful dr gray knew the dire straits in which his chief was struggling work on the s r n was going forward as usual the organization was running at its highest efficiency rails were being laid gangs of rockworkers were preparing the grade beyond the glaciers yet every day that passed every paycheck drawn brought ruin closer nevertheless oneil continued to joke and chat with the men who came to his table in the cafe and kept his business appointments with his customary cheerfulness the waiters who attended him rejoiced in his usual princely tips one evening as he ran through his mail he found a letter in a womans handwriting and glancing at the signature started it was signed gloria gordon briefly it apprised him of her marriage and of her and natalies return to hope gloria thanked him perfunctorily for his many kindnesses but she neither expressed nor implied an invitation for him to visit them he smiled a little grimly already her loyalty had veered to gordons side and natalie no doubt shared her feeling well it was but natural perhaps it would be unreasonable to expect them to sacrifice their desires and what they now seemed to consider their interests to a business quarrel they could hardly be expected to understand he could not help feeling hurt that the women should so readily exchange his friendship for the protection of his bitterest enemy but they were helpless and he had helped them let it rest at that he was really troubled however that they had been so easily deceived if they had only waited if he had only been able to advise them for gordons intention was plain he was aroused from his train of thought by a stranger whom he found standing beside his table and looking down at him with wavering eye misser oneil aint it the fellow inquired sure thought i knew you im bulker of the old north pass remember me mr bulker had been imbibing freely he showed evidences of a protracted spree not only in his speech but in the trembling hand which he extended his eyes were bloodshot and his goodnatured face was purple oneil greeted him pleasantly and considering himself enthusiastically welcomed the newcomer sat down suddenly as if some one had tripped him been washing you for ten minutes washing me no washing you couldnt make you out eyesights getting bad too many bright lights in this town ha joke lets have a gill thank you no must have a little dram for old times sake youre the only one of the north pass crowd ill drink with mr bulker gestured comprehensively at a group of waiters and murray yielded you were my friend oneil you always treated me right what are you doing now asked oneil with the interest he could not refuse to any one who had ever worked with him he remembered the fellow perfectly he had come on from the east as auditor and had appeared to be capable although somewhat given to drink im a broker wall streets my habitat fine time to buy stocks misser oneil bulker assumed an expression of great wisdom like to have a tip no good youre a wise man they fired me from the north pass whad you know about that fired me for drinking greatest injustice i ever heard of but i hit running like a turkey that wasnt the reason they let me go though not on your life he winked portentously and strangely enough his eyelid failed to resume its normal position it continued to droop giving the appearance of a waggish leer i knew too mush isnt healthy to know too mush is it ive never had a chance to find out smiled murray oh dont be an ingenue you savvied more than anybody on the job ill admit i took a nip now and then but i never got pickled say who dyou spose i saw today old man illis oneil became suddenly intent he had been trying to get in touch with poultney illis for more than a fortnight but his cables to london had brought no response when did he arrive just lately hes a game old rooster aint he gee hes sore sore about what bulker winked again with the same lack of muscular control about that north pass deal of course he was blackmailed out of a cold million the agreements about up now and i figure hes over here to renew it youre talking greek said oneil but his eagerness was manifest i sposed you knew the north pass has been paying blackmail to the yukon steamboat companies for three years when you built the line it practically put em out of the dawson market understand of course now that mr bulkers mind was running along wellworn grooves his intoxication became less apparent those frisco steamboat men got together and started a rate war against the railroad they hauled freight to dawson by way of st michaels at a loss of course illis and his crowd had to meet competition and it nearly broke em the first two seasons gee they were the mad ones finally they fixed up an agreement had to or go bust and of course the native sons put it over our english cousins they agreed to restore the old rate and each side promised to pay the other a royalty of ten dollars a ton on all the freight it hauled to dawson and upriver points you can guess the result cant you the steamboat companies let illis haul all the freight and sat back on their haunches and took their profit for every ton he hauled he slipped em ten round american dollars stamped with the goddess of liberty oh it was soft when they had him fairly tied up they drydocked their steamboats to save wear and tear he paid em a thousand dollars a day for three years if that aint blackmail its a first cousin to it by marriage didnt the interstate commerce commission get wise certainly not it looks wise but it never gets wise oh believe me poultney illis is hopping mad i spose hes over here now to renew the arrangement for another three years on behalf of his stockholders lets have a dram bulker sat back and stared as through a mist at his companion enjoying the effect of his disclosure oneil was indeed impressed more deeply than his informant dreamed out of the lips of a drunken man had come a hint which set his nerves to tingling he knew illis well he knew the caliber of the englishman and a plan was already leaping in his brain whereby he might save the s r n it lacked an hour of midnight when oneil escaped from bulker and reached his room once inside he seized the telephone and rang up hotel after hotel inquiring for the english capitalist but without result after a moments consideration he took his hat and gloves and went out the matter did not permit of delay not only were his own needs imperative but if poultney illis had come from london to confer with his rivals there was little time to spare remembering the englishmans habits oneil turned up the avenue to the waldorf where he asked for the manager whom he well knew yes mr illis is here he was informed but hes registered under a different name no doubt hell be glad to see you however a moment later murray recognized the voice of illiss valet over the wire and greeted him by name another brief delay and the capitalist himself was at the phone come right up he said and oneil replaced the receiver with a sigh of relief illis greeted him warmly for their relations had been close lucky you found me he said im going back on the next sailing have you signed up with the arctic navigation company murray inquired and the other started bless me what do you mean his caller laughed i see you havent i dont think you will either after youve talked with me without the tremor of an eyelash illis exclaimed my word what are you driving at that agreement over freight rates of course the briton eyed him for a moment then carefully closed the door leading from his sittingroom and seating himself lit a cigar what do you know about that matter he asked quietly about all there is to know enough at least to appreciate your feelings i flattered myself that my affairs were private where did you get your information ill tell you if you insist although id rather not theres no danger of its becoming public illis showed his relief im glad you gave me a start rotten fix for a man to be in why im here under an assumed name fancy but he waved his hand in a gesture which showed his acceptance of the inevitable you havent made your new agreement im to meet blum and capron tomorrow why didnt you take the s r n when i cabled you last month i couldnt but what has that to do with the matter dont you see its so plain to me that i cant understand how you failed to realize the value the necessity of buying my road explain please gladly the north pass yukon is paying a fabulous blackmail to the riverlines to escape a ruinous rate war right its blackmail as you say under the present agreement you handle the dawson freight and keep out of the lower river they take the whole tanana valley and lower yukon correct didnt it occur to you that the sr n which starts four hundred miles west of the north pass and taps the tanana valley can be used to put the river steamers of that section out of business lets have a look at the map mr illis hurried into an adjoining room and returned with a huge chart which he unrolled upon the table to tell you the truth i never looked at the proposition from that angle our people were afraid of those glaciers and the competition of the copper trust theyre disgusted too with our treatment the trust is eliminated kyak harbor is wiped off the map and im alone in the field how about this fellow gordon hell be broke in a year incidentally thats my trouble but im told you cant pass the glaciers i can parker says hell have the bridge done by spring then id bank on it id believe parker if i knew he was lying if you both agree i havent the slightest doubt this is a bigger proposition than the north pass mr illis you made money out of that road but this one will make more he swiftly outlined the condition of affairs even to the attitude assumed by the heidlemanns and illis knowing the speaker as he did had no doubt that he was hearing the exact truth but thats not all continued oneil the s r n is the club which will hammer your enemies into line thats what i came to see you about with a voice in it you can control the traffic of all central alaska and force the san francisco crowd to treat the n p y fairly thereby saving half a million a year its a big undertaking im not sure our crowd could swing it they dont have to theres a quick profit of two million to be had by selling to the trust next spring you can dictate your own terms to those blackmailers tomorrow and then make a turnover in nine months it doesnt matter who owns the s r n after its completed the steamboat men will see their profits cut as it is now they can make enough out of their own territory to haul freight into yours for nothing i dare say youll go to them if we dont take you up eh my road has its strategic value i must have help if you dont come to my rescue it will mean war with your line i dare say mr illis sat back staring at the ceiling for a long time from the street below came the whir and clatter of taxicabs as the midnight crowd came and went the citys nocturnal life was at its height men had put aside the worries of the day and were devoting themselves to the more serious and exhausting pastimes of relaxation still the whitehaired briton weighed in his mind the matter of millions while the fortunes of murray oneil hung in the balance my people wont buy the s r n illis finally announced but ill put it up to them i cant delay action if theres a chance of a refusal ill have to see blum and capron said oneil ill cable full details within the hour well have an answer by tomorrow night and if they refuse oneil lit a cigar with steady fingers oh if they refuse ill join you well go over the matter carefully in the mean time two million you said didnt you yes theres two million profit for you in nine months his voice was husky and a bit uneven for he had been under a great strain good you dont know how resentful i feel toward blum and his crowd i im downright angry i am that illis took the hand which his caller extended with an expressionless face im glad i found you confessed oneil i was on my last legs herman heidlemann will pay our price when the last bridgebolt is driven home and hell pay with a smile on his face thats the sort of man he is he wont pay if he knows im interested were not exactly friendly since i sold out my smelter interests but he neednt know nobody need know illis called his valet and instructed him to rouse his secretary and ring for some cable blanks i think ill cable too murray told him i have some boys up there who are working in the dark with their teeth shut theyre waiting for the crash and theyd like to hear the good news his fingers shook as he scrawled the name of doctor gray but his eyes were bright and youth was singing in his heart once more now lets get down to business said mr illis well have to talk fast it was growing light in the east when oneil returned to the holland house but he felt no fatigue and he laughed from the pure joy of living for his dream seemed coming true xix miss appleton makes a sacrifice tom slater came puffing up the hill to the appleton bungalow plumped himself into a chair and sighed deeply whats the matter are you played out asked eliza no im feeling like a colt any news from omar khayyam not a word elizas brows drew together in a worried frown for none of murrays boys had awaited tidings from him with greater anxiety than she it had been a trying month for them all dr gray upon whom the heaviest responsibility rested had aged visibly under the strain parker and mellen and mckay had likewise become worn and grave as the days passed and they saw disaster approaching even dan was blue and sheldon the lighthearted had begun to lose interest in his commissary duties after the storm at kyak there had been a period of fierce rejoicing which had ended abruptly with the receipt of oneils curt cablegram announcing the attitude of the trust gloom had succeeded the first surprise deepening to hopeless despondency through the days that followed oddly enough slater had been the only one to bear up under adversity he blossomed into a peculiar and almost offensive cheerfulness it was characteristic of his crooked temperament that misfortune awoke in him a lofty and unshakable optimism youre great on nicknames aint you he said to eliza regarding her with his neverfailing curiosity whos this homer keim youre always talking about he isnt any more he was he was a cheerful old persian poet i thought he was dutch from the name well murrays cheerful too him and me are alike in that ill bet he isnt worrying half so much as doc and the others you think hell make good he never fails but we cant hold on much longer dan says that some of the men are getting uneasy and want their money tom nodded the men are all right doc has kept them paid up its the shift bosses i say let em quit has it gone as far as that somebody keeps spreading the story that were busted and that murray has skipped out more of gordons work i spose some of the soreheads are coming in this evening to demand their wages can we pay them doc says he dassent so i spose theyll quit he should have fired em a week ago never let a man quit always beat him to it we could hold the roughnecks for another two weeks if it wasnt for these fellows but theyll go back and start a stampede how many are there about a dozen i was afraid it was worse there cant be much owing to them oh its bad enough theyve been letting their wages ride thats why they got scared we owe them about four thousand dollars they must be paid said eliza it will give mr oneil another two weeks a month perhaps docs got his back up and hes told the cashier to make em wait eliza hesitated and flushed a little i suppose its none of my business she said but couldnt you boys pay them out of your own salaries mr slater grinned an unprecedented proceeding which lent his face an altogether strange and unnatural expression salary we aint had any salary he said cheerfully not for months dan has drawn his regularly oh sure but he aint one of us hes an outsider i see elizas eyes were bright with a wistful admiration thats very nice of you men you have a family havent you uncle tom i have seven head and they eat like a herd of stock it looks like a lean winter for em if murray dont make a sale but he will that isnt what i came to see you about ive got my asking clothes on and i want a favor you shall have it of course i want a certificate of what ill health nobody believes i had the smallpox you didnt whwhat toms eyes opened wide he stared at the girl in hurt surprise it was nothing but pimples tom pimples he spat the word out indignantly and his round cheeks grew purple i i spose pimples gave me cramps and chills and backache and palpitation and swellings hunh i had a narrow escape narrows the word it was narrower than a knifeedge anything i get out of life from now on is velvet for i was knocking at deaths door the grave yawned but i jumped it its the first sick spell i ever had and i wont be cheated out of it understand what do you want me to do smiled the girl youre a writer write me an affidavit i cant do that then put it in your paper put it on the front page where folks can see it ive quit the review im doing magazine stories well thatll do im not particular where its printed so long as eliza shook her head you werent really sick uncle tom at this mr slater rose to his feet in high dudgeon dont call me uncle he exclaimed youre in with the others it wouldnt be published if i wrote it then you cant be much of a writer he glared at her and slowly distinctly with all the emphasis at his command said i had smallpox and a dam bad case understand i was sick i had miseries in every joint and cartage of my body im going to use a pickhandle for a cane and anybody that laughs will get a hickory massage thatll take a crooked needle and a pair of pinchers to fix thank god ive got my strength back you get me i do he snorted irately and turned to go but eliza checked him what about those shift bosses she asked slater rolled his eyes balefully just let one of em mention smallpox he said and ill fill the hospital till it bulges no no are you going to pay them certainly not eliza considered for a moment dont let them see dr gray she said at length he has enough to worry him meet them at the train and bring them here what for tea you boys have done all you can i think its time dan and i did something tom stared are you going to pay em he asked gruffly yes mr oneil needs time dan and i have saved four thousand dollars id offer it to dr gray he wouldnt take it exactly send dan up here when you see him it doesnt seem exactly right tom was obviously embarrassed you see we sort of belong to murray and you dont but he shook his head as if to rid himself of unwelcome emotion women are funny things youre willing to do that for the chief and yet you wont write me a little affidavit he grunted and went away still shaking his head when eliza explained her plan to dan she encountered an opposition that shocked and hurt her i wont do it he said shortly you what we cant build the s r yes and made you love him too said dan roughly i can see that eliza lifted her head and met his eyes squarely thats true but why not cant i love him isnt it my privilege to help him if i want to if i had two million dollars instead of two thousand id give it to him and and i wouldnt expect him to care for me either hell never do that he couldnt but oh danny ive been miserable dan felt a certain dryness of the throat which made speech oddly difficult i dont see why he couldnt care for you he said lamely eliza shook her head hopelessly im glad it happened she said glad in writing these articles ive tried to make him understood ive tried to put my whole soul into them so that the people will see that he isnt wouldnt be a thief nor a grafter ive described him as he is big honorable gentle i didnt know you were writing fiction said her brother impatiently im not its all true ive cried over those articles dan ive petted them and ive kissed his name oh ive been silly she smiled at him through a sudden glimmer of tears dan began to wonder if his sister in spite of her exemplary conduct in the past were after all going to have hysterics women were especially likely to he reflected when they demanded the impossible at last he said uncomfortably gee i thought i was the dippy member of the family its our chance to help him she urged will you no im sorry sis but my little bit wouldnt mean anything to him it means everything to me maybe thats selfish i dont care im as mad over natalie as you seem to be over him a weeks delay cant make any difference now he played and lost but i cant afford to lose hell make another fortune thats sure but do you think ill ever find another natalie no dont argue for i wont listen he left the house abruptly and eliza went into the white bedroom which oneil had fitted up for her from the remotest corner of her lowest bureau drawer she drew a battered tin box and dividing the money it contained into two equal parts placed one in the pockets of her mannish jacket it was dark when tom slater arrived at the head of a group of soiled workmen whom he ushered into the parlor of the bungalow heres the bunch he announced laconically as the newcomers ranged themselves uncomfortably about the wall dan appleton entered and greeted them with his customary breeziness the paymaster is busy and doc gray has a surgical case he said so ill cash your timechecks get me the box will you sis he had avoided elizas eyes upon entering and he avoided them now but the girls throat was aching as she hurried into her bedroom and hastily replaced the rolls of greenbacks she had removed from the tin box when he had finished paying off dan said brusquely now we mustnt have any loafing around town understand we cant get back tonight said one of the men oh yes you can i ordered an engine out we hear theres talk about quitting work another ventured wheres oneil hes in the states buying a steamship answered dan unblushingly we cant get stuff fast enough by the regular boats good that sounds like business we dont want to quit now hurry your parlorcar is waiting when he and eliza were alone he turned to her with a flush of embarrassment arent we the darnedest fools sis i wouldnt mind if we had done the chief any good but we havent he closed the lid of the tin box which was nearly empty now and pushed it away from him laughing mirthlessly hide that sarcophagus where i cant see it he commanded it makes me sick eliza flung her arm about his neck and laid her cheek against his poor danny youre a brick its the breadline for us he told her never mind were used to it now she laughed contentedly and snuggled her face closer to his it was on the following morning that oneils cablegram announcing the result of his interview with illis reached omar dr gray brought the news to the appleton bungalow while dan and his sister were still at breakfast happy tom came puffing and blowing at his heels with a highly satisfied itoldyouso expression on his round features he made it the tide has turned cried the doctor as he burst in waving the message on high yes he explained in answer to their excited questions murray got the money and our troubles are over now give me some coffee eliza im all shaky english money commented slater the same as we used on the north pass then he interested illis cried dan yep hes the whitewinged messenger of hope i wasnt worried for a minute tom averred the breakfast which followed was of a somewhat hysterical and fragmentary nature for eliza felt her heart swelling and the faithful gray was all but undone by the strain he had endured thats the first food ive tasted for weeks he confessed ive eaten but i havent tasted and now im not hungry he sighed stretched his long limbs gratefully and eyed the appletons with a kindly twinkle you were up in the air too werent you the chief will appreciate last nights affair eliza colored faintly it was nothing please dont tell him at the incredulous lift of his brows she hastened to explain tom said you men belonged to mr oneil and dan was an outsider that hurt me dreadfully well he cant say that now dan is one of murrays boys all right and you you must be his girl at that moment mellen and mckay burst into the bungalow demanding the truth behind the rumor which had just come to their ears and there followed fresh explanations and rejoicings through which eliza sat quietly thrilled by the note of genuine affection and loyalty that pervaded it all but now that the general despondency had vanished and joy reigned in its place tom slater relapsed into his habitual gloom and spoke forebodingly of the difficulties yet to be encountered murray dont say how much hes raised he remarked it may be only a drop in the bucket well have to go through all this again probably and the next time he wont find it so easy to sting a millionaire well last through the winter anyhow winter slater shook his bald head winter is hard on old men like me well have the bridge built by spring sure mellen declared maybe i hope so i wish i could last to see it but the smallpox undermined me perhaps its a mercy im so far gone nobody knows yet whether the bridge will stand and id hate to see it go out it wont go out said the engineer confidently maybe youre right but thats what trevor said about his breakwater his work was done and ours isnt hardly begun by the way murray didnt say he had the money he just said he expected to get it go out and hang your crepe on the roundhouse dan told him this is a jubilee if you keep on rejoicing youll have us all in tears when the others had gone he turned to eliza why dont you want oneil to know about that money sis he asked curiously when im a hero i like to be billed as one please she hesitated and turned her face away you you are so stupid about some things on the afternoon of this very day curtis gordon found natalie at a window staring out across the sound in the direction of omar he laid a warm hand upon her shoulder and said my dear confess you are lonesome she nodded silently well well we mustnt allow that why dont you run over to omar and see your friend miss appleton she has a cheerful way with her im afraid things arent very gay over there said natalie doubtfully quite probably but the fact that oneil is on his last legs neednt interfere with your pleasure a change will do you good you are very kind she murmured you have done everything to make me happy but its autumn winter is coming i feel dull and lonely and gray like the sky are you sure mr oneil has failed certainly he tried to sell his holdings to the trust but they refused to consider it poor fellow he continued unctuously now that hes down i pity him one cant dislike a person who has lost the power of working harm his men are quitting i doubt if hell dare show his face in this country again but never mind all that theres a boat leaving for omar in the morning go have a good time return when you will and tell us how they bear up under their adversity he patted her shoulder affectionately and went up to his room it was true enough that natalie had been unhappy since returning to hope not even her mother dreamed how she rebelled at remaining here she was lonely uninterested vaguely homesick she missed the intimate companionship of eliza she missed dans extravagant courting and oneils grave respectful attentions she also felt the loss of the honest goodfellowship of all those people at omar whom she had learned to like and to admire life here was colorless and was still haunted by the shadow of that thing from which she and her mother had fled gordon indeed had been generous to them both since his marriage his attitude had changed entirely he was polite agreeable charmingly devoted no ship arrived without some tangible and expensive evidence of his oftenexpressed desire to make his wife and stepdaughter happy he anticipated their slightest wish under his assiduous attentions natalies distrust and dislike had slowly melted and she came to believe that she had misjudged him there were times when he seemed to be overdoing the matter a bit times when she wondered if his courtesy could be altogether disinterested but these occasions were rare and always she scornfully accused herself of disloyalty as for gloria she was deeply contented as nearly happy in fact as a woman of her temperament could be and in this the daughter took her reward natalie arrived at omar in time to see the full effect of the good news from new york and joined sincerely in the general rejoicing she returned after a few days bursting with the tidings of oneils victory gordon listened to her with keenest attention he drew her out artfully and when he knew what he had sent her to learn he gave voice to his unwelcome surprise jove he snarled that beggar hoodwinked the heidlemanns after all its their money what fools what fools natalie looked up quickly does it affect your plans she asked yes in a way it consolidates my enemies you said you no longer had any ill feeling toward mr oneil gordon had resumed his usual suavity when i say enemies he qualified of course i mean it only in a business sense i heard that the trust had withdrawn discouraged by their losses but now that they reenter the field i shall have to fight them they would have done well to consult me to buy me off rather than be bled by oneil they shall pay well for their mistake but its incredible that man has the luck of the devil that evening he and denny sat with their heads together until a late hour and when they retired gordon had begun to whip new plans into shape xx how gordon changed his attack oneils return to omar was triumphal all his lieutenants gathered to meet him at the pier and the sincerity of their welcome stirred him deeply his arrangements with illis had taken time he had been delayed at seattle by bridge details and the placing of steel contracts he had worked swiftly and with such absorption that he had paid little heed to the rumors of gordons latest activities of the new venture which his own success had inspired he knew only the bare outline he had learned enough however to arouse his curiosity and as soon as the first confusion of his arrival at the front was over he asked for news havent you read the papers inquired happy tom he had attached himself to oneil at the moment of his stepping ashore and now followed him to headquarters with an air of melancholy satisfaction in mere physical nearness to his chief barely oneil confessed ive been working twenty hours a day getting that steel under motion dr gray said with conviction gordon is a remarkable man its a pity hes crooked i think its dam lucky declared tom hes smarter than us and if he wasnt handicapped by a total lack of decency hed beat us after the storm explained gray he moved back to hope and we thought hed made his last bow but in some way he got the idea that the trust was back of us so i judged from the little i read well we didnt undeceive him of course his first move was an attack through the press in the shape of a broadside against the heidlemanns it fairly took our breaths it appeared in the cortez courier and all over the states we hear a letter of defiance to herman heidlemann it declared that the trust was up to its old tricks here in alaska had gobbled the copper had the coal tied up under secret agreements and was trying to get possession of all the coastrange passes and defiles the old story but the man can write that article caused a stir i saw it naturally the cortez people ate it up theyre sore at the trust for leaving their town and at us for building omar then gordon called a massmeeting and some of us went up to watch the fireworks ive never seen anything quite like that meeting every man woman and child in the city was there and they hissed us when we came in gordon knew what he was about and he was in fine voice he told them cortez was the logical point of entry to the interior of alaska and ought to have all the traffic he fired their animosity toward the trust and accused us of basely selling out to it then he broached a project to build by local subscription a narrowgauge electric line from cortez utilizing the waterfalls for power the idea caught on and went like wildfire the people cheered themselves hoarse and pledged him over a hundred thousand dollars that night since then they have subscribed as much more and the town is crazy work has actually begun and they hope to reach the first summit by christmas slater broke in hes a spellbinder all right he made me hate the heidlemanns and detest myself for five minutes i wasnt even sure i liked you murray its a wild scheme of course continued the doctor but hes putting it over the town council has granted him a ninetynineyear lease covering every street the roadbed is started and things are booming lots have been staked all over the flats property values are somersaulting everybody is out of his head and gordon is a god all he does is organize new companies he has bought a sawmill a wharf a machine shop acres of real estate he has started a bank and a new hotel he has consolidated the barber shops and he talks about roofing in the streets with glass and making the town a series of arcades slater half smiled evidence of a convulsive mirth within theyve picked out a site for a university he said bitterly cortez is going to be a seat of learning and culture theyre planning a park and a place for an alaskan worlds fair and a museum and a library ive always wondered who starts public libraries its nuts but i didnt spose more than one or two people got foolish that way oneil drew from his pocket a newspaper five days old which he unfolded and opened at a fullpage advertisement headed cortez home railway this is running in all the coast papers he said and read our platform no promotion shares no construction profits no bonds no incompetence no highsalaried officials no monopoly no passes or rebates no graft of alaska by alaska for alaska there was much more of a similar kind written to appeal to the quickprofitloving public and it was followed by a violent attack upon the trust and an appeal to the people of seattle for assistance at one dollar per share listen to this oneil went on among the original subscribers are the following hotels and saloons of cortez city council prospectors ladies guild of cortez schoolchildren of cortez tom grew red in the face and gave his characteristic snort i dont mind his stringing the city council and the saloons and even the ladies guild he growled but when he steals the licorice and slatepencils from the kids its time he was stopped murray agreed i think we are about done with gordon he has led his ace im not sure this is a kind of popular uprising like a campmeeting if i went to cortez now some prattling schoolgirl would wallop me with her dinnerbucket we cant shake gordon loose hes a regular splavvus what is a splavvus tom inquired dr gray its a real peculiar animal being a cross between a bulldog and a skunk we have lots of em in maine oneil soon found that the accounts he had received of gordons last attempt to recoup his fortunes were in no way exaggerated cortez long the plaything of the railroadbuilders had been ripe for his touch it rose in its wounded civic pride and greeted his appeal with frantic delight it was quite true that the schoolchildren had taken stock in the enterprise their parents turned their own pockets inside out and subscriptions came in a deluge the price of real estate doubled quadrupled and gordon bought just enough to establish the price firmly the money he paid was deposited again in his new bank and he proceeded to use it over and over in maintaining exorbitant prices and in advancing his grandiose schemes his business took him often to seattle where by his whirlwind methods he duplicated his success in a measure his sensational attack upon the money powers got a wide hearing and he finally secured an indorsement of his scheme by the businessmens association this done he opened splendid offices and began a widespread stockflotation campaign soon the cortez home railway became known as a mighty patriotic effort of alaskans to throw off the shackles of oppression gordon perfectly understood that something more than vague accusations were necessary to bring the public to his support in sufficient numbers to sweep him on to victory and with this in mind he laid crafty plans to seize the heidlemann grade the trust had ceased active work on its old rightofway and moved to kyak to be sure but it had not abandoned its original route and in fact had maintained a small crew at the first defile outside of cortez known as beaver canon gordon reasoned shrewdly that a struggle between the agents of the trust and the patriotic citizens of the town would afford him precisely the advertising he needed and give point to his charge of unfair play against the heidlemanns it was not difficult to incite his victims to this act of robbery on the contrary once he had made the suggestion he had hard work to restrain them until he had completed his preparations these preparations were simple they consisted in writing and mailing to every newspaper of consequence a highly colored account of the railroad struggle these mimeographed stories were posted from seattle in time for them to reach their destinations on the date set for the seizure of the grade it was an ingenious publicity move worthy of a theatrical pressagent and it succeeded beyond the promoters fondest expectations too well in fact for it drove the trust in desperation to an alliance with the s r n the day set for the demonstration came the citizens of cortez boldly marched into beaver canon to take possession of the old heidlemann workings but it appeared that they had reckoned prematurely a handful of grimfaced trust employees warned them back there was a rush some rough work on the part of the aggressors and then the guards brought their weapons into play the result afforded gordon far more sensational material than he had hoped for one citizen was killed and five others were badly wounded cortez dazed and horrorstricken arose in her wrath and descended upon the assassins lynchings were planned and mobs threatened the local jail until soldiers were hurried thither and martial law was declared of course the wires were burdened with the accounts the reading public of the states awoke to the fact that a bitter strife was waging in the north between honest miners and the soulless heidlemann syndicate gordons previously written and carefully colored stories of the clash were printed far and wide editorials breathed indignation at such lawlessness and pointed to the cortez home railway as a commendable effort to destroy the heidlemann throttlehold upon the northland stock subscriptions came in a deluge which fairly engulfed gordons seattle office force during this brief whitehot campaign the promoter had been actuated as much by his senseless hatred of oneil as by lust of glory and gain and it was with no little satisfaction that he returned to alaska conscious of having dealt a telling blow to his enemy he sent natalie to omar on another visit in order that he might hear at first hand how oneil took the matter but his complacency received a shock when the girl returned he had no need to question her uncle curtis she began excitedly you ought to stop these terrible newspaper stories about mr oneil and the trust stop them my dear what do you mean he didnt sell out to the trust he has nothing to do with it what gordons incredulity was a challenge he sold to an englishman named illis they seem to be amused by your mistake over there at omar but i think some of the things printed are positively criminal i knew youd want the truth the truth yes but this cant be true stammered gordon it is mr oneil did try to interest the heidlemanns but they wouldnt have anything to do with him and the s r n was going to smash when mr illis came along barely in time it was too exiting and dramatic for anything the way mr oneil found him when he was in hiding hiding yes there was something about blackmail or a secret arrangement between mr illis and the yukon river lines i couldnt understand just what it was but anyhow murray took advantage of it and saved the north pass and the s r n at the same time it was really a perfectly wonderful stroke of genius i determined a once that you should stop these lies and correct the general idea that he is in the pay of the trust why he went to cortez last week and they threatened his life mrs gordon who had listened said quietly dont blame curtis for that that bloody affray at beaver canyon has made cortez bitter against every one connected with the heidlemanns what about this blackmail said her husband upon whose ear the word had made a welcome impression i dont understand what you mean by oneils saving the north pass and his own road at the same time nor illiss being in hiding neither do i natalie confessed but i know you have made a mistake that ought to be set right why doesnt he come out with the truth the whole thing is secret why natalie shrugged hopelessly and gordon lost himself in frowning thought this is amazing he said brusquely after a moment its vital it affects all my plans i must know everything at once im sorry i paid so little attention never mind try it again and be diplomatic if oneil wont tell you question appleton you can wind him around your fingers easily enough the girl eyed him with a quick change of expression isnt it enough to know that the trust has nothing to do with the s r n no he declared impatiently i must know the whole inside of this secret understanding this blackmail or whatever it is then im sorry come dont be silly you can do me a great service you said you no longer disliked mr oneil and that he couldnt harm you well well must i explain the whys and wherefores of every move i make it would be spying if i went back the matter is confidential i know that will you do as i ask he demanded natalie answered him firmly no i told you what i did tell you only so that you might correct you rebel eh gordon spoke out furiously it was their first clash since the marriage mrs gordon looked on torn between loyalty to her husband and a desire to protect her daughter she was searching her mind painfully for the compromise the halftruth that was her remedy for every moral distress at length she said placatingly im sure natalie will help you in any way she can curtis she isnt rebellious she merely doesnt understand she doesnt need to understand it is enough that i direct her as natalie turned and walked silently to the window he stifled an oath have i no authority he stormed do you mean to obey wait gloria laid a restraining hand on his arm perhaps i can learn what you want to know mr oneil was very kind her daughter whirled with white face and flashing eyes mother she gasped our loyalty begins at home said gloria feebly ohh i cant conceive of your of such a thing if you have no decency i have im sorry i spoke but if you dare to do such a thing i shall warn mr oneil that you are a spy she turned a glance of loathing on gordon i see she said quietly you used me as a tool you lied about your feeling toward him you meant harm to him all the time she faced the window again lied he shouted be careful thats pretty strong language dont try me too far or you may find yourself adrift once more i have been too patient but i have other ways of finding out what i wish to know and i shall verify what you have told me he strode angrily from the room leaving natalie staring out upon the bleak fall scene her shoulders very straight her breast heaving gloria did not venture to address her fortunately for the peace of all concerned gordon left for seattle on the next steamer neither of the women believed that natalies fragmentary revelation was the cause of his departure but once in touch with outside affairs he lost no time in running down the clues he had gathered and it was not long before he had learned enough to piece the truth together then he once more brought his mimeograph into use xxi dan appleton slips the leash the first winter snows found oneils track laid to the bridge site and the structure itself well begun he had moved his office out to the front and now saw little of eliza who was busied in writing her book she had finished her magazine articles and they had been accepted but she had given him no hint as to their character one afternoon happy tom burst in upon his chief having hastened out from omar on a constructiontrain drawing a seattle paper from his pocket he began excitedly well the fats in the fire murray somebody has belched up the whole north pass story oneil seized the newspaper and scanned it hurriedly he looked up scowling who gave this out he inquired in a harsh voice slater shrugged its in the cortez courier too so i spose it came from gordon blessings come from one source and gordons the fountain of all evil im getting so i blame him for everything unpleasant sometimes i think he gave me the smallpox where did he learn the inside of illiss deal by god theres a leak somewhere maybe he uncovered it back there in the states murray shook his head nobody knows anything about it except you boys he seized the telephone at his elbow and called dr gray while tom listened with his shining forehead puckered anxiously oneil hung up with a black face appleton he said tom looked if possible a shade gloomier than usual i wouldnt be too sure it was dan if i was you he ventured doubtfully where is he oneil ground out the words between his teeth surveying the townsite addition if he let anything slip it was by mistake mistake i wont employ people who make mistakes of that kind this story may bring the canadian government down on illis and forfeit his north pass charter to say nothing of our authorities that would finish us he rose went to the door and ordered the recently arrived engine uncoupled flinging himself into his fur coat he growled id rather have a crook under me than a fool appleton told us he talked too much tom pursed his lips thoughtfully gordon got it through the gerard girl i spose gordon gordon will there never be an end to gordon his frown deepened hes in the way tom if he balks this deal im afraid ill have to change ghosts it would be a pious act slater declared and his ghost wouldnt hant you none either it would put on its asbestos overshoes and go out among the other shades selling stock in electric fans or gordons arctic toboggan slide hed promote a purgatory development company and underwrite the bottomless pit for its sulphur i id hate to think this came from dan the locomotive had been switched out by this time and oneil hurried to board it on his way to omar he had time thoroughly to weigh the results of this unexpected complication his present desire was merely to verify his suspicion that appleton had told his secret to natalie beyond that he did not care to think for there was but one course open his anger reached the blazingpoint after his arrival as he stepped down from the enginecab gray silently handed him a code message from london which had arrived a few moments before when its contents had been deciphered oneil cursed and he was furious as he stumbled through the dark toward the green bungalow on the hill swinging round the corner of the house he came into a bright radiance which streamed forth from elizas window and he could not help seeing the interior of the room she was there writing busily and he saw that she was clad in the elaborate kimono which he had given her yet it was not her personal appearance which arrested his angry eyes and caused his step to halt it was instead her surroundings he had grown to accept her prim simplicity as a matter of course and never associated her in his thoughts with anything feminine but the room as it lay before him now was a revelation of daintiness and artful decoration tasteful watercolors hung on the walls a warm rug was on the floor and everywhere were rosy touches of color the plain white bed had been transformed into a couch of oriental luxury a lace spread of weblike texture covered it the pillows were hidden beneath billowing masses of ruffles and ribbons he saw a typical womans cozy corner piled high with cushions there was a jar of burning incense sticks near it everything in fact was utterly at variance with his notions of the owner even the girl herself seemed transfigured for her hair was brought forward around her face in some loose mysterious fashion which gave her a bewilderingly girlish appearance as he looked in upon her she raised her face so that the light shone full upon it her brows were puckered she nibbled at the end of her pencil in the midst of some creative puzzle oneils eyes photographed all this in a single surprised glance as he passed the next moment he was mounting the steps to the porch dan flung open the door but his words of greeting froze his smile of welcome vanished at sight of his chiefs forbidding visage murray was in no mood to waste words he began roughly did you tell miss gerard that poultney illis is backing me dan stammered i perhaps i what has gone wrong chief did you tell her the inside the story of his agreement with the steamboat people dan paled beneath his tan but his eyes met murrays without flinching i think i did tell her something i dont quite remember but anything i may have said was in confi i thought so i merely wished to make certain well the whole thing is in the papers appleton laid his hand upon the table to steady himself then it didnt come from her she wouldnt gordon has spread the story broadcast it couldnt have come from any other source it couldnt have reached him in any other way for none of my boys has breathed a word his voice rose despite his effort at selfcontrol illiss agreement was illegal he said savagely it will probably forfeit the charter of the north pass or land him in court i suppose you realize that i discovered his secret and assured him it was safe with me now you peddle it to gordon and the whole thing is public heres the first result he shook the london cablegram in dans face and his own was distorted with rage there was a stir in elizas room which neither noticed appleton wiped his face with uncertain hand he moistened his lips to say i im terribly sorry but im sure natalie wouldnt spy i dont remember what i told her or how i came to know about the affair doc gray told me i think in the first excitement but god she wouldnt knowingly gordon fired you for talking too much i thought you had learned your lesson but it seems you hadnt dont blame miss gerard for pumping you her loyalty belongs to gordon now but i require loyalty too since you lack it you can go oneil turned as elizas door opened she stood before him pale frightened trembling i couldnt help hearing she said you discharge us he nodded im sorry ive trusted my boys so implicitly that the thought of betrayal by them never occurred to me i cant have men close to me who make such mistakes as this perhaps there was an excuse or the shadow of one at least when a man is in love you know murray wheeled upon dan and demanded sharply whats this then in a noticeably altered tone he asked do you love natalie yes does she love you no sir oneil turned back to the girl saying i told dan when i hired him that he would be called upon to dare much to suffer much and that my interests must be his he has disregarded them and he must go thats all theres little difference between treachery and carelessness its too bad said the girl faintly dan stood stiff and silent wholly dazed by the sudden collapse of his fortunes im not ungrateful for what youve done appleton oneil went on i intend to pay you well for the help you gave me you took a chance at the canon and at gordons crossing youll get a check i dont want your damned money the other gulped ive drawn my wages nevertheless i shall pay you well its highly probable that youve wrecked the s r n and ruined me but i dont intend to forget my obligations to you its unfortunate call on the cashier in the morning good night he left them standing there unhappily dumb and stiff with shame once outside the house he plunged down the hill as if fleeing from the scene of some crime he rushed through the night blindly for he had loved his assistant engineer and the memory of that chalkfaced startled girl hurt him abominably when he came to the company office he was walking slowly heavily he found gray inside and dropped into a chair his face was grimly set and he listened dully to the physicians rambling talk i fired appleton he broke out at last gray looked up quickly he acknowledged that he did it i had no choice it came hard though hes a good boy he did some great work chief i know that affair at the crossing i intend to pay him well if hell accept its not that i like those kids stanley eliza took it harder than he it wasnt easy for me either he sighed wearily id give ten thousand dollars if it hadnt happened she looked as if id struck her what did they say nothing he has been careless disloyal you told them so oneil nodded and they said nothing nothing what could they say gray answered gruffly they might have said a good deal they might have told you how they paid off your men and saved a walkout when i had no money oneil stared incredulously what are you talking about he demanded when he had the facts he rose with an exclamation of dismay god why didnt you tell me why didnt they speak out i i why thats loyalty of the finest kind all the money they had saved too when they thought i had failed jove that was fine oh im sorry i wonder what they think of me i cant let dan go after that i he seized his cap and hurried out of the building its hardly right when things were going so well too said dan he was sitting crumpled up in a chair elizas arm encircling his shoulders i didnt mean to give up any secrets but im not myself when im with natalie we must take our medicine his sister told him gravely we deserve it for this story may spoil all hes done i didnt think it of her though dan groaned and bowed his head in his hands i dont know which hurts worse he said his anger or her action she couldnt do such a thing sis she just couldnt she probably didnt realize she hasnt much sense you know but after all hes suffered to think that we should injure him i could cry i think i shall the door opened before a rough hand and oneil strode into the room huge shaggy in his coonskin coat they rose startled but he came to them swiftly a look of mingled shame and gladness in his face ive come back to apologize he cried i couldnt wait ive learned what you children did while i was gone and ive come to beg forgiveness its all right its all right i dont know what you mean dan gasped doc told me how you paid those men that was real friendship it was splendid it touched me and i i want to apologize you see i hurried right back they saw that his eyes were moist and at the sight eliza gave a quivering cry then turned swiftly to hide her face she felt oneils furclad arm about her shoulder his hand was patting her and he was saying gently you are a dear child it was tremendously good of you both and i ought to be shot for acting as i did i wonder if you can accept a wretched apology as bravely as you accepted a wrong accusation it wasnt wrong it was right she sobbed dan told her and she told gordon there there i was to blame after all for letting any one know and if dan made a mistake he has more than offset it by his unselfishness his sacrifices it seems i forgot how much i really owe him that affair with the shift bosses wasnt anything said dan hastily and it was all elizas idea i refused at first but when she started to pay them herself i weakened he stuttered awkwardly for his sister was motioning him desperately to be silent but he ran on oh he ought to know the whole truth and how rotten i acted sis i deserve to be discharged please dont make this any harder for me than it is murray smiled im terribly embarrassed for im not used to apologies i cant afford to be unjust i have so few friends that i want to cherish them im sorry you saw me in such a temper anger is a treacherous thing and it always betrays me lets forget that i was here before and pretend that i just came to thank you for what you did he drew dan into the shelter of his other arm and pressed the two young people to him i didnt realize how deeply you kids care for each other and for me then im not fired dan queried doubtfully of course not when i take time to think about discharging a man i invariably end by raising his salary dan isnt worth half what youre paying him came elizas muffled voice she freed herself from murrays embrace and rearranged her hair with tremulous fingers surreptitiously she wiped her eyes you gave us an awful fright its terrible to be evicted in wintertime she tried to laugh but the attempt failed miserably just the same when a man contemplates marriage he must have money i dont want your blamed money dan blurted and it doesnt cost anything to contemplate marriage thats all im doing just looking at it from a distance perhaps i can help you to prevail on miss natalie to change her mind that would be a real service wouldnt it under his grave glance dans heart leaped i cant believe shes indifferent to you my boy youre suited to each other and theres no reason on earth why you shouldnt marry perhaps she doesnt know her own mind youre mighty good but the lover shook his head murray smiled again i think youre too timid dont plead and beg just carry her off be firm and masterful be rough the idea exclaimed eliza shes no cavewoman exactly if she were dan would need to court her and send her bouquets of wild violets shes overcivilized and therefore he needs to be primitive dan blushed and faltered i cant be firm with her murray i turn to jelly whenever she looks at me there was something so friendly and kind in his employers attitude that the young fellow was tempted to pour out all his vexations he had never felt so close to oneil as now but his masculine reserve could not be overcome all in a moment and he held his tongue when murray had put the two young people fully at their ease he rose to go but elizas eager voice made him turn with his hand on the doorknob what can we do about this unfortunate illis affair she asked dan must try to leave that to me ill straighten it out somehow it is all my fault and ill have to meet it he pressed their hands warmly when he had gone dan heaved a great sigh of relief im glad it happened just as it did sis he announced he knows my secret now and i can see that he never cared for natalie its a load off my mind to know the track is clear what a simpleton you are she told him dont you see hes merely paying his debt i wonder dan eyed her in amazement gee if thats so he is a prince isnt he the same ship which had brought the ominous news to oneil also brought curtis gordon north he had remained in seattle only long enough to see the illis story in print and then had hastened back to the front but his satisfaction over the mischief he had done received a rude jolt when at his first moment of leisure he looked over the late magazines which he had bought before taking leave in one which had appeared on the newsstands that very day he found to his amazement an article by miss eliza appleton in which his own picture appeared he pounced upon it eagerly and then as he read his eyes narrowed and his jaw stiffened there spread out to the public gaze was his own record in full including his initial venture into the kyak coalfields his abandonment of that project in favor of hope consolidated and an account of his connection with the latter enterprise eliza had not hesitated to call the mine worthless and she showed how he knowing its worthlessness from the first had used it as a lure to investors then followed the story of his efforts to gain a foothold in the railroad struggle his defeat at the salmon river canon his rout at the delta crossing and his final deathblow at kyak his career stood out boldly in all its fraudulent colors failure was written across every one of his undertakings the naked facts showed him visionary incompetent unscrupulous thus far he had succeeded in keeping a large part of his stockholders in ignorance of the true condition of hope consolidated but he quailed at the inevitable result of this article which had been flung far and wide into every city and village in the land he dared not think of its effect upon his present enterprise now so auspiciously launched he had made a ringing appeal to the public and its support would hinge upon its confidence in him as a man of affairs once that trust was destroyed the cortez home railway would crumble as swiftly as had all his other schemes the worst of it was that he knew himself shut off from the world for five days as effectually as if he were locked in a dungeon there was no wireless equipment on the ship he could not start the machinery of his press bureau and with every hour this damnable story was bound to gain momentum he cursed the luck which had set him on this quest for vengeance and bound his hands once he had gathered his wits he occupied himself in the only possible way by preparing a story of his own for the wire but for the first time in his experience he found himself upon the defensive and opposing a force against which no bland persuasiveness no personal magnetism could prevail in the scattered nature of his support lay his greatest weakness for it made the task of selfjustification extremely difficult perhaps it was well for his peace of mind that he could not measure the full effect of those forces which eliza appletons pen had set in motion in omar of course the article excited lively interest oneil felt a warm thrill of satisfaction as he read it on the morning after his scene with eliza and dan but it deepened his feeling of obligation almost painfully for like all who are thoughtlessly prodigal of their own favors he was deeply sensible of any kindness done himself elizas dignified exposition of alaskan affairs and particularly the agreeable things she had written about him were sure to be of great practical assistance he knew and he longed to make some real return but so far as she was concerned there seemed to be nothing that he could do with dan of course it was quite different mere money or advancement he admitted seemed paltry but there was a possibility of another kind of service meanwhile dan was struggling with his problem in his own way the possibility that natalie had voluntarily betrayed him was a racking torture and the remembrance of elizas words added to his suffering he tried to gain some hint of his chiefs feeling but murrays frank and friendly attitude baffled him when at last he received a brief note from natalie asking him to call he raced to hope afraid yet eager to hear what she might say she met him on the dock as he left the s r n motorboat and led him directly to the house natalie went straight to the point im in dreadful trouble she said and i sent for you to tell you that i had no idea of betraying confidences dan uttered some inane platitude but his eyes lighted with relief when i saw in the papers what a stir that north pass yukon story had made i was afraid i had done something dreadful tell me is it so did i make trouble you certainly did oneil was furious and nobody knows yet what the result will be it it nearly cost me my head does he blame me nno he says youre on gordons side now he blames me or did until he generously took it on himself what does it all mean im nearly distracted natalies eyes were pleading did you think i spied on you dan glowed with embarrassment and something more i didnt know what to think he said i was wretchedly miserable for i was afraid and yet i knew you couldnt do such a thing i told oneil i wasnt responsible for what i did or said when with you mr gordon sent me to omar purposely he sent me twice it was i who brought him word that the road was saved i told all id learned because i believed he no longer hated mr oneil i was happy to tell all i knew for he deceived me as he deceives every one i learned the truth too late why do you stay here dan demanded hotly why i dont know perhaps because im afraid to leave im alone you see mother believes in him shes completely under his sway and i cant tell her the sort of man he is shes happy and her happiness is worth more to me than my own but i shall go away i cant stand it here much longer where will you go back to my old home perhaps somewhere anywhere away from alaska i suppose you know i cant get along without you please dont you have been very good and sweet to me but she shook her dark head you couldnt marry me even if i cared for you in that way why i intend to marry you whether you want to or not oh dan it wouldnt do you know about mother ive nearly died of shame and it would be sure to come up somebody would speak of it sometime dans blue eyes went cold and smoky as he said it would take a pretty brave person to mention the subject in my presence i dont care a whoop for anything gordon or your family may say or do i there was a stir in the hall outside and the speaker turned to behold curtis gordon himself in the doorway the latter in passing had been drawn by the sound of voices and had looked into the library recognizing natalies caller he frowned what is this he inquired coldly a proposal do i interrupt you do said dan then after a pause ill finish it when you leave gordon entered and spoke to his stepdaughter what is this man doing in my house he is here at my invitation she replied tell him to leave i wont have him here why dont you tell me cried dan i dont need an interpreter young man dont be rash there is a limit to my patience if you have the indecency to come here after what you have done and after what your sister has said about me i shall certainly dan broke in roughly i didnt come to see you gordon you may be an agreeable sight to some people but youre no golden sunset in my eyes eliza flattered you natalie gave a little terrified cry for the men were glaring at each other savagely neither seemed to hear her did you read that article read it i wrote it gordons face flamed suddenly with rage he pointed to the door with trembling fingers and shouted get out ill not have you here i discharged you once get out his utterance was rapid and thick dan smiled mirthlessly dangerously in a soft voice he said i havent finished proposing i expect to be accepted youll pardon me i know will you go you dan turned to the girl who after that first outcry had stood as if spellbound her face pale her eyes shining natalie dear he said earnestly you cant live in the same house with this beast hes a cheat and a scoundrel hes done his best to spoil your life and hell succeed if you stay so come with me now eliza loves you and wants you and ill never cease loving you with all my heart marry me and well go gordon uttered an inarticulate sound and came forward with his hands working hungrily dont interrupt warned dan over his shoulder and his white teeth gleamed in sudden contrast with his tan no man could love you as i do dear gordons clutch fell upon him and tightened dan stiffened and his words ceased then the touch upon his flesh became unbearable whirling he wrenched himself free he was like a wild animal now body and spirit had leaped into rebellion at contact with gordon his long resentment burst its bounds his lean muscles quivered his frame trembled as if it restrained some tremendous pressure from within dont do that he cried hoarsely and brushed the sleeve where his enemys fingers had rested as if it had been soiled gordon snarled and stretched out his hand a second time but the younger man raised his fist and struck once twice again and again he flung his bony knuckles into that purple distorted face which he loathed as a thing unclean he battered down the big mans guard right and left he rained blows stepping forward as his victim fell back gordon reeled he pawed wildly he swung his arms but they encountered nothing yet he was a heavy man and although half stunned by the sudden onslaught he managed to retain his feet until he brought up against the heavy mahogany readingtable in the center of the room his retreat ended there another blow and his knees buckled his arms sagged then dan summoned all his strength and swung gordon groaned lurched forward and sprawled upon the warm red velvet carpet face down with his limbs twisted under him his vanquisher stood over him for an instant then turned upon natalie a face that was now keen and cruel and predatory come well be married today he said and crossing swiftly he took her two hands in his his voice was harsh and imperative hes down and out so dont be frightened now hurry ive had enough of this damned nonsense i im not frightened she said dazedly but i her eyes roved past him as if in quest of something here thisll do for a wrap dan whipped his fur overcoat from a chair and flung it about her my hat too he crushed his gray stetson over her dark hair and slipping his arm about her shoulders urged her toward the hall mother shell never well call on her together ill do the talking for both of us he jerked the front door open with a force that threatened to wrench it from its hinges and thrust his companion out into the bracing cold then as gordons japanese butler came running from the rear of the house he turned hey you he cried sharply the boss has gone on a little visit dont stumble over him and tell mrs gordon that mr and mrs appleton will call on her in a few days mr and mrs dan appleton of omar it was but a few steps to the pier dan felt that he was treading on air for the fierce unreasoning joy of possession was surging through his veins his old indecision and doubt was gone and the men he met recoiled before his hostile glance staring after him in bewilderment but as he lifted natalie down into the launch he felt her shaking violently and of a sudden his selfish exultation gave way to a tender solicitude there there he said gently dont cry honey its all right its all right she raised her face to his and his head swam for he saw that she was radiant im not crying im laughing i im mad insane with happiness he crushed her to him he buried his face in her neck mumbling her name over and over and neither of them knew that he was rapturously kissing the coonskin collar of his own greatcoat the launchman motor crank in hand paused staring he was still openmouthed when dan catching sight of him shouted whats the matter idiot is your back broken yes no sir the fellow spun the flywheel vigorously the little craft began to vibrate and quiver and then swung out from shore a moment later and the engineman yelled he came stumbling forward and seized the steeringwheel as the boat grazed a buoy thats right you steer dan laughed relaxing his hold to natalie he said theres a skypilot in omar and pressed her to him its a long way to omar she answered then hid her face against his breast and said meekly theres one in cortez too and hes much nearer xxii how the hazard was played elizas greeting to the runaways was as warm as their hearts could wish she divined the truth before they could speak and took natalie in her arms with a glad cry of welcome the two girls kissed each other wept laughed wept a little more kissed again and then the story came out dan was plainly swollen with pride i walloped him sis he told her i got even for the whole family and i believe his eyes are closed even to the beauties of nature he wont be able to read the weddingnotice eliza hugged his arm and looked at him adoringly it must have been perfectly splendid natalie nodded i was asleep she said but dan shocked me wide awake can you imagine it i didnt know my own feelings until he went for that brute then i knew all at once that i had loved him all the time isnt it funny it came over me so suddenly i i cant realize that hes mine she turned her eyes upon him with an expression that made his chest swell proudly gee he exclaimed if id known how she felt id have pitched into the first fellow i met a mans an awful fool till he gets married there followed a recital of the days incidents zestful full of happy digressions endless for the couple after the manner of lovers took it for granted that eliza was caught up into the seventh heaven along with them dan was drunk with delight and his bride seemed dizzied by the change which had overtaken her she looked upon it as miraculous almost unbelievable and under the spell of her happiness her real self asserted itself those cares and humiliations which had reacted to make her cold and selfcontained disappeared giving place to an impetuous girlishness that distracted her newly made husband and delighted eliza the last lingering doubts that dans sister had cherished were cleared away it was not until the bride had been banished to prepare for dinner that eliza thought to ask her brother have you told mr oneil the triumph faded suddenly out of his face gee no i havent told anybody they stared at each other reading the thoughts they had no need to voice well ive done it its too late now said dan defiantly maybe hell fire us again i would if i were he you must tell him this very minute i suppose so he agreed reluctantly and picked up his hat and yet i i wonder if id better after all dont you think it would sound nicer coming from some one else why wouldnt it seem like crowing for me to to for instance now if you coward exclaimed the girl he nodded but sis you do have a nicer way of putting things than i have why i wouldnt tell him for worlds i couldnt poor man weve brought him nothing but sorrow and bad luck its fierce well dont hesitate thats what gordon did and he got licked dan scowled and set his features in a brave show of moral courage shes mine and he cant take her away he vowed so i dont care what happens but id just as soon slap a baby in the face he left the house like a man under sentence when he returned a halfhour later eliza was awaiting him on the porch she had been standing there with chattering teeth and limbs shaking from the cold while the minutes dragged what did he say she asked breathlessly it went off finely thank heaven he was out at the front so i could break it to him over the phone did he curse you no i opened right up by saying i had bad news for him oh dan yes i dare say i wasnt very tactful now that i think it over but you see i was rattled i spilled out the whole story at once bad news said he my dear boy im delighted god bless you both then he made me tell him how it all happened and listened without a word i thought id faint he pulled some gag about daniel and the lion then his voice got far away and the blamed wire began to buzz so i hung up and beat it back here im glad its over hell probably send you a solidsilver dinnerset or raise your pay thats the kind of man he is elizas voice broke oh danny she cried hes the dearest sweetest thing she turned away and he kissed her sympathetically before going inside to the waiting natalie instead of following eliza remained on the porch gazing down at the lights of the little city an engine with its row of empty flats rolled into the yard panting from its exertions the notes of a piano came to her faintly from the street below the lights of an incoming steamer showed far down the sound oneil had made all this she reflected the busy town the hopeful thousands who came and went daily owed their prosperity to him he had made the wilderness fruitful but what of his own life she suspected that it was as bleak and barren as the mountain slopes above omar he too looked down upon this thriving intimate little community but from a distance beneath his unfailing cheerfulness she felt sure there lurked a hunger which the mere affection of his boys could never satisfy and now the thought that dan had come between him and his hearts desire filled her with pity he seemed suddenly a very lonely figure of a man despite his material success when his enemies were doing had already done so much to defeat him it seemed unfair that his trusted friend should step between him and the fulfilment of his dearest ambition that ambition common to all men failure in which brings a sense of failure to a mans whole life no matter what other ends are achieved of course he would smile and swallow his bitterness that was his nature but she would know the truth poor omar khayyam she thought wistfully i wish there were love enough in the world for you i wish there were two natalies or that then she shook the dream from her mind and went into the house for the night was cold and she was shaking wretchedly oneil behaved more handsomely even than eliza had anticipated he hurried into town on the following morning and his congratulations were so sincere his manner so hearty that dan forgot his embarrassment and took a shameless delight in advertising his happiness nor did murray stop with mere words he summoned all his lieutenants and omar rang that night with a celebration such as it had never before known the company chef had been busy all day the commissary had been ransacked and the weddingsupper was of a nature to interfere with office duties for many days thereafter tom slater made a congratulatory speech in reality a mournful adjuration to avoid the pitfalls of matrimonial inharmony and openly confessed that his digestion was now impaired beyond relief others followed him there was music laughter a riotous popping of corks and over it all oneil presided with grace and mellowness then after the two young people had been made thoroughly to feel his good will he went back to the front and omar saw him but seldom in the weeks that followed to romantic eliza this selfsought seclusion had but one meaning the man was brokenhearted she did not consider that there might be other reasons for his constant presence at the glaciers of course since the unwelcome publication of the north pass yukon story oneil had been in close touch with illis and by dint of strong argument had convinced the englishman of his own innocence in the affair a vigorous investigation might have proved disastrous but fortunately curtis gordon lacked leisure in which to follow the matter up the truth was that after his public exposure at elizas hands he was far too busy mending his own fences to spare time for attempts upon his rival consequently the story was allowed to die out and oneil was finally relieved to learn that its effect had been killed precisely how illis had effected this he did not know nor did he care to inquire illis had been forced into an iniquitous bargain and since he had taken the first chance to free himself from it the question of abstract right or wrong was not a subject for squeamish consideration it was at about this time that the sanguinary affray at beaver canon began to bear fruit one day a keenfaced quiet stranger presented a card at murrays office with the name henry t blaine beneath was the address of the heidlemann building in new york but otherwise the card told nothing something in mr blaines bearing however led murray to treat him with more than ordinary consideration i should like to go over your work the stranger announced and oneil himself acted as guide together they inspected the huge concrete abutments then were lowered into the heart of the giant caissons which protruded from the frozen stream the salmon lay locked in its winter slumber now the glaciers stood as silent and inactive as the snowmantled mountains that hemmed them in down into the very bowels of the river the men descended while oneil described the nature of the bottom the depth and character of his foundations and the measure of his progress he explained the character of that bar which lay above the bridge site and pointed out the heavy layers of railroad iron with which his cement work was reinforced i spent nearly two seasons studying this spot before i began the bridge he continued i had men here night and day observing the currents and the action of the ice then i laid my piers accordingly they are armored and reinforced to withstand any shock the river is subject to quick rises i believe suggested blaine twenty feet in a few hours the volley of ice must be almost irresistible almost murray smiled not quite our icebreakers were especially designed by parker to withstand any weight theres nothing like them anywhere in fact there will be nothing like this bridge when its completed blaine offered no comment but his questions searched to the depths of the builders knowledge when they were back in camp he said of course you know why im here your card told me that but i dont need the heidlemanns now we are prepared to reopen negotiations why my people are human they have feelings you read gordons lies about us and about that fight at beaver canon well were used to abuse and opposition of a kind we respect but that man stirred public opinion to such a point that theres no further use of heeding it were ready to proceed with our plans now and the public can go to the devil till it understands us better we have several men in jail at cortez charged with murder it will cost us a fortune to free the poor fellows first the heidlemanns were thieves and grafters and looters of the public domain now they have become assassins if this route to the interior proves feasible well and good if not well resume work at cortez next spring kyak of course is out of the question this route depends upon the bridge exactly its a two years job you offered to complete it this winter when you talked with mr herman heidlemann and i can then well consider a reasonable price but we must know definitely where we stand by next spring we have a great deal of capital tied up in the interior we cant wait this delay will cost you something mr blaine shrugged you made that point plain when you were in new york were accustomed to pay for our mistakes will you cover this in the shape of an option thats what im here for if you finish your bridge and it stands the spring breakup well be satisfied i shall expect to stay here and watch the work oneil agreed heartily youre very welcome mr blaine i like your brand of conversation i build railroads i dont run them now lets get down to figures the closing of the option required several weeks of course but the outcome was that even before midwinter arrived oneil found himself in the position he had longed to occupy in effect the sale was made and on terms which netted him and his backers one hundred per cent profit there was but one proviso namely that the bridge should be built by spring the heidlemanns were impatient their investment up to date had been heavy and they frankly declared that failure to bridge the chasm on time would convince them that the task was hopeless in a way this was unreasonable but oneil was well aware that they could not permit delay or a third failure unless his route was proved feasible without loss of time they would abandon it for one they knew to be certain even though more expensive he did not argue that the task was of unprecedented difficulty for he had made his promise and was ready to stand or fall by it it is doubtful however if any other contractor would have undertaken the work on such time in fact had it been a public bridge it would have required four years in the building yet oneil cheerfully staked his fortune on completing it in eight months with his option signed and the task squarely confronting him he realized with fresh force its bigness and the weight of responsibility that rested upon his shoulders he began the most dramatic struggle of his career a fight against untried conditions a desperate race against the seasons with ruin as the penalty of defeat the channel of the salmon at this point is fifteen hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep through it boils a tenmile current in other words the waters race by with the speed of a running man over this oneil expected to suspend a structure capable of withstanding the mightiest strains to which any bridge had ever been subjected parkers plans called for seventeen thousand yards of cement work and nine million pounds of steel every part of which must be fabricated to a careful pattern it was a mansized job and oneil was thankful that he had prepared so systematically for the work that he had gathered his materials with such extraordinary care supplies were arriving now in carloads in trainloads in shiploads from seattle from vancouver from far pittsburg they came in a thin continuous stream any interruption of which meant confusion and serious loss of time the movement of this vast tonnage required the ceaseless attention of a corps of skilled men he had personally directed affairs up to this point but he now obliterated himself and the leadership devolved upon two others parker small smiling gentlemannered mellen tall angular saturnine upon them engineer and bridgebuilder oneil rested his confidence serene in the knowledge that of all men they were the ablest in their lines as for himself he had all he could do to bring materials to them and to keep the long supplytrail open long it was indeed for the shortest haul was from seattle twelve hundred miles away and the steel bridge members came from pennsylvania the piers at omar groaned beneath the cargoes that were belched from the big freighters incidentally happy tom slater likewise groaned beneath his burdens as superintendent of transportation at the glaciers a city as large as omar sprang up a city with electric lights powerhouses machine shops freight yards and long rows of winter quarters it lay behind ramparts of coal of grillage timbers and piling of shedded cement barrels and tons of steel over it the winter snows sifted the north winds howled and the arctic cold deepened here locked in a mountain fastness more than a thousand miles from his base of supplies oneil began the decisive struggle of his life here at the focusing point of his enterprise in the white heat of the battle he spent his time heedless of every other interest or consideration the shifts were lengthened wages were increased a system of bonuses was adopted only picked men were given places but of these there were hundreds over them the grimfaced mellen brooded with the fevered eye of a fanatic and a tongue of flame wherever possible the men were sheltered and steampipes were run to guard against the cold but most of the labor was of necessity performed in the open and under trying conditions at times the wind blew a hurricane always there was the bitter cold men toiled until their flesh froze and their tools slipped from their fingers then dragged themselves stiffly into huts and warmed themselves for further effort they worked amid a boiling snowsmother that hid them from view while gravel and fine ice cut their faces like knives or again on still sharp days when the touch of metal was like the bite of fangs and echoes filled the valley to the brim with an empty clanging but they were no ordinary fellows no chaff to drift with the wind they were men toughened by exposure to the breath of the north men winnowed out from many thousands of their kind nor were they driven they were led mellen was among them constantly so was the softvoiced smiling parker not to mention oneil with his cheery laugh and his words of praise yet often it was hard to keep the work moving at all for steam condensed in the cylinders valves froze unless constantly operated pipes were kept open only by the use of hot cloths then too the snow crept upward steadily stealthily until it lay in heavy drifts which nearly hid the little town and changed the streets to miniature canons out of this snowsmothered frostbound valley there was but one trail the army lay encamped in a cul de sac all that connected it with the outside world were two slender threads of steel to keep them clear of snow was in itself a giants task for as yet there were no snowsheds and in many places the constructiontrains passed through deep cuts between solid walls of white every wind filled these level and threatened to seal the place fast but furiously the rotaries attacked the choking mass slowly it was whirled aside and onward flowed that steady stream of supplies no army of investment was ever in such constant peril of being cut off for every man engaged in the attack there was another behind him fighting back the allied forces which swept down from either hand only those who know that far land in her sterner moods can form any conception of the stupefying effect of continuous unbroken cold there is a point beyond which the power of reaction ceases where the human mind and body recoils uncontrollably from exposure and where the most robust effort results in a spiritless inactivity it is then that efficiency is cut in half then cut again and of all the terrors of the arctic there is none so compelling as the wind it is a monstrous deathly thing a creature that has life and preys upon the agony of men there are regions sheltered from it of course but in the gutters which penetrate the mountain ranges it lurks with constant menace and of all the coast from sitka westward the valley of the salmon is the most evil in the throat of this mightymouthed funnel joining the still abysmal cold of the interior with the widely varying temperatures of the open sea oneils band was camped and there the great hazard was played under such conditions it was fortunate indeed that he had fieldmarshals like parker and mellen for no single man could have triumphed parker was cautious brilliant farsighted he reduced the battle to paper he blueprinted it with slidingrule he analyzed it into inches and pounds and stresses and strains mellen was like a grim hannibal tireless cunning cold and he wove steel in his fingers as a woman weaves her thread it was a remarkable alliance a triumvirate of its kind unsurpassed as the weeks crept into months it worked an engineering marvel xxiii a new crisis with the completion of the railroad to the glacier crossing there came to it a certain amount of travel consisting mainly of prospectors bound to and from the interior the cortez winter trail was open and over it passed most of the traffic from the northward miningcamps but now and then a frostrimed stranger emerged from the canon above oneils terminus with tales of the gold country or a venturesome sledge party snowshoed its way inland from the end of the track murray made a point of hauling these trailers on his constructiontrains and of feeding them in his camps as freely as he did his own men in time the wavering line of sledtracks became fairly well broken and scarcely a week passed without bringing several mushers one day as oneil was picking his way through the outskirts of the camp he encountered one of his night foremen and was surprised to see that the fellow was leading a traildog by a chain now these malamutes are as much a part of the northland as the winter snows and they are a common sight in every community but the mans patent embarrassment challenged murrays attention he acted as if he had been detected in a theft or a breach of duty hello walsh been buying some live stock oneil inquired yes sir i picked up this dog cheap harness too eh murray noted that walshs arms were full of gear enough indeed for a full team knowing that the foreman owned no dogs he asked half banteringly youre not getting ready for a trip i hope no sir not exactly sir the dog was cheap so i i just bought him as a matter of fact dogs were not cheap and walsh should have been in bed at this hour murray walked on wondering what the fellow could be up to later he came upon a laborer dickering with a kyak indian over the price of a fur robe and in front of a bunkhouse he found other members of the night crew talking earnestly with two lately arrived strangers they fell silent as he approached and responded to his greeting with a peculiar nervous eagerness staring after him curiously as he passed on he expected dr gray out from omar but as he neared the track he met mellen the bridge superintendent engaged him briefly upon some detail then said i dont know whats the matter with the men this morning theyre loafing loafing nonsense you expect too much mellen shook his head the minute my back is turned they begin to gossip ive had to call them down perhaps they want a holiday theyre not that kind theres something in the air while they were speaking the morning train pulled in and oneil was surprised to see at least a dozen townspeople descending from it they were loafers saloonfrequenters for the most part and oddly enough they had with them dogs and sleds and all the equipment for travel he was prevented from making inquiry however by a shout from dr gray who cried hey chief look whos here oneil hastened forward with a greeting upon his lips for stanley was helping eliza and natalie down from the caboose which served as a passengercoach the young women becomingly clad in their warm winter furs made a picture good to look upon natalie had ripened wonderfully since her marriage and added to her rich dark beauty there was now an elusive sweetness a warmth and womanliness which had been lacking before as for eliza she had never appeared more sparkling more freshly wholesome and saucy than on this morning we came to take pictures she announced we want to see if the bridge suits us dont you believe her mr oneil said natalie dan told us you were working too hard so eliza insisted on taking you in hand im here merely in the office of chaperon and common scold you have been overdoing youre positively haggard gray nodded he wont mind me i hope youll abuse him well go at him hammer and tongs ignoring murrays smiling assertion that he was the only man in camp who really suffered from idleness the girls pulled him about and examined him critically then fell to discussing him as if he were not present hes worn to the bone said eliza did you ever see anything like his wrinkles he looks like a dried apple natalie declared dan says he doesnt eat probably hes too busy to chew his food well make him fletcherize and eat soup then well mend his underclothes ill warrant he doesnt dress properly how much sleep does he get natalie queried of the physician about half as much as he needs leave him to us said eliza grimly now where does he live well start in there oneil protested faintly please dont i hate soup and i cant allow anybody to pry into my wardrobe it wont stand inspection miss appleton pointed to his feet and asked crisply how many pairs of socks do you wear one any holes sometimes natalie was shocked one pair of socks in this cold its time we took a hand now lead us to this rabbithole where you live reluctantly yet with an unaccustomed warmth about his heart oneil escorted them to his headquarters it was a sharp clear morning the sky was as empty and bright as an upturned saucepan against it the soaring mountain peaks stood out as if carved from new ivory the glaciers to right and left were mute and motionless in the grip of that force which alone had power to check them the turbulent river was hidden beneath a casehardened armor the lake with its weird flotilla of revolving bergs was matted with a broad expanse of white across which meandered dim sled and snowshoe trails underfoot the paths gave out a crisp complaint the sunlight slanting up the valley held no warmth whatever and their breath hung about their heads like vapor crystallizing upon the fur of their caps and hoods oneils livingquarters consisted of a goodsized room adjoining the officebuilding pausing at the door he told his visitors im sorry to disappoint you but your zeal is utterly misplaced i live like a pasha in the midst of debilitating luxuries as you will see for yourselves he waved them proudly inside the room was bare damp and chill it was furnished plentifully but it was in characteristically masculine disorder the bed was tumbled the stove was half filled with cold ashes the water pitcher on the washstand had frozen in one corner was a heap of damp clothing now stiff with frost of course its a little upset he apologized i wasnt expecting callers you know when was it made up last eliza inquired a little weakly yesterday of course are you sure now see here he said firmly i havent time to make beds and everybody else is busier than i am im not in here enough to make it worth while i go to bed late and i tumble out before dawn the girls exchanged meaning glances eliza began to lay off her furs not bad is it he said hopefully natalie picked up the discarded clothing which crackled stiffly under her touch and parted from the bare boards with a tearing sound frozen the idea said she eliza poked among the other garments which hung against the wall and found them also rigid the nailheads behind them were coated with ice turning to the table with its litter of papers and the various unclassified accumulation of a bachelors house she said i suppose well have to leave this as it is just leave everything ill get a man to clean up while you take pictures of the bridge as natalie began preparing for action he queried in surprise dont you like my little home its awful the bride answered feelingly a perfect bears den eliza agreed it will take us all day its just the way i like it he told them but they resolutely banished him and locked the door in his face hey i dont want my things all mussed up he called pounding for readmittance i know right where everything is and the door opened out came an armful of papers a shower of burnt matches and a litter of trash from his worktable he groaned eliza showed her countenance for a moment to say now run away little boy youre going to have your face washed no matter how you cry when weve finished in here well attend to you the door slammed once more and he went away shaking his head at lunchtime they grudgingly admitted him and although they protested that they were not half through he was naively astonished at the change they had brought to pass for the first time in many days the place was thoroughly warm and dry it likewise displayed an orderliness and comfort to which it had been a stranger from some obscure source the girls had gathered pictures for the bare walls they had hung figured curtains at the windows there were fresh white covers for bed bureau and washstand his clothes had been rearranged and posted in conspicuous places were written directions telling him of their whereabouts one of the cards bore these words your soup take one in cup of hot brandy and water before retiring beneath were a bottle and a box of bouillon tablets a shining teakettle was humming on the stove this is splendid he agreed when they had completed a tour of inspection but where are my blueprints in the draftingroom where they belong this room is for rest and sleep we want to see it in this condition when we come back where did you find the fur rug he indicated a thick bearskin beside the bed we stole it from mr parker they confessed shamelessly he had two eliza continued complacently we nearly came to blows with the chef when we kidnapped his best boy weve ordered him to keep this place warm and look after your clothes and clean up every morning hes to be your valet and take care of you but were dreadfully shorthanded in the messhouse oneil protested weve given the chef your bill of fare and your man ben will see that you eat it i wont stand for soup it hush do you want us to come again natalie demanded yes again and again he nodded vigorously i dare say i was getting careless i pay more attention to the mens quarters than to my own do you know this is the first hint of home ive had since i was a boy and its mighty agreeable he stared wistfully at the feminine touches on all sides the bride settled herself with needle and thread saying now take eliza to the bridge while the light is good she wants to snapshoot it im going to sew on buttons and enjoy myself oneil read agreement in elizas eyes and obeyed as they neared the riverbank the girl exclaimed in surprise for up out of the frozen salmon two giant towers of concrete thrust themselves on each bank were massive abutments and connecting them were the beginnings of a complicated falsework structure by means of which the steel was to be laid in place it consisted of rows upon rows of piling laced together with an intricate pattern of squared timbers tracks were being laid upon it and along the rails ran a towering movable crane or traveler somewhat like a tremendous cradle this too was nearing completion piledrivers were piercing the ice with long slender needles of spruce across the whole river was weaving a gigantic fretwork of wood which appeared to be geometrically regular in design the air was noisy with the cries of men and a rhythmic thudding through which came the rattle of winches and the hiss of steam over the whole vast structure swarmed an army of human ants feeble pygmy figures that crept slowly here and there regardless of their dizzy height isnt it beautiful said the builder gazing at the scene with kindling eyes were breaking records every day in spite of the weather those fellows are heroes i feel guilty and mean when i see them risking life and limb while i just walk about and look on will it really stand the breakup asked the girl when that ice goes out it will be as if the solid earth were sliding down the channel it frightens me to think of it weve built solid rock in fact those piers are stronger than rock for theyre laced with veins of steel and anchored beneath the riverbed but eliza doubted ive seen rivers break and its frightful but of course ive never seen anything to compare with the salmon suppose just suppose there should be some weak spot oneil settled his shoulders a little under his coat it would nearly kill mellen and parker too for that matter and you he hesitated it means a great deal to me sometimes i think i could pull myself together and begin again but im getting old and im not sure id care to try after a pause he added a little stiffly as if not quite sure of the effect of his words thats the penalty of being alone in life i suppose we men are grandstand players we need an audience some one person who really cares whether we succeed or fail your brother for instance has won more in the building of the s r n than i can ever hope to win eliza felt a trifle conscious too and she did not look at him when she said poor lonely old omar khayyam you deserve all dan has i think i understand why you havent been to see us ive been too busy this thing has kept me here every hour its my child and one cant neglect his own child you know even if it isnt a real one he laughed apologetically see theres where we took the skiff that day we ran jackson glacier hes harmless enough now you annoyed me dreadfully that morning eliza and ive never quite understood why you were so reckless i wanted the sensation writers have to live before they can write ive worked the experience into my novel indeed what is your book about well its the story of a railroadbuilder of a fellow who risked everything he had on his own judgment its you why my dear cried oneil turning upon her a look of almost comic surprise im flattered of course but theres nothing romantic or uncommon about me you dont mind of course not but there ought to be a hero and love and such things in a novel you must have a tremendous imagination perhaps im not writing a biography you know however you neednt be alarmed it will never be accepted it should be for you write well your magazine articles are bully eliza smiled if the novel would only go as well as those stories id be happy they put gordon on the defensive i knew they would yes i built a nice fire under him and now hes squirming i think i helped you a little bit too indeed you did a great deal when you came to omar i never thought youd turn out to be my champion i he turned as dr gray came hurrying toward them panting in his haste the doctor began abruptly ive been looking for you murray the men are all quitting oneil started all quitting what are you talking about theres a stampede a gold stampede murray stared at the speaker as if doubting his own senses theres no gold around here he said at last two men came in last night theyve been prospecting over in the white river and report rich quartz theyve got samples with em and say there are placer indications everywhere they were on their way to omar to tell their friends and telephoned in from here somebody overheard and it leaked the whole camp is up in the air thats what brought out that gang from town this morning the significance of the incidents which had troubled him earlier in the day flashed upon oneil it was plain enough now why his men had been gossiping and buying dogs and fur robes he understood only too well what a general stampede would mean to his plans for it would take months to replace these skilled ironworkers who are these prospectors he inquired curtly nobody seems to know their names are thorn and baker that gang from omar has gone on and our people will follow in the morning those who cant scrape up an outfit here are going into town to equip we wont have fifty men on the job by tomorrow night what made baker and thorn stop here gray shrugged tired out perhaps weve got to do something quick murray thank god we dont have to sell em grub or haul em to omar that will check things for a day or two if they ever start for the interior were lost but the cataract isnt frozen over and theres only one sled trail past it we dont need more than six good men to do the trick we cant stop a stampede that way dr grays face fell into harsh lines ill bend a winchester over the first man who tries to pass appleton held the place last summer ill guarantee to do it now no the men have a right to quit stanley we cant force them to work we cant build this bridge with a chaingang humph i can beat up these two prospectors and ship em in to the hospital until things cool down that wont do either ill talk with them and if their story is right well ill throw open the commissary and outfit every one eliza gasped gray stammered youre crazy exclaimed the doctor if its a real stampede theyll go anyhow so we may as well take our medicine with a good grace the loss of even a hundred men would cripple us the camp is seething its all mellen can do to keep the day shift at work if you talk to em maybe theyll listen to you argument wont sway them this isnt a strike its a gold rush he turned toward the town eliza was speechless with dismay as she hurried along beside him gray was scowling darkly and muttering anathemas oneil himself was lost in thought the gravity of this final catastrophe left nothing to be said stanley lost little time in bringing the two miners to the office and there for a halfhour murray talked with them when they perceived that he was disposed to treat them courteously they told their story in detail and answered his questions with apparent honesty they willingly showed him their quartz samples and retailed the hardships they had suffered gray listened impatiently and once or twice undertook to interpolate some question but at a glance from his chief he desisted nevertheless his long fingers itched to lay hold of the strangers and put an end to this tale which threatened ruin his anger grew when murray dismissed them with every evidence of a full belief in their words now that the news is out and my men are determined to quit i want everybody to have an equal chance oneil announced as they rose to go theres bound to be a great rush and a lot of suffering maybe some deaths so im going to call the boys together and have you talk to them thorn and baker agreed and departed as the door closed behind them gray exploded but murray checked him quickly saying with an abrupt change of manner wait those fellows are lying seizing the telephone he rang up dan appleton and swiftly made known the situation stanley could hear the engineers startled exclamation get the cable to cortez as quickly as you can oneil was saying you have friends there havent you good hes just the man for hell have gordons payroll find out if joe thorn and henry baker are known and if so who they are and what theyve been doing lately get it quick understand then phone me he slammed the receiver upon its hook thats not alaskan quartz he said shortly it came from nevada or im greatly mistaken every hardrock miner carries specimens like those in his kit you think gordon i dont know but weve got rockmen on this job wholl recognize ore out of any mine they ever worked in go find them then come back here and hold the line open for dan suppose he cant locate these fellows in cortez then lets not think about that xxiv gordons fall the news of oneils attitude spread quickly and excitement grew among the workmen up through the chill darkness of early evening they came charging they were noisy and eager and when the gong summoned them to supper they rushed the messhouse in boisterous good humor no attempt was made to call out the night crew by tacit consent its members were allowed to mingle freely with their fellows and plan for the morrows departure some envious of the crowd from omar which had profited by an early start were anxious to be gone at once but the more soberminded argued that the road to white river was so long that a days advantage would mean little in the end and the advance party would merely serve to break trail for those behind these men be it said were not those who had struck earlier in the season at the behest of gordons emissary linn but fellows whose loyalty and industry were unquestioned their refusal to stampede at the first news was proof of their devotion yet any one who has lived in a mining community knows that no loyalty of employee to employer is strong enough to withstand for long the feverish excitement of a gold rush these bridgeworkers were the aristocracy of the whole force men inured to hardship and capable of extreme sacrifice in the course of their work but they were also independent americans who believed themselves entitled to every reward which fortune laid in their paths for this reason they were even harder to handle than the unskilled unimaginative men farther down the line long before the hour when oneil appeared the lowroofed messhouse was crowded natalie and eliza knowing the importance of this crisis refused to go home and begged murray to let them attend the meeting mr blaine who also felt the keenest concern in the outcome offered to escort them and at last with some difficulty he managed to wedge them inside the door where they apprehensively scanned the gathering it was not an ideal place for a meeting of this size but tables and benches had been pushed aside and into the space thus cleared the men were packed their appearance was hardly reassuring it was a brawny heavymuscled army with which oneil had to deal an army of loudvoiced toilers whose ways were violent and whose passions were quick nevertheless the two girls were treated with the greatest respect and when oneil stepped to a bench and raised himself above their heads his welcome was not unduly boisterous outside the night was clear and cold inside the cramped quarters the air was hot and close and fetid murray had no skill as a public speaker in the ordinary sense he attempted no oratorical tricks and addressed his workmen in a matteroffact tone boys he began there has been a gold strike at the head of the white river and you want to go i dont blame you id like to go myself if theres any chance to make money youre all right boss shouted some one and a general laugh attested the crowds relief at this acceptance of the inevitable they had expected argument despite the contrary assurances they had received now we all want an even break we want to know all there is to know so that a few fellows wont have the advantage of the rest the strike is three hundred miles away its winter and you know what that means i talked with baker and thorn this afternoon i want them to tell you just what they told me thats why i called this meeting if you decide to go you wont have to waste time going to omar after your outfits for ill sell you what you want from my supplies and ill sell at cost there was a yell of approval a cheer for the speaker then came calls for baker and thorn the two miners were thrust forward and the embarrassed thorn who had acted as spokesman was boosted to a table under murrays encouragement he stammered out the story of his good fortune the tale running straight enough to fan excitement into a blaze there was no disposition to doubt for news of this sort is only too sure of credence when the speaker had finished oneil inquired are you an experienced quartzminer do you know ore when you see it sure i worked in the jumbo at goldfield nevada up to last year so did baker when did you go into the white river country august how did you go in we packed in when our grub ran out we killed our horses and cached the meat for dogfeed is there any other dogfeed there no sir any people not a soul the country is open to the first comers its a finelooking country too we seen quartz indications everywhere i reckon this speaks for itself thorn significantly held up his ore samples weve made our locations you fellows is welcome to the rest first come first served there was an eager scramble for the specimens on the part of those nearest the speaker after a moment murray asked them did you fellows ever see any rock like that one of his workmen answered i have where in the jumbo at goldfield i highgraded there in the early days there was a laugh at this thorn flushed angrily well he rejoined weve got the same formation over there in the white river its just like goldfield it be the same kind of a camp too when the news gets out oneil broke in smoothly to say most of our fellows have no dogs it will take them three weeks to cover the trail theyll have to spend three weeks in there then three weeks more coming out over two months altogether they cant haul enough grub to do them he turned to his employees and said gravely youd better think it over boys those who have teams can make it but the rest of you will get left do you think the chance is worth all that work and suffering the bridgeworkers shifted uncomfortably on their feet then a voice exclaimed dont worry boss well make it somehow thorn says theres nobody over there murray continued but that seems strange for i happen to know of half a dozen outfits at the head of the white river jack dalton has had a gang working there for four years dalton was a famous character in the north one of the most intrepid of the early pioneers and the mention of his name brought a hush a large part of the audience realized the truth of oneils last statement yet resented having it thrust upon them thorn and baker were scowling gray had just entered the room and was signaling to his chief and oneil realized that he must score a triumph quickly if he wished to hold the attention of his men he resumed gravely if this strike was genuine i wouldnt argue but it isnt a confusion of startled protests rose the two miners burst out indignantly but oneil raising his voice for the first time managed to make himself heard those jewelry samples came from nevada he cried i recognized them myself this afternoon and heres another fellow who cant be fooled thorn told you he used to work in goldfield you can draw your own conclusions the temper of the crowd changed instantly jeers groans hisses arose the men were on their feet now and growing noisier every moment baker and thorn were glaring balefully at their accuser but gray succeeded in shouldering his way forward and whispered to oneil who turned suddenly and faced the men again just a minute he shouted you heard thorn say he and baker went prospecting in august well weve just had cortez on the cable and learn that they were working for gordon until two weeks ago a sudden silence fell murray smiled down at the two strangers what do you say to that thorn flew into a purple rage its a damned lie hes afraid youll quit work fellows viciously he flung himself toward the door only to feel the grasp of the muscular physician upon his arm listen to this message from the cashier of the cortez home bank bellowed gray his big voice dominating the uproar undisturbed by his prisoners struggles he read loudly joe thorn and henry baker quit work fifteenth leaving for fairbanks over winter trail with five dogs four gray and white malamutes black shepherd leader thorn medium size thirtyfive red hair baker dark scar on cheek wilson cashier the doctors features spread into a broad grin youve all seen the dogteam and heres the red hair his fingers sunk into his prisoners fiery locks with a grip that threatened to leave him a scalp for a trophy thorn cursed and twisted the crowds allegiance had been quick to shift but it veered back to oneil with equal suddenness bunco yelled a hoarse voice after a brief hush lynch em cried another and the angry clamor burst forth anew dont be foolish shouted murray nobody has been hurt wed have been on the trail tomorrow send em down the river barefoot yes what about that gang from omar im afraid theyll have to take care of themselves oneil said but these two men arent altogether to blame theyre acting under orders isnt that right he asked thorn the miner hesitated until the grip in his hair tightened then evidently fearing the menace in the faces on every side he decided to seek protection in a complete confession yes he agreed sullenly gordon cooked it up its all a fake oneil nodded with satisfaction this is the second time hes tried to get my men away from me the other time he failed because tom slater happened to come down with smallpox thank god he recovered a ripple of laughter spread then grew into a bellow for the nature of happy toms illness had long since become a source of general merriment and oneils timely reference served to divert the crowd it also destroyed most of its resentment you fellows dont seem able to protect yourselves so doc and i will have to do it for you now listen he continued more gravely i meant it when i said id open the commissary and help you out if the strike were genuine but nevertheless i want you to know just what it would have meant to me i havent enough money to complete the s r n and i cant raise enough but i have signed an option to sell the road if the bridge is built by next spring its really a two years job and some engineers dont believe it can be built at all but i know it can if youll help if we fail im ruined if we succeed he waved his hands and smiled at them cheerfully maybe well build another railroad somewhere thats what this stampede meant now will you stick to me the answer roared from a hundred throats you bet well stick at the rear of the room whence they had witnessed the rapid unfolding of this drama the two girls joined in the shout they were hugging each other and laughing hysterically he handled them just right said blaine with shining eyes just right but i was worried walsh the night foreman raised his voice to inquire does anybody want to buy a dogteam cheap who wants dogs now jeered some one give em to baker and thorn oneil was still speaking in all earnestness boys he said we have a big job on our hands it means fast work long hours and little sleep we picked you fellows out because we knew you were the very best bridgeworkers in the world now the life of the s r n lies with you and that bridge must be built on time about these two men who tried to stampede us i think its enough punishment if we laugh at them dont you he smiled down at thorn who scowled then grinned reluctantly and nodded his head when general good feeling was restored murray attempted to make his way out but his men seemed determined to thank him one by one and he was delayed through a long process of handshaking it pleased him to see that they understood from what hardships and disappointments he had saved them and he was doubly grateful when walsh rounded up his crew and announced that the night shift would resume work at midnight he escaped at last leaving the men grouped contentedly about huge pans of smoking doughnuts and pots of coffee which the cookboys had brought in liquor was taboo in the camp but he gave orders that unlimited cigars be distributed when he reached his quarters he was completely fagged for the crisis coming on top of his many responsibilities had taken all his vitality his once cheerless room was warm and cozy as he entered he found natalie sleeping peacefully on his bed and eliza curled up in his big chair waiting she opened her eyes drowsily and smiled up at him saying you were splendid omar khayyam im so glad he laid a finger on his lips and glanced at the sleeping natalie shh where are you going to put us for the night right here of course those men will do anything for you now i i think id die too if anything happened to the bridge he took her hand in his and smiled down into her earnest eyes a little wearily nothing will happen now go to bed and thank you for making a home for me it really is a home now ill appreciate it tomorrow he tiptoed out and tramped over to parkers quarters for the night the news of the white river fiasco reached curtis gordon in seattle whither he had gone in a final attempt to bolster up the tottering fortunes of the cortez home railway his disappointment was keen yet oneil from the beginning had met his attacks with such uniform success that new failure did not really surprise him it had been a forlorn hope at best strangely enough he had begun to lose something of his assurance of late although he maintained his outward appearance of confidence with all his old skill within himself he felt a growing uneasiness a lurking doubt of his abilities outwardly there was reason enough for discouragement for while his cooperative railroad scheme had begun brilliantly its initial success had not been sustained as time passed and eliza appletons exposure remained unrefuted he had found it ever more difficult to enlist support his own denials and explanations seemed powerless to affect the public mind and as he looked back he dated his decline from the appearance of her first article it had done all the mischief he had feared not only were his old stockholders dissatisfied but wherever he went for aid he found a disconcerting lack of response a halfveiled skepticism that was maddening yet his immediate business worries were not all nor the worst of his troubles his physical powers were waning to all appearances he was as strong as ever but a strange bodily lassitude hampered him he tired easily and against this handicap he was forced to struggle continually he had never rightly valued his amazing equipment of energy until now when some subtle ailment had begun to sap it the change was less in his muscular strength than in his nerves and his mental vigor he found himself growing peculiarly irritable his failures excited spasms of blind fury which left him weak and spent he began to suffer the depressing tortures of insomnia at times the nerves in his face and neck twitched unaccountably and this distressing affection spread these symptoms had first manifested themselves after his unmerciful drubbing at the hands of dan appleton but they were not the result of any injury they were due to some deeper cause when he had recovered his senses after the departure of dan and natalie he had fallen into a paroxysm of anger that lasted for days he had raged and stormed like a madman for to say nothing of other humiliations he prided himself extravagantly on his physical prowess while the marks of the rough treatment he had suffered were disappearing he remained indoors plunged in such abysmal fury that neither gloria nor the fawning denny dared approach him the very force of his emotions had permanently disturbed his poise or perhaps effected some obscure lesion in his brain even when he showed himself again in public he was still abnormally choleric his fits of passion became almost apoplectic in their violence they caused his associates to shun him as a man dangerous and in his calmer moments he thought of them with alarm he had tried to regain his nervous control but without success and his wifes anxiety only chafed him further gradually he lost his mental buoyancy and for the first time in his life he really yielded to pessimism he found he could no longer attack a problem with his accustomed certainty of conquering it but was haunted by a foreboding of inevitable failure all in all when he reached the states on his critical mission he knew that he was far from being his old self and he had deteriorated more than he knew a week or two of disappointments should have shown him the futility of further effort at any other time it would have set him to putting his house in order for the final crash but now it merely enraged him he redoubled his activity launching a new campaign of publicity so extravagant and illtimed as to repel the assistance he needed he had lost his finesse his nicely adjusted financial sense had gone the outcome was not long delayed it came in the form of a newspaper despatch to the effect that his cortez bank had suspended payment because of a run started by the dissatisfied employees of the railroad through gordons flamboyant advertising his enterprises were so well known by this time that the story was featured despite his efforts to kill it his frantic cables to cortez for a denial only brought assurances that the report was true and that conditions would not mend unless a shipment of currency was immediately forthcoming harassed by reporters driven on by the need for a show of action he set out to raise the money but the support he had hoped for failed him when it transpired that his banks assets consisted mainly of real estate at boom prices and stock in his various companies which had been inflated to the burstingpoint days passed a week or more then he was compelled to relinquish his option on the steamship line he had partly purchased and to sacrifice all that had been paid in on the enterprise this too made a big story for the newspapers for it punctured one of the most imposing corporations in the famous gordon system it likewise threatened to involve the others in the general crash hope consolidated indeed still remained and gordons declaration that the value of its shares was more than sufficient to protect his bank met with some credence until swift upon the heels of the other disasters came an application for a receiver by the stockholders coupled with the promise of a rigorous investigation into his various financial manipulations then at last gordon acknowledged defeat ruin had come swiftly the diversity of his interests made his situation the more hopeless for so cunningly had he interlocked one with another that to separate them promised to be an endless task he still kept up a fairly successful pretense of confidence and publicly he promised to bring order out of chaos but in secret he gave way to the blackest despair heretofore failure had never affected him deeply for he had always managed to escape with advantage to his pocket and without serious damage to his prestige but out of the present difficulty he could find no way his office force stopped work frightened at his bearing the bellboys of his hotel brought to the desk tales of such maniacal violence that lie was requested to move at last the citizens of cortez who up to this time had been like putty in his fingers realized their betrayal and turned against him creditors attached the railway property certain violenttempered men prayed openly and earnestly to their gods for his return to alaska in order that they might exact satisfaction in frontier fashion eastern investors in hope consolidated appeared in seattle there was talk of criminal procedure bewildered as he was half crazed with anxiety gordon knew that the avalanche had not only wrecked his fortunes but was bearing him swiftly toward the penitentiary its gates yawned to welcome him and he felt a chilling terror such as he had never known one evening as captain johnny brennan stood on the dock superintending the final loading of a cargo for the s r n he was accosted by a tall nervous man with shifting eyes and twitching lips it was hard to recognize in this pitiable shaken creature the once resplendent gordon who had bent the whole northland to his ends some tantalizing demons inside the mans frame were jerking at his sinews fear was in his roving glance he stammered he plucked at the little captains sleeve like a frightened woman the openhearted irishman was touched yes said johnny after listening for a time ill take you with me and they wont catch you either gordon chattered ill pay you well handsomely im a rich man i have interests that demand attention so accept this money please keep it all my good fellow brennan stared at the bundle gordon had thrust into his hand then regarded the speaker curiously man dear he said this isnt money these are stock certificates eh stock well theres money in stocks big money if you know how to handle them the promoters wandering eye shifted to the line of stevedores trundling their trucks into the hold then up to the crane with its straining burden of bridge material every package was stenciled with his rivals name but he exclaimed bravo captain well be up to the summit by christmas no graft no incompetence the utmost publicity in corporate affairs thats our platform were destined for a glorious success glorious success go aboard and lie down brennan said gently you need a good sleep then calling a steward he ordered show mr gordon to my cabin and give him what he wants he watched the tall figure stumble up the gangplank and shook his head the utmost publicity is it well its you thats getting it now and to think that youre the man with the mines and the railroads and the widow im afraid youll be in irons when she sees you but thats as good a finish as you deserve after all xxv preparations the building of the salmon river bridge will not soon be forgotten by engineers and men of science but while the technical features of the undertaking are familiar to a few the general public knows little about how the work was actually done and since the building of the bridge was the pivotal point in murray oneils career it may be well to describe in some detail its various phases the steps which led up to that day when the salmon burst her bonds and put the result of all his planning and labor to the final test nowhere else in the history of bridgebuilding had such conditions been encountered nowhere on earth had work of this character been attended with greater hazards never had circumstances created a situation of more dramatic interest by many the whole venture was regarded as a reckless gamble for more than a million dollars had been risked on the chance not alone that oneil could build supports which the ice could not demolish but that he could build them under the most serious difficulties in recordbreaking time far more than the mere cost of the structure hinged upon his success failure would mean that his whole investment up to that point would be wiped out to say nothing of the twentymilliondollar project of a trunkline up the valley of the salmon had the government permitted the kyak coalfields to be opened up the lower reaches of the s r n would have had a value but all activity in that region had been throttled and the policy of delay and indecision at headquarters promised no relief careful as had been the plans exhaustive and painstaking as had been the preparations the bridgebuilders met with unpreventable delays disappointments and disasters for man is but a feeble creature whose brain tires and whose dreams are brittle it is with these hindrances and accidents and with their effect upon the outcome that we have to deal of course the greatest handicap the one everpresent obstacle was the cold and this made itself most troublesome in the sinking of the caissons and the building of the concrete piers it was necessary for instance to house in all cement work and to raise the temperature not only of the air surrounding it but of the materials themselves before they were mixed and laid huge windbreaks had to be built to protect the outside men from the gales that scoured the riverbed and these were forever blowing down or suffering damage from the hurricanes all this however had been anticipated it was but the normal condition of work in the northland and it was not until the middle of winter shortly after elizas and natalies visit to the front that an unexpected danger threatened a danger more appalling than any upon which oneil and his assistants had reckoned in laying his plans parker had proceeded upon the assumption that once the cold had gripped the glaciers they would remain motionless until spring all available evidence went to prove the correctness of this supposition but alaska is a land of surprises of contrasts of contradictions study of its phenomena is too recent to make practicable the laying down of hard and fast rules in the midst of a season of cruelly low temperatures there came a thaw unprecedented inexplicable a tremendous warm breath from the pacific rolled northward bathing the frozen plains and mountain ranges blizzards turned to rains and weeping fogs the dry and shifting snowfields melted water ran in the courses winter loosed its hold its mantle slipped nothing like this had ever been known or imagined it was impossible it was as if the unhallowed region were bent upon living up to its evil reputation in a short time the loosened waters that trickled through the sleeping icefields greased the foundations upon which they lay jackson glacier roused itself then began to glide forward like a ship upon its ways first there came the usual premonitory explosions the sound of subterranean blasts as the ice cracked gave way and shifted to the weight above echoes filled the sodden valley with memories of the summer months it was as if the seasons had changed as if the zodiacal procession had been thrown into confusion the frozen surface of the salmon was inundated water four feet deep in some places ran over it the general wonder at this occurrence changed to consternation when it was seen that the glacier acted like a batteringram of stupendous size buckling the river ice in front of it as if ice were made of paper that sevenfoot armor was crushed broken into a thousand fragments which threatened to choke the stream a halfmile below the bridge site the salmon was pinched as if between two jaws its smooth surface was rapidly turned into an indescribable jumble of upended cakes when a fortnight had passed oneil began to fear that this movement would go on until the channel had been closed as by a huge sliding door in that case the rising waters would quickly wipe out all traces of his work such a crumpling and shifting of the ice had never occurred before at least not within fifty years as the alder and cottonwood growth on the east bank showed but nothing seemed impossible no prank too grimly grotesque for nature to play in this solitude oneil felt that his own ingenuity was quite unequal to the task of combating this peril set against forces so tremendous and arbitrary human invention seemed dwarfed to a pitiable insignificance day after day he watched the progress of that white palisade day after day he scanned the heavens for a sign of change for out of the sky alone could come his deliverance hourly tests were made at the bridge site lest the ice should give way before the pressure from below and by moving upstream destroy the intricate pattern of piling which was being driven to support the steelwork but day after day the snows continued to melt and the rain to fall two rivers were now boiling past the camp one hidden deep the other a shallow torrent which ran upon a bed of ice the valley was rent by the sounds of the glaciers snaillike progress then without apparent cause the seasons fell into order again the mercury dropped the surfacewater disappeared the country was sheeted with a glittering crust over which men walked leaving no trace of footprints jackson became silent once again the wind blew cold from out of the funnelmouth and the bridgebuilders threshed their arms to start their blood but the glacier face had advanced four hundred feet from its position in august it had narrowed the salmon by fully onehalf its width fortunately the bridge had suffered no damage as yet and no one foresaw the effect which these altered conditions were to have the actual erection of steelwork was impossible during the coldest months parker had planned only to rush the piers abutments and falsework to completion so that he could take advantage of the mild spring weather preceding the breakup the execution of this plan was in itself an unparalleled undertaking making it necessary to hire double crews of picked men yet as the weeks wore into months the intricate details were wrought out one by one and preparations were completed for the great race late in march dan appleton went to the front taking with him his wife and his sister for whom oneil had thoughtfully prepared suitable livingquarters the girls were as hungry as dan to have a part in the deciding struggle or at least to see it close at hand for the spirit of those engaged in the work had entered them also life at omar of late had been rather uneventful and they looked forward with pleasure to a renewal of those companionable relations which had made the summer months so full of interest and delight but they were disappointed life at the end of the line they found to be a very grim a very earnest and in some respects an extremely disagreeable affair the feverish unceasing activity of their friends left no time for companionship or recreation of any sort more and more they too came to feel the sense of haste and strain pervading the whole army of workers the weight of responsibility that bore upon the commander dan became almost a stranger to them and when they saw him he was obsessed by vital issues mellen was gruff and irritable parker in his preoccupation ignored everything but his duties of all their former comrades oneil alone seemed aware of their presence but behind his smile they saw the lurking worries in his eyes was an abstraction they could not penetrate in his bearing the fatigue of a man tried to the breakingpoint to eliza there was a certain joy merely in being near the man she loved even though she could not help being hurt by his apparent indifference the long weeks without sight of him had deepened her feeling and she had turned for relief to the writing of her book the natural outlet for her repressed emotions into its pages she had poured all her passion all her yearning and she had written with an intimate understanding of oneils ambitions and aims which later gave the story its unique success as an epic of financial romance hers was a nature which could not be content with idleness she took up the work that she and natalie had begun devoting herself unobtrusively yet effectively to making oneil comfortable it was a labor of love done with no expectation of reward it thrilled her filling her with mingled sadness and satisfaction but if murray noticed the improvement in his surroundings which she sometimes doubted he evidently attributed it to a sudden access of zeal on the part of ben for he made no comment whether or not she wished him to see and understand she could hardly tell somehow his unobservant masculine acceptance of things better and worse appealed to the woman in her she slipped into oneils quarters during his absence and slipped out again quietly she learned to know his ways his peculiarities she found herself caressing and talking to his personal belongings as if they could hear and understand she conducted long conversations with the objects on his bureau one morning ben entered unexpectedly to surprise her in the act of kissing murrays shavingmirror as if it still preserved the image of its owners face after which she banished the cookboy utterly and performed his duties with her own hands of course discovery was inevitable at last oneil stumbled in upon her in the midst of her task and questioning her read the truth from her blushes and her incoherent attempts at explanation so youre the one who has been doing this he exclaimed in frank astonishment and ive been tipping benny for his thoughtfulness all this time the rascal has made enough to retire rich he seemed not to understand his duties very well so i took charge but you had no business to catch me the flush died from elizas cheeks and she faced him with thoroughly feminine indignation i cant let you go on with this said murray i ought to be doing something for you but the girl flared up defiantly i love it ill do it no matter if you lock me out im not on the payroll you know so you have no authority over me none at all his eyes roved around the room and for the first time he fully took in the changes her hands had wrought my dear child its very nice to be spoiled this way and have everything neat and clean but it embarrasses me dreadfully to have you saddled with the sordid work it isnt sordid and what brought you home at this hour anyhow she demanded oneils smile gave place to an anxious frown the ice is rising and rising yes our old enemy jackson glacier is causing us trouble again that jam of broken ice in front of it is backing up the water theres more running now and the ice is lifting its lifting the falsework with it pulling the piles out of the riverbottom like splinters out of a sore hand thats pretty bad isnt it it certainly is it threatens to throw everything out of alignment and prevent us from laying the steel if we dont check it check it cried eliza how can you check a thing like that easily enough if we can spare the hands by cutting away the ice where it is frozen to the piles so that it wont lift them with it the trouble is to get men enough you see the ice is nine feet thick now ive set every man to work with axes and chisels and steampoints and i came up to telephone slater for more help well have to work fast night and day theres nobody left in omar eliza said quickly i know toms going to gather all he can at cortez and hope and rush them out here our task is to keep the ice cut away until help arrives i suppose its too late in the season to repair any serious damage exactly if you care to go back with me you can see what were doing as they set off for the bridge site murray looked down at eliza striding manlike beside him with something of affectionate appreciation in his eyes and said humbly it was careless of me not to see what you have been doing for me all this time my only excuse is that ive been driven half mad with other things i havent time to think of myself all housekeepers have a thankless task laughed eliza when they reached the riverbank she saw everything apparently just as when she had last seen it why its not as bad as i imagined she exclaimed i thought id find everything going to smash oh theres nothing spectacular about it there seldom is about serious mishaps in this business the ice has risen only an inch or more so far but the very slowness and sureness of it is whats alarming it shows that the water is backing up and as the flow increases the rise of the ice will quicken if it starts to move up or down stream were lost there was ample evidence that the menace was thoroughly understood for the whole day shift was toiling at the ice chopping it thawing it shoveling it away although its tremendous thickness made their efforts seem puerile everywhere there was manifested a frantic haste a grim strained eagerness that was full of ominous meaning all that day eliza watched the unequal struggle and in the evening dan brought her reports that were far from reassuring the relentless movement showed no sign of ceasing when she retired that night she sought ease from her anxiety in a prayer that was half a petition for oneils success and half an exceedingly full and frank confession of her love for him outside beneath the glare of torches and hastily strung incandescents a weary army toiled stubbornly digging gouging chopping at the foot of the towering wall of timbers which stretched across the salmon in the north the aurora borealis played brilliantly as if to light a council of the gods on the following day happy tom arrived with fifty men i got the last mothers son i could find he explained as he warmed himself at oneils stove did you go to hope i did and i saw the splavvus himself gordon hes worse than we thought tom tapped his shining forehead significantly loft to let what insane nothing but echoes in his dome the towns as empty as his bonnet too and the streets are full of snow its a sight tell me about mrs gordon shes quite a person said slater slowly she surprised me shes there alone with him and a watchman she does all the work even to lugging in the wood and coal hes too busy to help but she wont leave him she told me that dan and natalie wanted her to come over here but she couldnt bring herself to do it or to let them assist in any way gordon spends all his time at his desk promoting writing ads and prospectuses hes got a grand scheme hes found that hope consolidated is full of rich ore but the trouble is in getting it out so hes working on a new process of extraction its a wonderful process youd never guess what it is he smokes it out he says all he needs is plenty of smoke that bothered him until he hit on the idea of burning feathers now hes planning to raise ducks because theyve got so much down isnt that the limit shell have to fit him into a padded cell sooner or later poor devil said oneil im sorry he had an unusual mind slater sniffed i think its pretty soft for him myself hes made better than a standoff he lost his memory but he saved his skin its funny how some men cant fall if they slip on a bananapeel somebody shoves a cushion under em before they light i never got the best of anything if i dropped asleep in church my wife would divorce me and id go to the electric chair gordon robs widows and orphans right and left then ends up with a loving woman to take care of him in his old age why if i even robbed a blind puppy of a biscuit id leave a thumbprint on his ear or the dogs mother would turn out to be a bloodhound anyhow id spend my declining years nestled up to a rockpile with a mallet in my mit and a lowbrowed gentleman scowling at me from the top of a wall hed lean on his shotgun and say hurry up fatty its getting late and theres a ton of oakum to pick it just goes to show that some of us is born behind the game and never get even while others like gordon quit winner no matter how much they lose having relieved himself of this fervid homily happy tom unrolled a package of gum and thrust three sticks into his mouth speaking of bad luck he continued when are you going to get married murray oneil started why never it isnt the same kind of proposition as building a bridge you know theres a little matter of youth and good looks that counts considerably in the marriage business no woman would have an old chap like me slater took a mournful inventory of his chiefs person then said doubtfully you might put it over murray i aint strictly handsome myself but i did as oneil slipped into his fur coat after the fat man had slouched out he caught sight of himself in the glass of his bureau and paused he leaned forward and studied the careworn countenance that peered forth at him then shook his head he saw that the hair was growing grayer that the face was very plain and yes unquestionably it was no longer youthful of course he didnt feel old but the evidence that he was so admitted of no disproof and it was evidence of a sort which no woman could disregard he turned from the glass with a qualm of disgust at his weakness in allowing himself to be influenced in the slightest by toms suggestion for a week the ice rose slowly a foot a day and in spite of the greatest watchfulness it took the falsework with it here and there but concentrated effort at the critical points saved the structure from serious injury then the jam in front of jackson glacier went out at least in part and the ice began to fall down it settled smoothly swiftly until it rested once more upon the shores it was still as firm as in midwinter and showed no sign of breaking nor had it moved downstream a hairs breadth oneil gathered his forces for the final onslaught xxvi the race on april th the last of the steel for span number one reached the front and erection was begun the men fell to with a vim and an enthusiasm impossible to describe with incredible rapidity the heavy sections were laid in place the riveters began their metallic song the towering three bent traveler ran smoothly on its track and under it grew a web work of metal braced and reinforced to withstand in addition to ordinary strains the pressure of a hundredmileanhour wind to those who looked on the structure appeared to build itself like some dream edifice it seemed a miracle that human hands could work that stubborn metal so swiftly and with so little effort but every piece had been cut and fitted carefully then checked and placed where it was accessible now that winter had broken spring came with a rush the snows began to shrink and the drifts to settle the air grew balmier with every day the drip from eaves was answered by the gurgling laughter of hidden waters here and there the boldest mountainsides began to show and the tops of alder thickets thrust themselves into sight where wood or metal caught the sunrays the snow retreated pools of icewater began to form at noon the days were long too and no frozen winds charged out of the north as the daylight lengthened so did the workinghours of the toilers on april th the span was completed in thirteen days mellens crew had laid four hundred feet of the heaviest steel ever used in a bridge of this type but there was no halt the material for the second section had been assembled meanwhile and the traveler began to swing it into place the din was unceasing the clash of riveters the creak and rattle of hoists the shouts of men mingled in a persistent earsplitting clamor and foot by foot the girders reached out toward the second monolith which rose from the riverbed the welladjusted human machine was running smoothly every man knew his place and the duties that went with it the hands of each worker were capable and skilled but now the hillsides were growing bare rills gashed the sloping snowfields the upper gullies began to rumble to avalanches forerunners of the process that would strip the earth of snow and ice and free the river in all its fury in six days three hundred feet more of steel had been bolted fast to the complete section and span two was in place but the surface of the salmon was no longer white and pure it was dirty and discolored now for the debris which had collected during the past winter was exposing itself the icy covering was partially inundated also shallow ponds formed upon it and were rippled by the south breeze running waters on every side sang a menace to the workers then progress ceased abruptly it became known that a part of the material for the third span had gone astray in its long journey across the continent there had been a delay at the pittsburg mills then a blockade in the sierras oneil was in omar at the end of the cable straining every nerve to have the shipment rushed through mellen brooded over his uncompleted work parker studied the dripping hills and measured the melting snows he still smiled but he showed his anxiety in a constant nervous unrest and he could not sleep at length news came that johnny brennan had the steel aboard his ship and had sailed a record run was predicted but meanwhile the south wind brought havoc on its breath the sun shone hotly into the valley of the salmon and instead of warmth it brought a chill to the hearts of those who watched and waited twelve endless idle days crawled by winter no longer gave battle she was routed and in her mad retreat she threatened to overwhelm oneils fortunes on may th the needed bridge members were assembled and the erection of span three began the original plan had been to build this section on the cantilever principle so as to gain independence of the river ice but to do so would have meant slow work and much delay an expenditure of time which the terms of the option made impossible arrangements had been made therefore to lay it on falsework as the other spans had been laid risking everything upon the weather as a matter of precaution the southern half of the span was connected to the completed portion but before the connection could be fully made the remainder of the jam in front of jackson glacier which had caused so much trouble heretofore went out suddenly and the river ice moved downstream about a foot carrying with it the whole intricate system of supporting timbers beneath the uncompleted span hasty measurements showed that the north end of the steel then on the falsework was thirteen inches out of line it was mr blaine who brought the tidings of this last calamity to eliza appleton from his evident anxiety she gathered that the matter was of graver consequence than she could well understand thirteen inches in fifteen hundred feet cant amount to much she said vaguely blaine smiled in spite of himself you dont understand its as bad as thirteen feet for the work cant go on until everything is in perfect alignment that whole forest of piles must be straightened impossible she gasped why there are thousands of them he shook his head still smiling doubtfully nothing is impossible to mellen and parker theyve begun clearing away the ice on the upstream side and driving new anchorpiles above theyre going to fit tackle to them and yank the whole thing upstream i never heard of such a thing but theres no time to do anything else he cast a worried look at the smiling sky i wonder what will happen next this is getting on my nerves out on the river swift work was going on steam from every available boiler was carried across the ice in feedpipes the night shift had been roused from sleep and every available man was busied in relieving the pressure piledrivers hammered long timbers into the riverbed above the threatened point hydraulic jacks were put in place and steel cables were run to drum and pulley the men worked sometimes kneedeep in icewater but they did not walk they ran in an incredibly short time the preparations were completed a strain was put upon the tackle and when night came the massive falsework had been pulled back into line and the traveler was once more swinging steel into place it was a magnificent feat yet not one of those concerned in it could feel confident that the work had not been done in vain for the time was growing terribly short and although the ice seemed solid it was rotting fast after the southern half of the span had been completed the warmth increased rapidly therefore the steel crew lengthened its hours the men worked from seven oclock in the morning until eleven oclock at night on the th without warning of any sort garfield glacier began moving forward it had lain inactive even during the midwinter thaw which had started its smaller brother but that warm spell had evidently had its effect upon the giant for now he shook off his lethargy and awoke he stirred gradually at first and without sound as if bent upon surprising the interlopers then his speed increased as the glacier advanced it thrust the ninefoot blanket of lake ice ahead of it and this in turn crowded the river ice down upon the bridge the movement at the camp site on the first day was only two inches but that was sufficiently serious the onset of garfield at this time was of course unexpected for no forward motion had ever been reported prior to the spring breakup the action of the ice heretofore had been alarming but now consternation spread a panic swept the ranks of the builders for this was no shortlived phenomenon this was the annual march of the glacier itself which promised to continue indefinitely a tremendous cuttingedge nine feet in thickness like the blade of a carpenters plane was being driven against the bridge by an irresistible force once again the endless thawing and chopping and gouging of ice began but the more rapidly the encroaching edge was cut away the more swiftly did it bear down the huge mass began to rumble it calved it split it detonated and having finally loosened itself from its bed it acquired increased momentum as the men with chisels and steampoints became exhausted others took their places but the structural gang clung to its perch above augmenting the din of riveters and the groaning of blocks and tackle among the ablebodied men sleep now was out of the question for the ice gained in spite of every effort it was too late to remove the steel in the uncompleted span to a place of safety for that would have required more time than to bridge the remaining gap piling began to buckle and bend before that irresistible push the whole nicely balanced mass of metal was in danger of being unseated mellen cursed the heavens in a black fury parker smiled through white lips oneil ground his teeth and spurred his men on this feverish haste brought its penalty on the evening of the th when the span was more than threequarters finished a lower chord section fouled as it was lifted and two loadingbeams at the top of the traveler snapped on that day victory had been in sight the driving of the last bolt had been but a question of hours a race with the sliding ice but with the hoisting apparatus out of use work halted swiftly desperately without loss of a moments time repairs began no regrets were voiced no effort was made to place the blame for that would have caused delay and every minute counted eleven hours later the broken beams were replaced and erection had recommenced but now for those above there was danger to life and limb during the pause the ice had gained and no effort could relieve the falsework of its strain all knew that if it gave way the workmen would be caught in a chaos of collapsing wood and steel from the morning of may th until midnight of the th the ironworkers clung to their tasks they dropped their tools and ran to their meals they gulped their food and fled back to their posts the weaker ones gave out and staggered away cursed and taunted by their companions they were rough fellows and in their deepthroated profanity was a prayer the strong ones struggled on blind with weariness but upheld by that desperate unthinking courage that animates a bayonet charge it seemed that every moment must see the beginning of that slow work of demolition which would send them all scurrying to safety but hour after hour the piling continued to hold and the fingers of steel to reach out foot by foot for the concrete pier which was their goal at midnight of the th the last rivet was driven but the ice had gained to such an extent that the lower chord was buckled downstream about eight inches and the distance was growing steadily quickly the traveler was shifted to the falsework beyond the pier and the men under mellens direction fell to splitting out the blocking as the supports were chopped away the mass began to crush the last few wedges there was a great snapping and rending of wood and some one strained to the breakingpoint shouted look out there she goes a cry of terror arose the men fled trampling one another in their panic but mellen charged them like a wild man firing curses and orders at them until they rallied the remaining supports were removed the fifteen hundred tons of metal settled into place and rested securely on its foundations oneil was the last man ashore as he walked the completed span from pier three the barricade of piling beneath him was bending and tearing but he issued no orders to remove it for the river was doing that in the general haste piledrivers hoists boilers and various odds and ends of machinery and material had been left where they stood they were being inundated now many of them were all but submerged there was no possibility of saving them at present for the men were half dead from exhaustion as he lurched up the muddy uneven street to his quarters murray felt his fatigue like a heavy burden for he had been sixty hours without sleep he saw slater and appleton and the rest of his boys he saw natalie and eliza but he was too tired to speak to them or to grasp what they said he heard the workmen cheering mellen and parker and himself it was very foolish he thought to cheer since the river had so nearly triumphed and the final test was yet to come he fell upon his bed clothed as he was an hour later the falsework beneath span three collapsed although the bridge was not yet finished the most critical point of its construction had been passed for the fourth and final portion would be built over shallow water and no great difficulties were to be expected even though the ice went out before the work was finished but murray had made his promise and his boast to complete the structure within a stated time and he was determined to live up to the very letter of his agreement with the trust as to the result of the breakup he had no fear whatever for once nature aided him she seemed to smile as if in approval of his steadfastness the movement of the channel ice became irregular spasmodic but it remained firm until the last span had been put in place of this dramatic struggle eliza appleton had watched every phase with intensest interest but when at last she knew that the battle was won she experienced a peculiar revulsion of feeling so long as oneil had been working against odds with the prospect of ruin and failure forever imminent she had felt an almost painful sympathy but now that he had conquered she felt timid about congratulating him he was no longer to be pitied and helped he had attained his goal and the fame he longed for his success would inevitably take him out of her life she was very sorry that he needed her no longer she did not watch the last bridgemember swung but went to her room and tried to face the future spring was here her book was finished there was the need to take up her life again she was surprised when murray came to find her i missed you eliza he said the others are all down at the riverbank i want you to congratulate me she saw with a jealous twinge that exultation over his victory had overcome his weariness that his face was alight with a fire she had never before seen he seemed young vigorous and masterful once more of course he went on the credit belongs to parker who worked the bridge out in each detail hes marvelous and to mellen who actually built it but i helped a little praise to me means praise to them it is all over now isnt it practically blaine has cabled new york that weve won strictly speaking we havent as yet for theres still the breakup to face but the bridge will come through it without a scratch the ice may go out any minute now and after that i can rest he smiled at her gladly it will feel good to get rid of all this responsibility wont it i think youve suffered under it as much as i have a little wistfully she answered youre going to realize that dream you told me about the day of the storm at kyak you have conquered this great country just as you dreamed he acquiesced eagerly boyishly yes whirring wheels a current of traffic a broad highway of steel thats the sort of monument i want to leave sometime ill come back and see it all completed and tell myself that i had a little part in making it come back he queried why youre going to stay till were through arent you oh no im going south with the spring flight on the next boat perhaps his face fell the exultant light gradually faded from his eyes why i had no idea arent you happy here she nodded but i must try to make good in my work as you have in yours he was looking at her sorrowfully almost as if she had deserted him thats too bad but i suppose you must go yes this is no place for you i dare say other people need you to bring sunshine and joy to them just as we old fellows do but ive never thought about your leaving it wouldnt be right to ask you to stay here among such people as we are when you have so much ahead of you still it will leave a gap yes it certainly will leave a gap she longed desperately to tell him how willingly she would stay if he only asked her but the very thought shocked her into a deeper reserve im going east to sell my book she said stiffly youve given me the climax of the story in this race with the seasons is it a love story he asked eliza flushed yes its mostly love youre not at all the girl i thought you when we first met youre very different im sure i wont recognize myself as the hero who or what is the girl in the story well shes just the kind of girl that would appeal to a person like you shes tall and dark and dashing and of course shes remarkably beautiful shes very feminine too whats her name miss appleton stammered why i called her violet until i could think of a better whats wrong with violet you couldnt think of a better name than that im fond of it oh its a good bookname but for real life its too delicate eliza felt with vexation that her face was burning she was sure he was laughing at her cant i read the manuscript he pleaded heavens no i she changed the subject abruptly ive left word to be called the minute the ice starts to go out i want to see the last act of the drama when oneil left her he was vaguely perplexed for something in her bearing did not seem quite natural he was forlorn too at the prospect of losing her he wondered if fathers suffered thus or if a lover could be more deeply pained at a parting than he somehow he seemed to share the feelings of both xxvii how a dream came true early on the following morning eliza was awakened by a sound of shouting outside her window she lay half dazed for a moment or two until the significance of the uproar made itself apparent then she leaped from her bed men were crying there she goes shes going out doors were slamming there was the rustle and scuff of flying feet and in the next room dan was evidently throwing himself into his clothes like a fireman eliza called to him but he did not answer and the next moment he had fled upsetting some article of furniture in his haste drawing her curtains aside the girl saw in the brightening dawn men pouring down the street dressing as they went they seemed half demented they were yelling at one another but she could not gather from their words whether it was the ice which was moving or the bridge the bridge that possibility set her to dressing with tremulous fingers her heart sick with fear she called to natalie but scarcely recognized her own voice i dont know came the muffled reply to her question it sounds like something terrible im afraid dan will fall in or get hurt the confusion in the street was growing eliza natalies voice was tragic what is it dear h help me quick how i cant find my other shoe but eliza was sitting on the floor lacing up her own stout boots and an instant later she followed her brother pursued by a wail of dismay from the adjoining chamber through the chill morning light she hurried asking many questions but receiving no coherent reply from the racing men then after endless moments of suspense she saw with relief that the massive superstructure of the bridge was still standing above the shouting she heard another sound indistinct but insistent it filled the air with a whispering movement it was punctuated at intervals by a dull rumbling and grinding she found the riverbank black with forms but like a cat she wormed her way through the crowd until the whole panorama lay before her the bridge stood as she had seen it on the yesterday slender strong superb in the simplicity of its splendid outline but beneath it and as far as her eyes could follow the river she saw not the solid spread of white to which she had become accustomed but a moving expanse of floes at first the winter burden slipped past in huge masses acres in extent but soon these began to be rent apart irregular black seams ran through them opened closed and threw up ridges of iceshavings as they ground together the floes were rubbing against the banks they came sliding out over the dry shore like tremendous sheets of cardboard manipulated by unseen hands and not until their ninefoot edges were exposed to view did the mind grasp the appalling significance of their movement they swept down in phalanxes upon the wedgelike icebreakers which stood guard above the bridgepiers then they halted separated and the armored cuttingedges sheared through them like blades a halfmile below where the salmon flung itself headlong against the upper wing of jackson glacier the floating ice was checked by the narrowed passageway there a jam was forming and as the river heaved and tore at its growing burden a spectacular struggle went on the sound of it came faintly but impressively to the watchers a grinding and crushing of bergs a roar of escaping waters fragments were upended masses were rearing themselves edgewise into the air were overturning and collapsing they were wedging themselves into every conceivable angle and the crowding procession from above was adding to the barrier momentarily as the passageway became blocked the waters rose the river piled itself up so swiftly that the eye could note its rise along the banks but the attention of the crowd was divided between the jam and something far out on the bridge itself at first glance eliza did not comprehend then she heard a man explaining he was going out when we got here and now he wont come back the girl gasped for she recognized the distant figure of a man dwarfed to puny proportions by the bulk of the structure in the mazes of which he stood the man was oneil he was perched upon one of the girders near the center of the longest span where he could watch the attack upon the pyramidal icebreakers beneath him hes a fool said some one at elizas back that jam is getting bigger hed better let the damned bridge take care of itself she turned and began to force her way through the press of people between her and the south abutment she arrived there disheveled and panting to find slater mellen and parker standing in the approach in front of them extended the long skeleton tunnel into which murray had gone mr oneil is out there she cried to tom slater turned and reading the tragic appeal in her face said reassuringly sure but hes all right they say theres danger happy toms round visage puckered into a doubtful smile oh hell take care of himself mellen turned to the girl and said briefly theres no danger whatever but elizas fear was not to be so easily quieted then why did he go out alone what are you men doing here its his orders tom told her mellen was staring at the jam below over which the salmon was hurling a flood of ice and foaming waters the stream was swelling and rising steadily already it had nearly reached the level of the timberline on the left bank the blockade was extending upstream almost to the bridge itself mellen said something to parker who shook his head silently dan appleton shouldered his way out of the crowd with natalie at his heels she had dressed herself in haste her hair was loose her jacket was buttoned awry on one foot was a shoe on the other a bedroom slipper muddy and sodden her dark eyes were big with excitement why dont you make murray come in dan demanded sharply he wont do it muttered slater the jam is growing nobody knows whatll happen if it holds much longer if the bridge should go mellen whirled crying savagely it wont go all hell couldnt take it out from the ranks of the workmen came a bellow of triumph as an unusually heavy icefloe was swept against the breakers and rent asunder the tumult of the imprisoned waters below was growing louder every moment across the lake came a stentorian rumble as a huge mass was loosened from the front of garfield the channel of the salmon where the onlookers stood was a heaving churning caldron over which the slim bridge flung itself defiantly eliza plucked at her brothers sleeve imploringly and he saw her for the first time hello sis he cried how did you get here is he in danger danny yes no mellen says its all right so it must be but that dam at that moment natalie began to sob hysterically and dan turned his attention to her but his sister was not of the hysterical kind seizing tom slater by the arm she tried to shake him demanding fiercely suppose the jam doesnt give way what will happen happy tom stared at her uncomprehendingly her voice was shrill and insistent suppose the water rises higher wont the ice sweep down on the bridge itself wont it wreck everything if it goes out suddenly tell me it cant hold mellen says so slater like the others found it impossible to keep his eyes from the river where those immeasurable forces were at play then in his peculiar irascible manner he complained i told em we was crazy to try this it aint a white mans country it aint a safe place for a bridge theres just one godawful thing after another he broke into a shout for eliza had slipped past him and was speeding like a shadow out across the irregularly spaced ties upon which the bridge track was laid mellen whirled at the cry and made after her but he might as well have tried to catch the wind as she ran she heard her brother shout in sudden alarm and natalies voice raised in entreaty but she sped on under an impulse as irresistible as panic fear down through the openings beneath her feet she saw as in a nightmare the sweeping flood burdened with plunging ice chunks and flecked with foam she seemed to be suspended above it yet she was running at reckless speed dimly aware of the consequences of a misjudged footstep but fearful only of being overtaken suddenly she hated her companions her mind was in a furious revolt at their cowardice their indecision or whatever it was that held them like a group of wooden figures safe on shore while the man whose life was worth all theirs put together exposed himself to needless peril that he was really in danger she felt sure she knew that murray was apt to lose himself in his dreams perhaps some visionary mood had blinded him to the menace of that mounting iceridge it front of the glacier or had he madly chosen to stand or fall with this structure that meant so much to him she would make him yield to her own terror drag him ashore if necessary with her own hands she stumbled but saved herself from a fall then gathered her skirts more closely and rushed on measuring with instinctive nicety the length of every stride it was not an easy path over which she dashed for the ties were unevenly spaced gaping apertures gave terrible glimpses of the river below and across these ghastly abysses she had to leap the hoarse bursts of shouting from the shore ceased as the workmen beheld her flitting out along the steel causeway they watched her in dumb amazement all at once oneil saw her and hurried to meet her eliza he cried be careful what possessed you to do this come away she gasped its dangerous the jam look she pointed down the channel he shook his head impatiently yes she pleaded yes please they wouldnt come to warn you they tried to stop me you must go ashore the frightened entreaty in her clear wideopen eyes the disorder that her haste had made affected oneil strangely he stared at her bewildered doubtful then steadied her and groped with his free hand for support he could feel her trembling wretchedly theres no danger none whatever he said soothingly nothing can happen you dont know the bridge has never been tried the ice is battering at it and that jam if it doesnt burst but it will it cant last much longer its rising to be sure but the river will overflow the bank please she urged you can do no good here im afraid he stared at her in the same incredulous bewilderment some impulse deep within him was struggling for expression but he could not find words to frame it his eyes were oddly bright as he smiled at her wont you go ashore she begged ill take you back of course but i want to stay and see then ill stay eliza her name burst from his lips in a tone that thrilled her but with it came a sudden uproar from the distant crowd and the next instant they saw that the icebarrier was giving way the pressure had become irresistible as the salmon had risen the ice had risen also and now the narrow throat was belching its contents forth the chaos of upended bergs was being torn apart over it and through it burst a deluge which filled the valley with the roar of a mighty cataract clouds of spray were in the air broken masses were leaping and somersaulting high up on the shore were stranded floes and fragments left in the wake of the moving body onward it coursed clashing and grinding along the brittle face of the glacier over the alder tops beyond the bend they could see it moving faster and faster like the crest of a tidal wave the surface of the river lowered swiftly beneath the bridge the huge white pans ground and milled shouldered aside by the ironsheathed pillars of concrete see its gone already once it clears a passageway well have no more gorges for the freshets are coming the bridge didnt even tremble there wasnt a tremor not a scratch eliza looked up to find oneil regarding her with an expression that set her heart throbbing and her thoughts scattering she clasped a huge cold bolthead and clung to it desperately for the upheaval in her soul rivaled that which had just passed before her eyes the bridge the river the valley itself were gyrating slowly dizzily eliza she did not answer child oneils voice was shaking why did you come to me why did you do this mad thing i saw something in your face that i cant believe that i cant think possible it it gives me courage if i dont speak quickly ill never dare is it true dear girl can it be im so old such a poor thing you couldnt possibly care and yet why did you come the words were torn from him he was gripped and shaken by a powerful emotion she tried to answer but her lips were soundless she closed her eyes and murray saw that she was whiter than the foam far beneath he stared into the colorless face upturned to his until her eyelids fluttered open and she managed to voice the words that clung in her throat ive always loved you like this he gave a cry like that of a starving man she felt herself drawn against him but now he too was speechless he could only press her close while his mind went groping for words to express that joy which was as yet unbelievable and stunning couldnt you see she asked breathlessly he shook his head im such a dreamer im afraid it cant be true im afraid youll go away and leave me you wont ever will you eliza i couldnt stand that then fresh realization of the truth swept over him they clung to each other drunk with ecstasy senseless of their surroundings i thought you cared for natalie she said softly after a while it was always you always always she turned her lips to his and lifted her entwining arms the breakfastgong had called the men away before the two figures far out upon the bridge picked their way slowly to the shore the salmon was still flooded with hurrying masses of ice as it would continue to be for several days but it was running free the channel in front of the glacier was open blaine was the first to shake oneils hand for the members of murrays crew held aloof in some embarrassment its a perfect piece of work said he i congratulate you the others echoed his sentiments faintly hesitatingly for they were abashed at what they saw in their chiefs face and realized that words were weak and meaningless dan dared not trust himself to speak he had many things to say to his sister but his throat ached miserably natalie restrained herself only by the greatest effort it was tom slater who ended the awkward pause by grumbling sarcastically if all the young lovers are safely ashore maybe us old men who built the bridge can go and get something to eat murray smiled at the girl beside him im afraid theyve guessed our secret dear secret slater rolled his eyes there aint over a couple thousand people beside us that saw you pop the question i spose she was out of breath and couldnt say no eliza gasped and fled to her brothers arms sis poor little sis dan cried and two tears stole down his brown cheeks isnt this just great then the others burst into a noisy expression of their gladness happy tom regarded them all pessimistically i feel bound to warn you he said at length that marriage is an awful gamble it aint what it seems it is natalie declared its better and you know it it turned out all right for me tom acknowledged because i got the best woman in the world but he eyed his chief accusingly i went about it in a modest way i didnt humiliate her in public he turned impatiently upon his companions still pouring out their babble of congratulations come along cant you he cried and leave em alone im a dyspeptic old married man but i used to be young and affectionate like murray after breakfast im going to cable mrs slater to come and bring the kids with her and watch her bedridden invalid husband build the rest of this railroad im getting chuck full of romance it has been a miraculous morning for me said murray after a time and the greatest miracle is you dear this is just the way the story ended in my book eliza told him happily our book he pressed her closer yes our book our bridge our everything eliza she hid her blushing face against his shoulder then with thumb and finger drew his ear down to her lips summoning her courage she whispered murray dear wont you call me violet the end
