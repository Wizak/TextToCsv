autres temps i mrs lidcote as the huge menacing mass of new york defined itself far off across the waters shrank back into her corner of the deck and sat listening with a kind of unreasoning terror to the steady onward drive of the screws she had set out on the voyage quietly enough in what she called her reasonable mood but the week at sea had given her too much time to think of things and had left her too long alone with the past when she was alone it was always the past that occupied her she couldnt get away from it and she didnt any longer care to during her long years of exile she had made her terms with it had learned to accept the fact that it would always be there huge obstructing encumbering bigger and more dominant than anything the future could ever conjure up and at any rate she was sure of it she understood it knew how to reckon with it she had learned to screen and manage and protect it as one does an afflicted member of ones family there had never been any danger of her being allowed to forget the past it looked out at her from the face of every acquaintance it appeared suddenly in the eyes of strangers when a word enlightened them yes the mrs lidcote dont you know it had sprung at her the first day out when across the diningroom from the captains table she had seen mrs lorin boulgers revolving eyeglass pause and the eye behind it grow as blank as a dropped blind the next day of course the captain had asked you know your ambassadress mrs boulger and she had replied that no she seldom left florence and hadnt been to rome for more than a day since the boulgers had been sent to italy she was so used to these phrases that it cost her no effort to repeat them and the captain had promptly changed the subject no she didnt as a rule mind the past because she was used to it and understood it it was a great concrete fact in her path that she had to walk around every time she moved in any direction but now in the light of the unhappy event that had summoned her from italy the sudden unanticipated news of her daughters divorce from horace pursh and remarriage with wilbour barkley the past her own poor miserable past started up at her with eyes of accusation became to her disordered fancy like the afflicted relative suddenly breaking away from nurses and keepers and publicly parading the horror and misery she had all the long years so patiently screened and secluded yes there it had stood before her through the agitated weeks since the news had come during her interminable journey from india where leilas letter had overtaken her and the feverish halt in her apartment in florence where she had had to stop and gather up her possessions for a fresh start there it had stood grinning at her with a new balefillness which seemed to say oh but youve got to look at me now because im not only your own past but leilas present certainly it was a masterstroke of those archironists of the shears and spindle to duplicate her own story in her daughters mrs lidcote had always somewhat grimly fancied that having so signally failed to be of use to leila in other ways she would at least serve her as a warning she had even abstained from defending herself from making the best of her case had stoically refused to plead extenuating circumstances lest leilas impulsive sympathy should lead to deductions that might react disastrously on her own life and now that very thing had happened and mrs lidcote could hear the whole of new york saying with one voice yes leilas done just what her mother did with such an example what could you expect yet if she had been an example poor woman she had been an awful one she had been she would have supposed of more use as a deterrent than a hundred blameless mothers as incentives for how could any one who had seen anything of her life in the last eighteen years have had the courage to repeat so disastrous an experiment well logic in such cases didnt count example didnt count nothing probably counted but having the same impulses in the blood and that was the dark inheritance she had bestowed upon her daughter leila hadnt consciously copied her she had simply taken after her had been a projection of her own longpast rebellion mrs lidcote had deplored when she started that the utopia was a slow steamer and would take eight full days to bring her to her unhappy daughter but now as the moment of reunion approached she would willingly have turned the boat about and fled back to the high seas it was not only because she felt still so unprepared to face what new york had in store for her but because she needed more time to dispose of what the utopia had already given her the past was bad enough but the present and future were worse because they were less comprehensible and because as she grew older surprises and inconsequences troubled her more than the worst certainties there was mrs boulger for instance in the light or rather the darkness of new developments it might really be that mrs boulger had not meant to cut her but had simply failed to recognize her mrs lidcote had arrived at this hypothesis simply by listening to the conversation of the persons sitting next to her on deck two lively young women with the latest paris hats on their heads and the latest new york ideas in them these ladies as to whom it would have been impossible for a person with mrs lidcotes oldfashioned categories to determine whether they were married or unmarried nice or horrid or any one or other of the definite things which young women in her youth and her society were conveniently assumed to be had revealed a familiarity with the world of new york that again according to mrs lidcotes traditions should have implied a recognized place in it but in the present fluid state of manners what did anything imply except what their hats implied that no one could tell what was coming next they seemed at any rate to frequent a group of idle and opulent people who executed the same gestures and revolved on the same pivots as mrs lidcotes daughter and her friends their coras matties and mabels seemed at any moment likely to reveal familiar patronymics and once one of the speakers summing up a discussion of which mrs lidcote had missed the beginning had affirmed with headlong confidence leila oh leilas all right could it be her leila the mother had wondered with a sharp thrill of apprehension if only they would mention surnames but their talk leaped elliptically from allusion to allusion their unfinished sentences dangled over bottomless pits of conjecture and they gave their bewildered hearer the impression not so much of talking only of their intimates as of being intimate with every one alive her old friend franklin ide could have told her perhaps but here was the last day of the voyage and she hadnt yet found courage to ask him great as had been the joy of discovering his name on the passengerlist and seeing his friendly bearded face in the throng against the taffrail at cherbourg she had as yet said nothing to him except when they had met of course im going out to leila she had said nothing to franklin ide because she had always instinctively shrunk from taking him into her confidence she was sure he felt sorry for her sorrier perhaps than any one had ever felt but he had always paid her the supreme tribute of not showing it his attitude allowed her to imagine that compassion was not the basis of his feeling for her and it was part of her joy in his friendship that it was the one relation seemingly unconditioned by her state the only one in which she could think and feel and behave like any other woman now however as the problem of new york loomed nearer she began to regret that she had not spoken had not at least questioned him about the hints she had gathered on the way he did not know the two ladies next to her he did not even as it chanced know mrs lorin boulger but he knew new york and new york was the sphinx whose riddle she must read or perish almost as the thought passed through her mind his stooping shoulders and grizzled head detached themselves against the blaze of light in the west and he sauntered down the empty deck and dropped into the chair at her side youre expecting the barkleys to meet you i suppose he asked it was the first time she had heard any one pronounce her daughters new name and it occurred to her that her friend who was shy and inarticulate had been trying to say it all the way over and had at last shot it out at her only because he felt it must be now or never i dont know i cabled of course but i believe shes at theyre at his place somewhere oh barkleys yes near lenox isnt it but shes sure to come to town to meet you he said it so easily and naturally that her own constraint was relieved and suddenly before she knew what she meant to do she had burst out she may dislike the idea of seeing people ide whose absent shortsighted gaze had been fixed on the slowly gliding water turned in his seat to stare at his companion who leila he said with an incredulous laugh mrs lidcote flushed to her faded hair and grew pale again it took me a long time to get used to it she said his look grew gently commiserating i think youll find he paused for a word that things are different now altogether easier thats what ive been wondering ever since we started she was determined now to speak she moved nearer so that their arms touched and she could drop her voice to a murmur you see it all came on me in a flash my going off to india and siam on that long trip kept me away from letters for weeks at a time and she didnt want to tell me beforehand oh i understand that poor child you know how good shes always been to me how shes tried to spare me and she knew of course what a state of horror id be in she knew id rush off to her at once and try to stop it so she never gave me a hint of anything and she even managed to muzzle susy suffern you know susy is the one of the family who keeps me informed about things at home i dont yet see how she prevented susys telling me but she did and her first letter the one i got up at bangkok simply said the thing was over the divorce i mean and that the very next day shed well i suppose there was no use waiting and he seems to have behaved as well as possible to have wanted to marry her as much as who barkley he helped her out i should say so why what do you suppose he interrupted himself hell be devoted to her i assure you oh of course im sure he will hes written me really beautifully but its a terrible strain on a mans devotion im not sure that leila realizes ide sounded again his little reassuring laugh im not sure that you realize theyre all right it was the very phrase that the young lady in the next seat had applied to the unknown leila and its recurrence on ides lips flushed mrs lidcote with fresh courage i wish i knew just what you mean the two young women next to me the ones with the wonderful hats have been talking in the same way what about leila about a leila i fancied it might be mine and about society in general all their friends seem to be divorced some of them seem to announce their engagements before they get their decree one of them her name was mabel as far as i could make out her husband found out that she meant to divorce him by noticing that she wore a new engagementring well you see leila did everything regularly as the french say ide rejoined yes but are these people in society the people my neighbours talk about he shrugged his shoulders it would take an arbitration commission a good many sittings to define the boundaries of society nowadays but at any rate theyre in new york and i assure you youre not youre farther and farther from it but ive been back there several times to see leila she hesitated and looked away from him then she brought out slowly and ive never noticed the least change in in my own case oh he sounded deprecatingly and she trembled with the fear of having gone too far but the hour was past when such scruples could restrain her she must know where she was and where leila was mrs boulger still cuts me she brought out with an embarrassed laugh are you sure youve probably cut her if not now at least in the past and in a cut if youre not first youre nowhere thats what keeps up so many quarrels the word roused mrs lidcote to a renewed sense of realities but the pursues she said the pursues are so strong there are so many of them and they all back each other up just as my husbands family did i know what it means to have a clan against one theyre stronger than any number of separate friends the pursues will never forgive leila for leaving horace why his mother opposed his marrying her because of of me she tried to get leila to promise that she wouldnt see me when they went to europe on their honeymoon and now shell say it was my example her companion vaguely stroking his beard mused a moment upon this then he asked with seeming irrelevance what did leila say when you wrote that you were coming she said it wasnt the least necessary but that id better come because it was the only way to convince me that it wasnt well then that proves shes not afraid of the purshes she breathed a long sigh of remembrance oh just at first you know one never is he laid his hand on hers with a gesture of intelligence and pity youll see youll see he said a shadow lengthened down the deck before them and a steward stood there proffering a marconigram oh now i shall know she exclaimed she tore the message open and then let it fall on her knees dropping her hands on it in silence ides enquiry roused her its all right oh quite right perfectly she cant come but shes sending susy suffern she says susy will explain after another silence she added with a sudden gush of bitterness as if i needed any explanation she felt ides hesitating glance upon her shes in the country yes prevented last moment longing for you expecting you love from both dont you see the poor darling that she couldnt face it no i dont he waited do you mean to go to her immediately it will be too late to catch a train this evening but i shall take the first tomorrow morning she considered a moment perhaps its better i need a talk with susy first shes to meet me at the dock and ill take her straight back to the hotel with me as she developed this plan she had the sense that ide was still thoughtfully even gravely considering her when she ceased he remained silent a moment then he said almost ceremoniously if your talk with miss suffern doesnt last too late may i come and see you when its over i shall be dining at my club and ill call you up at about ten if i may im off to chicago on business tomorrow morning and it would be a satisfaction to know before i start that your cousins been able to reassure you as i know she will he spoke with a shy deliberateness that even to mrs lidcotes troubled perceptions sounded a longsilenced note of feeling perhaps the breaking down of the barrier of reticence between them had released unsuspected emotions in both the tone of his appeal moved her curiously and loosened the tight strain of her fears oh yes come do come she said rising the huge threat of new york was imminent now dwarfing under long reaches of embattled masonry the great deck she stood on and all the little specks of life it carried one of them drifting nearer took the shape of her maid followed by luggageladen stewards and signing to her that it was time to go below as they descended to the main deck the throng swept her against mrs lorin boulgers shoulder and she heard the ambassadress call out to some one over the vexed sea of hats so sorry i should have been delighted but ive promised to spend sunday with some friends at lenox ii susy sufferns explanation did not end till after ten oclock and she had just gone when franklin ide who complying with an old new york tradition had caused himself to be preceded by a long white box of roses was shown into mrs lidcotes sittingroom he came forward with his shy halfhumorous smile and taking her hand looked at her for a moment without speaking its all right he then pronounced mrs lidcote returned his smile its extraordinary everythings changed even susy has changed and you know the extent to which susy used to represent the old new york theres no old new york left it seems she talked in the most amazing way she snaps her fingers at the pursues she told me me that every woman had a right to happiness and that selfexpression was the highest duty she accused me of misunderstanding leila she said my point of view was conventional she was bursting with pride at having been in the secret and wearing a brooch that wilbour barkleyd given her franklin ide had seated himself in the armchair she had pushed forward for him under the electric chandelier he threw back his head and laughed what did i tell you yes but i cant believe that susys not mistaken poor dear she has the habit of lost causes and she may feel that having stuck to me she can do no less than stick to leila but she didnt did she openly defy the world for you she didnt snap her fingers at the lidcotes mrs lidcote shook her head still smiling no it was enough to defy my family it was doubtful at one time if they would tolerate her seeing me and she almost had to disinfect herself after each visit i believe that at first my sisterinlaw wouldnt let the girls come down when susy dined with her well isnt your cousins present attitude the best possible proof that times have changed yes yes i know she leaned forward from her sofacorner fixing her eyes on his thin kindly face which gleamed on her indistinctly through her tears if its true its its dazzling she says leilas perfectly happy its as if an angel had gone about lifting gravestones and the buried people walked again and the living didnt shrink from them thats about it he assented she drew a deep breath and sat looking away from him down the long perspective of lampfringed streets over which her windows hung i can understand how happy you must be he began at length she turned to him impetuously yes yes im happy but im lonely too lonelier than ever i didnt take up much room in the world before but now where is there a corner for me oh since ive begun to confess myself why shouldnt i go on telling you this lifts a gravestone from me you see before this leila needed me she was unhappy and i knew it and though we hardly ever talked of it i felt that in a way the thought that id been through the same thing and down to the dregs of it helped her and her needing me helped me and when the news of her marriage came my first thought was that now shed need me more than ever that shed have no one but me to turn to yes under all my distress there was a fierce joy in that it was so new and wonderful to feel again that there was one person who wouldnt be able to get on without me and now what you and susy tell me seems to have taken my child from me and just at first thats all i can feel of course its all you feel he looked at her musingly why didnt leila come to meet you that was really my fault you see id cabled that i was not sure of being able to get off on the utopia and apparently my second cable was delayed and when she received it shed already asked some people over sunday one or two of her old friends susy says im so glad they should have wanted to go to her at once but naturally id rather have been alone with her you still mean to go then oh i must susy wanted to drag me off to ridgefield with her over sunday and leila sent me word that of course i might go if i wanted to and that i was not to think of her but i know how disappointed she would be susy said she was afraid i might be upset at her having people to stay and that if i minded she wouldnt urge me to come but if they dont mind why should i and of course if theyre willing to go to leila it must mean of course im glad you recognize that franklin ide exclaimed abruptly he stood up and went over to her taking her hand with one of his quick gestures theres something i want to say to you he began the next morning in the train through all the other contending thoughts in mrs lidcotes mind there ran the warm undercurrent of what franklin ide had wanted to say to her he had wanted she knew to say it once before when nearly eight years earlier the hazard of meeting at the end of a rainy autumn in a deserted swiss hotel had thrown them for a fortnight into unwonted propinquity they had walked and talked together borrowed each others books and newspapers spent the long chill evenings over the fire in the dim lamplight of her little pitchpine sittingroom and she had been wonderfully comforted by his presence and hard frozen places in her had melted and she had known that she would be desperately sorry when he went and then just at the end in his odd indirect way he had let her see that it rested with her to have him stay she could still relive the sleepless night she had given to that discovery it was preposterous of course to think of repaying his devotion by accepting such a sacrifice but how find reasons to convince him she could not bear to let him think her less touched less inclined to him than she was the generosity of his love deserved that she should repay it with the truth yet how let him see what she felt and yet refuse what he offered how confess to him what had been on her lips when he made the offer ive seen what it did to one man and there must never never be another the tacit ignoring of her past had been the element in which their friendship lived and she could not suddenly to him of all men begin to talk of herself like a guilty woman in a play somehow in the end she had managed it had averted a direct explanation had made him understand that her life was over that she existed only for her daughter and that a more definite word from him would have been almost a breach of delicacy she was so used to be having as if her life were over and at any rate he had taken her hint and she had been able to spare her sensitiveness and his the next year when he came to florence to see her they met again in the old friendly way and that till now had continued to be the tenor of their intimacy and now suddenly and unexpectedly he had brought up the question again directly this time and in such a form that she could not evade it putting the renewal of his plea after so long an interval on the ground that on her own showing her chief argument against it no longer existed you tell me leilas happy if shes happy she doesnt need you need you that is in the same way as before you wanted i know to be always in reach always free and available if she should suddenly call you to her or take refuge with you i understood that i respected it i didnt urge my case because i saw it was useless you couldnt i understood well enough have felt free to take such happiness as life with me might give you while she was unhappy and as you imagined with no hope of release even then i didnt feel as you did about it i understood better the trend of things here but ten years ago the change hadnt really come and i had no way of convincing you that it was coming still i always fancied that leila might not think her case was closed and so i chose to think that ours wasnt either let me go on thinking so at any rate till youve seen her and confirmed with your own eyes what susy suffern tells you iii all through what susy suffern told and retold her during their fourhours flight to the hills this plea of ides kept coming back to mrs lidcote she did not yet know what she felt as to its bearing on her own fate but it was something on which her confused thoughts could stay themselves amid the welter of new impressions and she was inexpressibly glad that he had said what he had and said it at that particular moment it helped her to hold fast to her identity in the rush of strange names and new categories that her cousins talk poured out on her with the progress of the journey miss sufferns communications grew more and more amazing she was like a cicerone preparing the mind of an inexperienced traveller for the marvels about to burst on it you wont know leila shes had her pearls reset sargents to paint her oh and i was to tell you that she hopes you wont mind being the least bit squeezed over sunday the house was built by wilbours father you know and its rather oldfashioned only ten spare bedrooms of course thats small for what they mean to do and shell show you the new plans theyve had made their idea is to keep the present house as a wing she told me to explain shes so dreadfully sorry not to be able to give you a sittingroom just at first theyre thinking of egypt for next winter unless of course wilbour gets his appointment oh didnt she write you about that why he wants borne you know the second secretaryship or rather he wanted england but leila insisted that if they went abroad she must be near you and of course what she says is law oh they quite hope theyll get it you see horaces uncle is in the cabinet one of the assistant secretaries and i believe he has a good deal of pull horaces uncle you mean wilbours i suppose mrs lidcote interjected with a gasp of which a fraction was given to miss sufferns flippant use of the language wilbours no i dont i mean horaces theres no bad feeling between them i assure you since horaces engagement was announced you didnt know horace was engaged why hes marrying one of bishop thorburys girls the redhaired one who wrote the novel that every ones talking about this flesh of mine theyre to be married in the cathedral of course horace can because it was leila who but as i say theres not the least feeling and horace wrote himself to his uncle about wilbour mrs lidcotes thoughts fled back to what she had said to ide the day before on the deck of the utopia i didnt take up much room before but now where is there a corner for me where indeed in this crowded topsyturvey world with its headlong changes and helterskelter readjustments its new tolerances and indifferences and accommodations was there room for a character fashioned by slower sterner processes and a life broken under their inexorable pressure and then in a flash she viewed the chaos from a new angle and order seemed to move upon the void if the old processes were changed her case was changed with them she too was a part of the general readjustment a tiny fragment of the new pattern worked out in bolder freer harmonies since her daughter had no penalty to pay was not she herself released by the same stroke the rich arrears of youth and joy were gone but was there not time enough left to accumulate new stores of happiness that of course was what franklin ide had felt and had meant her to feel he had seen at once what the change in her daughters situation would make in her view of her own it was almost wondrously enough as if leilas folly had been the means of vindicating hers everything else for the moment faded for mrs lidcote in the glow of her daughters embrace it was unnatural it was almost terrifying to find herself standing on a strange threshold under an unknown roof in a big hall full of pictures flowers firelight and hurrying servants and in this spacious unfamiliar confusion to discover leila bareheaded laughing authoritative with a strange young man jovially echoing her welcome and transmitting her orders but once mrs lidcote had her child on her breast and her childs its all right you old darling in her ears every other feeling was lost in the deep sense of wellbeing that only leilas hug could give the sense was still with her warming her veins and pleasantly fluttering her heart as she went up to her room after luncheon a little constrained by the presence of visitors and not altogether sorry to defer for a few hours the long talk with her daughter for which she somehow felt herself tremulously unready she had withdrawn on the plea of fatigue to the bright luxurious bedroom into which leila had again and again apologized for having been obliged to squeeze her the room was bigger and finer than any in her small apartment in florence but it was not the standard of affluence implied in her daughters tone about it that chiefly struck her nor yet the finish and complexity of its appointments it was the look it shared with the rest of the house and with the perspective of the gardens beneath its windows of being part of an establishment of something solid avowed founded on sacraments and precedents and principles there was nothing about the place or about leila and wilbour that suggested either passion or peril their relation seemed as comfortable as their furniture and as respectable as their balance at the bank this was in the whole confusing experience the thing that confused mrs lidcote most that gave her at once the deepest feeling of security for leila and the strongest sense of apprehension for herself yes there was something oppressive in the completeness and compactness of leilas wellbeing ide had been right her daughter did not need her leila with her first embrace had unconsciously attested the fact in the same phrase as ide himself and as the two young women with the hats its all right you old darling she had said and her mother sat alone trying to fit herself into the new scheme of things which such a certainty betokened her first distinct feeling was one of irrational resentment if such a change was to come why had it not come sooner here was she a woman not yet old who had paid with the best years of her life for the theft of the happiness that her daughters contemporaries were taking as their due there was no sense no sequence in it she had had what she wanted but she had had to pay too much for it she had had to pay the last bitterest price of learning that love has a price that it is worth so much and no more she had known the anguish of watching the man she loved discover this first and of reading the discovery in his eyes it was a part of her history that she had not trusted herself to think of for a long time past she always took a big turn about that haunted corner but now at the sight of the young man downstairs so openly and jovially leilas she was overwhelmed at the senseless waste of her own adventure and wrung with the irony of perceiving that the success or failure of the deepest human experiences may hang on a matter of chronology then gradually the thought of ide returned to her i chose to think that our case wasnt closed he had said she had been deeply touched by that to every one else her case had been closed so long finis was scrawled all over her but here was one man who had believed and waited and what if what he believed in and waited for were coming true if leilas all right should really foreshadow hers as yet of course it was impossible to tell she had fancied indeed when she entered the drawingroom before luncheon that a toosudden hush had fallen on the assembled group of leilas friends on the slender vociferous young women and the lounging golfstockinged young men they had all received her politely with the kind of petrified politeness that may be either a tribute to age or a protest at laxity but to them of course she must be an old woman because she was leilas mother and in a society so dominated by youth the mere presence of maturity was a constraint one of the young girls however had presently emerged from the group and attaching herself to mrs lidcote had listened to her with a blue gaze of admiration which gave the older woman a sudden happy consciousness of her longforgotten social graces it was agreeable to find herself attracting this young charlotte wynn whose mother had been among her closest friends and in whom something of the soberness and softness of the earlier manners had survived but the little colloquy broken up by the announcement of luncheon could of course result in nothing more definite than this reminiscent emotion no she could not yet tell how her own case was to be fitted into the new order of things but there were more people older people leila had put it arriving by the afternoon train and that evening at dinner she would doubtless be able to judge she began to wonder nervously who the newcomers might be probably she would be spared the embarrassment of finding old acquaintances among them but it was odd that her daughter had mentioned no names leila had proposed that later in the afternoon wilbour should take her mother for a drive she said she wanted them to have a nice quiet talk but mrs lidcote wished her talk with leila to come first and had moreover at luncheon caught stray allusions to an impending tennismatch in which her soninlaw was engaged her fatigue had been a sufficient pretext for declining the drive and she had begged leila to think of her as peacefully resting in her room till such time as they could snatch their quiet moment before tea then you duck leila with a last kiss had decided and presently mrs lidcote through her open window had heard the fresh loud voices of her daughters visitors chiming across the gardens from the tenniscourt iv leila had come and gone and they had had their talk it had not lasted as long as mrs lidcote wished for in the middle of it leila had been summoned to the telephone to receive an important message from town and had sent word to her mother that she couldnt come back just then as one of the young ladies had been called away unexpectedly and arrangements had to be made for her departure but the mother and daughter had had almost an hour together and mrs lidcote was happy she had never seen leila so tender so solicitous the only thing that troubled her was the very excess of this solicitude the exaggerated expression of her daughters annoyance that their first moments together should have been marred by the presence of strangers not strangers to me darling since theyre friends of yours her mother had assured her yes but i know your feeling you queer wild mother i know how youve always hated people hated people had leila forgotten why and thats why i told susy that if you preferred to go with her to ridgefield on sunday i should perfectly understand and patiently wait for our good hug but you didnt really mind them at luncheon did you dearest mrs lidcote at that had suddenly thrown a startled look at her daughter i dont mind things of that kind any longer she had simply answered but that doesnt console me for having exposed you to the bother of it for having let you come here when i ought to have ordered you off to ridgefield with susy if susy hadnt been stupid shed have made you go there with her i hate to think of you up here all alone again mrs lidcote tried to read something more than a rather obtuse devotion in her daughters radiant gaze im glad to have had a rest this afternoon dear and later oh yes later when all this fuss is over well more than make up for it shant we you precious darling and at this point leila had been summoned to the telephone leaving mrs lidcote to her conjectures these were still floating before her in cloudy uncertainty when miss suffern tapped at the door youve come to take me down to tea id forgotten how late it was mrs lidcote exclaimed miss suffern a plump peering little woman with prim hair and a conciliatory smile nervously adjusted the pendent bugles of her elaborate black dress miss suffern was always in mourning and always commemorating the demise of distant relatives by wearing the discarded wardrobe of their next of kin it isnt exactly mourning she would say but its the only stitch of black poor julia had and of course george was only my mothers stepcousin as she came forward mrs lidcote found herself humorously wondering whether she were mourning horace purshs divorce in one of his mothers old black satins oh did you mean to go down for tea susy suffern peered at her a little fluttered leila sent me up to keep you company she thought it would be cozier for you to stay here she was afraid you were feeling rather tired i was but ive had the whole afternoon to rest in and this wonderful sofa to help me leila told me to tell you that shed rush up for a minute before dinner after everybody had arrived but the train is always dreadfully late shes in despair at not giving you a sittingroom she wanted to know if i thought you really minded of course i dont mind its not like leila to think i should mrs lidcote drew aside to make way for the housemaid who appeared in the doorway bearing a table spread with a bewildering variety of teacakes leila saw to it herself miss suffern murmured as the door closed her one idea is that you should feel happy here it struck mrs lidcote as one more mark of the subverted state of things that her daughters solicitude should find expression in the multiplicity of sandwiches and the pipinghotness of muffins but then everything that had happened since her arrival seemed to increase her confusion the note of a motorhorn down the drive gave another turn to her thoughts are those the new arrivals already she asked oh dear no they wont be here till after seven miss suffern craned her head from the window to catch a glimpse of the motor it must be charlotte leaving was it the little wynn girl who was called away in a hurry i hope its not on account of illness oh no i believe there was some mistake about dates her mother telephoned her that she was expected at the stepleys at fishkill and she had to be rushed over to albany to catch a train mrs lidcote meditated im sorry shes a charming young thing i hoped i should have another talk with her this evening after dinner yes its too bad miss sufferns gaze grew vague you do look tired you know she continued seating herself at the teatable and preparing to dispense its delicacies you must go straight back to your sofa and let me wait on you the excitement has told on you more than you think and you mustnt fight against it any longer just stay quietly up here and let yourself go youll have leila to yourself on monday mrs lidcote received the teacup which her cousin proffered but showed no other disposition to obey her injunctions for a moment she stirred her tea in silence then she asked is it your idea that i should stay quietly up here till monday miss suffern set down her cup with a gesture so sudden that it endangered an adjacent plate of scones when she had assured herself of the safety of the scones she looked up with a fluttered laugh perhaps dear by tomorrow youll be feeling differently the air here you know yes i know mrs lidcote bent forward to help herself to a scone whos arriving this evening she asked miss suffern frowned and peered you know my wretched head for names leila told me but there are so many so many she didnt tell me she expected a big party oh not big but rather outside of her little group and of course as its the first time shes a little excited at having the older set the older set our contemporaries you mean why yes miss suffern paused as if to gather herself up for a leap the ashton gileses she brought out the ashton gileses really i shall be glad to see mary giles again it must be eighteen years said mrs lidcote steadily yes miss suffern gasped precipitately refilling her cup the ashton gileses and who else well the sam fresbies but the most important person of course is mrs lorin boulger mrs boulger leila didnt tell me she was coming didnt she i suppose she forgot everything when she saw you but the party was got up for mrs boulger you see its very important that she should well take a fancy to leila and wilbour his being appointed to rome virtually depends on it and you know leila insists on rome in order to be near you so she asked mary giles whos intimate with the boulgers if the visit couldnt possibly be arranged and marys cable caught mrs boulger at cherbourg shes to be only a fortnight in america and getting her to come directly here was rather a triumph yes i see it was said mrs lidcote you know shes rather rather fussy and mary was a little doubtful if if she would on account of leila mrs lidcote murmured well yes in her official position but luckily shes a friend of the barkleys and finding the gileses and fresbies here will make it all right the times have changed susy suffern indulgently summed up mrs lidcote smiled yes a few years ago it would have seemed improbable that i should ever again be dining with mary giles and harriet fresbie and mrs lorin boulger miss suffern did not at the moment seem disposed to enlarge upon this theme and after an interval of silence mrs lidcote suddenly resumed do they know im here by the way the effect of her question was to produce in miss suffern an exaggerated access of peering and frowning she twitched the teathings about fingered her bugles and looking at the clock exclaimed amazedly mercy is it seven already not that it can make any difference i suppose mrs lidcote continued but did leila tell them i was coming miss suffern looked at her with pain why you dont suppose dearest that leila would do anything mrs lidcote went on for of course its of the first importance as you say that mrs lorin boulger should be favorably impressed in order that wilbour may have the best possible chance of getting borne i told leila youd feel that dear you see its actually on your account so that they may get a post near you that leila invited mrs boulger yes i see that mrs lidcote abruptly rising from her seat turned her eyes to the clock but as you say its getting late oughtnt we to dress for dinner miss suffern at the suggestion stood up also an agitated hand among her bugles i do wish i could persuade you to stay up here this evening im sure leilad be happier if you would really youre much too tired to come down what nonsense susy mrs lidcote spoke with a sudden sharpness her hand stretched to the bell when do we dine at halfpast eight then i must really send you packing at my age it takes time to dress miss suffern thus projected toward the threshold lingered there to repeat leilall never forgive herself if you make an effort youre not up to but mrs lidcote smiled on her without answering and the icy lightwave propelled her through the door v mrs lidcote though she had made the gesture of ringing for her maid had not done so when the door closed she continued to stand motionless in the middle of her soft spacious room the fire which had been kindled at twilight danced on the brightness of silver and mirrors and sober gilding and the sofa toward which she had been urged by miss suffern heaped up its cushions in inviting proximity to a table laden with new books and papers she could not recall having ever been more luxuriously housed or having ever had so strange a sense of being out alone under the night in a windbeaten plain she sat down by the fire and thought a knock on the door made her lift her head and she saw her daughter on the threshold the intricate ordering of leilas fair hair and the flying folds of her dressinggown showed that she had interrupted her dressing to hasten to her mother but once in the room she paused a moment smiling uncertainly as though she had forgotten the object of her haste mrs lidcote rose to her feet time to dress dearest dont scold i shant be late to dress leila stood before her with a puzzled look why i thought dear i mean i hoped youd decided just to stay here quietly and rest her mother smiled but ive been resting all the afternoon yes but you know you do look tired and when susy told me just now that you meant to make the effort you came to stop me i came to tell you that you neednt feel in the least obliged of course i understand that there was a pause during which leila vaguely averting herself from her mothers scrutiny drifted toward the dressingtable and began to disturb the symmetry of the brushes and bottles laid out on it do your visitors know that im here mrs lidcote suddenly went on do they of course why naturally leila rejoined absorbed in trying to turn the stopper of a saltsbottle then wont they think it odd if i dont appear oh not in the least dearest i assure you theyll all understand leila laid down the bottle and turned back to her mother her face alight with reassurance mrs lidcote stood motionless her head erect her smiling eyes on her daughters will they think it odd if i do leila stopped short her lips half parted to reply as she paused the colour stole over her bare neck swept up to her throat and burst into flame in her cheeks thence it sent its devastating crimson up to her very temples to the lobes of her ears to the edges of her eyelids beating all over her in fiery waves as if fanned by some imperceptible wind mrs lidcote silently watched the conflagration then she turned away her eyes with a slight laugh i only meant that i was afraid it might upset the arrangement of your dinnertable if i didnt come down if you can assure me that it wont i believe ill take you at your word and go back to this irresistible sofa she paused as if waiting for her daughter to speak then she held out her arms run off and dress dearest and dont have me on your mind she clasped leila close pressing a long kiss on the last afterglow of her subsiding blush i do feel the least bit overdone and if it wont inconvenience you to have me drop out of things i believe ill basely take to my bed and stay there till your party scatters and now run off or youll be late and make my excuses to them all vi the barkleys visitors had dispersed and mrs lidcote completely restored by her two days rest found herself on the following monday alone with her children and miss suffern there was a note of jubilation in the air for the party had gone off so extraordinarily well and so completely as it appeared to the satisfaction of mrs lorin boulger that wilbours early appointment to rome was almost to be counted on so certain did this seem that the prospect of a prompt reunion mitigated the distress with which leila learned of her mothers decision to return almost immediately to italy no one understood this decision it seemed to leila absolutely unintelligible that mrs lidcote should not stay on with them till their own fate was fixed and wilbour echoed her astonishment why shouldnt you as leila says wait here till we can all pack up and go together mrs lidcote smiled her gratitude with her refusal after all its not yet sure that youll be packing up oh you ought to have seen wilbour with mrs boulger leila triumphed no you ought to have seen leila with her leilas husband exulted miss suffern enthusiastically appended i do think inviting harriet fresbie was a stroke of genius oh well be with you soon leila laughed so soon that its really foolish to separate but mrs lidcote held out with the quiet firmness which her daughter knew it was useless to oppose after her long months in india it was really imperative she declared that she should get back to florence and see what was happening to her little place there and she had been so comfortable on the utopia that she had a fancy to return by the same ship there was nothing for it therefore but to acquiesce in her decision and keep her with them till the afternoon before the day of the utopias sailing this arrangement fitted in with certain projects which during her two days seclusion mrs lidcote had silently matured it had become to her of the first importance to get away as soon as she could and the little place in florence which held her past in every fold of its curtains and between every page of its books seemed now to her the one spot where that past would be endurable to look upon she was not unhappy during the intervening days the sight of leilas wellbeing the sense of leilas tenderness were after all what she had come for and of these she had had full measure leila had never been happier or more tender and the contemplation of her bliss and the enjoyment of her affection were an absorbing occupation for her mother but they were also a sharp strain on certain overtightened chords and mrs lidcote when at last she found herself alone in the new york hotel to which she had returned the night before embarking had the feeling that she had just escaped with her life from the clutch of a giant hand she had refused to let her daughter come to town with her she had even rejected susy sufferns company she wanted no viaticum but that of her own thoughts and she let these come to her without shrinking from them as she sat in the same highhung sittingroom in which just a week before she and franklin ide had had their memorable talk she had promised her friend to let him hear from her but she had not kept her promise she knew that he had probably come back from chicago and that if he learned of her sudden decision to return to italy it would be impossible for her not to see him before sailing and as she wished above all things not to see him she had kept silent intending to send him a letter from the steamer there was no reason why she should wait till then to write it the actual moment was more favorable and the task though not agreeable would at least bridge over an hour of her lonely evening she went up to the writingtable drew out a sheet of paper and began to write his name and as she did so the door opened and he came in the words she met him with were the last she could have imagined herself saying when they had parted how in the world did you know that i was here he caught her meaning in a flash you didnt want me to then he stood looking at her i suppose i ought to have taken your silence as meaning that but i happened to meet mrs wynn who is stopping here and she asked me to dine with her and charlotte and charlottes young man they told me theyd seen you arriving this afternoon and i couldnt help coming up there was a pause between them which mrs lidcote at last surprisingly broke with the exclamation ah she did recognize me then recognize you he stared why oh i saw she did though she never moved an eyelid i saw it by charlottes blush the child has the prettiest blush i saw that her mother wouldnt let her speak to me ide put down his hat with an impatient laugh hasnt leila cured you of your delusions she looked at him intently then you dont think margaret wynn meant to cut me i think your ideas are absurd she paused for a perceptible moment without taking this up then she said at a tangent im sailing tomorrow early i meant to write to you theres the letter id begun ide followed her gesture and then turned his eyes back to her face you didnt mean to see me then or even to let me know that you were going till youd left i felt it would be easier to explain to you in a letter what in gods name is there to explain she made no reply and he pressed on it cant be that youre worried about leila for charlotte wynn told me shed been there last week and there was a big party arriving when she left fresbies and gileses and mrs lorin boulger all the board of examiners if leila has passed that shes got her degree mrs lidcote had dropped down into a corner of the sofa where she had sat during their talk of the week before i was stupid she began abruptly i ought to have gone to ridgefield with susy i didnt see till afterward that i was expected to you were expected to yes oh it wasnt leilas fault she suffered poor darling she was distracted but shed asked her party before she knew i was arriving oh as to that ide drew a deep breath of relief i can understand that it must have been a disappointment not to have you to herself just at first but after all you were among old friends or their children the gileses and fresbies and little charlotte wynn he paused a moment before the last name and scrutinized her hesitatingly even if they came at the wrong time you must have been glad to see them all at leilas she gave him back his look with a faint smile i didnt see them you didnt see them no that is excepting little charlotte wynn that child is exquisite we had a talk before luncheon the day i arrived but when her mother found out that i was staying in the house she telephoned her to leave immediately and so i didnt see her again the colour rushed to ides sallow face i dont know where you get such ideas she pursued as if she had not heard him oh and i saw mary giles for a minute too susy suffern brought her up to my room the last evening after dinner when all the others were at bridge she meant it kindly but it wasnt much use but what were you doing in your room in the evening after dinner why you see when i found out my mistake in coming how embarrassing it was for leila i mean i simply told her i was very tired and preferred to stay upstairs till the party was over ide with a groan struck his hand against the arm of his chair i wonder how much of all this you simply imagined i didnt imagine the fact of harriet fresbies not even asking if she might see me when she knew i was in the house nor of mary giless getting susy at the eleventh hour to smuggle her up to my room when the others wouldnt know where shed gone nor poor leilas ghastly fear lest mrs lorin boulger for whom the party was given should guess i was in the house and prevent her husbands giving wilbour the second secretaryship because shed been obliged to spend a night under the same roof with his motherinlaw ide continued to drum on his chairarm with exasperated fingers you dont know that any of the acts you describe are due to the causes you suppose mrs lidcote paused before replying as if honestly trying to measure the weight of this argument then she said in a low tone i know that leila was in an agony lest i should come down to dinner the first night and it was for me she was afraid not for herself leila is never afraid for herself but the conclusions you draw are simply preposterous there are narrowminded women everywhere but the women who were at leilas knew perfectly well that their going there would give her a sort of social sanction and if they were willing that she should have it why on earth should they want to withhold it from you thats what i told myself a week ago in this very room after my first talk with susy suffern she lifted a misty smile to his anxious eyes thats why i listened to what you said to me the same evening and why your arguments half convinced me and made me think that what had been possible for leila might not be impossible for me if the new dispensation had come why not for me as well as for the others i cant tell you the flight my imagination took franklin ide rose from his seat and crossed the room to a chair near her sofacorner all i cared about was that it seemed for the moment to be carrying you toward me he said i cared about that too thats why i meant to go away without seeing you they gave each other grave look for look because you see i was mistaken she went on we were both mistaken you say its preposterous that the women who didnt object to accepting leilas hospitality should have objected to meeting me under her roof and so it is but i begin to understand why its simply that society is much too busy to revise its own judgments probably no one in the house with me stopped to consider that my case and leilas were identical they only remembered that id done something which at the time i did it was condemned by society my case has been passed on and classified im the woman who has been cut for nearly twenty years the older people have half forgotten why and the younger ones have never really known its simply become a tradition to cut me and traditions that have lost their meaning are the hardest of all to destroy ide sat motionless while she spoke as she ended he stood up with a short laugh and walked across the room to the window outside the immense black prospect of new york strung with its myriad lines of light stretched away into the smoky edges of the night he showed it to her with a gesture what do you suppose such words as youve been using society tradition and the rest mean to all the life out there she came and stood by him in the window less than nothing of course but you and i are not out there were shut up in a little tight round of habit and association just as were shut up in this room remember i thought id got out of it once but what really happened was that the other people went out and left me in the same little room the only difference was that i was there alone oh ive made it habitable now im used to it but ive lost any illusions i may have had as to an angels opening the door ide again laughed impatiently well if the door wont open why not let another prisoner in at least it would be less of a solitude she turned from the dark window back into the vividly lighted room it would be more of a prison you forget that i know all about that were all imprisoned of course all of us middling people who dont carry our freedom in our brains but weve accommodated ourselves to our different cells and if were moved suddenly into new ones were likely to find a stone wall where we thought there was thin air and to knock ourselves senseless against it i saw a man do that once ide leaning with folded arms against the windowframe watched her in silence as she moved restlessly about the room gathering together some scattered books and tossing a handful of torn letters into the paperbasket when she ceased he rejoined all you say is based on preconceived theories why didnt you put them to the test by coming down to meet your old friends dont you see the inference they would naturally draw from your hiding yourself when they arrived it looked as though you were afraid of them or as though you hadnt forgiven them either way you put them in the wrong instead of waiting to let them put you in the right if leila had buried herself in a desert do you suppose society would have gone to fetch her out you say you were afraid for leila and that she was afraid for you dont you see what all these complications of feeling mean simply that you were too nervous at the moment to let things happen naturally just as youre too nervous now to judge them rationally he paused and turned his eyes to her face dont try to just yet give yourself a little more time give me a little more time ive always known it would take time he moved nearer and she let him have her hand with the grave kindness of his face so close above her she felt like a child roused out of frightened dreams and finding a light in the room perhaps youre right she heard herself begin then something within her clutched her back and her hand fell away from him i know im right trust me he urged well talk of this in florence soon she stood before him feeling with despair his kindness his patience and his unreality everything he said seemed like a painted gauze let down between herself and the real facts of life and a sudden desire seized her to tear the gauze into shreds she drew back and looked at him with a smile of superficial reassurance you are right about not talking any longer now im nervous and tired and it would do no good i brood over things too much as you say i must try not to shrink from people she turned away and glanced at the clock why its only ten if i send you off i shall begin to brood again and if you stay we shall go on talking about the same thing why shouldnt we go down and see margaret wynn for half an hour she spoke lightly and rapidly her brilliant eyes on his face as she watched him she saw it change as if her smile had thrown a too vivid light upon it oh no not tonight he exclaimed not tonight why what other night have i when im off at dawn besides i want to show you at once that i mean to be more sensible that im not going to be afraid of people any more and i should really like another glimpse of little charlotte he stood before her his hand in his beard with the gesture he had in moments of perplexity come she ordered him gaily turning to the door he followed her and laid his hand on her arm dont you think hadnt you better let me go first and see they told me theyd had a tiring day at the dressmakers i daresay they have gone to bed but you said theyd a young man of charlottes dining with them surely he wouldnt have left by ten at any rate ill go down with you and see

new thought struck her or wait my maids in the next room ill tell her to go and ask if margaret will receive me yes thats much the best way she turned back and went toward the door that led to her bedroom but before she could open it she felt ides quick touch again i believe i remember now charlottes young man was suggesting that they should all go out to a musichall or something of the sort im sure im positively sure that you wont find them her hand dropped from the door his dropped from her arm and as they drew back and faced each other she saw the blood rise slowly through his sallow skin redden his neck and ears encroach upon the edges of his beard and settle in dull patches under his kind troubled eyes she had seen the same blush on another face and the same impulse of compassion she had then felt made her turn her gaze away again a knock on the door broke the silence and a porter put his head into the room its only just to know how many pieces therell be to go down to the steamer in the morning with the words she felt that the veil of painted gauze was torn in tatters and that she was moving again among the grim edges of reality oh dear she exclaimed i never can remember wait a minute i shall have to ask my maid she opened her bedroom door and called out annette
