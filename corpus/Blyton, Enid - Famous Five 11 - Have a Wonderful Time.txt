and now theyre off for a wonderful fortnight and im not with them dont be silly george said her mother you can go as soon as that cold of yours is better its better now said george scowling mother you know it is thats enough georgina said her father looking up from his newspaper this is the third breakfasttime weve had this argument be quiet george would never answer anyone when she was called georgina so much as she would have liked to say something back she pursed up her mouth and looked away her mother laughed oh george dear dont look so terribly fierce it was your own fault you got this cold you would go and bathe and stay in far too long and after all its only the third week in april i always bathe in april said george sulkily i said be quiet said her father banging down his paper on the table one more word from you george and you wont go to your three cousins at all woof said timmy from under the table he didnt like it when anyone spoke angrily to george and dont you start arguing with me either said georges father poking timmy with his toe and scowling exactly like george his wife laughed again oh be quiet the two of you she said george be patient dear ill let you go

night im perfectly all right today oh if i can go off to faynights castle tomorrow i promise i wont cough once today whats this about faynights castle demanded her father looking up again first ive heard of it oh no quentin dear ive told you at least three times said his wife julian dick and anne have been lent two funny old caravans by a school friend they are in a field near faynights castle oh so theyre not staying in a castle then said georges father cant have that i wont have george coming home all high and mighty george couldnt possibly be high and mighty said his wife its as much as i can do to get her to keep her nails clean and wear clean shorts do be sensible quentin you know perfectly well that george and her cousins always like to go off on extraordinary holidays together and have adventures grinned george who was now in a very good temper indeed at the thought of going to join her cousins the next day no youre not to have any of those awful adventures this time said her mother anyway i dont see how you can staying in a peaceful place like the village of faynights castle living in a couple of old caravans i wouldnt trust george anywhere said her husband give her just a sniff of an adventure and shes after it i never knew anyone like george thank goodness weve only got one child i dont feel as if i could cope with two or three georges there are plenty of people like george said his wife julian and dick for instance always in the middle of something or other with anne tagging behind longing for a peaceful life well ive had enough of this argument said georges father pushing his chair out vigorously and accidentally kicking timmy under the table he yelped that dogs got no brains said the impatient man lies under the table at every meal and expects me to remember hes there well im going to do some work he went out of the room the diningroom door banged then the study door banged then a window was shut with a bang a fire was poked very vigorously there was the creak of an armchair as someone sat down in it heavily then there was silence now your fathers lost to the world till lunchtime said georges mother dear oh dear ive told him at least three times about faynights castle where your cousins are staying bless him now george i do really think you can go tomorrow dear you look so much better today you can get your things ready and ill pack them this afternoon thank you mother said george giving her a sudden hug anyway father will be glad to have me out of the house for a bit im too noisy for him youre a pair said her mother remembering the slammed doors and other things youre both a perfect nuisance at times but i couldnt bear to do without you oh timmy are you still under the table i wish you wouldnt leave your tail about so did i hurt you oh he doesnt mind you treading on it mother said george generously im going to get my things ready this very minute how do i get to faynights castle by train yes ill take you to kirrin station and you can catch the tenforty said her mother you change at limming ho and take the train that goes to faynights if you send a card to julian hell get it tomorrow morning and will meet you ill write it now said george happily oh mother i began to be afraid this awful cold would hang on all through the holidays i shant bathe again on such a cold day in april you said that last year and the year before that too said her mother you have a very short memory george come on timmy said george and the two of them went out of the door like a whirlwind it slammed behind them and the house shook at once the study door opened and an angry voice yelled loudly whos that slamming doors when im at work cant anybody in this house shut a door quietly george grinned as she fled upstairs the biggest slammerofdoors was her father but he only heard the slams made by other people george turned her writingcase inside out to find a postcard she must post it at once or julian wouldnt get it and it would be so nice to have all her three cousins meeting her were off tomorrow she told timmy who looked up at her and wagged his tail vigorously yes youre coming too of course then the five will all be together again the famous five youll like that wont you tim so shall i she scribbled the postcard and flew down to post it slam went the front door and her father almost jumped out of his skin he was a very clever and hardworking scientist impatient hottempered kindly and very forgetful how he wished his daughter was not so exactly like him but was like his quiet gentle little niece anne george posted the card it was short and to the point cold gone coming tomorrow arriving so make sure you all meet me and timmy our tails are well up i can tell you george george turned out her drawers and began to pick out the things she wanted to take with her her mother came to help there was always an argument about packing because george wanted to take as little as possible and no warm things at all and her mother had exactly opposite ideas however between the two of them they managed to pack the suitcase full of quite sensible things george refused as usual to take a dress of any sort i wonder when youll grow out of wanting to be a boy and of acting like one said her mother exasperated all right all right take those awful old shorts if you want to and that red jersey but you are to pack those warm vests i put them in once and you took them out and you must take a warm rug julian says the caravans are not very warm this weather i wonder what theyre like said george stuffing the vests in theyre funny oldfashioned ones julian said in his letter perhaps theyre like the gypsies have not the modern streamlined ones that are pulled along by cars youll see tomorrow said her mother oh george youre coughing again just the dust thats all said george going purple in the face trying to hold back the tickle in her throat she drank a glass of water in a hurry it would be too dreadful if her mother said she wasnt to go after all however her mother really did think that george was better she had been in bed for a week making a terrible fuss and being a very difficult patient now after being up for a few days she really seemed herself again it will do her good to get down to faynights and its good strong air thought her mother she needs company again too she doesnt like having to be all alone knowing the others are holidaying without her george felt happy that evening only one more night and she would be off to a fortnights caravanning if only the weather was good what a fine time they would have suddenly the telephone shrilled out rrrrrrring rrrrrring georges mother went to answer it hallo she said oh its you julian is everything all right george sped out into the hall at once oh surely surely nothing had happened surely julian wasnt ringing to tell her not to come she listened breathlessly whats that you say julian i cant make out what youre talking about dear yes of course your uncle is all right why shouldnt he be no he hasnt disappeared julian what are you talking about george listened impatiently what was all this but it turned out to be something quite ordinary really when at last her mother put down the receiver she told george dont hop about like that george its quite all right you can go tomorrow julian was only ringing up to make sure that your father wasnt one of the scientists who have suddenly disappeared apparently in tonights paper there is a short report about two that have completely vanished and dear old julian wanted to make sure your father was here safely as if father would vanishsaid george scornfully julian must be mad its just two more of those silly scientists who are disloyal to this country and disappear to another country to sell our secrets i could have told julian that chapter two all together again contents prevnext next morning on a dewy hillside a good distance from kirrin where george lived two boys leapt down the steps of a caravan and went to one nearby they rapped on the door anne are you awake its a heavenly day of course im awake cried a voice the doors unlocked come in im getting breakfast julian and dick pushed open the bluepainted door anne was standing at a little stove at one end of her caravan boiling eggs in a saucepan i cant look round she said im timing them by my watch one minute more to go the postman has just brought a card from george said julian she says her tail and timmys are both well up im glad shes coming at last and old timmy too well all go and meet her said anne still with her eyes on her watch twenty seconds more we only came here ourselves three days ago said dick so she hasnt really missed much surely those eggs will be hardboiled anne anne stopped looking at her watch no they wont theyll be just right she scooped them out of the little saucepan with a big spoon put them in the eggcups dick there they arejust under your nose dick picked an egg up from the plate on which anne had placed them it was so hot that he dropped it with a yell and it broke its shell yolk flowed out of it dick you saw me take it out of boiling water said anne now ive got to do another its a pity old timmy isnt here hed soon have licked that broken egg up from the floor and saved me clearing up the mess well eat our breakfast sitting on the steps of your caravan anne said julian the suns so lovely so they all sat there eating boiled eggs wellbuttered bread with chunky homemade marmalade afterwards and then juicy apples the sun shone down and julian took off his coat their two caravans were set on a sloping grassy hillside a tall hedge grew behind and kept off the wind primroses ran in a pale gold streak under the hedge and brilliant celandines shone in the sun turning their polished faces towards it not far off were three more caravans but they were modern ones the people staying in those were not yet up and the doors were fast shut the three children had had no chance of making friends with them on the opposite hill rose an old ruined castle whose great walls still defied the gales that sometimes blew over the hills it had four towers three were very much broken but the fourth looked almost complete the windows were slitholes made centuries back when archers shot their arrows from them a very steep pathway led up to the castle at the top of it was a gateway enormously strong built of big white blocks of stone the gateway was now filled by a great screen of wroughtiron to prevent anyone entering and the only entrance was by a small tower in which was a narrow door here there was a turnstile through which visitors might go to see the old castle a high strong wall ran all round the castle still standing after so many years bits of the top of it had fallen down the hill and lay halfburied in grass and weeds it had once been a magnificent old castle built on the high steep hill for safety a place from which the castle guards might see the country easily for miles around as julian said anyone up in one of the towers or even on the wall would be able to see enemies approaching from seven counties there would be plenty of time to shut the great gate man the walls and get ready to withstand quite a long siege if necessary the three of them sat on the steps lazing in the sun when they had finished their breakfast they looked at the ruined old castle and watched the jackdaws circling round the four towers there must be about a thousand jackdaws there said dick i wish we had fieldglasses so that we could watch them it would be as good as a circus i love the way they all fly up together and circle round and round and yet never bump into one another do they nest in that old castle asked anne oh yes they fill up the towers with big sticks said dick and put their nests on the top i bet wed find the ground beneath the towers strewn ankledeep in sticks if we went to see well lets go one day when george is here said anne it only costs five pence to go in i like old castles i like the feel of old places so do i said julian i hope george brings the fieldglasses she had for her birthday we could take them up into the castle with us and see all round the countryside for miles and miles we could count the seven counties i must wash up said anne getting up i must tidy the caravans too before george comes you dont really think old george will notice if theyre tidy or not do you said dick it will be a waste of your time anne but anne always enjoyed tidying things and putting them away in cupboards or on shelves she liked having the two caravans to look after she had just got used to them nicely and was looking forward to showing george round them she skipped over to the hedge and picked a great bunch of primroses back she went and divided them into two she stuffed half into one little blue bowl set their green crinkled leaves round them and then put the other half into a second bowl there you go with the green and yellow curtains she said she was soon very busy sweeping and dusting she debated whether to send dick to the stream to wash the breakfast things and decided not to dick wasnt too good with crockery and it was not theirs to break it belonged to the owner of the caravans by the time it was halfpast eleven the caravans were spick and span georges sheets and blankets were on the shelf above her bunk which in the daytime let down neatly against the wall to make more room anne had a bunk on the opposite side this is the kind of holiday i like said anne to herself somewhere small to live fields and hills just outside picnicky meals and not too much adventure what are you murmuring about anne said dick peeping in at the window did i hear something about adventure are you looking for one already good gracious no said anne its the last thing i want and the last thing well get too in this quiet little place thank goodness dick grinned well you never know he said are you ready to come and meet george anne its about time we went anne went down the steps and joined dick and julian better lock the door said dick weve locked ours he locked annes door and the three set off down the grassy hillside to the stile that led into the lane below the old castle on the opposite hill seemed to tower up higher and higher as they went down and down towards the village it will be lovely to see timmy again said anne and ill be jolly glad to have george too in my caravan i didnt really mind being alone at night but its always nice to have george near me and timmy grunting in his sleep you want to sleep with dick if you like grunts and snorts and moans said julian what do you dream about dick you must have more nightmares than anyone else in the kingdom i never grunt or snort or moan said dick indignantly you want to hear yourself why look isnt that the train coming in isnt that it curving round the line in the distance said anne it must be theres only one train in the morning here wed better run they ran at top speed the train drew in at the station just as they raced on to the platform a head of short curly hair looked out from a windowand then another dark brown head just below it george and timmy yelled anne hallo shouted george almost falling out of the door woof barked timmy and leapt down to the platform almost on top of dick down jumped george her eyes shining she hugged anne and gave julian and dick a punch each im here she said i felt awful knowing you were away camping without me i gave poor old mother a dreadful time i bet you did said julian and linked his arm in hers let me take that suitcase well just slip into the village first and have a few icecreams to celebrate theres a shop here that has some jolly decent ones good i feel exactly like icecreams said george happily look timmy knows what you said his tongue is hanging out for an icecream already timmy arent you pleased were all together again woof said timmy and licked annes hand for the twentieth time i really ought to bring a towel with me when i meet timmy said anne his licks are so very wet oh no not again timmy go and use your tongue on julian i say look george has brought her fieldglasses with her said dick suddenly noticing that the brown strap over georges shoulder did not belong to a camera but to a very fine leather case that held the new fieldglasses good we wanted to watch the jackdaws with them and there are some herons down on the marsh too well i thought i must bring them said george its the first hols ive had a chance to use them mother wouldnt let me take them to school i sayhow much further is this icecream shop in the dairy here said julian marching her in and i advise you to start off with vanilla go on to strawberry and finish up with chocolate you do have good ideas said george i hope youve got some money as well if were going to eat icecreams at this rate mother didnt give me very much to spend they sat down and ordered icecreams the plump little shopwoman smiled at them she knew them by now this is very good weather for you she said are there many caravanners up on faynights field no not many said julian beginning his ice well youre going to have a few more said the little plump lady i hear theres some fairfolk coming they usually camp up in your field youll have some fun if so oh good said dick well really be able to make a few friends then we like fairfolk dont we timmy chapter three a pleasant morning contents prevnext is there going to be a fair near here then asked george starting on her strawberry ice what sort of a fair a circus or something no just a mixedup show said the shopwoman theres to be a fireeater and thatll bring the villagers to the show faster than anything a fireeater did you ever hear of such a thing i wonder that anyone cares to make a living at that what else is there to be asked anne she didnt somehow fancy watching anyone eating fire well theres a man who can get himself free in under two minutes no matter how tightly hes tied up with rope said the woman fair miracle he must be and theres a man called mr indiarubber because he can bend himself anywhere and wriggle through drainpipes and get in at a window if its left open just a crack gracious hed make a good burglar said george i wish i was like indiarubber can this man bounce when he falls down everyone laughed what else said anne this sounds very exciting theres a man with snakes said the plump little lady with a shudder snakes just fancy id be afraid they would bite me id run a mile if i saw a snake coming at me are they poisonous snakes that he has i wonder said dick i dont somehow fancy having a caravan next to ours with lashings of poisonous snakes crawling round dont said anne i should go home at once another customer came in and the shopwoman had to leave the children and go to serve her the four felt rather thrilled what a bit of luck to have such exciting people in the same field as they were a fireeater said dick ive always wanted to see one i bet he doesnt really eat fire hed burn the whole of his mouth and throat has everyone finished asked julian getting some money out of his pocket if so well take george up to the field and show her our gay caravans they arent a bit like the ones we once went caravanning in george they are oldfashioned gypsy ones youll like them gay and very picturesque who lent you them asked george as they left the shop some school friend wasnt it yes he and his family always go and camp in their caravans in the easter and summer hols said julian but this easter theyre going to france and rather than leave them empty they thought theyd lend them outand were the lucky ones they walked up the lane and came to the stile george looked up at the towering castle gleaming in the sun on the hill opposite faynights castle she said hundreds of years old how id love to know all the things that happened there through the centuries i do love old things i vote we go and explore it we will it only costs five pence said dick well all have a good five penceworth of castle i wonder if there are any dungeons dark damp drear and dreadful they went up the grassy hillside to the field where their caravans were george exclaimed in delight oh are those our caravans arent they gay theyre just like the caravans the gypsies use only these look cleaner and gayer the red caravan picked out with black and yellow is ours said dick the blue one picked out in black and yellow is yours and annes woof said timmy at once oh sorry yours too timmy said dick at once and everyone chuckled it was queer the way timmy suddenly made a woofish remark just as if he really understood every word that was said george was quite certain he did of course the caravans stood on high wheels there was a window each side the door was at the front and so were the steps of course gay curtains hung at the windows and a line of bold carving ran round the edges of the outjutting roof they are old gypsy caravans painted and made really up to date said julian theyre jolly comfortable inside too bunks that fold down against the walls in the daytime a little sink for washingup though we usually use the stream because its such a fag to fetch water a small larder cupboards and shelves cork carpet on the floor with warm rugs so that no draught comes through you sound as if you are trying to sell them to me said george with a laugh you neednt i love them both and i think theyre miles nicer than the modern caravans down there somehow these seem real oh the others are real enough said julian and theyve got more space but space doesnt matter to us because we shall live outside most of the time do we have a campfire asked george eagerly oh yes i see we do theres the ashy patch where you had your fire oh julian do lets have a fire there at night and sit round it in the darkness with midges biting us and bats flapping all round said dick yes certainly we will come inside george shes to come into my caravan first said anne and pushed george up the steps george was really delighted she was very happy to think she was going to have a peaceful two weeks here with her three cousins and timmy she pulled her bunk up and down to see how it worked she opened the larder and cupboard doors then she went to see the boys caravan how tidy she said in surprise i expected annes to be tidy but yours is just as spick and span oh dear i hope you havent all turned over a new leaf and become models of neatness i havent dont worry said dick with a grin anne has been at work you know how she loves to put everything in its place we dont need to worry about anything when shes about good old anne all the same george will have to help me said anne firmly i dont expect boys to tidy up and cook and do things like that but george ought to because shes a girl if only id been born a boy groaned george all right anne ill do my share sometimes i say there wont be much room for timmy on my bunk at nights will there well hes not coming on mine said anne he can sleep on the floor on a rug cant you timmy woof said timmy without wagging his tail at all he looked very disapproving there you are he says he wouldnt dream of doing such a thing said george he always sleeps on my feet they went outside again it really was a lovely day the primroses opened more and more of their little yellow flowers and a blackbird suddenly burst into a fluting song on the bough of a hawthorn tree in the hedge nearby did anyone get a paper in the village asked dick oh you did julian good lets have a look at the weather forecast if its good we might go for a long walk this afternoon the sea is not really very far off julian took the folded paper from his pocket and threw it over to dick he sat down on the steps of his caravan and opened it he was looking for the paragraph giving the weather forecast when headlines caught his eye he gave an exclamation hallo heres a bit more about those two vanished scientists julian oh said george remembering julians telephone call of the night before julian whatever in the world made you think my father could be one of the vanished scientists as if he would ever be disloyal to his country and take his secrets anywhere else oh i didnt think that said julian at once of course i didnt id never think uncle quentin would do a thing like that noin yesterdays paper it just said that two of our most famous scientists had disappearedand i thought perhaps they had been kidnapped and as uncle quentin is really very famous i just thought id ring up to make sure oh said george well as mother hadnt heard a thing about them she was awfully astonished when you asked her if father had disappeared especially as he was banging about just then in the study looking for something he had lost which he was sitting on as usual i suppose said dick with a grin but listen to this it doesnt look as if the two men have been kidnapped it looks as if they just walked out and took important papers with them beasts theres too much of that sort of thing nowadays it seems tome he read out a paragraph or two derek terrykane and jeffrey pottersham have been missing for two days they met at a friends house to discuss a certain aspect of their work and then left together to walk to the underground since then they have not been seen it has however been established that terrykane had brought his passport up to date and had purchased tickets for flying to paris no news of his arrival there has been reported there just what i said to mother exclaimed george theyve gone off to sell their secrets to another country why do we let them uncle quentin wont be pleased about that said julian didnt he work with terrykane at one time yes i believe he did said george im jolly glad im not at home today father will be rampaging round like anything telling mother hundreds of times what he thinks about scientists who are traitors he certainly will said julian i dont blame him either thats a thing i dont understand to be a traitor to ones own country it leaves a nasty taste in my mouth to think of it come on lets think about dinner anne what are we going to have fried sausages and onions potatoes a tin of sliced peaches and ill make a custard said anne at once ill fry the sausages said dick ill light the fire out here and get the fryingpan anyone like their sausages split in the cooking everyone did i like mine nice and burnt said george how many do we have each ive only had those icecreams since breakfast there are twelve said anne giving dick the bag three each none for timmy but ive got a large juicy bone for him julian will you get me some water please theres the pail over there i want to peel the potatoes george can you possibly open the peaches without cutting yourself like you did last time yes captain said george with a grin ah this is like old times good food good company and a good time three cheers for us chapter four the fairfolk arrive contents prevnext that first day they were all together was a lovely one they enjoyed it thoroughly especially george who had fretted all by herself for two weeks at home timmy was very happy too he tore after rabbits most of them quite imaginary up and down the field and in and out the hedges till he was tired out then he would come and fling himself down by the four panting like a steamengine going uphill his long pink tongue hanging out of his mouth you make me feel hot just to look at you timmy said anne pushing him away look george hes so hot hes steaming one of these days timmy youll blow up they went for a walk in the afternoon but didnt quite get to the sea they saw it from a hill sparkling blue in the distance little white yachts dotted the blue water like faroff swans with wings outspread they had tea at a farmhouse watched by a couple of bigeyed farmchildren do you want to take some of my homemade jam with you asked the farmers jolly redfaced wife when they paid her for their tea oh yes rather said dick and i suppose you couldnt sell us some of that fruitcake were camping in caravans in faynights field just opposite the castle so were having picnic meals each day yes you can have a whole cake said the farmers wife i did rny baking yesterday so theres plenty and would you like some ham and ive some good pickled onions too this was wonderful they bought all the food very cheaply indeed and carried it home gladly dick took off the lid of the pickled onions halfway back to the caravans and sniffed better than any scent he said have a sniff george it didnt stop at sniffs of course everyone took out a large pickled onion except timmy who backed away at once onions were one thing he really couldnt bear dick put back the lid i think somebody else ought to carry the onions not dick said anne there wont be many left by the time we reach our caravans when they climbed over the stile at the bottom of the field the sun was going down the evening star had appeared in the sky and twinkled brightly as they trudged up to their caravans julian stopped and pointed hallo look there are two more caravans hererather like ours i wonder if its the fairfolk arriving and theres another one see coming up the lane said dick it will have to go to the fieldgate because it cant come the way we do over the stile there it goes we shall soon have plenty of exciting neighbours said anne pleased they went up to their own caravans and looked curiously at the one that stood near to theirs it was yellow picked out with blue and black and could have done with a new coat of paint it was very like their own caravans but looked much older there didnt seem to be anyone about the newlyarrived vans the doors and windows were shut the four stood and looked curiously at them theres a big box under that nearest caravan said julian i wonder whats in it the box was long shallow and wide on the sides were round holes punched into it at intervals george went to the caravan and bent down to look at the box wondering if there was anything alive in it timmy went with her sniffing at the holes in curiosity he suddenly backed away and barked loudly george put her hand on his collar to drag him off but he wouldnt go with her he barked without stopping a noise came from inside the box a rustling dry sliding sort of noise that made timmy bark even more frantically stop it timmy stop it said george tugging at him julian come and help me theres something in that box that timmy has never met before goodness knows what and hes halfpuzzled and halfscared hes barking defiance and hell never stop unless we drag him away an angry voice came from the bottom of the field by the stile hey you take that dog away what do you mean by poking into my business upsetting my snakes oooh snakes said anne retiring quickly to her own caravan george its snakes in there do get timmy away julian and george managed to drag timmy away halfchoking him with his collar though he didnt seem to notice this at all the angry voice was now just behind them george turned and saw a little dark man middleaged with gleaming black eyes he was shaking his fist still shouting sorry said george pulling timmy harder please stop shouting or my dog will go for you go for me he will go for me you keep a dangerous dog like that which smells out my snakes and will go for me yelled the angry little man dancing about like a boxer on his toes ahhhhhh wait till i let out my snakes and then your dog will run and run and will never be seen again this was a most alarming threat with an enormous heave julian dick and george at last got timmy under control dragged him up the steps of annes caravan and shut the door on him anne tried to quieten him while the other three went out to the angry little man again he had dragged out the big shallow box and had opened the lid the three watched fascinated what snakes had he in there rattlesnakes cobras they were all ready to run for their lives if the snakes were as angry as their owner a great head reared itself out of the box and swung itself from side to side two unblinking dark eyes gleamed and then a long long body writhed out and glided up the mans legs round his waist and round his neck he fondled it talking in a low caressing voice george shivered julian and dick watched in amazement its a python said julian my what a monster ive never seen one so close before i wonder it doesnt wind itself round that fellow and squeeze him to death hes got hold of it near the tail said dick watching oh look theres another one sure enough a second python slid out of the box coil upon gleaming coil it too wreathed itself round its owner making a loud hissing noise as it did so its body was thicker than julians calf anne was watching out of her caravan window hardly able to believe her eyes she had never in her life seen snakes as big as these she didnt even know what they were she began to wish their caravans were miles and miles away the little man quieted his snakes at last they almost hid him with their great coils from each side of his neck came a snakes head flat and shining timmy was now watching out of the window also his head beside annes he was amazed to see the gliding snakes and stopped barking at once he got down from the window and went under the table timmy didnt think he liked the look of these new creatures at all the man fondled the snakes and then still speaking to them lovingly got them back into their box again they glided in and piled themselves inside coil upon coil the man shut down the lid and locked it then he turned to the three watching children you see how upset you make my snakes he said now you keep away you hear and you keep your dog away too ah you children interfering poking your noses staring i do not like children and nor do my snakes you keep away see he shouted the last words so angrily that the three jumped look here said julian we only came to say we were sorry our dog barked like that dogs always bark at strange things they dont know or understand its only natural dogs too i hate said the little man going into his caravan you will keep him away from here especially when i have my snakes out or one might give him too loving a squeeze ha he disappeared into his van and the door shut firmly not so good said julian we seem to have made a bad start with the fairfolk and i had hoped they would be friendly and let us into some of their secrets i dont like the last thing he said said george worried a loving squeeze by one of those pythons would be the end of timmy i shall certainly keep him away when i see that funny little man taking out his snakes he really seemed to love them didnt he he certainly did said julian well i wonder who lives in the second newlyarrived caravan i feel i hardly dare even to look at it in case it contains gorillas or elephants or hippos or dont be an idiot said george come on its getting dark hallo here comes the caravan we saw down in the lane just now it came slowly up the grassy hillside bumping as it went on the side was painted a name in large scarlet letters mister indiarubber oh the rubberman said george dick is he the driver do you think they all stared at the driver he was long and thin and droopy and he looked as if he might burst into tears at any moment his horse looked rather the same well he might be mr indiarubber said julian but certainly there doesnt seem to be much bounce in him look hes getting down the man got down with a supple loose grace that didnt seem to fit his droopy body at all he took the horse out of the shafts and set it loose in the field it wandered away pulling here and there at the grass still looking as sad and droopy as its master bufflo suddenly yelled the man you in the door of the second caravan opened and a young man looked out a huge young man with a mop of yellow hair a bright red shirt and a broad smile hiya rubber he called we got here first come along in skippys got some food ready mr indiarubber walked sadly up the steps of bufflos caravan the door shut this is really rather exciting said dick an indiarubber man bufflo and skippy whoever they may be and a man with tame snakes next to us whatever next anne called to them do come in timmys whining like anything they went up the steps of her caravan and found that anne had got ready a light supper for them a ham sandwich each a piece of fruit cake lnd an orange ill have a pickled onion with my sandwich please said dick ill chop it up and put it in with the ham what wonderful ideas i do have to be sure chapter five night and morning contents prevnext as they had their supper they talked about the queer new arrivals timmy sat close to george trying to tell her that he was sorry for causing such a disturbance she patted him and scolded him at the same time i quite understand that you dont like the snakes timmy but when i tell you to stop barking and come away you must do as youre told do you understand timmys tail dropped and he put his big head on georges knee he gave a little whine i dont think hell ever go near that box again now hes seen the snakes that came out of it said anne you should have seen how scared he was when he looked out of the window with me and saw them he went and hid under the table its a pity weve made a bad start with the fairfolk said julian i dont expect they like children much because as a rule the kids would make themselves an awful nuisance peering here and poking there i think i can hear more caravans arriving said george and timmy pricked up his ears and growled be quiet timmy were not the only ones allowed in this field dick went to the window and peered out into the twilight he saw some large dark shapes in another part of the field looming out of the darkness a little campfire burned brightly in front of one showing a small figure bending over it these are jolly good sandwiches anne said dick what about another pickled onion everyone no dick said anne firmly youve eaten your sandwich well i can eat a pickled onion without a sandwich cant i said dick hand over anne anne wouldnt ive hidden them she said you want some for tomorrow dont you dont be greedy dick have a biscuit if youre still hungry i meant to ask if we could have a campfire outside tonight said george remembering but somehow i feel so sleepy i think id nod off if i sat by it i feel sleepy too said anne lets clear up george and snuggle into our bunks the boys can go to their caravan and read or play games if they want to dick yawned well i might read for a bit he said i hope youve got enough water anne for the various things you use it for because i do not intend to stumble over this dark field to the stream and fall over snakes and anything else the fairfolk may have strewn carelessly about the grass you dont think those snakes could get loose do you said anne anxiously of course not said julian anyway timmy will bark the place down if even a hedgehog comes roving by so you dont need to worry about snakes the boys said good night and went off to their own caravan the girls saw a light suddenly shine out there and shadows moved across the curtains drawn over the windows dicks lighted their lamp said anne theirs was already lighted and the caravan looked cosy and friendly anne showed george how to put up her bunk it clicked into place felt nice and firm and was most invitinglooking the girls made their beds in the bunks putting in sheets and blankets and rugs wheres my pillow asked george oh its a cushion in the daytime is it what a good idea she and anne took the covers off the two cushions in the chairs and underneath were the pillowcases over the pillows ready for the night they undressed washed in stream water in the little sink cleaned their teeth and brushed their hair does the water go under the caravan when i pull the plug out of the sink said george here goes the water gurgled out and splashed on the ground under the van timmy pricked up his ears and listened he could see that he would have to get used to quite a lot of new noises here got your torch said anne when at last they had both got into their bunks im going to blow out the lamp if you want anything in the night youll have to put on your torch george look at timmy sitting on the floor still he doesnt realize weve gone to bed tim are you waiting for us to go upstairs timmy thumped his tail on the floor that was just exactly what he was waiting for when george went to bed she always went upstairs whether she was at school or at home and though he hadnt managed to discover any stairs in the caravan yet he was sure that george knew where they were it took timmy a few minutes to realize that george was going to sleep for the night in the bunk she had put up against the wall then with one bound he was on top of her and settled down on her legs she gave a groan oh timmy you are rough get off my legs get further down get into the curve of my knees timmy found the bunk too small to be really comfortable however he managed to curl himself up in as small a space as possible put his head down on one of georges knees gave one of his heavy sighs and fell asleep he had one ear open all the time though an ear for a rat that for some peculiar reason ran over the roof an ear for a daring rabbit that nibbled the grass under the caravan and a very alert ear for a big cockchafer that flew straight into the glass pane of the righthand window just above georges bunk plang it collided with the pane and fell back stunned timmy couldnt for the life of him think what it was but soon fell asleep again still with one ear open the blackbird in the hawthorn tree woke him up early it had thought of a perfectly new melody and was trying it out very loudly and deliberately a thrush nearby joined in mind how you do it mind how you do it sang the thrush at the top of its voice timmy sat up and stretched george woke up at once because timmy trod heavily on her middle she couldnt think where she was at first then she remembered and smiled of course in a caravan with anne how that blackbird sang a better song than the thrush cows mooed in the distance and the early morning sun slid in through the window and picked out the clock and the bowl of primroses timmy settled down if george wasnt going to get up neither was he george shut her eyes and fell asleep again too outside the camp began to awake caravan doors opened fires were lighted somebody went down to the stream to get water the boys came banging at the door of the girls caravan come on sleepyheads its halfpast seven and were hungry goodness said anne sitting up brighteyed with sleep george wake up it wasnt long before they were all sitting round a little fire from which came a very nice smell dick was frying bacon and eggs and the smell made everyone very hungry anne had boiled a kettle on her little stove and made some tea she came down the steps with a tray on which she had put the teapot and hot water anne always does things properly said dick here hold your plate out ju your bacons done take your nose out of the way timmy you silly dog youll get it splashed with hot fat again do look after timmy when im cooking george hes already wolfed one slice of bacon well it saved you cooking it said george i say arent there a lot of caravans here now they must have come last night they stared round at the field besides the snakemans caravan and bufflos and mr indiarubbers there were four or five more one interested the children very much it was a brilliant yellow with red flames painted on the sides the name on it was alfredo the fire eater i imagine him to be a great big fierce chap said dick a regular fireeater with a terribly ferocious temper an enormous voice and a great stride when he walks he will probably be a skinny little fellow who trots along like a pony said julian theres someone coming out of his caravan now said george look its a woman said anne his wife i expect how tiny she is rather sweet she looks spanish shes so dark this must be the fireeater coming behind her said george surely it is and hes just like you imagined him dick how clever of you a great big fellow came down the steps behind his tiny wife he certainly looked very fierce for he had a lionlike mane of tawny hair and a big red face with large gleaming eyes he took enormous strides as he went and his little wife had to run to keep up with him just my idea of a fireeater said dick pleased i think well keep out of his way until we know if he also dislikes children like the snakeman what a tiny wife he has i bet he makes her run around him and wait on him hand and foot well hes fetching water from the stream for her anyway said anne two huge pails my word he really does look like a fireeater doesnt he theres somebody else look said dick now who would he be look at him going to the stream he walks like a tiger or a cat all slinky and powerful the man who can set himself free from ropes no matter how hes tied said anne im sure he is it was most exciting to watch the new arrivals they all seemed to know one another they stopped to talk they laughed they visited one anothers caravans and finally three of the women set off together with baskets going off to shop said anne thats what i ought to do coming george theres a bus that goes down to the village in about ten minutes we can easily clear up when we come back right said george and got up too what are the boys going to do while were gone oh fetch more water find sticks for the fire and see to their own bunks said anne airily are we really said dick grinning well we might on the other hand we might not anyway you two go because food is getting rather low a very serious thought that anne get me some more toothpaste will you and if you can spot some of those doughnuts at the dairy bring a dozen back with you yes and see if you can get a tin of pineapple said julian dont forget we want milk too if you want many more things youll have to come and help us carry them said anne anything else call at the post office and see if there are any letters said dick and dont forget to buy a paper we may as well find out if anything has happened in the outside world not that i feel i can take much interest in it at the moment right said anne come on george we shall miss that bus and off they went with timmy at their heels chapter six unfriendly folk contents prevnext the two boys decided they would fetch the water and stack up some firewood while the girls were gone they made their bunks too by the simple process of dragging off all the clothes and bundling them on the shelf and then letting down the bunks against the wall that done there didnt seem much else to do except wait for the girls so they took a walk round the field they kept a good distance from the snakeman who was doing something peculiar to one of his pythons it looks as if hes polishing it but he surely cant be said julian id like to go near enough to watch but hes such a hottempered little fellow he might quite well set one of those enormous pythons on to us the snakeman was sitting on a box with one snake spread over his knee some of its coils round one of his legs the other coils round his waist the head appeared to be under his armpit the man was rubbing away hard at the snakes scaly body and it really seemed as if the python was enjoying it bufflo was doing something with a whip it had a magnificent handle set with semiprecious stones that caught the sun and glittered in many colours look at the lash said julian yards and yards long id like to see him crack it almost as if he heard him bufflo got to his feet and swung the great whip in his hand then he raised it and a moment later there was a sound exactly like a pistolshot the lash cracked as it was whipped through the air and the two boys jumped not expecting such a loud noise bufflo cracked it again then he whistled and a small plump woman came to the steps of his caravan you mended it yet she called perhaps said bufflo get a cigarette skippy hurry skippy put her hand into the caravan felt along a shelf and brought out a packet of cigarettes she didnt go down the steps but stood there holding out the cigarette between her finger and thumb bufflo swung his whip crack the cigarette disappeared as if by magic the boys stared in amazement surely the end of the lash hadnt whipped that cigarette from skippys fingers it didnt seem possible there it is said bufflo pointing some distance away hold it again skippy i reckon this whip is okay now skippy picked up the cigarette and put it in her mouth no called bufflo i aint sure enough of this lash yet you hold it like you did skippy took it out of her mouth and held out the cigarette in her finger and thumb once more crack like a pistolshot the whip cracked again and once more the cigarette disappeared aw bufflo youve gone and broken it in half said skippy reproachfully pointing to where it lay on the ground neatly cut in half that was real careless of you bufflo said nothing he merely turned his back on skippy and set to work on his lash again though what he was doing neither of the boys could make out they went a little nearer to see bufflo had his back to them but he must have heard them coming you clear out he said hardly raising his voice no kids allowed round here clear out or ill crack my whip and take the top hairs off your head julian and dick felt perfectly certain he would be able to carry out his threat and they retreated with as much dignity as they could i suppose the snakeman told him what a disturbance old timmy made yesterday with the snakes said dick i hope it wont spoil things for us with all the fairfolk they went across the field and on the way met mr indiarubber they couldnt help staring at him he honestly looked as if he were made of rubber he was a curious grey the grey of an ordinary school rubber and his skin looked rubbery too he scowled at the two boys clear out he said no kids allowed in our field julian was annoyed its our field as much as yours he said weve got a couple of caravans here those over there well this has always been our field said mr indiarubber so you clear out to the next one we havent any horses to pull our caravans even if we wanted to go which we dont retorted julian angrily anyway why should you object to us wed like to be friendly we shant do you any harm or make a nuisance of ourselves usfolk and youfolk dont mix said the man obstinately we dont want you here nor them posh caravans down there neither and he pointed to the three modern caravans in one corner of the field this has always been our field dont lets argue about it said dick who had been looking at the man with the greatest curiosity are you really so rubbery that you can wriggle in and out of pipes and things do you but he didnt have time to finish his question because the rubberman flung himself down on the ground did a few strange contortions nicked himself between the boys legs and there they both were flat on the ground the rubberman was walking off looking quite pleased with himself well said dick feeling a bump on his head i tried to grab his legs and they honestly felt like rubber i say what a pity these people resent us being in their field its not going to be very pleasant to have them all banded against us not fair either i should like to be friendly well perhaps its just a case of usfolk and youfolk said julian theres a lot of that kind of feeling about these days and its so silly were all the same under the skin weve always got on well with anyone before they hardly liked to go near the other caravans though they longed to have a closer view of alfredo the fireeater he looked so exactly like what i imagined a fireeater ought to be said dick i should think hes probably chief of all the fairfolk hereif theyve got a chief look here he comes said julian and sure enough round the corner came alfredo running fast he came towards the boys and julian at first thought that he was coming to chase them away he didnt mean to run from alfredo but it wasnt very pleasant standing still either with this enormous fellow racing towards them his cheeks as red as fire his great mane of hair flopping up and down and then they saw why alfredo was running after him came his tiny little dark wife she was shrieking at him in some foreign language and was chasing him with a saucepan alfredo lumbered by the two boys looking scared out of his life he went down to the stile leapt over it and disappeared down the lane the little dark woman watched him go when he turned to look round she waved the saucepan at him big bad one she cried you burn breakfast again again again i bang you with saucepan big bad one come alfredo come but alfredo had no intention of coming the angry little woman turned to the two boys he burn breakfast she said he no watch he burn always it seems queer for a fireeater to burn something hes cooking said julian though on second thoughts perhaps its not poof fireeating it is easy said alfredos hottempered little wife cooking is not so easy it needs brains and eyes and hands but fredo he has no brains his hands are clumsy he can only eat fire and what use is that well i suppose he makes money by it said dick amused he is my big bad one said the little woman she turned to go and then turned back again with a sudden smile but he is very good sometimes she said she went back to her caravan the boys looked at one another poor alfredo said dick he looks as brave as a lion and hes certainly a giant of a manbut hes as timid as a mouse fancy running away from that tiny little woman well im not so sure i wouldnt too if she came bounding over the field after me brandishing that dangerouslooking saucepan said julian ahwhos this the man that anne had thought might be the one who could set himself free when bound with ropes was coming up from the stile he walked easily and lightly really very like a cat julian glanced at his hands they were small but looked very strong yes he could certainly undo knots with hands like that they gazed at him curiously no kids allowed here said the man as he came up sorry but were caravanners too said dick i say are you the fellow that can undo ropes when hes tied up in them could be said the man and walked on he turned round suddenly like me to tie you up he called ive a good mind to try dont you try interfering with us or ill do it dear me what a nice pleasant lot they are said julian quite different from the other circus folk weve known i begin to feel we shant make friends as fast as i thought wed better be careful i think said dick they seem to resent us goodness knows why they may make things jolly unpleasant dont lets snoop round any more this morning lets keep away from them till they get a bit used to us then perhaps theyll be more friendly well go and meet the girls said julian so they went down to the stile and walked to the busstop the bus came panting up the hill at that very moment and the girls stepped off with the three fairwomen behind them the girls joined the boys weve done a lot of shopping said anne our baskets are awfully heavy thanks julian if youll carry mine dick can take georges did you see those women who got off with us yes said julian why well we tried to talk to them but they were very unfriendly said anne we felt quite uncomfortable and timmy growled like anything of course which made things worse i dont think he liked their smell they did smell rather unwashed we didnt get on too well either with the rest of the fairfolk said julian in fact i cant say that dick and i were a success at all all they wanted us to do was to clear out i got a paper for you said anne and george found a letter at the post office from her mother its addressed to all of us so we didnt open it well read it when we get to the caravans i hope its nearly time for dinner said george what do you think timmy timmy knew the word dinner he gave a joyful bark and led the way dinner there couldnt be a better idea chapter seven a letter a walk and a shock contents prevnext george opened her mothers letter when they had finished their meal everyone voted that it was a truly wizard lunch two hardboiled eggs each fresh lettuce tomatoes mustard and cress and potatoes baked in the fire in their jackets followed by what julian had asked for slices of tinned pineapple very sweet and juicy very nice said julian lying back in the sun anne youre a jolly good housekeeper now george lets hear what aunt fanny has got to say in her letter george unfolded the notepaper and smoothed it out its to all of us she said dear george anne julian and dick i hope george arrived safely and that you all met her i am really writing to remind george that it is her grandmothers birthday on saturday and she must write to her i forgot to remind george before she she went so thought i must quickly send a letter george your father is very much upset to read about those two missing scientists he knows derek terrykane very well and worked with him for some time he says he is absolutely sure that he isnt a traitor to his country he thinks he has been spirited away somewhere and jeffrey pottersham too probably in a plane miles away by now in a country that will force them to give up their secrets its just as well you went off today because this afternoon your father is striding about all over the place talking nineteen to the dozen and banging every door he comes to bless him if you write please dont mention scientists as i am hoping he will calm down soon he really is very upset and keeps on saying what is the world coming to when he knows quite well that its coming to exactly what the scientists plan it to come to have a good time all of you and dont forget to write to your grandmother george your loving mother i can just see father striding about like a like a fireeater said julian with a grin as george stopped for a word hell drive aunt fanny into chasing him around with a saucepan one day funny business about these scientists though isnt it after all terrykane had planned to leave the country got his aeroplane ticket and everything so although your father believes in him george it honestly looks a bit fishy doesnt it anything in the paper about it asked dick and shook it open yeshere we are missing scientists it is now certain that jeffrey pottersham was in the pay of a country unfriendly to us and was planning to join terrykane on his journey abroad nothing has been heard of the two men although reports that they have been seen in many places abroad have been received that rather settles it said julian two really bad eggs lookhere are their photographs the four leaned over the paper looking at the pictures of the two men well i should have thought anyone would recognize terrykane if they saw him said anne those big thick arched eyebrows and that enormous forehead if i saw anyone with eyebrows like that id think they werent real hell shave them off said dick then hell look completely different probably stick them on his upper lip upside down and use them for moustaches dont be so silly said george with a giggle the other fellow is very ordinarylooking except for his dome of a head pity none of us four have got great foreheads i suppose we must be rather stupid people were not so bad said julian weve had to use our brains many times in all our adventures and we havent come off so badly lets clear up and then go for a walk again said anne if we dont i shall fall asleep this sun is so gloriously hot its really cooking me yes wed better go for a walk said julian getting up shall we go and see the castle do you think or shall we leave that for another day leave it said anne i honestly dont feel like clambering up that steep hill just now i think the morning would be a better time they cleared up and then locked the two caravans and set out julian looked back some of the fairfolk were sitting together eating a meal they watched the children in silence it wasnt very pleasant somehow they dont exactly love us do they said dick now you listen timmy dont you go accepting any titbits from people here see oh dick said george in alarm you surely dont think they would harm timmy no i dont really said dick but we might as well be careful as the rubber man pointed out to us this morning usfolk and hisfolk think differently about some things it just cant be helped but i do wish theyd let us be friendly i dont like this kind of thing well anyway i shall keep timmy to heel all the time said george making up her mind firmly timmy to heel please understand that as long as we are in the caravan field you must walk to heel do you understand woofwoof said timmy and immediately kept so close to georges ankles that his nose kept bumping into them they decided to catch the bus to tinkers green and then walk from there to the sea they would have time to get there and back before dark the bus was waiting at the corner and they ran to catch it it was about two miles to tinkers green which was a dear little village with a proper green and a duckpond with white ducks swimming on it shall we have an icecream suggested dick as they came to a grocers shop with an icecream sign outside it no said julian firmly weve just had an enormous lunch and well save up icecreams for teatime we shall never get down to the sea if we sit and eat icecreams half the afternoon it was a lovely walk down violetstudded lanes and then over a heathery common with clumps of primroses in the hollows and even a few very very early bluebells much to annes delight theres the sea oh what a dear little bay said anne in delight and isnt it blueas blue as cornflowers we could almost bathe you wouldnt like it if you did said julian the sea would be as cold as ice come on lets get down to the little jetty and have a look at the fishingboats they went down to the sunwarmed stone jetty and began talking to the fishermen there some were sitting in the sun mending their nets and were very willing to talk how nice to have a bit of friendliness shown us instead of the stares and rudeness of the fairfolk said dick to julian who nodded and agreed a fisherman took them on his boat and explained a lot of things they already knew and some they didnt it was nice to sit and listen to his broad speech and to watch his bright blue eyes as he talked he was as brown as an oakapple could we ever hire a boat here if we wanted to asked julian is there one we could manage by ourselves we are quite good at sailing old joseph there has a boat he could hire out if you wanted one said the man they were talking to he hired it out the other day and i expect hed hire it out to you too if so be you can really manage it thanks well ask him if we ever decide to go out said julian he looked at his watch wed better go and get some tea somewhere we want to be home before dark were camping over at faynights castle oh ay said the fisherman youve got the fairfolk there now havent you they were here two weeks since my that fireeater is a fair treat he is and that ropeman well i tell you this i tied him up in my fishingline you can see it here strong as two ropes it is i tied him up with all the knots i know and in under a minute he stood up and the line fell off him knots and all ay that is so said the old fellow called joseph a wonder he is that man so is the rubber fellow he called for a drainpipe narrow as this see and he wriggled through it quick as an eel fair scared me it did to see him wriggling out of the other end well go and see them perform when they begin their show said julian at the moment theyre not very friendly towards us they dont like us being in their field they keeps themselves to themselves said joseph they had a heap of trouble at the place they were in before they came to us someone set the police on them and now they wont make friends with anyone well we must go said julian and they said goodbye to the friendly fishermen and went they stopped and had tea at a little teashop and then made their way home anyone want to take the bus said julian we can easily get home before dark if we walk but if the girls are tired well bus from tinkers green of course were not tired said george indignantly have you ever known me say im tired julian all right all right it was just a bit of politeness on my part said julian come on lets get going the way was longer than they had thought it was getting dark when they got to the stile that led into the caravan field they climbed over it and made their way slowly to their corner and then they suddenly stopped and stared they looked all round and stared again their two caravans were gone they could see the places where they had stood and where their fire had been but no caravans stood there now well said julian astounded this beats everything are we dreaming i cant see a sign of our caravans anywhere yes but how could they go said anne almost stammering in her surprise i meanwe had no horses to pull them away anywhere they couldnt go just by themselves there was a silence the four were completely bewildered how could two large solid caravans disappear into thin air look there are wheelmarks in the grass said dick suddenly see our caravans went this way come on follow down the hillside look in the greatest astonishment the four children and timmy followed the wheelmarks julian glanced back once feeling that they were being watched but not one of the fairfolk was to be seen perhaps they are watching silently behind their caravan curtains julian thought uncomfortably the wheelmarks went right down the field and reached the gate it was shut now but it must have been opened for the two caravans because there were marks in the grass by the gate marks that passed through it and then were lost in the lane what are we to do said anne scared theyre gone weve nowhere to sleep oh julian what are we going to do chapter eight where are the caravans contents prevnext for once in a way julian was quite at a loss what to do it looked as if someone had stolen the two caravans taken them right away somewhere i suppose wed better ring up the police he said theyll watch out for the two caravans and arrest the thieves but that wont help us much for tonight weve got to find somewhere to sleep i think we ought to go and tackle one or two of the fairfolk said dick even if they have got nothing to do with the theft they must have seen the caravans being taken away yes i think youre right said julian they must know something about it george you stay here with anne in case the fair people are rude well take timmy he may be useful george didnt want to stay behind but she could see that anne did so she stayed with her straining her eyes after the two boys as they went back up the hill with timmy close behind dont lets go to the snakeman said dick he might be playing with his snakes in his caravan what possible game can you play with snakes said julian or are you thinking of snakes and ladders funny joke said dick politely look theres somebody by a campfire bufflo i think no its alfredo well we know he isnt as fierce as he looks lets tackle him about the caravans they went up to the big fireeater who was sitting smoking by the fire he didnt hear them coming and jumped violently when julian spoke to him mr alfredo began julian could you tell us where our two caravans have gone we found them missing when we got back just now ask bufflo said alfredo gruffly not looking at them but dont you know anything about them persisted julian ask bufflo said alfredo blowing out clouds of smoke julian and dick turned away annoyed and went over to bufflos caravan it was shut they knocked on the door and bufflo appeared his mop of golden hair gleaming in the lamplight mr bufflo began julian politely again mr alfredo told us to come and ask you about our caravans which are missing and ask the rubberman said bufflo shortly and slammed the door julian was angry he knocked again the window opened and skippy bufflos little wife looked out you go and ask mr indiarubber she called and shut the window with what sounded suspiciously like a giggle is this a silly trick theyre playing on us said dick fiercely looks like it said julian well well try the rubberman come on hes the last one well try though they went to the rubbermans caravan and rapped smartly on the door whos there came the voice of mr indiarubber come out we want to ask you something said julian whos there said the rubberman again you know jolly well who we are said julian raising his voice our caravans have been stolen and we want to find out who took them if you wont give us any help were going to telephone the police the door opened and the rubberman stood on the top of the steps looking down at julian nobody has stolen them he said nobody at all you go and ask the snakeman if you think were going round asking every single person in this camp youre mistaken said julian angrily i dont want to go to the police we wanted to be friends with you fairfolk not enemies this is all very silly if the carvans are stolen weve no other choice but to go to the police and i dont imagine you want them after you again we know they were put on to you a few weeks back you know too much said the rubberman in a very surly voice your caravans are not stolen i will show you where they are he came lightly down the steps of his caravan and walked in front of the two boys in the halfdarkness he went across the grassy hillside making for where the childrens caravans had stood where are you taking us called julian we know the vans are not there please dont act the idiot theres been enough of that already the man said nothing but walked on the boys and timmy could do nothing but follow timmy was not happy he kept up a continuous low growling like faroff thunder the rubberman took not the slightest notice julian wondered idly if he didnt fear dogs because they wouldnt be able to bite rubber the man took them to the hedge that ran at one side of the field beyond where the two caravans had stood julian began to feel exasperated he knew perfectly well that the two vans had been taken down to the fieldgate and out into the lanethen why was this fellow leading him in the opposite direction the rubberman forced his way through the hedge and the boys followed and there just the other side two big dark shapes loomed up in the twilight the caravans well said julian taken aback what was the idea of putting the caravans here in the next field usfolk and youfolk dont mix said the man we dont like kids messing about three weeks ago we had a canaryman with over a hundred canaries that gave a show with him and some kids opened all the cages one night and set them loose oh said julian theyd die of course if they were set loose they dont know how to look for their own food that was bad luck but we dont do things like that no kids allowed with us now said the rubberman thats why we put horses into your vans took them down to the fieldgate and up into the next field and here they are we thought youd be back in the daylight and would see them well its nice to find you can be chatty all of a sudden said julian dont growl any more timmy its all right weve found our vans the rubberman disappeared without another word they heard him squeezing easily through the hedge julian took out the key to his caravan went up the steps and opened the door he rummaged about and found his torch he switched it on and shone it round nothing had been disturbed well so thats that he said just a bit of spite on the part of the fairfolk i suppose punishing us for what those horrid kids did to the canaries i must say it was a shame to open those cages half the poor little creatures must have died i dont like birds put in cages but as canaries cant live in this country unless they are looked after its cruel to let them go loose and starve i agree with you said dick they were now walking down the hillside to a gap in the hedge through which the vans must have been pulled up the hill george and anne would be most relieved to hear they had found the caravans julian gave a whistle and george answered it at once were still here julian whats happened weve got the caravans shouted back julian cheerily theyre in this field the girls joined them at once most surprised to hear this news julian explained the fairfolk really have got a hate on against children he said apparently they had a canaryman whose show consisted of singing canaries and some kids set all the birds loose one night so half of them died and now the fairfolk wont have children anywhere near them i suppose the snakeman is afraid of us setting his snakes loose said dick with a chuckle well thank goodness weve found the vans i had a feeling we might have to sleep in a haystack tonight i wouldnt have minded that said george i like haystacks well light a fire and cook something said julian i feel hungry after all this upset i dont said anne i hate feeling that the fairfolk wont be friends its silly of them were not used to that yes but theyre rather like children themselves said julian somebody does something unkind to them so they get sulky and wait for a chance to hit back and then someone set the police on them too dont forget theyre very touchy at the moment i imagine well its a pity said george watching dick light a campfire very efficiently i was looking forward to having a good time with them do you suppose the farmer will mind us being here oh i never thought of that said julian this may not be a camping field i hope to goodness we dont have an angry farmer shouting at us tomorrow and oh dear we are so far away from the stream now said anne its on the other side of the field where we were and we do badly want water well have to do without it tonight said dick firmly i dont want the top of my hair taken off by bufflo or a rope tying up my legs thrown by the ropeman or a snake wriggling after me i bet those fairfolk will be on the watch for us to fetch water this is all very silly they had rather a solemn meal things had suddenly begun to seem rather complicated they couldnt go to the police about such a silly thing nor did they want to but if the farmer wanted to turn them out of this field how could they go back to their first campingplace nobody wanted to live in a camp surrounded by enemies well sleep on it said julian at last dont worry you girls well find a way out of this problem we are pretty good at getting out of difficulties never say die woof said timmy agreeing heartily george patted him thats one of your mottoes isnt it timmy she said and another motto of his is let sleeping dogs lie said dick with a broad grin he hates being wakened up when hes having a nice nap dreaming of millions of rabbits to catch well talking of naps what about getting into our bunks said julian with a yawn weve had a good long walk today and im tired im going to lie in my bunk and read everyone thought this a very good idea they cleared up the supperthings and the girls said good night to the boys they went into the caravan with timmy i do hope this holiday isnt going to be a failure said anne as she got into her bunk george gave one of her snorts a failure you wait and see ive a feeling it will turn out to be super chapter nine a great surprise contents prevnext it didnt seem as if georges feeling that the holiday was going to be super was at all correct the next morning a loud rapping came on the door of the boys caravan before they were even awake then a large red face looked in at the window startling julian considerably who gave you permission to camp here said the face looking as black as thunder julian went to the door in his pyjamas do you own this field he said politely well we were camping in the next field and thats let for campers and caravanners said the man who was dressed like a farmer this isnt as i said we were in the next field repeated julian and for some reason the fairfolk there didnt like us and when we were out they brought our caravans here as weve no horses to take them away we couldnt do anything else but stay well you cant stay said the farmer i dont let out this field i use it for my cows youll have to go today or ill put your caravans out into the road yes but look here began julian and then stopped the farmer had walked off a determined figure in ridingbreeches and tweed coat the girls opened their window and called to julian we heard what he said isnt he mean now what are we going to do were going to get up and have breakfast said julian and then im going to give the fairfolk one more chance theyll have to lend us two horses the two they used yesterday to pull our vans and pull us back into our rightful place otherwise i very much fear i shall have to get help from the police oh dear said anne i do hate this kind of thing we were having such a lovely time before the fair people arrived but it seems quite impossible to get them to be friends with us quite said julian im not so sure i want to be friendly now either id rather give up this holiday altogether and go back home than have continual trouble going on round us dick and i will go and tackle the fairfolk after breakfast breakfast was just as solemn as supper had been julian was rather silent he was thinking what was best to say to the sullen folk in the next field you must take timmy with you said george voicing the thoughts of everyone julian and dick set off with timmy about half past eight all the fair people were up and about and the smoke of their fires rose up in the morning air julian thought he would go and tackle the fireeater so the two boys went towards his caravan the other fair people looked up and one by one left their vans or their fires and closed round the boys timmy bared his teeth and growled mr alfredo began julian the farmer is turning us out of that field we must come back here we want you to lend us two horses for our vans a ripple of laughter spread through the listening people mr alfredo answered politely with a large smile on his face what a pity we dont hire out our horses i dont want to hire them from you said julian patiently its up to you to let us have them to bring back our vans otherwise well i shall have to go and ask the police for help those caravans dont belong to us you know there was an angry murmur from the listening crowd timmy growled more loudly one or two of the fairfolk stepped back hurriedly when they heard him crack julian turned quickly the fair people ran back and the two boys found that they were facing bufflo who with a large and unpleasant grin on his face was swinging his whip in his hand crack julian jumped violently for a few hairs from the top of his head were suddenly whisked off into the air the end of the lash had neatly cut them away the crowd laughed loudly timmy bared his white teeth and snarled dick put his hand down on the dogs collar do that again and i shant be able to hold the dog he called warningly julian stood there at a loss to know what to do next he couldnt bear turning tail and going off to the accompaniment of jeers and howls he was so full of rage that he couldnt say a word and then something happened something so utterly unexpected that nobody did anything at all except let it happen a boyish figure came running up the grassy hillsidesomeone very like george with short curly hair and a very freckled face someone dressed however in a short grey skirt and not in shorts like george she came racing up yelling at the top of her voice dick dick hey dick dick turned and stared in amazement why its jo jo the gypsy girl who once got mixed up with us in an adventure julian its jo there was no doubt about it at all it was jo she came tearing up her face glowing with the utmost delight and flung herself excitedly on dick she had always liked him best dick i didnt know you were here julian are the others here too oh timmy dear old timmy dick are you camping here oh this is really too marvellous to be true jo seemed to be about to fling herself on dick again and he fended her off jo where in the world have you come from well you see said jo ive got school holidays like you and i thought id go and visit you at kirrin cottage so i did but you had all gone away together that was yesterday go on said dick as jo stopped out of breath well i didnt want to go back home again straight away said jo so i thought id pay a visit to my uncle hes my mothers brother and i knew he was camping here so i hitchhiked all the way yesterday and came late last night well im blessed said julian and who is your uncle may i ask oh alfredo the fireeater was jos astonishing reply didnt you know oh dick oh julian can i stay here while youre here do do say i can you havent forgotten me have you of course not said dick thinking that nobody could possibly forget this wild little gypsy girl with her mad ways and her staunch affection then for the first time jo realized that something was going on what was this crowd doing round julian and dick she looked round and immediately sensed that the fair people were not friendly to the two boys although the main expression on their faces now was one of astonishment how did jo know these boys they wondered how was it she was so very friendly with them they were puzzled and suspicious uncle alfredo where are you demanded jo looking all round oh there you are uncle these are my very best friends and so are the girls too wherever they are ill tell you all about them and how nice they were to me ill tell everybody well said julian feeling rather embarrassed at what jo might reveal well you tell them jo and ill just pop back and break the news to george and anne they will be surprised to find you are here and that alfredo is your uncle the two boys and timmy turned to go the little crowd opened to let them pass it closed up again round the excited jo whose high voice the boys could hear all the way across the field well well well said dick as they got through the hedge what an astonishing thing i couldnt believe my eyes when young jo appeared could you i hope george wont mind she was always rather jealous of jo and the things she could do the two girls were amazed at the boys news george was not too pleased she preferred jo at a distance rather than near she liked and admired her but rather unwillingly jo was too like george herself for george to give her complete friendliness well fancy jo jo herself being here said anne smiling oh julian it was a good thing she arrived when she did i dont like that bit about bufflo cracking his whip at you he might have made you bald on the top oh it was only a few hairs said julian but it gave me quite a shock and i think it gave the fair people a shock too when jo arrived like a little hurricane yelling at the top of her voice and flinging herself on poor old dick she almost knocked him over shes not a bad kid said dick but she never stops to think i wonder if the people she stays with know where shes gone i wouldnt be a bit surprised if she just disappeared without a word like the two scientists said julian with a grin gosh i cant get over it jo was the very last person i would expect here well not really if you think a bit said anne her father is a gypsy isnt he and her mother was in a circus she told us so she trained dogs dont you remember julian so its quite natural for jo to have relations like the fair people but just fancy having a fireeater for an uncle yes id forgotten that jos mother was in a circus said julian i expect shes got peculiar relations all over the country i wonder what shes telling them about us shes singing dicks praises anyway said george she always thought the world of dick perhaps the fair people wont be quite so unfriendly if they know that jo is fond of us well were in a bit of a fix said dick we cant stay in this field or the farmer will be after us again and i cant see the fair people lending us their horses and without horses we cant leave this field we could ask the farmer to lend us his horses suggested anne wed have to pay him though and i dont see why we should said julian after all it isnt our fault that our caravans were moved here i think this is a horrid and unfriendly place said anne and i dont want to stay here another day im not enjoying it a bit cheer up said dick never say die woof said timmy look someones coming through that gap in the hedge down there by the lane said george pointing its jo yes and my goodness me shes got a couple of horses with her cried dick good old jo shes got alfredos horses chapter ten back with the fairfolk again contents prevnext the four of them with timmy capering behind ran to meet jo she beamed at everyone hallo anne hallo george pleased to meet you again this isnt half a surprise jo how did you get those horses said dick taking one by the bridle easy grinned jo i just told uncle fredo all about you what wonders you were and all you did for me and wasnt i shocked when i heard theyd turned you out of your field i let go then i told them just what i thought of them treating my best friends like that did you really jo said george doubtfully didnt you hear me demanded jo i yelled like anything at uncle fredo and then his wife my aunt anita she yelled at him too and then we both yelled at everyone it must have been quite a yelling match said julian and the result was that you got your way and got the horses to take back our caravans jo well when aunt anita told me theyd taken your caravans into the next field and left them there and wouldnt lend you horses to bring them back i told them all a few things said jo i said no id better not tell you what i said i wasnt very polite i bet you werent said dick who had already had a little experience of jos wild tongue the year before and when i told them how my father went to prison and you got me a home with somebody nice who looks after me they were sorry theyd treated you roughly said jo and so i told uncle fredo i was going to catch two horses and bring your caravans back into the field again i see said julian and the fairfolk just let you oh yes said jo so lets hitch them in julian and go back at once isnt that the farmer coming over there it was and he looked pretty grim julian hurriedly put one horse into the shafts of the girls caravan and dick backed the other horse into the shafts of the second caravan the farmer came up and watched so you thought youd get horses after all did you he said i thought you would telling me a lot of poppycock about being stranded here and not being able to get away grrrrrrrr said timmy at once but he was the only one who made any reply geeup said jo taking the reins of the horse pulling the girls caravan hup there git along will you the horse got along and jo wickedly drove him so near to the farmer that he had to move back in a hurry he growled something at her timmy appearing round the caravan growled back the farmer stood back further and watched the two caravans going down the hillside out through the wide gap in the hedge and down the lane they came to the fieldgate and anne opened it in went the horses straining now because they were going uphill and the vans were heavy at last they arrived in the corner where the vans had stood before julian backed them over the same bit of ground he unhitched the horses and threw the reins of the second horse to dick well take them back ourselves he said so the two boys walked the horses over to alfredo who was pegging up some washing on a line it seemed a most unsuitable thing for a fireeater to do but alfredo didnt seem to mind mr alfredo thank you for lending us the horses said julian in his politest tones shall we tie them up anywhere or set them loose alfredo turned round and took some pegs out of his large mouth he looked rather ashamed set them loose he said he hesitated before he put the pegs back into his mouth we didnt know you were friends with my niece he said she told us all about you you should have told us you knew her and how could he do that when he didnt know she was your niece shouted mrs alfredo from the caravan door fredo you have no brains not a single brain do you have ahhhhhh now you drop my best blouse on the ground she ran out at top speed and alfredo stared in alarm fortunately she had no saucepan with her this time she turned to the two amused boys alfredo is sorry he took your caravans away she said are you not fredo well it was you who began alfredo with a look of astonishment but he wasnt allowed to finish his dark little wife gave him a violent nudge and spoke again herself her words tumbling over one another pay no attention to this big bad man he has no brains he can only eat fire and that is a poor thing to do now jo she has brains now are you not glad that you are back again in your corner i should have felt gladder if you had all been friendly to us said julian im afraid we dont feel like stopping here any longer though we shall probably leave tomorrow now there fredo see what you have done you have chased away these nice children cried mrs alfredo they have manners these boys a thing you know nothing about fredo you should learn from them fredo you should fredo took some pegs from his mouth to make an indignant answer but his wife suddenly gave a shriek and ran to her caravan something burns something burns alfredo gave a hearty laugh a loud guffaw that surprised the boys ha she bakes today and burns her cake she has no brains that woman no brains at all julian and dick turned to go alfredo spoke to them in a low voice you can stay here now here in this field you are jos friend that is enough for us it may be said julian but its not quite enough for us im afraid we shall leave tomorrow the boys went back to the caravans jo sat on the grass with george and anne eagerly telling them of her life with a very nice family but they wont let me wear shorts or be a boy she ended sadly thats why i wear a skirt now could you lend me some shorts george no i couldnt said george firmly jo was quite enough like her as it was without wearing shorts well you seem to have turned over a new leaf jo can you read and write yet almost said jo and turned her eyes away she found lessons very difficult for she had never been to school when she lived with her gypsy father she looked back again with bright eyes can i stay with you she said my fostermother would let me i know if it was you i was with didnt you tell her you were coming here said dick that was unkind jo i never thought said jo you send her a card for me dick send one yourself said george at once you said you could write jo took no notice of that remark can i stay with you she said i wont sleep in the caravans ill doss down underneath i always did that when the weather was fine and i lived with my dad in his caravan it would be a change for me now not to live in a house i like lots of things in houses though i never thought i would but i shall always like sleeping rough best well you could stay here with us if we were going to stay said julian but i dont much feel inclined to now weve had such an unfriendly welcome from everyone ill tell everyone to be kind to you said jo at once and got up as if she meant to go then and there to force everyone into kindness dick pushed her down no well stay here one more day and night and make up our minds tomorrow what do you say julian right said julian he looked at his watch lets go and celebrate jos coming with a few icecreams and i expect you two girls have got some shopping to do havent you yes said anne and fetched the shopping bags they set off down the hill the five of them and timmy as they passed the snakeman he called out cheerily to them good morning nice day isnt it after the surliness and sulkiness the children had got from the fairfolk up till then this came as a surprise anne smiled but the boys and george merely nodded and passed by they were not so forgiving as anne they passed the rubberman bringing back water behind him came the ropeman both of them nodded to the children and the sadlooking rubberman actually gave a brief grin then they saw bufflo practising with his whip crackcrackcrack he came over to them if youd like a crack with my whip youre welcome any time he said to julian thanks said julian politely but stiffly but were probably leaving tomorrow keep your hair on said bufflo feeling snubbed i would if youd let me said julian at once rubbing his hand over the top of his head where bufflo had stripped off a few upstanding hairs ho ho guffawed bufflo and then stopped abruptly afraid he had given offence julian grinned at him he rather liked bufflo with his mop of yellow hair and lazy drawl you stay on with us said bufflo ill lend you a whip were probably leaving tomorrow repeated julian he nodded to him and went on with the others im beginning to feel id rather like to stay after all said george it makes such a difference if people are friendly well were not staying said julian shortly ive practically made up my mind but well just wait till tomorrow its a a matter of pride with me you girls dont understand quite how i feel about the whole thing they didnt dick understood though and he agreed with julian they went on down to the village and made their way to the icecream shop they had a very pleasant day they had a wonderful lunch on the grass by their caravans and to their surprise mrs alfredo presented them with a sponge sandwich she had made anne thanked her very much indeed to make up for a certain stiffness in the thanks of the two boys you might have said a bit more she said reproachfully to them she really is a kind little woman honestly i wouldnt mind staying on now but julian was curiously obstinate about it he shook his head we go tomorrow he said unless something unexpected happens to make us stay and it wont but julian was quite wrong something unexpected did happen something really very peculiar indeed chapter eleven a very strange thing contents prevnext the unexpected happening came that evening after tea they had all had rather a late tea and a very nice one bread and butter and honey new doughnuts from the dairy and the spongecake that mrs alfredo had presented them with which had a very rich filling indeed i cant eat a thing more said george that spongecake was too rich for words i dont even feel as if i can get up and clear away so dont start suggesting it anne im not said anne theres plenty of time its a heavenly evening lets sit for a while there goes that blackbird again he has a different tune every time he sings thats what i like about blackbirds said dick lazily theyre proper composers they make up their own tunes not like the chaffinch who just carols the same old song again and again and again honestly there was one this morning that said it fifty times without stopping chipchipchip cherryerryerry chippeeooeear shouted a chaffinch rattling it all off as if he had learnt it by heart chipchipchip there he goes again said dick if he doesnt say that he shouts pinkpinkpink as if hed got that colour on the brain look at him over there isnt he a beauty he certainly was he flew down to the grass beside the children and began to peck up the crumbs even venturing on to annes knee once she sat still really thrilled timmy growled and the chaffinch flew off silly timmy said george jealous of a chaffinch oh look dick are those herons flying down to the marsh on the east side of the castle hill yes said dick sitting up where are your fieldglasses george we could see the big birds beautifully through them george fetched them from her caravan she handed them to dick he focused them on the marsh yes four herons gosh what long legs theyve got havent they they are wading happily about now ones struck down at something with its great beak whats it got yes its a frog i can see its back legs you cant said george taking the fieldglasses from him youre a fibber the glasses arent powerful enough to see a frogs legs all that way off but they were powerful enough they were really magnificent ones far too good for george who wasnt very careful with valuable things she was just in time to see the poor frogs legs disappearing into the big strong beak of the heron then something frightened the birds and before the others could have a look at them they had all flapped away how slowly they flap their wings said dick they must surely flap them more slowly than any other bird give me the glasses again george ill have a squint at the jackdaws there are thousands of them flying again over the castle their evening jaunt i suppose he put them to his eyes and moved the glasses to and fro watching the endless whirl and swoop of the black jackdaws the sound of their many voices came loudly over the evening air chackchackchackchack dick saw some fly down to the only complete tower of the castle he lowered the glasses to follow them one jackdaw flew down to the sill of the slitwindow near the top of the tower and dick followed its flight it rested for half a second on the sill and then flew off as if frightened and then dick saw something that made his heart suddenly jump his glasses were trained on the windowslit and he saw something most astonishing there he gazed as if he couldnt believe his eyes then he spoke in a low voice to julian ju take the glasses will you train them on the windowslit near the top of the only complete tower and tell me if you see what i see quick julian held out his hand in astonishment for the glasses the others stared in surprise what could dick have seen julian put the glasses to his eyes and focused them on the window dick had been looking at he stared hard yes yes i can what an extraordinary thing it must be an effect of the light i think by this time the others were in such a state of curiosity that they couldnt bear it george snatched the glasses from julian let me see she said quite fiercely she trained them on to the window she gazed and gazed and gazed then she lowered the glasses and stared at julian and dick are you being funny she said theres nothing there nothing but an empty window anne snatched the glasses from her just before dick tried to take them again she too trained them on the window but there was absolutely nothing there to see theres nothing said anne disgusted and dick took the glasses from her at once focusing them once more on the window he lowered them its gone he said to julian nothing there now dick if you dont tell us what you saw well roll go you down the hill said george crossly are you making something up what did you see well said dick looking at julian i saw a face a face not far from the window staring out what did you see ju the same said julian it made me feel pretty queer too a face said george anne and jo all together what do you mean well just what we said replied dick a face with eyes and nose and mouth but nobody lives in the castle its a ruin said george was it someone exploring do you think julian looked at his watch no it couldnt have been a visitor im sure the castle shuts at half past five and its gone six and anyway it looked a a sort of desperate face yes i thought so too said dick its well its very peculiar isnt it julian there may be some kind of ordinary explanation for it but i cant help feeling theres something queer about it was it a mans face asked george or a womans a mans i think said dick i couldnt see any hair against the darkness inside the window or clothes but it looked a mans face did you notice the eyebrows ju yes i did said julian they were very pronounced werent they this rang a bell with george eyebrows she said at once dont you remember the picture of that scientist terrykane showed that he had thick black eyebrows you said hed shave them off and use them upside down for moustaches dont you remember dick yes i do remember said dick and looked at julian julian shook his head i didnt recognize the likeness he said but after all its a very long way away it is only because georges glasses are so extraordinarily good that we managed to spot a face looking out of a window so very far away actually i think there will be an ordinary explanation its just that we were so startled and that made us think it was very queer i wish id seen the face sighed george theyre my glasses too and i never saw the face well you can keep on looking and see if it comes back said dick handing over the glasses it may do so anne george and jo took turn and turn about gazing earnestly through the fieldglasses but they saw no face in the end it got so dark that it was quite difficult to make out the tower let alone the window or a face i tell you what we might do said julian we could go and see over the castle ourselves tomorrow and we could go up into that tower then we should certainly see if theres a face there but i thought we were leaving tomorrow said dick oh yes we did think of leaving didnt we said julian who had quite forgotten this idea of his in his excitement well i dont feel as if we can go before weve explored that castle and found the explanation of the face of course we cant said george fancy seeing a thing like that and rushing off without finding out about it i couldnt possibly im going to stay anyhow announced jo i could stop with my uncle alfredo if you go and ill let you know if the face comes again if george will leave me her glasses well i shant said george with much determination if i go my glasses go with me but im not going you will stay now wont you julian well stay and find out about the face said julian i honestly feel awfully puzzled about it hallo whos this coming a big figure loomed up in the twilight it was alfredo the fireeater jo are you there he said your aunt invites you to supper and all your friends too come along there was a pause anne looked expectantly across at julian was he still going to be highandmighty and proud she hoped not thanks said julian at last wed be pleased to come do you mean now that would be nice said alfredo with a little bow i fireeat for you anything you say this was too tempting to resist everyone got up at once and followed the big alfredo over the hillside to his caravan outside there was a really good fire and on it was a big black pot that gave out a wonderful smell supper is not quite ready said alfredo the five children were relieved after their big tea they didnt feel ready even for a meal that smelt as good as the one in the pot they sat down by it will you really eat fire for us asked anne how do you do it ah very difficult said alfredo i do it only if you promise me not to try it by yourselves you would not like blisters all over your mouth inside would you everyone felt certain that they wouldnt i dont want you to have blisters in your mouth either added anne alfredo looked shocked i am a very good fireeater he assured her no good ones ever make blisters in their mouths now you sit still and i will fetch my torch and eat fire for you someone else sat down beside them it was bufflo he grinned at them skippy came and sat down too then the snakeman came up and he sat down on the opposite side of the fire alfredo came back carrying a few things in his hands quite a family circle he said now watch i will eat fire for you chapter twelve fireeating and other things contents prevnext alfredo sat down on the grass some way back from the fire he set a little metal bowl in front of him that smelt of petrol he held up two things to show the children his torches said mrs alfredo proudly he eats fire from them alfredo called out something to the snakeman dipping his two torches into the bowl they were not alight yet and to the children they looked like very large buttonhooks with a wad of wool caught in the hookpart the snakeman leaned forward and took a burning twig out of the fire with a deft throw he pitched it right into the metal bowl immediately it set light to the petrol there and flames shot up in the darkness alfredo had held his torches out of the way but now he thrust first one and then another into the burning petrol in the bowl they flared alight at once and red flames shot up as he held one in each hand his eyes gleamed in the brilliant light and the five children sat still spellbound then alfredo leaned back his head back and back and opened his great mouth wide he put one of the lighted torches into it and closed his mouth over it so that his cheeks gleamed a strange and unbelievable red from the flames inside his mouth anne gave a little scream and george gasped the two boys held their breath only jo watched unconcerned she had seen her uncle do this many times before alfredo opened his mouth and flames rushed out of it gushing like a fiery waterfall what with the other torch flaring in his left hand the burning petrol in the bowl the torch in his right hand and the flames from his mouth it really was an extraordinary scene he did the same with the other torch and once more his cheeks glowed like a lamp then fire came from his mouth again and was blown this way and that by the night breeze alfredo closed his mouth he swallowed then he looked round opened his mouth to show that he no longer had any flames there and smiled broadly ah you like to see me eat fire he said and put out his torches the bowl was no longer flaming and now only the firelight lit the scene its marvellous said julian with great admiration but dont you burn your mouth what me no never laughed alfredo at first maybe yes when i begin years and years ago but now no it would be a shameful thing to burn my mouth i would hang my head and go away but how is it you dont burn your mouth asked dick puzzled alfredo refused to give any explanation that was part of the mystery of his act and he wasnt going to give it away i can fireeat too announced jo casually and most unexpectedly here uncle let me have one of your torches you you will do nothing of the sort roared alfredo do you want to burn to bits no and i shant either said jo ive watched you and i know just how its done ive tried it fibber said george at once now you listen to me began alfredo again if you fireeat i will whip you till you beg me for mercy i will now fredo said his wife youll do nothing of the sort ill deal with jo if she starts any nonsense here as for fireeating well if theres to be anyone else fireeating here i will do it i your wife you will not fireeat said alfredo obstinately evidently afraid that his hottempered little wife might try to do it anne suddenly gave a scream of fright a long thick body glided between her and julian one of the snakemans pythons he had brought one with him and the children hadnt known jo caught hold of it and held on for dear life let him be said the snakeman he will come back to me he wants a run let me hold him for a bit begged jo he feels so smooth and cold i like snakes julian put out his hand gingerly and touched the great snake it did feel unexpectedly smooth and quite cool how extraordinary it looked so scaly and rough the snake slithered all the way up jo and then began to pour itself down her back now dont you let him get his tail round you warned the snakeman ive told you that before ill wear him round my neck said jo and proceeded to pull the snakes long body until in the end he hung round her neck like a fur george watched in unwilling admiration anne had removed herself as far from jo as possible the boys gazed in astonishment and felt a new respect for the little gypsy girl someone struck up a soft melody on a guitar it was skippy bufflos wife she hummed a sad little song that had a gay little chorus in which all the fairfolk joined practically all the camp had come along now and there were quite a few the children hadnt seen before it was exciting sitting there round the glowing fire listening to the thrum of the guitar and the sound of skippys low clear voice sitting near a fireeater too and within arms length of a snake who also seemed to be enjoying the music he swayed about in time to the chorus and then suddenly poured himself all down the front of jo and glided like magic to his master the snakeman ah my beauty said the funny little man and let the python slide between his hands its coils pulsing powerfully as it went you like the music my beauty he really loves his snake whispered anne to george how can he alfredos wife got up it is time to go she told the audience alfredo needs his supper is it not so my big bad man alfredo agreed that it was so he placed the heavy iron pot over the glowing fire again and in a few seconds such a glorious smell came from it that all the five children began to sniff expectantly wheres timmy said george suddenly he was nowhere to be seen he crept away with his tail down when he saw the snake said jo i saw him go timmy come back its all right timmy timmy ill call him thank you said george hes my dog timmy timmy came his tail still down george fondled him and so did jo he licked them both in turn george tried to drag him away from jo she didnt like timmy to show affection for the little gypsy girl but he always did he loved her the supper was lovely what is in your pot asked dick accepting a second helping ive never tasted such a delicious stew in my life chicken duck beef bacon rabbit hare hedgehog onions turnips began alfredos wife i put there everything that comes it cooks and i stir it cooks and i stir perhaps a partridge goes in one day and a pheasant the next and hold your tongue wife growled alfredo who knew quite well that the farmers round about might well ask questions about some of the things in that stew you tell me to hold my tongue cried little mrs alfredo angrily flourishing a spoon you tell me that woof said timmy receiving some nice tasty drops on his nose and licking them off woof he got up and went towards the spoon hoping for a few more oh aunt nita do give timmy a spoonful out of the stew begged jo and to timmys great joy he got a big plateful all to himself he could hardly believe it thank you very much for a very nice supper said julian feeling that it really was time to go he got up and the others followed his example and thank you for fireeating for us alfredo said george it doesnt seem to have spoilt your appetite poof said alfredo as if such a thing would never enter his head jo are you going to stay with us again tonight you are welcome id just like an old rug thats all aunt nita said jo im going to sleep under georges caravan you can sleep on the floor inside if you like said george but jo shook her head no ive had enough of sleeping indoors for a bit i want to sleep out under the caravan will be a fine place for me gypsies often sleep there when the weather is warm they went back over the dark hillside a few stars were out but the moon was not yet up that was a jolly interesting evening said dick i enjoyed it i like your aunt and uncle jo jo was delighted she always loved praise from dick she went under the girls caravan and rolled herself up in the rug she had been taught to clean her teeth and wash and do her hair by the fostermother she had lived with for some months but all that was forgotten now that she was leading a gypsy life again in a day or two shell be the filthy dirty tanglyhaired rude girl she was when we first knew her said george combing out her own hair extra well im glad were going to stay here after all arent you anne i really do think the fair people are friendly towards us now thanks to jo said anne george said nothing she didnt like being under obligation to jo she finished preparing herself for bed and got into her bunk i wish wed seen that face at the window dont you anne she said i do wonder whose it was and why it was there looking out i dont think i want to talk about faces at windows just now said anne getting into her bunk lets change the subject she blew out the lamp and settled down they talked for a few minutes and then george heard something outside the caravan what could it be timmy raised his head and gave a little growl george looked at the window opposite a lone star shone through it and then something came in front of the star blotted it out and pressed itself against the glass pane timmy growled again but not very loudly was it someone he knew george flashed on her torch and immediately saw what it was she gave a little giggle then she called to anne anne anne quick theres a face at the window anne wake up im not asleep said annes voice and she sat up scared what face where youre not just frightening me are you no there it is look said george and shone her torch at the window a big long darkbrown face looked in and anne gave a shriek then she laughed you beast george its only alfredos horse oh you did give me a fright ive a good mind to pull you out of your bunk on to the floor go away you silly staring horse shoo go away chapter thirteen off to the castle contents prevnext next morning as they had breakfast the children discussed the face at the castle window again they had levelled the fieldglasses time and again at the window but there was nothing to be seen lets go and see over the castle as soon as it opens said dick but mind nobody is to mention faces at windows you hear me jo youre the one who cant keep your tongue still sometimes jo flared up im not i can keep a secret all right fireeater said dick with a grin he looked at his watch its too soon to go yet ill go and help mr slither with his snakes said jo anyone else coming mr slither what a marvellous name for a man who keeps snakes said dick i dont mind coming to watch but im not keen on the way they pour themselves up and down people they all went to mr slithers caravan except anne who said she would much rather clear up the breakfast things the snakeman had both his snakes out of their box he is polishing them said george sitting down near by see how he makes their brown bodies shine here jo you mop beauty for me said mr slither the stuff is in that bottle over there hes got those nasty little mites again under his scales mop him with that stuff and that will soon get rid of them jo seemed to know what to do she got a rag tipped up the bottle of yellow stuff and began to pat one of the snakes gently letting the lotion soak round his scales george not to be outdone offered to help in the polishing of the other snake you hold him then said mr slither and slid the snake over to george he got up and went into his caravan george hadnt quite bargained for this the snake lay across her knees and then began to wind round her body dont you let him get a hold of you with his tail jo warned her the boys soon got tired of seeing jo and george vying with one another over the pythons and went off to where bufflo was practising spinning roperings he spun loop after loop of rope making wonderful patterns in the air with it he grinned at the boys like a try he said but neither of them could do anything with the rope at all lets see you snap off something with the whiplash said dick i think youre a marvel at that what do you want me to hit asked bufflo picking up his magnificent whip the topmost leaves on that bush yes said dick bufflo looked at them swung his whip once or twice lifted it and cracked it like magic the topmost leaves disappeared off the bush the boys gazed in admiration now pick off that daisyhead over there said julian pointing crack the daisyhead vanished thats easy said bufflo look you hold a pencil or something in your hands one of you ill pick it out without touching your fingers julian hesitated but dick dived his hand into his pocket and brought out a red pencil not very long he held out his hand with the pencil between finger and thumb bufflo looked at it with halfclosed eyes as if measuring the distance he raised his whip crack the tipend of the lash curled itself round the pencil and pulled it clean out of dicks hand it flew up into the air and bufno reached out his hand and caught it jolly good said dick lost in admiration does it take long to learn a thing like that matter of twenty years or so said bufflo but you want to begin when youre a nipper about three years old say my pa taught me and if i didnt learn fast enough hed take the skin off the tips of my ears with his whiplash you soon learn if you know thats going to happen to you the boys gazed at bufflos big ears they certainly did look a bit rough at the edges i throw knives too said bufflo basking in the boys admiration i put skippy up against a board and throw knives all round her so that when she walks away from the board at the end theres her shape all outlined in knives like to see me well no not now said julian looking at his watch were going to see over the castle have you ever seen over it bufflo no who wants to waste time going over a ruined old castle said bufflo scornfully not me he went off to his caravan spinning roperings as he went with an ease that dick couldnt help envying from the bottom of his heart what a pity he hadnt begun to learn these things early enough he was afraid he would never be really good at them now he was too old george jo its time we went called julian put down those snakes and come along anne are you ready mr slither went to collect his snakes they glided over him in delight and he ran his hands over their smooth gleaming bodies i must wash my hands before i go said george theyre a bit snaky coming jo jo didnt really see why it was necessary to wash snaky hands but she went with george to the stream and they rinsed them thoroughly george wiped her hands on a rather dirty hanky and jo wiped hers on a much dirtier skirt she looked at georges shorts enviously what a pity to have to wear skirts they didnt lock up the caravans julian felt sure that the fairfolk were now really friendly to them and would not take anything from them themselves nor permit anyone else to do so they all walked down the hillside timmy bounding along joyfully under the impression that he was going to take them for a nice long walk they climbed over the stile walked up the lane a little way and came to the wooden gate that opened on to the steep path up to the castle now that it was so near to them it looked almost as if it might fall on top of them they went up the path and came to the small tower in which was the little door giving entrance to the castle an old woman was there looking a little like a witch if she had had green eyes anne would most certainly have set her down as a descendant of a witch but she had eyes like black beads she had no teeth at all and it was difficult to understand what she said five please said julian giving her twentyfive pence you cant take the dog in said the old woman mumbling so much that they couldnt make out what she said she pointed to the dog and repeated her remark again shaking her head all the time oh cant we really take our dog said george he wont do any harm the old woman pointed to a set of rules dogs not allowed in all right well leave him outside then said george crossly what a silly rule timmy stay here we wont be long timmy put his tail down he didnt approve of this but he knew that he was not allowed into certain places such as churches and he imagined this place must be an enormous church the kind of place into which george so often disappeared on sundays he lay down in a sunny corner the five children went in through the clicking turnstile they opened the door beyond and went into the castle grounds the door shut behind them wait we ought to get a guidebook said julian i want to know something about that tower he went back and bought one for another five pence they stood in the great castle yard and looked at the book it gave the history of the old place a history of peace and war quarrels and truces family feuds marriages and all the other things that make up history it would be an exciting story if it was written up properly said julian look heres the plan there are dungeons not open to the public quoted dick in disappointment what a pity it was once a very strong and powerful castle said julian looking at the plan it always had the strong wall that is still round it and the castle itself is built in the middle of a great courtyard that runs all round it says the walls of the castle itself are eight feet thick eight feet thick no wonder most of it is still standing they looked at the silent ruins in awe the castle towered up broken here and there with sometimes a whole wall missing and with all the doorways misshapen there were four towers of course said julian still with his nose glued to the guidebook it says three are almost completely ruined nowbut the fourth one is in fairly good condition though the stone stairway that led up to the top has fallen in well then you couldnt have seen a face at that window said george looking up at the fourth tower if the stairway has fallen in no one could get up there hm well see how much fallen in it is said julian it may be dangerous to the public and perhaps well find a notice warning us off but it might be quite climbable in places shall we go up it if so said jo her eyes shining what shall we do if we find the face well wait till we find it first said julian he shut the guidebook and put it into his pocket well we seem to be the only people here lets get going well walk round the courtyard first they walked round the courtyard that surrounded the castle it was strewn with great white stones that had fallen from the walls of the castle itself in one place a whole wall had fallen in and they could see the inside of the castle dark and forbidding they came round to the front of it again lets go in at the front door if you can call that great stone archway that said julian i say cant you imagine knights on horseback riding round this courtyard impatient to be off to some tournament their horses hoofs clipclopping all the time yes said dick i can just imagine it they went in at the arched entrance and wandered through room after room with stone floors and walls and with small slitlike windows that gave very little light indeed they had no glass for panes in those days said dick i bet they were glad on cold windy days that the windows were so tiny brrrrrrr this must have been a terribly cold place to live in the floors used to be covered with rushes and tapestry was hung on the walls said anne remembering a history lesson julian lets go and look for the stairway to that tower now do lets im longing to find out whether there really is a face up in that tower chapter fourteen faynights castle contents prevnext chackchackchack chackchackchack the jackdaws circled round the old castle calling to one another in their cheerful friendly voices the five children looked up and watched them you can see the grey at the backs of their necks said dick i wonder how many years jackdaws have lived round and about this castle i suppose the sticks lying all over this courtyard must have been dropped by them said julian they make their nests of big twigs really they must drop as many as they use just look at that pile over there very wasteful of them said dick i wish they would come and drop some near our caravan to save me going to get firewood each day for the fire they were standing at the great archway that made the entrance to the castle anne grew impatient do lets look at the towers now she said they went to the nearest one but it was almost impossible to realize that it had been a tower it was just a great heap of fallen stones piled one on top of another they went to the only good tower they had hoped to find some remains of a stone stairway but to their great disappointment they could not even look up into the tower one of the inner walls had fallen in and the floor was piled up completely blocked there was no sign of a stairway either it too had fallen in or it was covered by the stones of the ruined wall julian was astonished it was obvious that nobody could possibly climb up the tower from the inside then how in the world could there have been a face at the tower window he began to feel rather uncomfortable was it a real face if not what could it have been this is queer said dick thinking the same as julian and pointing to the heapedup stones on the ground floor of the tower it does look absolutely impossible for anyone to get up into the top of the tower well what about that face then lets go and ask that old woman if there is any way at all of getting up into the tower said julian she might know so they left the castle walked across the courtyard back to the little tower in the outer wall that guarded the big gateway the old woman was sitting by the turnstile knitting could you tell us please if there is any way of getting up into the tower over there asked julian the old woman answered something but it was difficult to understand a word she said however as she shook her head vigorously it was plain that there was no way up to the tower it was very puzzling is there a better plan of the castle than this asked julian showing his guidebook a plan of the dungeons for instance and a plan of the towers as they once were before they were ruined the old lady said something that sounded like society of reservation of somethingorother what did you say asked julian patiently the witchlike woman was evidently getting tired of these questions she opened a big book that showed the amount of people and fees paid and looked down it she put her finger on something written there and showed it to julian society for preservation of old buildings he read oh did somebody come from them lately would they know more than it says in the guidebook yes said the old woman two men came they spent all day here last thursday you ask that society what you want to know not me i only take the money she sounded quite intelligible all of a sudden then she relapsed into mumbles again and no one could understand a word anyway shes told us what we want to know said julian well telephone the society and ask them if they can tell us any more about the castle there may be secret passages and things not shown in the guidebook at all how exciting said george thrilled i say lets go back to that tower and look at the outside of it it might be climbable there they went back to see but it wasnt climbable although the stones it was built of were uneven enough to form slight footholds and handholds it would be much too dangerous for anyone to try to climb up even the catfooted jo for one thing it would not be possible to tell which stones were loose and crumbling until the climber caught hold and then down he would go all the same jo was willing to try i might be able to do it she said slipping off one of her shoes put your shoe on said dick at once you are not going to try any tricks of that sort there isnt even ivy for you to cling to jo put back her shoe sulkily looking astonishingly like george as she scowled and then to everyones enormous astonishment who should come bounding up to them but timmy timmy wherever have you come from said george in surprise theres no way in except through the turnstile and the door behind it is shut we shut it ourselves how did you get in woof said timmy trying to explain he ran to the good tower made his way over the blocks of stone lying about and stopped by a small space between three or four of the fallen stones woof he said again and pawed at one of the stones he came out there said george she tugged at a big stone but she couldnt move it an inch of course i dont know how in the world timmy squeezed himself out of this space it doesnt look big enough for a rabbit certainly none of us could get inside what puzzles me said julian is how timmy got in from the outside we left him right outside the castle so he must have run round the outer wall somewhere and found a small hole he must have squeezed into that yes thats right said dick we know the walls are eight feet thick so he must have found a place where a bit of it had broken at the bottom and forced his way in but would there be a hole right through the whole thickness of eight feet this was really puzzling they all looked at timmy and he wagged his tail expectantly then he barked loudly and capered round as if he wanted a game the door behind the turnstile opened at once and the old lady appeared how did that dog get here she called hes to go out at once we dont know how he got in said dick is there a hole in the outer wall no said the old woman not one you must have let that dog in when i wasnt looking hes to go out and you too youve been here long enough we may as well go said julian weve seen all there is to see or all that we are allowed to see im quite sure there is some way of getting up into that tower although the stairway is in ruins im going to ring up the society for the preservation of old buildings and ask them to put me in touch with the fellows who examined the castle last week they must have been experts yes they would probably have a complete plan said dick secret passages dungeons hidden rooms and all if there are any they took timmy by the collar and went out through the turnstiles clickclickclick i feel like having a couple of doughnuts at the dairy said george and some lemonade anyone else feel the same everyone did including timmy who barked at once timmys silly over those doughnuts said george he just wolfs them down its a great waste said anne he ate four last time more than anyone else had they walked down to the village you go and order what we want said julian and ill just go and look up this society it may have an office somewhere in this district he went to the post office to use the telephone there and the rest of them trooped in at the door of the bright little dairy the plump shopwoman welcomed them beamingly she considered them her best customers and they certainly were they were each on their second doughnut when julian came back any news asked dick yes said julian peculiar news though i found the address of the society theyve got a branch about fifty miles from here that deals with all the old buildings for a radius of a hundred miles i asked if they had any recent booklet about the castle he stopped to take a doughnut and bit into it the others waited patiently while he chewed they said they hadnt the last time they had checked over faynights castle was two years ago but but what about those two men who came from the society last week then said george yes thats what i said answered julian taking another bite and heres the peculiar bit they said they didnt know what i was talking about nobody had been sent there from the society and who was i anyhow hmm said dick thinking hard then those men were examining and exploring the castle for their own reasons i agree said julian and i cant help thinking that the face at the window and those two men have something to do with one another its quite clear that the men had nothing whatever to do with any official society they merely gave it as an excuse because they wanted to find out what kind of hidingplace the castle had the others stared at him feeling a familiar excitement rising in them what george called the adventure feeling then there was a real face at that tower window and there is a way of getting up there said anne yes said julian i know it sounds very farfetched but i do think there is just a possibility that those two scientists have gone there i dont know if you read it in the paper but one of them jeffrey pottersham has written a book on famous ruins he would know all about faynights castle because its a very wellknown one if they wanted to hide somewhere till the hue and cry had died down and then escape to another country well they could hide in the tower and then quietly slip out from the castle one night go down to the sea and hire a fishingboat cried dick taking the words out of julians mouth theyd be across the channel in no time yes thats what id worked out too said julian i rather think ill telephone uncle quentin about this ill describe the face as well as i can to him i feel this is all rather too important to manage quite on our own those men may have extremely important secrets its an adventure again said jo her face serious but her eyes very bright oh im glad im in it too chapter fifteen an interesting day contents prevnext everyone began to feel distinctly excited i think ill catch the bus into the next town said julian the telephonebox here is too easily overheard id rather go to a kiosk somewhere in a street where nobody can hear what im saying all right you go said dick well do some shopping and go back to the caravans i wonder what uncle quentin will say julian went off to the busstop the others wandered in and out of the few village shops doing their marketing tomatoes lettuces mustard and cress sausage rolls fruit cake tins of fruit and plenty of creamy milk in big quart bottles they met some of the fairfolk in the street and everyone was very friendly indeed mrs alfredo was there with an enormous basket nearly as big as herself she beamed and called across to them you see i have to do my shopping myself that big bad man is too lazy to do it for me and he has no brains i tell him to bring back meat and he brings fish i tell him to buy cabbage and he brings lettuce he has no brains the children laughed it was strange to find great big alfredo a real fireeater ordered about and grumbled at by his tiny little wife its a change to find them all so friendly said george pleased long may it last theres the snakeman mr slither he hasnt got his snakes with him though hed have the whole village to himself if he did said anne i wonder what he buys to feed his snakes on theyre only fed once a fortnight said jo they swallow no dont tell me said anne hastily i dont really want to know look theres skippy skippy waved cheerily she carried bags filled to bursting too the fairfolk certainly did themselves well they must make a lot of money said anne well they spend it when they have it said jo they never save its either a good time for them or a very bad time they must have had a good run at the last showplacethey all seem very rich they went back to the camp and spent a very interesting day because the fairfolk eager to make up for their unfriendly behaviour made them all very welcome alfredo explained his fireeating a little more and showed how he put wads of cotton wool at the hookend of his torches and then soaked them in petrol to flare easily the rubberman obligingly wriggled in and out of the wheelspokes of his caravan a most amazing feat he also doubled himself up and twisted his arms and legs together in such a peculiar manner that he seemed to be more like a fourtentacled octdpus than a human being he offered to teach dick how to do this but dick couldnt even bend himself properly double he was disappointed because he couldnt help thinking what a marvellous trick it would be to perform in the playingfield at school mr slither gave them a most entertaining talk about snakes and ended up with some information about poisonous snakes that he said they might find very useful indeed take rattlers now he said or mambas or any poisonous snake if you want to catch one to tame dont go after it with a stick or pin it to the ground that frightens it and you cant do anything with it what do you have to do then asked george well you want to watch their forked tongues said mr slither earnestly you know how they put them out and make them quiver and shake yes said everyone well now if a poisonous snake makes its tongue go all stiff without a quiver in it just be careful said mr slither solemnly dont you touch it then but if its tongue is nice and quivery just slide your arms along its body and it will let you pick it up he went through the motions he described picking up a pretend snake and letting its body slither through his arms it was fascinating to watch but very weird thanks most awfully said dick whenever i pick up poisonous snakes ill do exactly as you say the others laughed dick sounded as if he went about picking up poisonous snakes every day mr slither was pleased to have such an appreciative audience george and anne however had firmly made up their minds that they were not going even to look at a snakes tongue if it put it out they were going to run for miles there were a few more fairfolk there that the children didnt know much about dacca the tapdancer who put on high boots and tapdanced for the children on the top step of her caravan pearl who was an acrobat and could walk on a wirerope dance on it and turn somersaults over it landing back safely each time and others who belonged to the show but only helped with the crowds and the various turns jo didnt know them all but she was soon so much one of them that the children began to wonder if she would ever go back to her fostermother again shes exactly like them all now said george cheerful and dirty slapdash and generous lazy and yet hardworking too bufflo practises for hours at his ropespinning but he lies about for hours too theyre queer folk but i really do like them very much the others agreed with her heartily they had their lunch without julian because he hadnt come back why was he so long he only had to telephone his uncle he came back at last sorry im so late he said but first of all i couldnt get any answer at all so i waited a bit in case aunt fanny and uncle quentin were out and i had lunch while i waited then i telephoned again and aunt fanny was in but uncle quentin had gone to london and wouldnt be back till night to london said george astonished he hardly ever goes to london apparently he went up about these two missing scientists said julian hes so certain that his friend terrykane isnt a traitor and he went up to tell the authorities so well i couldnt wait till night of course didnt you report our news then said dick disappointed yes but i had to tell aunt fanny said julian she said she would repeat it all to uncle quentin when he came back tonight its a pity i couldnt get hold of him and find out what he thinks i asked aunt fanny to tell him to write to me at once after tea they sat on the hillside again basking in the sun it really was wonderful weather for them julian looked over to the ruined castle opposite he fixed his eyes on the tower where they had seen the face it was so far away that he could only just make out the windowslit get your glasses george he said we may as well have another squint at that window it was about this time that we saw the face george fetched them she would not give them to julian first though she put them to her own eyes and gazed at the window at first she saw nothing and then quite suddenly a face appeared at the window george was so astonished that she cried out julian snatched the glasses from her he focused them on the window and saw the face at once yes the same as yesterday eyebrows and all dick took the glasses and then each of them in turn gazed at the strange face it did not move at all as far as they could see but simply stared then when anne was looking at it it suddenly disappeared and did not come back again well we didnt imagine it yesterday then said julian its there all right and where theres a face there should be a body er did any of you think that the face had a a sort of despairing expression yes said dick and the others agreed i thought so yesterday too said dick do you suppose the fellow whoever he is is being kept prisoner up there it looks like it said julian but how in the world did he get there its a marvellous place to put him of course nobody would ever dream of a hidingplace like that and if it hadnt been for us looking at the jackdaws through very fine fieldglasses wed never have seen him looking out it was a chance in a thousand that we saw him in a million said dick look here ju i think we ought to go up to the castle and yell up to the fellow he might be able to yell back or throw a message out he would have thrown out a message before now if hed been able to said julian as for yelling hed have to lean right out of that thickwalled window to make himself heard hes right at the back of it remember and the slit is very deep cant we go and find out something said george who was longing to take some action after all timmy got in somewhere and we might be able to as well thats quite an idea said julian timmy did find a way in and it may be the way that leads up to the top of the tower lets go then said george at once not now said julian wed be seen if we scrambled about on the hill outside the castle walls wed have to go at night we could go when the moon comes up a shiver of excitement ran through the whole five timmy thumped his tail on the ground he had been listening all the time just as if he understood well take you too timmy said george just in case we run into any trouble we shant get into trouble said julian were only going to explore and i dont think for a minute well find much because im sure we shant be able to get up into the tower but i expect you all feel like i do you cant leave this mystery of the face at the window alone you want to do something about it even if its only scrambling round the old walls at night yes thats exactly how i feel said george i wouldnt be able to go to sleep tonight i know oh julian isnt this exciting very said julian im glad we didnt leave today after all we should have if we hadnt seen that face at the window the sun went down and the air grew rather cold they went into the boys caravan and played cards not feeling at all sleepy jo was very bad at cards and soon stopped playing she sat watching her arm round timmys neck they had a supper of sausage rolls and tinned strawberries its a pity they dont have meals like this at school said dick no trouble to prepare and most delicious to eat julian is it time to go yes said julian put on warm things and well set off heres to a really adventurous night chapter sixteen secret ways contents prevnext they waited till the moon went behind a cloud and then like moving shadows made their way down the hillside as fast as they could they did not want any of the fairfolk to see them they clambered over the stile and went up the lane they made their way up the steep path to the castle but when they came to the little tower where the turnstile was they went off to the right and walked round the foot of the great thick walls it was difficult to walk there because the slope of the hill was so steep timmy went with them excited at this unexpected walk now timmy listen we want you to show us how you got in said george are you listening timmy go in timmy go in where you went this morning timmy waved his long tail panted and let his tongue hang out in the way he did when he wanted to show he was being as helpful as he could he ran in front sniffing then he suddenly stopped and looked back he gave a little whine the others hurried to him the moon most annoyingly went behind a cloud julian took out his torch and shone it where timmy stood the dog stood there looking very pleased well what is there to be pleased about timmy said julian puzzled theres no hole there nowhere you could possibly have got in what are you trying to show us timmy gave a little bark then suddenly leapt about four feet up the uneven stones of the wall and disappeared hie wheres he gone said julian startled and flashed his torch up i say look theres a stone missing up there quite a big block and timmys gone in at the hole theres the block fallen down the hillside said dick pointing to a big white stone roughly square in shape but how has timmy gone in ju this wall is frightfully thick and even if one stone falls out there must be plenty more behind julian climbed up he came to the space where the great fallen stone had been and flashed his torch there i say this is interesting he called the wall is hollow just here timmys gone into the hollow at once a surge of excitement went through the whole lot can we get in and follow timmy called george shout to him julian and see where he is julian called into the hollow timmy timmy where are you a distant rather muffled bark answered him and then timmys eyes suddenly gleamed up at julian the dog was standing down in the small hollow behind the fallen stone hes here called back julian i tell you what i think weve hit on when this enormous wall was built a space was left inside either to save stones or to make a hidden passage i dont know which and that fallen stone has exposed a bit of the hollow shall we explore oh yes came the answer at once julian climbed down into the middle of the wall he flashed his torch into the space he was standing in yes he called its a kind of passage its small though well have to bend almost double to get along it anne you come next then i can help you will the air be all right called dick into the passage it smells a bit musty said julian but if it really is a passage there must be secret airholes somewhere to keep the air fresh in here thats right anne you hang on to me jo you come next then george then dick soon they were all in the curious passage which ran along in the centre of the wall it certainly was very small they all got tired of going along bent double it was pitch dark too and although they all had torches except jo it was very difficult to see anne hung on to julians coat for dear life she wasnt enjoying this very much but she wouldnt have been left out of it for anything julian suddenly stopped and everyone bumped into the one in front whats up called dick from the back steps here shouted back julian steps going down very very steeply almost like a stone ladder be careful everybody the steps were certainly steep better go down backwards decided julian then we can have handholds as well as footholds anne wait till im down and ill help you the steps went down for about ten feet julian got down safely then anne turned herself round and went down backwards too as if she were on a ladder instead of on stairs it was much easier that way at the bottom was another passage wider and higher for which everyone was devoutly thankful where does this lead to said julian stopping to think this passage is at right angles to the wall weve left the wall now were going underneath part of the courtyard i should think i bet were not far from that tower called dick i say do hope this leads to the tower nobody could possibly tell where it was going to lead to anyway it seemed to run quite straight and after about eighty feet of it julian stopped again steps up again he called just as steep as the others i think we may be going up into the inside of the castle walls this is possibly a secret way into one of the old rooms of the castle they went carefully up the steep stone steps and found themselves not in a passage but in a very small room that appeared to be hollowed out of the wall of the castle itself julian stopped in surprise and everyone crowded into the tiny room it really wasnt much larger than a big cupboard a narrow bench stood at one side with a shelf above it an old pitcher stood on the shelf with a broken lip and on the bench was a small dagger rusty and broken i say look here this is a secret room like they used to have in old places so that someone might hide if necessary said julian were inside one of the walls of the castle itself perhaps the wall of an old bedroom and theres the old pitcher that had water in said george and a dagger who hid here and how long ago dick flashed his torch round to see if he could spot anything else he gave a sudden exclamation and kept his torch fixed on a corner of the room what is it said julian paper red and blue silver paper said dick chocolate wrapping how many times have we bought this kind of chocolate wrapped in silver paper patterned with red and blue he picked it up and straightened it out yes there was the name of the chocolate firm on it everyone was silent this could only mean one thing someone had been in this room lately someone who ate chocolate someone who had thrown down the wrapping never expecting it to be found well said julian breaking the silence this is surprising someone else knows this way in where does it lead to up to that tower i imagine hadnt we better be careful said dick lowering his voice i mean whoever was here might quite well be wandering about somewhere near yes perhaps wed better go back said julian thinking of the girls no said george in a fierce whisper lets go on we can be very cautious a passage led from the strange hidden room it went along on the level for a little way and then they arrived at a spiral stairway that ran straight upwards like a corkscrew at the top they came to a small very narrow door it had a great oldfashioned iron ring for a handle julian stood hesitating should he open it or not he stood for half a minute trying to make up his mind he whispered back to the others ive come to a little door shall i open it yes came back the answering whispers julian cautiously took hold of the iron ring he turned it and it made no noise he wondered if the door was locked on the other side but it wasnt it opened silently julian looked through it expecting to see a room but there wasnt one instead he found himself on a small gallery that seemed to run all the way round the inside of the tower the moon shone in through a slitwindow and julian could just make out that he must be looking down from a gallery into the darkness of a towerroom on the second or third floor of the tower the third probably he pulled anne out and the other three followed there was no sound to be heard julian whispered to the others weve come out on to a gallery which overlooks one of the rooms inside the tower it may be a secondfloor room because we know that the ceiling of the first floor has fallen in or perhaps its even the third floor must be the third said dick were pretty high his whisper went all round the gallery and came back to them he had spoken more loudly than julian it made them jump how do we get higher still whispered george is there any way up from this gallery well walk round it and see said julian be as quiet as you can i dont think theres anyone here but you never know and watch your step in case the stone isnt sound its very crumbly here and there julian led the way round the curious little gallery had this towerroom been used for old plays or mimes was the gallery for spectators he wished he could turn back the years and lean over the gallery to see what had been going on in the room below when the castle was full of people about threequarters of the way round the gallery a little flight of steps led downwards into the room below but just beyond where the steps began there was another door set in the wall very like the one they had just come through it too had an iron ring for a handle julian turned it slowly it didnt open was it locked there was a great key standing in the iron lock and julian turned it but still the door didnt open then he saw that it was bolted the bolt was securely pushed home so somebody was a prisoner the other side was it the man who owned the face julian turned and whispered very softly in annes ear theres a door here bolted my side looks as if were coming to the face tell george to send timmy right up to me anne whispered to george and george pushed timmy forward he squeezed past annes legs and stood by julian sensing the sudden excitement were probably coming to stairs that lead up to the top towerroom where that window is with the face thought julian as he slid back the bolt very cautiously he pushed the door and it opened he stood listening his torch switched off then he switched it on just as he had thought another stone stairway led up steeply at the top must be the prisoner whoever he was well go up said julian softly quiet everybody chapter seventeen excitement and shocks contents prevnext timmy strained forward but julian had his hand on the dogs collar he went up the stone stairway very steep and narrow the others followed with hardly a sound all of them but jo had on their rubber shoes she had bare feet timmy made the most noise because his claws clicked on the stone at the top was another door from behind it came a curious noiseguttural and growling timmy growled in his throat at first julian couldnt think what the noise was then he suddenly knew somebody snoring well thats lucky i can take a peep in and see who it is we must be at the top of the tower now the door in front of him was not locked he pushed it open and looked inside his hand still on timmys collar the moonlight struck through a narrow window and fell on the face of a sleeping man julian stared at it in rising excitement those eyebrows yes this was the man whose face had appeared at the window and i know who he is too it is terrykane thought julian moving like a shadow into the room hes exactly like the picture we saw in the papers perhaps the other man is here too he looked cautiously round the room but could see no one else although it was possible there might be someone in the darkest shadows he listened there was only the snoring of the man lying in the moonlight he could not hear the breathing of anyone else with his hand still on timmys collar he switched on his torch and swept it round the towerroom its beam piercing the black corners no one was there except the one man and with a sudden shock julian saw that he was tied with ropes his arms were bound behind him and his legs were tied together too if this was terrykane then his uncle must be right the man was no traitor he had been kidnapped and was a prisoner everyone was now in the room staring at the sleeping man he had his mouth open and he still snored loudly what are you going to do julian whispered george wake him up julian nodded he went over to the sleeping man and shook him by the shoulder he woke up at once and stared in amazement at julian who was full in the moonlight he struggled up to a sitting position who are you he said how did you get here and who are those over in the shadows there listen are you mr terrykane asked julian yes i am but who are you we are staying on the hill opposite the castle said julian and we saw your face at the window through our fieldglasses so we came to find you but but how do you know who i am said the man still amazed we read about you in the papers said julian and we saw your picture we couldnt help noticing your eyebrows sir we even saw them through the glasses look here can you undo me said the man eagerly i must escape tomorrow night my enemies are smuggling me out of here into a car and down to the sea and a boat is being hired to take me across to the continent they want me to tell them what i know about my latest experiments i shant of course but life wouldnt be at all pleasant for me ill cut the ropes said julian and he took out his pocketknife he cut the knots that tied terrykanes wrists together and then freed his legs timmy stood and watched ready to pounce if the man did anything fierce thats better said the man stretching his arms out how did you manage to get to the window asked julian watching the man rub his arms and knees each evening one of the men who brought me here comes to bring me food and drink said terrykane he undoes my hands so that i can feed myself he sits and smokes while i eat taking no notice of me i drag myself over to the window to have a breath of fresh air i cant stay there long because i am soon tied up again of course i cant imagine how anyone could see my face at this deepset slitwindow it was our fieldglasses said julian they are such fine ones its a good thing you did get to the window for a breath of air or wed never have found you julian i can hear a noise said jo suddenly she had ears like a cat able to pick up the slightest sound where said julian turning sharply downstairs whispered jo wait ill go and see she slipped out of the door and down the steep little stairs she came to the door at the bottom the one that led into the gallery yes someone was coming coming along the gallery too jo thought quickly if she darted back up the stairs to warn the others this newcomer might go up there too and they would all be caught he could bolt the door at the top and would have six prisoners instead of one she decided to crouch down on the floor of the gallery a little beyond the door that led upwards footsteps came loudly along the gallery and up to the door then the stranger obviously found the door unbolted and stopped in consternation he stood perfectly still listening jo thought he really must be able to hear her heart beating it was thumping so loudly she didnt dare to call out to try and warn the others if she did they would walk straight into his arms and then jo heard julians voice calling quietly down the stone stairs jo jo where are you and then oh dear she thought she could hear julian coming down the stairs to find her dont come julian she said under her breath dont come but julian came right down and behind him came terrykane and dick with the girls following with timmy on their way to escaping the stranger down at the door was even more amazed to hear voices and footsteps he slammed the door suddenly and rammed the stout bolt home the footsteps on the stairs stopped in alarm hey jo is that you called julians voice open the door the stranger spoke angrily the doors bolted who are you there was a silence then terrykane answered so youre back again pottersham open that door at once oho thought julian so the other scientist is here too jeffrey pottersham he must have got terrykane here by kidnapping him what can have happened to jo the man at the door stood there as if he didnt quite know what to do jo crouched down in the gallery and listened intently the man spoke again who set you free whos that with you now listen pottersham said terrykanes voice ive had enough of this nonsense you must be out of your mind acting like this doping me and kidnapping me telling me were going to go off by fishingboat to the continent and the rest of it there are four children here who saw my face at the window and came to investigate and children said pottersham taken aback what in the middle of the night how did they get up to this tower im the only one that knows the way in pottersham open the door shouted terrykane furiously he gave it a kick but the old door was sturdy and strong you can go back to the tower all of you said pottersham im going off to get fresh orders it looks as if well have to take those kids with us terrykane theyll be sorry they saw your face at the window they wont like life where were going pottersham turned and went back the way he had come jo guessed that he knew the same way in as they had happened on she waited until she felt that it was perfectly safe and then she ran to the door again she hammered on it dick dick come down where are you she heard an answering shout from up the stairs behind the door and then dick came running down jo unbolt the door quick jo unbolted it but it wouldnt open julian had now come down too and he called to jo turn the key jo it may be locked too julian the keys gone cried jo and she tugged in vain at the door he must have locked it as well as bolted it and hes taken the key oh how can i get you out you cant said dick still youre free jo you can go and tell the police buck up now you know the way dont you i havent got a torch said jo oh dear well we cant possibly get one of ours out to you said dick youd better wait till morning then jo you may lose yourself down in those dark passages yeswait till morning the passages will still be dark said poor jo id better go now no youre to wait till morning said julian fearing that jo might wander off in the strange passages and be lost for ever she might even find herself down in the dungeons horrible thought all right said jo ill wait till morning ill curl up on the gallery here its quite warm it will be very hard said dick well go back to the room upstairs jo call us if you want us what a blessing youre free jo curled up on the gallery but she couldnt sleep for one thing the floor was very hard and the stone was very very cold she suddenly thought of the little room where they had seen the pitcher the dagger and the chocolate wrappingpaper that would be a far better place to sleep she could lie on the bench she stood up and thought out the way all she had to do was to go round the gallery till she came to the little door that opened on to the corkscrew staircase leading from the gallery to the little hidden room she made her way cautiously to the door she felt for the iron ring turned it and opened the door it was very very dark and she could see nothing at all in front of her she put out her foot carefully was she at the top of the spiral staircase she found that she was she held out her hands on either side touching the stone walls of the curious little stairway and went slowly down step by step oh dear am i going the right way the stairs seem to be going on so long thought jo i dont like it but i must go on chapter eighteen jo has an adventure on her own contents prevnext jo came to the end of the spiral stairway at last she found herself on the level once more and remembered the little straight passage that led to the secret room from the stairway good good good now she would soon be in the room and could lie down on the bench she went through the doorway of the secret room without knowing it because it was so dark she groped her way along and suddenly felt the edge of the bench here at last she said thankfully out loud and then poor jo got a dreadful shock a pair of strong arms went round her and held her fast she screamed and struggled her heart beating in wild alarm who was it oh if only she had a light and then a torch was switched on and held to her face oho you must be jo i suppose said pottershams voice i wondered who you were when one of those kids yelled out for you i thought you must be wandering somewhere about i guessed youd come this way and i sat on the bench and waited for you let me go said jo fiercely and struggled like a wild cat the man only held her all the more tightly he was very strong jo suddenly put down her face and bit his hand he gave a shout and loosened his hold jo was almost free when he caught her again and shook her like a rat you little wild cat dont you do that again jo did it again even more fiercely and the man dropped her on to the ground nursing his hand jo made for the entrance of the room but again the man was too quick and she found herself held again ill tie you up said the man furiously ill rope you so that you wont be able to move and ill leave you here in the dark till i come back again he took a rope from round his waist and proceeded to tie jo up so thoroughly that she could hardly move her hands were behind her back her legs were tied at knees and ankles she rolled about the floor calling the man all the names she knew well youre safe for the time being said pottersham sucking his bitten hand now im going i wish you joy of the hard cold floor and the darkness you savage little wild cat jo heard his footsteps going in the distance she could have kicked herself for not having guessed he might have been lying in wait for her now she couldnt get help for the others in fact she was much worse off than they were because she was tied up and they werent poor jo she dozed off exhausted by the nights excitement and her fierce struggle she lay against the wall so uncomfortable that she kept waking from her doze every few minutes and then a thought came into her head she remembered the ropeman all tied up in length after length of knotted rope she had watched him set himself free so many times could any of his tricks help her now the ropeman would be able to get himself free of this rope in two minutes she thought and began to wriggle and struggle again but she was not the ropeman and after about an hour she was so exhausted again that she went into a doze once more when she awoke she felt better she forced herself into a sitting position and made herself think clearly and slowly work one knot free first she said to herself remembering what the ropeman had told her at first you wont know which knot is best when you know that you will always be able to free yourself in two minutes but find that one knot first she said all this to herself as she tried to find a knot that might be worked loose at last one seemed a little looser than the others it was one that bound her left wrist to her right she twisted her wrist round and got her thumb to the knot she picked and pulled and at last it loosened a little she had more control over that hand now if only she had a knife somewhere she could manage to get it between her finger and thumb now and perhaps use it to cut another knot she suddenly lost her patience and flung her head back on the bench straining and pulling at the rope she knocked against something and it fell to the stone floor with a clatter jo wondered what it was and then she knew that dagger that old rusty dagger oh if i could find it i might do something with it she swung herself round on the floor till she felt the dagger under her she rolled over on her back and tried to pick it up with her free finger and thumb and at last she managed to hold it she sat up bent forward and did her best to force the rusty dagger up and down a little on the rope that tied her hands behind her she could hardly move it at all because her hands were still so tightly tied but she persevered she grew so tired that she had to give it up for a long while then she tried again then had another long rest the third time she was lucky the rope suddenly frayed and broke she pulled her hands hard found them looser and picked at a knot it took jo a long long time to free her hands but she did it at last she couldnt manage to undo her legs at first because her hands were trembling so much but after another long rest she undid the tight knots and shook her legs free well thank goodness i learnt a few hints from the ropeman she said out loud id never have got free if i hadnt she wondered what the time was it was pitch dark in the little room of course she stood up and was surprised to find that her legs were shaky she staggered a few steps and then sat down again but her legs soon felt better and she stood up once more now to find my way out she said how i wish i had a torch she went carefully down the flight of stone steps that led down from the room and then came to the wide passage that ran under the courtyard she went along it glad it was level and then came once again to stone steps that led upwards up she climbed knowing that she was going the right way although she was in the dark now she came to the small passage where she had to bend almost double the one that ran through the centre of the thick outerwalls jo heaved a sigh of relief surely she would soon come to where the stone had fallen out and would be able to see daylight she saw daylight before she came to the place where the stone was missing she saw it some way in front of her a misty little patch that made her wonder what it was at first then she knew daylight oh thank goodness she stumbled along to it and climbed up to the hole from which the stone had fallen she sat there drinking in the sunlight it was bright and warm and very comforting after the darkness of the passages jo felt quite dazed then she suddenly realized how very high the sun was in the sky goodness it must be afternoon she looked cautiously out of the hole in the wall now that she was so near freedom she didnt want to be caught by anyone watching out for her there was nobody jo leapt down from the hole and ran down the steep hillside she went as surefooted as a goat leaping along till she came to the lane she crossed it and made her way to the caravanfield she was just about to go over the stile when she stopped julian had said she was to go to the police but jo like the other gypsy folk was afraid of the police no gypsy ever asked the police for help jo felt herself shrivelling up inside when she thought of talking to big policemen no ill go to uncle fredo she thought he will know what to do i will tell him all about it she was going up the field when she saw someone strange there who was it could it be that horrid man who had tied her up she had not seen him at all clearly and she was afraid it might be she saw that he was talking urgently to some of the fairfolk they were listening politely but jo could see that they thought he was rather mad she went a bit nearer and found that he was asking where julian and the rest were he was becoming very angry with the fairpeople because they assured him that they did not know where the children had gone its the man they call pottersham said jo to herself and dived under a caravan hes come to find out how much weve told anyone about that face she hid till he had gone away down the hillside to the lane very red in the face and shouting out that he would get the police jo crawled out and the fairfolk crowded round her at once where have you been where are the others that man wanted to know all about you he sounds quite mad hes a bad man said jo ill tell you all about him and where the others are weve got to rescue them whereupon jo launched into her story with the greatest zest beginning in the middle then going back to the beginning putting in things she had forgotten and thoroughly muddling everyone when she ended they all stared at her in excitement they didnt really know what it was all about but they had certainly gathered a few things you mean to say that those kids are locked up in that tower over there said alfredo amazed and a spy is with them no hes not a spy hes a good man explained jo what they call a scientist very very clever that man who left just now he said he was a a scientitist said skippy stumbling over the unfamiliar word well hes a bad man said jo firmly he is probably a spy he kidnapped the good man up in the tower there to take him away to another country and he tied me up too like i told you see my wrists and ankles she displayed them cut and bruised the fairfolk looked at them in silence then bufflo cracked his whip and made everyone jump we will rescue them he said this is no police job it is our job i say look that scientitist comes back said skippy suddenly and sure enough there he was coming hurriedly up the field to ask some more questions we will get him muttered bufflo all the fairfolk waited in silence for the man to come up then they closed round him solidly and began to walk up the hill the man was taken with them he couldnt help himself he was walked behind a caravan and before the crowd had come apart again he was on the ground neatly roped by the ropeman well weve got you said the ropeman and now well get on to the next bit of business chapter nineteen jo joins in contents prevnext the scientist as skippy persisted in calling him was put into an empty caravan with windows and doors shut because he shouted so loudly when the snakeman opened the door and slid in one of his pythons the scientist stopped shouting at once and lay extremely still the snakeman opened the door and his python glided out again but the man in the caravan had learnt his lesson not another sound came from him then everyone in the camp held a conference there was no hurry about it at all because it had been decided that nothing should be done before nighttime if we make a rescue in the daylight then the police will come said alfredo they will interfere they will not believe a word we say they never do how shall we rescue them said skippy do we go through these strange passages and up steep stone stairs it does not sound nice to me it isnt at all nice jo assured her and anyway it wouldnt be sensible the door leading to the towerroom is locked i told you and that man has got the key ah said bufflo springing up at once you didnt tell us that before he has the key then i will get it from him i didnt think of that said jo watching bufflo leap up the caravan steps he came out in a minute or two and joined them again he has no key on him he said he says he never had he says we are all mad and he will get the police he will find it hard to get the police just yet said mrs alfredo and gave a high little laugh he has thrown away the key or given it to a friend perhaps well its settled we cant get in through the door that leads to the towerroom then said the snakeman who seemed to have a better grasp of things than the others right is there any other way into the room only by the window said jo that slitwindow there see too high for any ladder of course anyway weve got to get into the courtyard first well have to climb over the high castle wall that is easy said the rubberman i can climb any wall but not perhaps one so high as the tower wall can anyone get into or out of the slit of a window asked bufflo screwing up his eyes to look at the tower oh yes its bigger than you think said jo its very deep the walls are so thick you see though i dont think they are so thick up there as they are down below but bufflo how can anyone get up to that window it can be done said bufflo that is not so difficult you can lend us a pegrope jekky he said to the ropeman yes said jekky jo knew what that was a thick rope with pegs thrust through the strands to act as footholds but how will you get the pegrope up said jo puzzled it can be done said bufflo again and the talking went on jo suddenly began to feel terribly hungry and got up to get herself a meal when she got back to the conference everything was apparently settled we set off tonight as soon as darkness comes bufflo told her you will not come jo this is mans business of course im coming said jo amazed that anyone should think she wasnt theyre my friends arent they im coming all right you are not said bufflo and jo immediately made up her mind to disappear before the men set off and hide somewhere so that she might follow them by this time it was about six oclock bufflo and the ropeman disappeared in jekkys caravan and became very busy there jo went peeping in at the door to see what they were doing but they ordered her out this is not your business any more they said and turned her out when she refused to go when darkness came a little company set out from the camp they had searched for jo to make sure she was not coming but she had disappeared bufflo led the way down the hill looking extremely fat because he was wound about with a great deal of pegrope then came mr slither with one of his pythons draped round him then the rubberman with mr alfredo bufflo also carried his whip though nobody quite knew why anyway bufflo always did carry a whip it was part of him so nobody questioned him about it behind them like a little shadow slipped jo what were they going to do she had watched the towerwindow for the last two hours and when darkness came she saw a light there a light that shone on and off on and off thats dick or julian signalling she thought they will have wondered why i havent brought help sometime today they dont know that i was captured and tied up ill have something to tell them when were all together again the little company went over the stile into the lane and up the path to the castle they came to the wall the rubberman took a jump at it and literally seemed to run up it fling himself on to the top roll over and disappear hes over said bufflo what it is to be made of rubber i dont believe that fellow ever feels hurt there was a low whistle from the other side of the wall bufflo unwound a thin rope from his waist tied a stone to it and flung it over the rope slithered after the stone and over the wall like a long thin worm thud they heard the stone fall on the ground the other side another low whistle told them that the rubberman had it bufflo then undid the pegrope from his waist and he and the others held out its length between them standing one behind the other one end was fastened to the thin rope whose other end held the stone the rubberman on the other side of the wall began to pull on the thin rope when all the slack was taken in the pegrope began to go up the wall too because it was tied to the thin rope and had to follow it up went the pegrope and up looking like a great thick caterpillar with tufts sticking out of its sides jo watched yes that was clever a good and easy way of getting over the thick high wall but to get the pegrope up to the slitwindew would not be so easy a whistle came again bufflo let go the pegrope and it swung flat against his side of the wall he tugged it it was firm evidently the rubberman had tied it fast to something it was safe to go up it would bear anyones weight without slipping down the wall bufflo went up first using the pegs as footholds and pulling himself up by the rope between the pegs each of the men was quick and deft in the way he climbed jo waited till the last one had started up and then leapt for the rope too up she went like a cat and landed beside bufflo on the other side of the wall he was astounded and gave her a cuff she dodged away and stood aside watching she wondered how the men intended to reach the topmost window of the high tower perhaps she would be of some help if only she could be the four men stood in the moonlight looking up at the tower they talked in low tones while the rubberman undid the thin rope from the pegrope and neatly coiled it into loops the pegrope was left on the wall jo heard a car going up the lane at the bottom of the castle hill she heard it stop and back somewhere part of her attention was on the four men and the other part on the car the car stopped its engine there was no further sound jo forgot it for a few minutes and then was on the alert againwas that voices she heard somewhere she listened intently the sound came again on the night air a low murmur that came nearer jo held her breath could that horrid man what was his name pottershamcould he have arranged for his equally horrid friends to fetch mr terrykane and all the children out of the tower that night and take them off to the coast perhaps they had already hired a fishingboat from joseph the old fisherman and they would all be away and never heard of again so the thoughts ran in jos alert mind mr pottersham would have had plenty of time to get fresh orders and arrange everything before he had gone to the camp and got himself locked up in a caravan oh dear dare she go and warn her uncle alfredo where he stood in the moonlight holding a little conference with the others hell cuff me as soon as i go near thought jo rubbing her left ear which still stung from bafflos cuff they wont listen to me i know still ill try she went up to the group of men cautiously she saw bufflo take out a daggerknife from his belt and tie it to the end of the thin rope that the rubberman held she guessed in a moment what he was about to do and ran to him no bufflo no dont throw that knife up youll hurt someone you might wound one of them no bufflo no clear out said bufflo angrily and raised his hand to slap her she dodged away she went round the group to her uncle uncle fredo she said beseechingly listen i can hear voices i think those alfredo pushed her away roughly will you stop this jo do you want a good whipping you behave like a buzzing fly mr slither called her see here jo if you want to be useful hold beauty for me he will be in the way in a minute he draped the great snake over her shoulders and beauty hissed loudly he began to coil himself round jo and she caught hold of his tail she liked beauty but just at that moment she didnt want him at all she stood back and watched what bufflo was going to do she knew of course and her heart beat fearfully he was going to throw his knife through that high slitwindow a thing that surely only bufflo with his unerring aim could possibly do but if he gets it through the window it may stick into one of the four up there or into mr terrykane she thought in a panic it might wound dick or timmy oh i wish bufflo wouldnt do it she heard low voices again this time they came from just the other side of the wall men were going to follow those secret passages and go right up to the towerroom jo knew they were they would be there before bufflo and the others had followed out their rescue plan she pictured the four children being dragged down the stairs and terrykane too would timmy defend them he would but the men would certainly deal with him they knew there was a dog there because timmy had barked the night before oh dear thought jo in despair i must do something but what can i do chapter twenty a lot of excitement contents prevnext jo suddenly made up her mind she would follow the men through those passages and see if she could warn the others by shouting when she came near enough to the towerroom she would help them somehow bufflo and the others would be too late to save them now jo ran to the wall she was up the pegrope left there and down the other side in a trice she made her way to where the missing stone left the gap in the old wall beauty the python was surprised to find himself pulled off and thrown on the ground just before jo ran for the wall he wasnt used to that sort of treatment he lay there coiling and uncoiling himself where had that nice girl gone beauty liked jo she knew how to treat him he glided after her he too went up the wall and over quite easily though he did not need to use the pegrope like jo he glided after jo quickly it was amazing to see his speed when he really wanted to be quick he came to the hole in the wall ah he liked holes he glided in after jo he caught up with her just as she had reached the end of the small passage through which she had had to walk bent double he pushed against her legs and then twined himself round her she gave a small scream and then realized what it was beauty youll get into trouble with mr slither coming after me like this go back stop twining yourself round meive got important things to do but beauty was not like timmy he obeyed only when he thought he would and he was not going to obey this time all right come with me if you want to said jo at last having in vain tried to push the great snake back youll be company i suppose stop hissing like that beauty you sound like an engine letting off steam in this narrow passage soon jo had gone down the steep steps that led to the level passage under the courtyard beauty slithered down them too rather surprised at the sudden drop along the wider passage they went beauty now in front and jo sometimes tripping over his powerful tail up steps again and into the thick wall of the castle itself something shining ahead made jo suddenly stop she listened but heard nothing she went forward cautiously and found that in the little secret room was a small lantern left there probably by one of the men in front she saw the rusty dagger lying on the floor where she had left it the night before and grinned the rope was there too that she had untied from her arms and legs jo went on along the passage that led to the spiral stairway now she thought she could hear something she climbed the steep stairs cross with beauty because he pushed by her and almost sent her headlong down them she came to the door that opened on to the little gallery dare she open it suppose the men were just outside she opened it slowly it was pitch dark on the other side of course but jo knew she was about to step out on the little gallery beauty suddenly slithered up her and coiled himself lovingly round her jo could not make the snake uncoil and she stepped out on the small gallery with beauty firmly wrapped about her and then what a noise she heard she stood quite aghast whatever could be going on she heard excited voices surely one was bufflos and was that crack a pistolshot what had happened down below in the courtyard when jo had disappeared over the wall with beauty none of the men noticed her go they were all too intent on their plan bufflo was to use his gift for knifethrowing but in quite a different way from usual he was to throw the knife high into the air and make it curve in through the slitwindow at the top of the tower bufflo was an expert at knifethrowing or indeed at any kind of throwing he stood there in the courtyard looking up at the high window he halfclosed his eyes getting the distance and the direction fixed hi his mind the moon suddenly went in and he lowered his hand he could not throw accurately in the dark the moon sailed out again quite brilliant bufflo lost no time once more he took aim his eyes narrowed and then the knife flew high into the air gleaming as it went taking behind it a long tail of very thin rope it struck the sill of the slitwindow and fell back bufflo caught it deftly the moonlight showed plainly that the knife was not sharppointedbufflo had filed off the point and it was now quite blunt jo need not have worried about someone in the tower being hurt by a sharp dagger once more bufflo took aim and once more the knife sailed up swift as a swallow shining silver as it went this time it fell cleanly in at the windowopening slithered all the way across the stone ledge inside and fell to the floor of the towerroom with a thud it caused the greatest astonishment there mr terrykane the four children and timmy were all huddled together for warmth in one corner they were hungry and cold no one had brought them food and they had nothing to keep them warm except a rug belonging to terrykane all that day they had been in the towerroom sometimes looking from the window sometimes shouting all together at the tops of their voices but nobody heard them and nobody saw them why doesnt jo bring help they had said a hundred times that long long day they didnt know that poor jo was spending hours trying to free herself from the knots round her legs and wrists they had looked out of the window at the camp on the opposite hill where the fairfolk went about their business looking like ants on the faroff green slope was jo there it was too faroff to make out anyone for certain when darkness came julian had flashed his torch from the window on and off on and off then cold and miserable they had all huddled together with timmy licking first one and then another not at all understanding why they should stay in this one room timmy will be so thirsty said george he keeps licking round his mouth in the way he does when he wants a drink well i feel like licking round my mouth too said dick they were halfasleep when the knife came thudding into the room timmy leapt up at once and barked madly he stood and stared at the knife that lay gleaming in the moonlight and barked without stopping a knife said george in amazement a knife with a string tied on the end its blunt said julian picking it up the tip has been filed off whats the meaning of it and why the string tied to it be careful that another knife doesnt come through warned terrykane it wont said julian i think this is something to do with jo she hasnt gone to the police she has got the fairfolk to help us this is bufflos knife im sure they were all round him examining it now im going to the window said julian ill look right out into the courtyard hold my legs dick he climbed up on the stone sill and crawled a little forward through the deepset slit he came to the outer edge of the window and looked down dick hung on to his legs afraid that the sill might crumble away and julian would fall i can see four people down in the courtyard said julian oh good one is alfredo one is bufflo and i cant make out the other two ahoy down there the four men below were standing looking up intently they saw julians head appear outside the window and waved to him pull in the rope shouted bufflo he had now tied the end of a second pegrope to the thin rope and he and the others lifted it so that it might run easily up the wall julian slid back into the tower room he was excited this string on the knife runs down the wall and is tied to a thicker rope he said ill pull it up and up will come a rope that we can climb down he pulled on the string and more and more of it appeared through the window then julian felt a heavier weight and he guessed the thicker rope was coming up now he had to pull more slowly dick helped him over the windowsill in at the window appeared the first length of the pegrope the children had never seen one like it before they were used to the more ordinary ropeladder but terrykane knew what it was a pegrope he said circus people and fairpeople make themthey are lighter and easier to manage than ropeladders well have to fix the end to something really strong so that it will hold our weight anne looked at the pegrope in dismay she didnt at all like the idea of climbing down that swinging on it all the way down the high stone wall of the tower but the others looked at it with pleasure and excitement a way of escape a good strong rope to climb down out of this hateful cold room terrykane looked about for something to fasten the rope to in the wall at one side was a great iron ring embedded in the stone what it had been used for once upon a time nobody could imaginebut certainly it would be of great use now there were no pegs in the first yard or so of the rope terrykane and julian cut off the string that had pulled it up and then dragged the thick rope through the iron ring they dragged it right through until the first peg stopped it then they twisted the ropeend round upon itself and made great strong knots that could not slip julian took hold of the rope and leaned back hard on it pulling it with all his strength it would hold a dozen of us at once he said pleased shall i go first sir i can help everyone else down then if im at the bottom dick and you can see to the girls when they climb out what about timmy asked george at once well wrap him up in the rug tie him firmly and lower him down on the string said dick its very strong string thin rope really ill go down now said julian and went to the window then he stopped someone was clattering up the stone steps that led to the tower someone was at the door who could it be chapter twentyone in the tower room contents prevnext the door was flung open and a man stood there panting behind him came three others pottersham said terrykane so youre back yes im back said the panting man timmy began to bark and try to escape from georges hand he showed his teeth and all his hackles rose up on his neck he looked a very savage dog indeed pottersham backed away he didnt like the look of timmy at all if you let that dog go ill shoot him he said and as if by magic a gun appeared in his right hand george tried her hardest to restrain the furious timmy and called to julian to help her julian hold him as well hell fling himself on that man hes so angry julian went to help between them they forced the furious dog back into a corner where george tried in vain to pacify him she was terrified that he might be shot you cant behave like this pottersham began terrykane but he was cut short weve no time to lose were taking you terrykane and one of the kids we can use him for a hostage if too much fuss is made about your disappearance well take this boy and he grabbed at dick dick gave him a punch on the jaw immediately thanking his stars that he had learnt boxing at school but he at once found himself on the floor these men were not standing for any nonsense they were in a hurry get him said pottersham to one of the men behind him and dick was pounced on then terrykane was taken too and his arms held behind him what about these other kids he said angrily youre surely not going to lock them up in this room and leave them yes we are said pottersham were leaving a note for the old turnstile woman to tell her theyre up here let the police rescue them if they can you always were a began terrykane and then ducked to avoid a blow timmy barked madly all the time and almost choked himself trying to get away from george and julian he was mad with rage and when he saw dick being roughly treated he very nearly did manage to get loose take them ordered pottersham and hurry go on down the steps with them the three men forced terrykane and dick to the stone stairs and then everyone shot round in astonishment a loud voice suddenly came from the window anne gasped bufflo was there he hadnt been able to understand why nobody came down the pegrope so he had come up to find out and to his enormous surprise there appeared to be quite an upset going on hey there whats up he yelled and slid into the room looking most out of place with his mop of yellow hair gay checked shirt and whip bufflo shouted all four of the children and timmy changed his angry bark to a welcoming one terrykane looked on in astonishment his arms still pinioned behind him who in the world is this shouted pottersham alarmed at bufflos sudden appearance through the window how did he get through there bufflo eyed the gun in pottershams hand and lazily cracked his small whip once or twice put that thing away he said in his drawling voice you ought to know better than to wave a thing like that about when theres kids around go on put it away he cracked his whip again pottersham pointed the gun at him angrily and then a most amazing thing happened the gun disappeared from pottershams hand flew right up into the air and was neatly caught by bufflo and all by the crack of a whip crack just that and the gun had been flicked from his hand by the powerful lashend and had stung pottershams fingers so much he was now howling in pain and bending double to nurse his injured hand terrykane gasped what a neat trick but how dangerous the gun might have gone off now the tables were indeed turned for it was bufflo who held the gun not pottersham and pottersham looked very pale indeed he stared as if he hardly knew what to do let go of them ordered bufflo nodding his head towards terrykane and dick the three men released them and stood back seems as if we got to get the police after all remarked bufflo in a perfectly ordinary voice as if these happenings were not at all unusual you can let that dog go now if you want julian no no cried pottersham in terror and at that moment the moon went behind a cloud and the towerroom was plunged in darkness except for the lantern that pottersham had set down on the floor when he had first arrived he saw one slight chance for himself and the others he suddenly kicked at the lantern which flew into the air and hit bufflo then went out and left the entire place in pitch darkness bufflo did not dare to fire he might hit the wrong person set the dog loose he roared but it was too late by the time timmy had got to the door it was slammed shut and a bolt was shot home the other side there was the sound of hurried steps slipping and stumbling down the stone stairway in the dark hrrr said bufflo when the moon came out again and showed him the astonished and dismayed faces of the five in the room we slipped up somewhere didnt we theyve gone yes but without us said terrykane letting dick untie his arms theyve probably gone down through those passages theyll be out before weve escaped ourselves mores the pity and now weve got to try this ropetrick down the tower wall seeing that the door is locked come on then said julian lets go before anything else happens he went to the window slid to the outer edge and took hold of the rope it was perfectly easy to climb down though it wasnt very pleasant to look below him into the courtyard it seemed so very far away ann went next very much afraid but not showing it she was quite a good climber so she didnt find the rope difficult she was very very glad when she at last stood safely beside julian then came george with a bit of news i cant think whats happening to the four men she said they still seem to be about and theyre yelling like anything it sounds as if they are rushing round that gallery that runs along the walls of the towerroom below well let them said julian if they stay there long enough well have time to go to the hole in the outer wall and wait for them to come out one by one that would be very very nice timmys coming now said george ive wrapped him up well in that rug and tied it all round him and put a kind of ropeharness on him dicks going to lower him down we doubled the rope to make sure it would hold look here he comes poor darling timmy he cant think what in the world is happening timmy came down slowly swinging a little and bumping into the stone wall now and again he gave a little yelp each time and george was sure he would be covered with bruises she watched in great suspense as he came lower and lower timmy ought to be used to this sort of thing by now said julian hes had plenty of it in the adventures hes shared with us hey there tim slowly does it good dog then i guess youre glad to be standing on firm ground again timmy certainly was he allowed himself to be untied from his rug by george and then tried a few steps to see if the ground was really firm beneath his feet he leapt up at george joyfully very glad to be out in the open air again here comes dick said julian the pegrope swayed a little and alfredo went to hold it steady he and the rubberman and mr slither were now extremely concerned about something so concerned that they had hardly a word to say to julian and george and anne they had suddenly missed jo and the snake the snakeman didnt care tuppence about jo but he did care about his precious beloved magnificent python he had already hunted all round the courtyard for it if jos taken it back to camp with her ill pull her hair off muttered the snakeman unhappily and julian looked at him in astonishment what was he muttering about terrykane came next and last of all bufflo who seemed to slide down in a most remarkable way not using the pegs at all he leapt down beside them grinning theres a tremendous upset up aloft he said yelling and shouting and scampering about what do you suppose is the matter with those fellows well be able to get them nicely if we go to the hole in the wall theyll be out there soon i reckon come on chapter twentytwo beauty and jo enjoy themselves contents prevnext something certainly had happened to upset pottersham and his three friends after the door of the towerroom had been slammed and bolted the men had gone clattering down the stone steps they had come to the door that led into the gallery and had opened it and gone out on to the gallery itself but before they could find the spiral staircase a little way along pottersham had tripped over something something that hissed like an engine letting off steam and had wound itself round his legs he yelled and struck out at whatever it was at first he had thought it was a man lying in wait for him who had pounced at his legs but he knew it wasnt a man now no man could hiss like that one of the men shone a torch down to see what was the matter with pottersham what he saw made him yell and almost drop the torch a snake a snake bigger than any ive ever seen its got you pottersham help me man help me shouted pottersham hitting down at the snake as hard as he could its squeezing my legs together in its coils the other men ran to help him as soon as they began to tug beauty uncoiled and glided off into the shadows wheres the horrible thing gone panted pottersham it nearly crushed my legs to powder quick lets go before it comes back where in the world did it come from they took a few steps but the snake was lying in wait for them it tripped them all up by gliding in and out of their legs and then began to coil itself round one of the mens waists such a shouting and yelling and howling began then if ever there were frightened men those four were no matter where they went that snake seemed to be there coiling and uncoiling gliding writhing squeezing it was jo who had set the python on to them of course jo had stayed in the gallery while all the disturbance upstairs had been going on beauty draped round her neck the girl tried in vain to make out what was happening and then she had heard a door slam a bolt shot home and mens feet pouring down the stone stairs she guessed it must be the four whose voices she had heard earlier in the evening the men who had gone through the passages beauty now its your turn to do something said jo and she pulled the snake off her shoulders he poured himself down her and flowed on to the ground in one beautiful movement he glided towards the men who were now coming out of the gallery after that the python had the time of his life the more the men howled the more excited the big snake became jo was huddled in a corner laughing till the tears ran down her cheeks she knew the snake was quite harmless unless he gave one of the men too tight a squeeze she couldnt see what was going on but she could hear oh dear theres another one down she thought as she heard one of the men tripped up by beauty and there goes another i shall die of laughing good old beauty hes never allowed to behave like this in the usual way he must be enjoying himself at last the men could bear it no more come up to that towerroom yelled pottersham im not going back through those dark passages with snakes after me there must be dozens of them here well be bitten soon jo laughed out loud dozens of them well probably beauty did seem like a dozen snakes to the bewildered men falling over one another in the dark but beauty would not bite he was not poisonous somehow the men got up into the towerroom and left the snake behind beauty was tired of the game now and went to jo when the girl called to him she draped him round her neck and listened the door up in the towerroom had slammed jo slipped up the steps felt for the doorbolt in the darkness and neatly and quietly pulled it across now unless the men liked to risk going down the pegrope which she guessed bufflo had put up against the wall to rescue the others they were nicely trapped and if they did go down the rope they would be sure to find a few people waiting for them at the bottom come on beauty lets go said jo and went down the steps wishing she had a torch she remembered the little lantern that had been left in the hidden room and felt more cheerful she would be able to take that with her down all those dark passages good beauty slithered in front of her he knew the way all right they came to the little room and jo thankfully picked up the lantern she looked down at the big python and he stared up at her with gleaming unwinking eyes his long body coiled and uncoiled shining brown and polished in the light i wouldnt mind you for a pet if you were a bit smaller jo told him i dont know why people dont like snakes oh beauty it makes me laugh to think of the way you treated those men she chuckled as she went along the secret ways holding the lantern high except when she came to the last passage of all and had to walk bent double beauty waited for her when she came to the hole in the wall he had heard noises outside jo climbed out first and was immensely surprised to find herself pounced on and held she wriggled and shouted and struggled and finally bit the hand that was holding her then a torch was shone on her and a shout went up its jo jo where have you been and look here if you bite like that ill scrag you bufflo im sorrybut what did you want to go and pounce on me for cried jo the moon suddenly came out and lighted up the scene she saw julian and the rest there coming up eagerly jo are you all right said her uncle we were worried about you where have you been jo took no notice she ran up to dick and the others you escaped she cried did you all get safely down the pegrope theres no time to tell about that now said bufflo watching the hole in the wall what about those fellows were waiting for them here did you hear anything of them jo oh yes i followed them oh bufflo it was so funny said jo and began to laugh bufflo shook her but she couldnt stop and then who should come gliding out through the hole but beauty mr slither saw him at once and gave a yell beauty jo did you take him with you you wicked girl come here my beauty the snake glided to him and wound himself lovingly round him im not wicked said jo indignantly beauty wanted to come with me and he didand oh he got mixed up with all those men and she went off into peals of laughter again dick grinned in sympathy jo was very funny when she couldnt stop laughing alfredo shook her roughly and made her stop tell us what you know about those men he commanded are they coming out this way where are they oh the men said jo wiping her eyes and trying to stop laughing theyre all right beauty chased them back to the towerroom and i bolted them in theyre still there i expect unless they dare to get down the pegrope which i bet they wont bufflo gave a short laugh you did well jo he said you and beauty he gave a sharp order to alfredo and the rubberman who went back over the wall and into the courtyard to watch if the men slid down the pegrope i think it would be a good idea to get the police now said terrykane beginning to feel that he must be in some kind of extraordinary dream with pegropes and whips and knives and snakes turning up in such a peculiar manner that fellow pottersham is dangerous hes a traitor and must be caught before he gives away all that he knows about the work he and i have been doing right said bufflo weve got another fellow locked up too in an empty caravan but didnt he escape then said jo surprised i thought that man pottersham whos up in the towerroom now was the one we locked up the one we locked up is still locked up said bufflo grimly but who is he then said terrykane bewildered well soon find out said bufflo come on lets get going now its very late you kids must be dying of hunger somebody ought to go to the police and i want to get back to camp alfredo and the rubberman will keep guard on the pegrope said mr slither still fondling beauty there is no need to stay here any longer so down the hill they went talking nineteen to the dozen terrykane went off to the policestation and to telephone what he vaguely called the highup authorities the five children began to think hungrily of something to eat and drink timmy ran to the stream as soon as they reached the field and began to lap thirstily lets just find out if you know the fellow weve got locked up in this caravan said bufflo when they got to the camp he seems the only unexplained bit so far he unlocked the caravan and called loudly come on out we want to know who you are he held up a lamp and the man inside came slowly to the door there was a shout of amazement from all the children uncle quentin cried julian dick and anne father shouted george what are you doing here chapter twentythree having a wonderful time contents prev there was a minute or two of silence everyone was most astonished to think that georges father had been locked up like that it had been jos mistake of course she had been so sure he was mr pottersham julian said uncle quentin very much on his dignity and also very angry i must ask you to go and get the police here i was set on and locked up in this caravan for no reason at all bufflo began to look most disturbed he turned on jo why didnt you tell us he was georges father he said i didnt know it was said jo ive never seen him and anyway i thought it doesnt matter what you thought said uncle quentin looking at the dirty little girl in disgust i insist on the police being fetched uncle quentin im sure its all been a mistake said julian and anyway mr terrykane has gone to the police himself his uncle stared at him as if he couldnt believe his ears terrykane where is he what has happened is he found yes its rather a long story said julian it all began when we saw that face at the window i told aunt fanny all about that uncle and she said she would tell you when you got back from london well it was mr terrykane at the window i thought so i told your aunt fanny i had a feeling it was said his uncle thats why i came as soon as ever i could but you were none of you here what happened to you well thats part of the story uncle said julian patiently but i say do you mind if we have something to eat were practically dead from starvation havent had anything since yesterday that ended the interview for the time being mrs alfredo bustled about and soon there was a perfectly glorious meal set in front of the five halfstarved children they sat round a campfire and ate and ate and ate mrs alfredo practically emptied her big pot for them timmy was surrounded by plates of scraps and big bones brought by every member of the camp almost every minute someone loomed up out of the darkness with a plate of something or other either for the hungry children or for timmy at last they really could eat no more and julian began to tell their extraordinary story dick took it up and george added quite a few bits jo interrupted continually and even timmy put in a few barks only anne said nothing she was leaning against her uncle fast asleep i never heard such a tale in my life said uncle quentin continually never fancy that fellow pottersham going off with terrykane like that i knew terrykane was all righthe wouldnt let his country down now pottersham i never did like well go on the fairfolk were as enthralled as uncle quentin with the tale they came closer and closer as the story of the secret passages the hidden room the stone stairways and the rest was unfolded they got very excited when they learnt how bufflo had appeared in the towerroom and had flicked the gun out of pottershams hand uncle quentin threw back his head and roared when he heard that bit what a shock for that fellow he said id like to have seen his face well well i never heard such a tale in my life and then it was jos turn to tell how she had followed the four men into the secret passages and had set beauty the python on to the men she began to laugh again as she told her tale and soon all the fairfolk were laughing in sympathy rocking to and fro with tears streaming down their faces only uncle quentin looked rather solemn at this point he remembered how he had felt when because of his shouting the fairfolk had sent the python into his caravan and almost frightened him out of his life mr slither please do get beauty begged jo he ought to listen to his part of the story he was wonderful he enjoyed it all too im sure he would have laughed if only snakes could laugh poor uncle quentin didnt like to object when the snakeman fetched his beloved python in fact he fetched both of them and they had never had such a fuss made of them before they were patted and rubbed and pulled about in a way they both seemed to enjoy hugely let me hold beauty mr slither said jo at last and she draped him round her neck like a long shiny fur uncle quentin looked as if he was going to be sick he would certainly have got up and gone away if it hadnt been that his favourite niece anne was fast asleep against his shoulder what extraordinary people george seems to be friends with he thought i suppose they are all right but really what with whips and knives and snakes i must say i find all this very peculiar somebodys coming up the field said jo suddenly its yes its mr terrykane and hes got three policemen with him immediately almost all the fairfolk melted away into the darkness they knew quite well why the police had come not for them but because of mr pottersham and his unpleasant friends but all the same they wanted nothing to do with the three burly policemen walking up the hill with terrykane uncle quentin leapt to his feet as soon as he saw terrykane he ran to meet him joyfully and pumped his arm up and down up and down shaking hands so vigorously that terrykane felt quite exhausted my dear fellow said uncle quentin im so glad youre safe i told everyone you werent a traitor and never could be everyone i went up to london and told them im glad youre all right well its thanks to these children said terrykane who looked very tired i expect youve heard the peculiar and most extraordinary tale of the face at the window yes its all so extraordinary that i shouldnt believe it if i read it in a book said uncle quentin and yet it all happened my dear fellow you must be very tired i am said terrykane but im not going to lie down and sleep until those other fellows are safely under lock and key pottersham and his fine friends do you mind if i leave you for a bit and go off to the castle again we simply must catch those fellows i came to ask if one of the children could go with us because i hear we have to creep through all kinds of passages and galleries and up spiral stairways and goodness knows what but didnt you go that way when pottersham first took you there and hid you in that room asked dick surprised yes i must have gone that way said mr terrykane but i was blindfolded and halfdoped with something they had made me drink ive no idea of the way of course pottersham knew every inch hes written books about all these old castles you knownobody knows more about them and their secrets than he does he certainly put his knowledge to good use this week ill go with you said jo ive been up and down those passages four times now i know them by heart the others have only been once yes you go said bufflo take timmy said george most generously for usually she would never let timmy go with jo or take a snake suggested dick with a grin i wont take anything said jo ill be all right with three big policemen so long as theyre not after me i like them she didnt really but she couldnt help boasting a little she set off with terrykane and the three policemen strutting a little and feeling quite a heroine the others all went to their caravans tired out uncle quentin sat by the campfire waiting for the arrival of pottersham and his three friends good night said julian to the girls id like to wait till the crowd come back complete with the rubberman and alfredo but i shall fall asleep standing on my feet in a minute i say wasnt that a smashing supper super said the others well see you tomorrow they all slept very late the next day jo was back long before they awoke very anxious to tell them how they had captured pottersham and the others and how they had been marched off to the policestation with her following all the way but mrs alfredo would not let her wake the four children up however they did awake at last and got up eagerly remembering all the exciting moments of the day before soon they were jumping down the steps of the two caravans eager to hear the latest news hallo father shouted george seeing him not far off hallo uncle quentin hallo jo called the others and soon heard the latest bits of information from jo who was very proud of being in at the finish but they didnt put up any fight at all she said rather disappointed i think beauty scared all the fight out of them last night they just gave in without a word now you children called mrs alfredo i have kept a little breakfast for you you like to come they did like to come jo went too though she had already had one breakfast uncle quentin went to sit down with them he gazed around amazed at all the goingson of the camp bufflo was doing some remarkable ropespinning and whipcracking the rubberman was wriggling in and out of the wheelspokes of his caravan without stopping mr slither was polishing his snakes dacca was stepdancing on a board clickclickclickityclick alfredo came up with his buttonhooklike torches and his metal bowl i give you a treat he announced to uncle quentin you would like to see me fireeat uncle quentin stared at him as if he thought he had gone raving mad hes a fireeater uncle explained dick oh no thank you my good man i would rather not see you eat fire said uncle quentin politely but very firmly alfredo was most disappointed he had meant to give this man a real treat to make up for locking him into the caravan he went away sadly and mrs alfredo screamed after him you foolish man who wants to see you fireeat you have no brains you are a big silly bad man you keep away with your fireeating she disappeared into her caravan and uncle quentin looked after her astonished at her sudden outburst this is really a very extraordinary place he said and most extraordinary people im going back home today george wouldnt you all like to come with me i dont really feel its the right thing for you to get mixed up in so many queer doings oh no father said george in horror go home when weve only just settled in of course not none of us want to leave do we julian she said looking round beseechingly at him julian answered at once george is right uncle were just beginning to enjoy ourselves here i think were all agreed on that we are said
