 chapter one the big four high above the water in a modern beach house in mississippi four gentlemen enjoyed drinks and waited for a visitor normally their work required them to be enemies this afternoon however theyd played golf and eaten grilled seafood together each of the men was ceo of a large public corporation these corporations were extremely successful the smallest had sales of six hundred million dollars the largest four billion dollars although they manufactured other things their real profits came from cigarettes the companies represented here were responsible for percent of all cigarettes sold in the united states and canada the tobacco business was becoming more and more unpopular the big four as the four corporations were known in financial circles were attacked by the public the medical profession and even some politicians and now the lawyers were pursuing them the survivors of dead smokers were suing them claiming that cigarettes caused lung cancer there had been sixteen trials until now the tobacco companies had managed to win every case but the pressure was increasing if they lost a single one theyd face possible claims from millions of people to help fight these court cases the big four had put together a sum of money called the fund the fund was a secret officially it didnt exist the money in it was used to hire the best defense lawyers for the trials it paid for wellspoken experts to help persuade people that cigarette smoking didnt necessarily kill you and the cleverest jury consultants before a trial the jury consultants job was to find out all they could about possible jurors so they could predict whether they might be sympathetic to the tobacco companies case or not the fund was managed by a man called rankin fitch the four ceos disliked him but they listened to what he said and when necessary obeyed the instructions he gave hed directed eight trials without a loss now they were waiting for him to arrive to tell them about the latest trial wood vs pynex pynex was the third largest of the big four its ceo was d martin jankle fitch is here the four men each reached for their drinks as fitch walked into the room he was a big man in a dark suit he looked important an assistant handed him a glass of water and he waved away a plate of seafood a brief summary gentlemen at the moment the entire defense team is working nonstop and this will continue through the weekend investigations into possible jurors are on schedule trial lawyers are ready witnesses are prepared all our experts are already in town what about the jurors asked jankle it was his corporations lawsuit and so he was the most nervous one problem juror can be poison im aware of that fitch replied coldly i assume the plaintiffs lawyers are ready asked another ceo safe assumption said fitch this latest challenge to the tobacco companies had been organized carefully there were eight lawyers at the last count financed by eight of the largest law firms in the country whod each contributed a million dollars the lawyers had picked the plaintiff the widow of a man named jacob l wood theyd picked the place on the mississippi coast because juries in biloxi could be generous in this kind of case they were even lucky with the judge the honorable frederick harkin hed previously been a plaintiffs lawyer the opposition were certainly ready this wasnt an ordinary tobacco case and everyone in the room knew it how long will the trial last jankle finally asked four to six weeks jury selection goes fast here replied fitch how long should we stay in town i dont care you can leave now or you can wait until the jury is picked you all have big jets if i need you i can find you he was suddenly ready to leave anything else not a word wendall rohr the main lawyer for the plaintiff had made and lost his first fortune before he was fifty he made his second fortune and swore never to lose it his energies were directed at suing american corporations on behalf of injured people hed met celeste wood widow of jacob wood through a young lawyer jacob wood had died at the age of fiftyone after smoking three packs of cigarettes a day for almost thirty years rohr had raised the first million dollars to fight the case and then more money had flowed in his plan was simple and smart if he won this case more people would decide to sue with a hundred million smokers out there hed be busy for the rest of his working life rohr operated from offices near the courthouse and his team was working hard investigating possible jurors the tobacco lawyers were down the street working just as hard nothing rivaled the thrill of big lawsuits by am on monday a crowd was gathering outside the biloxi courthouse there were wall street financial analysts who were specialists in the price of tobacco shares sent to follow the early developments of the trial there was a group of people growing larger by the minute each holding a piece of paper a jury summons seven deputies had been assigned to security duties at eightthirty the doors to the courtroom on the second floor opened a court official gloria lane checked each summons greeted the people she knew and organized them into their seats there were possible jurors all were given forms to complete the lawyers arrived in dark suits and tried to look at the jurors without being noticed behind the lawyers sat the jury consultants watching the possible jurors for any gestures arms folded across the chest or fingers picking nervously at teeth which might reveal their real thoughts and opinions juror number fiftysix nicholas easter received more than his share of anxious looks he worried the jury consultants as they hadnt been able to find out very much about him the last lawyer into the room was wendall rohr he stared at the possible jurors these were his people this was his case in his home town he nodded at a couple grinned at another together theyd find the truth rankin fitch was also in court pretending to read a newspaper then judge harkin arrived he completed a short welcoming speech the lawsuit had begun four years ago and the documents now filled eleven boxes each side had already spent millions to reach this point the jury selection started six people over the age of sixtyfive who hadnt been identified by the computer were free to leave five of them left is anybody legally blind the judge asked slowly a hand was raised from the center of the pack juror number sixtythree mr herman grimes age fiftynine computer programmer white married no kids what was this did nobody know this man was blind the jury consultants whispered on both sides mr grimes you are excused from jury duty youre free to go herman grimes didnt move he just looked at whatever he could see and said why do i have to leave because youre blind i know that who says blind people cant serve on juries you tell me why if its written in the law the law is unfair and ill sue if it isnt written in the law ill sue even faster the law said that a blind person may be excused from jury service so the judge decided not to insist on second thoughts mr grimes i think youd be an excellent juror please sit down herman nodded politely thank you sir the judge continued to release possible jurors with physical problems at noon thirteen had been dismissed by p m the number remaining was down to then the group were asked about any nonmedical problems eleven more were dismissed and another form was given out with instructions to the jurors that they should complete it by nine the next morning the form included questions like do you smoke cigarettes do you want to stop has any member of your family or anyone you know well suffered any disease or illness directly linked to smoking cigarettes other questions explored their opinions on tax and smokers rights then do you know any of the lawyers working on the case do you know any of the possible witnesses nicholas easter made another cup of coffee hed spent an hour with the questions last night and another hour this morning he knew that handwriting experts would study everything he wrote he wanted to appear neat thoughtful and intelligent a juror that both sides would love many of the questions had been used in the cimmino tobacco case last year in allentown pennsylvania nicholas had been a possible juror in that case too but then hed been known as david lancaster a parttime film student with a beard and glasses he hadnt been selected for the jury a month later hed shaved his beard thrown away his glasses and left town nicholas knew that there were people on both sides trying to find out about his past his present apartment was only a temporary home it was basic but although he had a better address four blocks away he couldnt risk being seen there in court on the second day the forms were collected from the possible jurors and six more were excused for personal reasons then the show began wendall rohr introduced the plaintiff celeste woods to the court a small woman of fiftyfive she tried to look as if she was still saddened over the death of her husband although hed been dead for four years in fact shed almost remarried an event which rohr had persuaded her to cancel when he heard about it she could marry after the trial he told her rohr started questioning the possible jurors about their previous jury service and their opinions on the rights of victims and the price of insurance the jury had a lunch break gloria lane and her staff handed out box lunches to the lawyers containing thin sandwiches and red apples this was going to be a working lunch for them outside the courtroom forms were being analyzed by the jury consultants and the results were being fed into computers after three hours discussion with the lawyers the judge removed another thirtyone names the group was down to the following morning it was the turn of the main lawyer for pynex durwood cable senior partner for whitney cable white his opponent wendall rohr was friendly and sociable cable on the other hand seemed quieter he talked slowly but his gray eyes missed nothing my name is durwood cable and i represent pynex a company that has been making cigarettes for ninety years there he wasnt ashamed of it he did an expert job of persuading his audience that his client was almost likeable cable then talked about the freedom to choose whether to smoke cigarettes or not he asked a lot of questions got a few responses and finished at noon in time for a quick lunch before three oclock the lawyers on both sides had to agree on the final jury selection according to the rules each side could ask for a number of strikes which meant that a possible juror could be dismissed for no reason because of the importance of this case judge harkin had granted each side the right to do this ten times instead of the usual four the process started out of the first thirty names ten were selected finally the jury was complete and nicholas easter had become the eleventh juror for wood vs pynex when the courtroom was opened at three judge harkin called out the names of the chosen twelve nicholas twentyseven was the second youngest juror there were nine whites three blacks seven women five men one blind in the corner of the jury box there were three extra jurors these would replace any member of the jury who had to leave the jury for some reason the judge forbade the jurors from discussing the case with anyone and with a pleasant smile dismissed them for the night chapter two the case opens at eightthirty in the morning nicholas slipped through the unlocked back door of the courthouse and went up to the second floor he knew the building well three weeks earlier unnoticed when there was no one around hed explored the area around the courtroom including the judges chambers the witness rooms and of course the jury room he went there now and found lou dell sitting outside the room reading a romantic novel good morning can i help you her entire face was one large smile nicholas easter he said as he reached for her outstretched hand she found his name on her paperwork welcome to the jury room is this your first trial yes come on she said pulling him into the room coffee and cakes are over here i made these cookies myself nicholas poured black coffee into a plastic cup there was a list of instructions for the jurors from judge harkin including the order that they couldnt discuss the case with anyone they couldnt even discuss the case with each other until instructed by the judge nicholas signed the list at the bottom as requested the door opened with a kick and mr herman grimes entered with his walking stick tapping along in front of him his wife was close behind describing the room to him under her breath nicholas introduced himself my favorite uncles blind nicholas said id consider it an honor if youd allow me to assist you during the trial thank you said herman after a brief pause thank you sir his wife said at ten oclock judge harkin looked around the crowded courtroom and decided that everyone was in place bring in the jury he said the jurors walked in good morning said the judge do we have a foreman its me your honor herman grimes said the lawyers and jury consultants for the defense were worried by this choice of foreman but their expressions remained warm and positive nicholas easter looked cautiously around the courtroom on the second row behind the defense rankin fitch sat trying to look uninterested in the jury but nicholas knew better fitch missed nothing fourteen months earlier nicholas had seen him in the cimmino courtroom in allentown pennsylvania nicholas knew that fitch would have investigated his background and found that some of what hed said wasnt true there were also small groups of people whom nicholas was certain were the jury consultants the selecting was done so now they moved to the next phase watching they listened to every word spoken by every witness and predicted how the jury would react if a witness seemed to make a bad impression on the jury they could be removed sent home and replaced by another witness after a sign from the judge wendall rohr started his opening statement he told the jury that hed prove that mr jacob wood a fine fellow developed lung cancer after smoking cigarettes for almost thirty years the cigarettes killed him how could they prove that cigarettes caused lung cancer theyd bring along cancer experts and talk to people who used to work in the tobacco industry rohr finished in fifty minutes smiled and sat down durwood cable for the defense spoke for under thirty minutes he calmly assured the jurors that pynex had its own experts who would clearly explain that cigarettes dont cause lung cancer cable spoke without notes looking carefully into the eyes of each juror his voice and stare were honest you wanted to believe this man the first crisis occurred at lunch judge harkin announced the noon break at and the jurors left the court lou dell took them to the jury room just have a seat she said and lunch will be here in a moment herman grimes took a seat at the head of the table next to millie dupree a kind woman of fifty who actually knew another blind person nicholas introduced himself to lonnie shaver the only black man on the jury and the manager of a grocery store twenty minutes passed and no lunch appeared at twelvethirty nicholas said hey herman wheres our lunch im just the foreman herman answered with a smile as the room was suddenly quiet nicholas walked to the door and asked lou dell to come in we re hungry he said lou dell looked at the other eleven faces and said its on the way wheres it coming from he demanded oreillys restaurant just around the corner listen said nicholas we cant go out and eat a nice lunch like normal people so if lunch is going to be here i hope there isnt going to be a problem every day i suggest you get on the phone and find out where it is or ill discuss it with judge harkin the door closed that was a bit hard dont you think asked millie dupree maybe and if it was ill apologize said nicholas but if we dont get things organized at the beginning theyll forget about us do you realize that in almost every trial they allow the jurors to go out and eat how do you know asked millie dupree i know a little about the system i had two years of law school the other jurors were impressed no food had arrived by it should be here soon said lou dell nervously im really sorry wheres the mens room asked nicholas lou dell gave him directions but nicholas walked past the door and out of the courthouse to mary mahoneys a local restaurant nicholas had done the same walk a week ago and had even eaten at a table close to judge harkins he went up to the judges table sorry to interrupt sir nicholas said what are you doing here harkin asked im here on behalf of your jury while youre having a nice lunch here were sitting in a tiny room waiting for food were hungry and were upset harkin stood up well lets go and see when they got back to the jury room the table was bare no food the time was lou dell suddenly arrived she was breathless ive just talked to oreillys she said someone called them to say we wouldnt need lunch until onethirty these people are starving said the judge he turned to the jury im very sorry this wont happen again he paused looked at his watch and smiled im inviting you to follow me to mary mahoneys and join me for lunch the restaurant served the jurors with delicious grilled seafood nicholas was the hero of the day later mr oreilly met with judge harkin he swore on a bible that hed talked to a woman who said she was ringing from the courthouse shed instructed him to deliver lunch at exactly onethirty the trials first witness was the dead man jacob wood testifying on a video which had been filmed a few months before his death he was thin and pale and sounded sick he was fiftyone and looked twenty years older when the jury felt sleepy the judge gave them a break the four smokers needed a cigarette and lou dell took them to a separate room if you cant stop smoking after this trial somethings wrong she said jokingly the four didnt smile jerry fernandez thirtyeight a car salesman with casino debts and a bad marriage lit his cigarette first then he passed his lighter to the three women heres to jacob wood jerry said the three women said nothing they were busy smoking one of them was a tall woman with a long pointed nose called sylvia taylortatum i wonder whos next jerry continued i guess all those doctors sylvia replied sucking hard on her cigarette the womans name was marlee at least that was the name shed chosen for this period of her life she was thirty with short brown hair and brown eyes shed been in the courtroom before and she knew her way around she sat in the back row and just before the judge arrived she asked one of the deputies to deliver a letter to rankin fitch fitch was surprised to see his name on the envelope no one knew his name except his employees and clients he read the note dear mr fitch tomorrow juror number two easter will wear a gray and red sweater white socks and brown leather shoes fitch went up to the deputy who was standing by the courtroom door who gave you this a woman i dont know her name fitch questioned the deputy about her appearance and voice with jose his driver he looked around the first floor of the courthouse then as if they were just enjoying some fresh air the two men walked around the outside of the courthouse who was she and what was going on fitch had thought about entering easters apartment before but now he knew it was necessary he sent jose and another man doyle to the apartment building while easter was in court inside doyle photographed the apartment he was there for no more than ten minutes nicholas left the courthouse on foot and stopped at oreillys for some food he was certain he was being followed when he got to his apartment he entered a fournumber code on the door before he unlocked it he went to his computer and found that an illegal entry had occurred at pm the secret camera hidden above the refrigerator had filmed doyle nicholas watched the video and stared at doyles face hed never seen him before nicholas smiled as he saw doyle looking at his computer it was impossible to enter doyle couldnt even find the power switch at eight the next morning fitch was hiding in a van by easters apartment and watched him walk out into the sunshine fitch looked out of the van window i dont believe it gray and red sweater white socks brown shoes fitch went straight to his office we have to find the girl he said she has something for us his office was in the back of an empty store no one noticed the place and it was just a short walk from the courthouse two men with guns guarded the door at all times the furniture was cheap but the office was full of the latest technology the walls of one room were covered with photos of the jurors the room at the back was the smallest and was kept locked it was a viewing room one of fitchs people had hidden a tiny camera in a document case which was placed in the courtroom under the defense table and which secretly filmed all the jurors in the viewing room two jury consultants watched the results on a large screen when fitch talked to cable he could tell him how the jurors seemed to be feeling cable however didnt know about the hidden camera the deal was organized over a threehour lunch luther vandemeer ceo of trellco one of the big four tobacco companies and his friend larry zell of listing foods had already talked about it on the phone trellco wasnt in court this time but the big four had to stand together zell understood hed worked for trellco for seventeen years there was a small regional grocery company hadley brothers which owned stores along the mississippi coast one store was in biloxi and its manager was a smart young black man called lonnie shaver who by chance was on the jury in the pynex trial vandemeer wanted one of listing foods divisions superhouse a much larger group of grocery stores to purchase hadley brothers it would be a small deal and nothing could go wrong listing and trellco were totally independent of each other and listing was already in the grocery store business later of course there would need to be a reorganization of the company and pressure could be put on lonnie shaver to support the defense they needed to act quickly the trial was only due to last for four more weeks chapter three lonnie shavers opportunity easter made sure he was easy to follow over the weekend on saturday he worked all day selling computers then he returned to his apartment and didnt leave it on sunday he drove to the harbor where he met jerry fernandez they left in a fishing boat with two others and returned eight and a half hours later with red faces a can full of fish and a boat full of empty beer cans fishing was the first hobby of nicholas easter that anyone had been able to discover and jerry was the first friend there was no sign of the girl she waited only until monday morning thirty minutes before the trial restarted fitch was in his office an assistant konrad said theres a phone call you might like to take her name she wont say any idea how she got the number no are you tracing it yes give us a minute keep her on the line fitch lifted the telephone receiver yes he said as nicely as possible is this mr fitch she asked quite pleasantly it is and who is this marlee in about twenty minutes juror number twelve fernandez will walk into the courtroom holding a copy of sports illustrated the october issue i see said fitch anything else no not now konrad raced in the call came from a pay phone in gulfpoint a convenience store what a surprise said fitch as he grabbed his jacket and began straightening his tie i guess ill run to court in the jury room nicholas waited until the general conversation died down he said loudly well did anyone get bribed or followed over the weekend there were a few laughs but no confessions why does the judge keep asking questions like that asked millie dupree in similar cases there have been some problems with the jurors nicholas explained i dont think we should discuss this herman said why not its harmless this isnt about evidence this is about he hesitated a second for effect then continued this is about trying to control the jury nicholas had the jurors attention there was a tobacco trial very similar to this in quitman county mississippi about seven years ago there was some pretty shocking behavior before and during the trial judge harkin is watching us carefully lots of people are watching us who asked millie both sides answered nicholas both sides hire these jury consultants and they come here to help pick the perfect jury the perfect jury is one that will deliver the verdict that they want they study us before were selected how do they do that one of the jurors asked well they photograph us our apartments our offices and our kids its just legal but its close to being illegal they might check our tax records and talk to our neighbors all eleven jurors were listening trying to remember if theyd seen any strangers hiding around street corners with cameras nicholas drank some coffee and continued after the jurys been picked its a little different now theyre only watching fifteen people the twelve jurors and the three extra jurors throughout the trial each side will have jury consultants in the courtroom trying to read our reactions they usually sit on the first two rows theyre well dressed and they stare at us all the time i thought those folks were newspaper reporters said another juror retired colonel frank herrera i hadnt noticed said herman grimes everyone smiled watch them today nicholas said in fact i have a great idea theres one woman who im almost positive is a jury consultant for the defense every morning since the trial began shes been on the front row behind durwood cable when we go out this morning lets stare at her all twelve of us even me herman asked yes herm even you just turn to ten oclock and stare with the rest of us why are we playing games asked sylvia taylortatum why not what else have we got to do for the next eight hours lets do it while judge harkin is reminding us about all the rules that always takes ten minutes lou dell came for them at nine nicholas held two magazines one of which was sports illustrated he walked beside jerry fernandez until they came to the courtroom then said to his new friend want something to read jerry took the magazine sure thanks he said they walked through the door into the courtroom fitch knew fernandez juror number twelve would have the magazine but the sight of it was still a shock his surprise quickly turned to excitement marlee was clearly working on the outside maybe there were two or three or four members of the jury who were plotting with her it didnt matter how many jurors were involved fitch just wanted to make a deal the jury consultants name was ginger shed sat through dozens of trials she looked at the jury and waited for the judge to greet them which he did most of the jurors nodded and smiled at the judge then all of them including the blind man turned and stared directly at her she looked away judge harkin continued asking the jurors one question after another and he too quickly noticed that the jury were looking at the same person they kept staring all together nicholas found it difficult not to laugh his luck was unbelievable two rows behind ginger sat rankin fitch it was difficult to tell exactly who the jurors were staring at ginger or fitch ginger certainly thought it was her she found some notes to read fitch felt helpless as the twelve faces studied him judge harkin finished his questions quickly thank you ladies and gentlemen now we will continue with dr milton fricke after dr fricke had spoken there was a short break as a new witness dr robert bronsky was called by wendall rohr fitch was in his office when the call came its marlee line four konrad whispered trace the call fitch ordered hello mr fitch came the familiar voice yes do you know why they were staring at you no ill tell you tomorrow and if you keep tracing the calls ill stop calling konrad arrived with the expected news that the call had been made from a payphone on tuesday morning nicholas arrived at the jury room early there were new cups and saucers nicholas claimed to hate coffee from a plastic cup and two of the other jurors said they felt the same the judge had agreed to his request retired colonel frank herrera arrived just after eight morning colonel nicholas said warmly youre early so are you i know i couldnt sleep i was dreaming of black lungs herrera sat down across the table i smoked for ten years in the army he said but i had the good sense to stop some people cant i guess like jacob wood the colonel made a sound of disgust why did you stop because cigarettes are poison everybody knows that if herrera had given those opinions on the pretrial forms he wouldnt have been selected but he probably wanted to be on the jury he was retired bored with golf and tired of his wife so should cigarettes be illegal nicholas asked no i think people shouldnt be stupid and smoke three packs a day for almost thirty years what do they expect there was no doubt that his mind was made up you should have said this during jury selection we were asked questions just like these said nicholas herreras cheeks went red but he hesitated for a second this guy easter knew the law yes well i can be persuaded you know herrera said after a day in court looking at diagrams of lungs and listening to medical explanations from dr bronsky lonnie drove to his supermarket we have guests from head office for you an assistant manager said with a frown in his office lonnie found three men lonnie good to see you said troy hadley son of one of the owners he quickly introduced the others listen lonnie ken and ben here are from a company called superhouse and well for lots of reasons my dad and my uncle have decided to sell all seventeen stores to them lonnie was finding it hard to swallow why two main reasons number one my dad is sixtyeight and al my uncle has just had surgery as you know also superhouse is offering a good price its time to sell will this store be closed lonnie asked almost in defeat ken picked up a piece of paper well there are always changes when this sort of thing happens but we see a future for you with us lonnie were ashamed to admit that we dont have an africanamerican in a management position we want this to change wed like you to come to charlotte as soon as possible and spend a few days with us when can you come in a minute lonnie had gone from nearunemployment to promotion in a new company he said with obvious disappointment im on jury service but what about the weekends can you do this weekend sure said lonnie the first person nicholas saw the following morning in court was the man whod broken into his apartment nicholas had already decided what to do he wrote a note and asked for it to be handed to the judge judge that man out there left side third row from the front white shirt blue and green tie was following me yesterday its the second time ive seen him can we find out who he is nicholas easter the judge called a tenminute break and asked for nicholas now where did you see this man nicholas didnt mention the video but told the judge that hed seen the man a couple of times recently the judge relaxed slightly mr easter have any of the other jurors mentioned anything like this no sir will you tell me if they do if theres something wrong i need to know you can send a note through lou dell well there is something perhaps you ought to know he hesitated colonel herrera thinks that anyone who smokes three packs of cigarettes a day for almost thirty years deserves what he gets the judge digested this information mr easter im not asking you to spy on the other jurors but i am worried about this jury because of the pressure from the outside if you see or hear anything please tell me sure judge chapter four more telephone calls the defenses questioning of bronsky ended late thursday afternoon and marlee struck on friday morning konrad took the first call at good morning fitch she said sweetly when she was put through good morning marlee fitch answered with a happy voice his best effort at pleasantness and how are you fabulous juror number two easter will wear a light blue shirt faded jeans and running shoes and hell bring with him a copy of rolling stone october issue got that yes when can we get together and talk when im ready pang one of fitchs technicians was sitting in a coffee shop near easters apartment on time easter left his apartment and started his walk to the courthouse of course he was wearing exactly what shed promised marlees second call came from a different number something new for you fitch youll love it guess what the jurors are going to do today tell me theyre going to do the pledge of allegiance marlees third call went to the offices of wendall rohr she was going to send a fax which must be handed to mr rohr before he left for court the fax stated which clothes nicholas easter would wear that day and hinted at the pledge rohr called an emergency meeting before the court started nicholas waited for a pause in the conversation hey herman i have an idea by now herman knew the other eleven voices from memory yes nicholas he said nicholas raised his voice so everyone could hear him well when i was a kid we started each day at school with the pledge of allegiance every time i see a flag early in the morning i have this desire to give the pledge and in the courtroom we have this beautiful flag behind the judge you want to do the pledge of allegiance out there in open court asked colonel herrera cant see anything wrong with that said jerry fernandez whod earlier agreed to support nicholas youre not playing games are you asked the colonel nicholas looked at him with aching eyes and said my father was killed in vietnam that flag means a lot to me the plan was agreed the jurors entered the courtroom just before judge harkin started his standard speech reminding them that they mustnt have unauthorized contact with anyone he realized that the jurors were still standing with their hands on their hearts and led by nicholas they said the pledge of allegiance judge harkins initial reaction was of disbelief he glanced at rohr and cable who were open mouthed then he stood halfway through the pledge he joined in suddenly it seemed important that everyone joined in the lawyers certainly couldnt show any disloyalty from the back row fitch watched in amazement a jury taking control of a courtroom it was extraordinary that marlee knew it was going to happen it was exciting that she was playing games with him but fitch at least had some idea of what was happening wendall rohr on the other hand felt completely defeated he was shocked by the sight of easter dressed exactly as the fax had said and then starting the pledge he stared at the jury especially easter and wondered what was going on the pledge finished and the jurors sat down judge harkin seemed determined to act as if this was normal behavior i believe were ready for a new witness he said rohr stood still shocked and said the plaintiff calls dr hilo kilvan the next expert witness entered the courtroom lonnie was collected early saturday morning by a company jet and was flown to charlotte ken met him at the airport in a company van and fifteen minutes later they arrived at the superhouse headquarters ken and ben showed him around they had coffee with george teaker the ceo in his large office and then lonnie was shown a video about the company according to the video superhouse was going to grow by percent a year for the next six years profits would be amazing when the video finished a young man arrived with details about health care share options and vacations after lunch in a smart restaurant there were more meetings and another video by now lonnie needed some fresh air and ken suggested that they could go and play golf lonnie had never played golf before a fact that ken knew but he suggested that they go and get some sunshine anyway they drove through neat farms and treelined roads until they reached the country club lonnie was nervous about entering a smart country club and decided to leave if he saw no other black faces but george teaker was in the club lounge with two black gentlemen they all greeted lonnie warmly and he felt much better they drank and talked and planned the future lonnie stayed the night in the country club and woke the next morning with a slight headache that morning there were two brief meetings the first was with george teaker who wanted lonnie to run the biloxi store for ninety days under a new contract if all went well hed be transferred to a larger store they were then joined by a lawyer taunton who handed lonnie a proposed contract of employment look over it taunton said tapping his chin with a designer pen and well talk next week he took out a notepad just a few questions he said the questions were routine then he asked have you in your capacity as store manager been involved in litigation yes i have replied lonnie about four years ago an old man slipped and fell on a wet floor he sued did it go to trial asked taunton he knew every detail no replied lonnie the claim was settled out of court taunton glanced at teaker and said this tobacco trial in biloxi could be serious for companies like ours if the plaintiff wins the case and theres a big verdict there will be a lot more tobacco litigation the lawyers will go crazy theyll bankrupt the tobacco companies we make a lot of money from tobacco sales lonnie teaker said with perfect timing there has to be an end to these trials the tobacco industry has never lost one of them i think their record is something like fiftyfive wins he took a deep breath sorry if i said too much but this trial is so important lonnie thought about this taunton was a lawyer so he wouldnt talk about the trial in a way that wasnt appropriate no problem he said taunton was suddenly all smiles and promised to call lonnie the meeting was over on monday morning the jurors met over coffee and talked about their weekends herman was late so he couldnt stop them whispering about the trial i think i was followed at the weekend said nicholas why would they follow you someone asked thats what the tobacco companies do they spend millions of dollars selecting us and more watching us how do you know its the tobacco company asked sylvia lighting another cigarette i dont but they have more money than the plaintiff in fact they have unlimited funds to fight these cases for wendall rohr and the plaintiffs team the weekend had brought no rest theyd traced marlees fax back to a truck stop near hattiesburg and obtained an unclear description of a young woman late twenties maybe early thirties wearing a fishing cap with a face halfhidden by dark glasses it was the opinion of the eight principal plaintiffs lawyers that this was something new no one could recall a trial in which a person outside had contacted the lawyers with hints of what the jury might do they all agreed that shed be back and that shed probably ask for money a deal money for a verdict they didnt dare however to plan how they might deal with her maybe later but not now fitch on the other hand thought of little else hed spent the weekend watching jurors and meeting with lawyers hed been pleased with the ken and ben show in charlotte and had been assured by george teaker that they could trust lonnie shaver fitch slept four hours saturday and five sunday he dreamed of the girl marlee and what she might bring him this could be his easiest verdict yet fitch watched the courtroom on monday from the viewing room in his office he listened as dr hilo kilvan continued with his testimony fitchs consultants were certain that the plaintiffs witnesses hadnt really made a strong impression on the jurors in court nicholas sent a note to the judge saying that he needed to see him urgently at lunchtime he went to the judges chambers i need to be quick said nicholas its frank herrera we talked about him last time well his mind is made up and im afraid hes trying to influence people is he discussing the case once with me herman is very proud of being foreman of the jury and he wont allow talk about the trial and another thing nicholas opened his case and pulled out a videocassette he looked at a videocassette recorder in the corner may i the judge nodded on the video

security now said nicholas fitchs sandwich was interrupted with the words he was waiting to hear the girls on the line he grabbed the phone fitch baby its me marlee dont know the guys name but hes the goon you sent into easters apartment on thursday just after i gave you the note anyway later you sent the same goon into the courtroom that was stupid because easter recognized him and he sent a note to the judge are you listening fitch listening but not breathing yes well now the judge knows that the guy broke into easters apartment so get him out of town fast two hours later doyle was flying to chicago at threethirty the jurors were sent back to their room and judge harkin questioned the lawyers about the breakin at nicholass apartment nicholas was called to the meeting and the judge questioned him about the man whod been following him nicholas answered in perfect detail giving dates and places and also describing the security measures in his apartment he played the videocassette again after hed gone judge harkin and the lawyers considered their options back in court judge harkin apologized for his decision it was very rare to sequester a jury but he had no choice in this case the jurors should leave go home pack and report to the court the next day ready to spend the next two weeks sequestered chapter five the siesta motel on monday night nicholas invited jerry to go to a casino to celebrate their last hours of freedom jerry invited sylvia taylortatum they were becoming friendly sylvia was divorced for the second time and jerry would soon be divorced for the first lonnie shaver spent monday night working he contacted george teaker at his home and explained that the jury was going to be sequestered and that the judge had forbidden any direct phone calls to and from the motel teaker was sympathetic and worried about the result of the trial our people in new york think a guilty verdict could really damage the economy especially in our business ill do what i can lonnie promised youve got to help us lonnie i know its difficult but youre there know what i mean sure i understand ill do what i can durwood cable waited until almost nine on monday evening to talk to fitch we were embarrassed in court this afternoon cable said who was the guy in the apartment he wasnt one of my men we have reason to believe that he was a goon employed by rohr and his boys can you prove it i dont have to prove a damn thing and i dont have to answer any more questions your job is to win in court i rarely lose fitch went to the door i know and youre doing a fine job cable you just need a little help from the outside nicholas arrived first with two gym bags filled with clothes lou dell and willis a deputy were waiting outside the jury room to collect the bags and store them it was tuesday morning how do the bags get from here to the hotel well take them over later willis said but we have to inspect them first no one is inspecting these bags judges orders said lou dell i dont care what the judge has ordered no one is inspecting my bags nicholas placed them in a corner and walked to the coffeepot by all twelve jurors were present and the room was full of baggage that nicholas had rescued and stored hed done a fine job of making the jury feel really angry about the question of their baggage at nine lou dell knocked on the door its time to go the judge is ready for you tell the judge were not coming out said nicholas the courtroom was full on tuesday morning so many people witnessed lou dell whispering to the judge he wondered what to do his jury was on strike the judge addressed the court gentlemen there is a small problem with the jury i need to speak to them when the judge knocked on the jury door nicholas opened it whats the problem asked the judge we dont think it fair that the deputies search our bags why not its routine in all sequestration cases these are our personal possessions were not terrorists or drug smugglers were not coming out until you promise our bags will be left alone fine replied the judge the bags will not be searched but if i find out that a juror possesses any item which is on the list i gave you yesterday then that juror could be sent to jail do you understand easter looked round the room at the other jurors thats fine judge he said but theres one other problem according to your rules here were allowed one personal visit per week we think we should get more the judge didnt want to have a discussion about it can we agree on two its only a couple of weeks he asked two with a possible third said nicholas thats fine does that suit everybody thank you your honor herman said loudly the jury were ready to enter the courtroom news of the breakin to nicholass apartment affected the pynex share price on the tuesday morning it started to fall then rumors started that the jury had refused to leave the jury room because the testimony offered by the plaintiff was so boring the share price rose again the woman juror that fitch wanted to influence most was rikki coleman she was a pretty thirtyyearold mother of two she worked as an administrator in a local hospital and her husband was a private pilot neither of the colemans smoked and there was no evidence that they drank because of her lifestyle and her job in a hospital fitch was afraid of rikki coleman as a juror fitch had managed to get hold of medical records for seven out of the twelve jurors including those of rikki coleman after some investigation he discovered that while rikki had been at a small bible college in montgomery alabama shed become pregnant but had decided not to have the baby the operation was carried out in a small private womens hospital a week after her twentieth birthday the father wasnt named rikki had met her husband a year after she finished college fitch was willing to bet a lot of money that he didnt know about rikkis pregnancy the motel was called the siesta motel and it was fifty kilometers along the coast the trip was made by bus the jurors felt tired and lonely only nicholas was delighted with sequestration but he managed to look depressed the bus was followed by fitchs boys and two detectives working for rohr no one expected the motel address to remain a secret the jurors were on the first floor of one wing of the motel lou dell and willis had rooms by the door leading to the main building another deputy chuck had a room at the other end of the hallway the rooms had been assigned by judge harkin himself the motel tvs only showed hotel movies no news or other programs during sequestration the telephones had been removed a room at the end of the hall had been made into a sitting room for the jurors it was quickly given the name of the party room no one could leave the wing without authorization the following morning over breakfast the complaints started i dont understand why we cant have telephones nicholas said why cant we have a cold beer asked jerry i have a cold beer every night when im at home maybe two the complaining increased until the jurors were ready to rebel wed better get things sorted out now said nicholas seriously were going be here for two weeks maybe three i say we talk to judge harkin judge harkin was in his chambers with the lawyers when gloria lane entered we have another problem with the jury theyre at the motel and theyre not coming until they can talk to you the judge gave a false smile lets go and see them konrad took the first call at she didnt want to talk to fitch she just wanted to leave a message that the jury were upset and not leaving the motel until the judge had seen them at she called again and gave konrad the information that easter would be wearing a dark shirt over a brown tshirt and red socks at she called again and asked to speak to fitch good morning fitch she said good morning marlee do you know the st regis hotel in new orleans no its on canal street theres an openair bar on the roof meet me there at seven tonight fine and come alone ill watch you enter the hotel and if you bring friends the meetings off and if you attempt to trail me ill disappear judge harkin cable and rohr were met at the front desk of the motel by lou dell who was scared she led them to the party room after a few uncertain hellos the judge said im a little disturbed by this nicholas easter replied were not in the mood to take any criticism hed written down a list of their complaints the judge had to agree beer would be no problem newspapers would be allowed after theyd been checked phone calls were possible television was allowed if they promised not to watch the local news the judge asked for a nostrike guarantee in the future but easter wouldnt promise anything on the news of a second strike pynex shares moved down two points but later recovered the st regis hotel was watched by fitchs people from the afternoon but there was no sign of the girl just before seven fitch went up in the elevator to the roof and sat down several of his people were there at different tables at seventhirty she appeared from nowhere she was very pretty and fitch guessed her age to be between twentyeight and thirtytwo the waiter asked if she wanted something to drink hed been bribed to remove anything she touched with her fingers glasses plates anything he wouldnt get the chance are you hungry fitch asked no im in a hurry if i stay your goons can take more photos so why are we here one meeting leads to another and where do all the meetings lead us to a verdict for a fee im sure lets not talk about money now ok they talked briefly about some of the jurors fitch found out little about marlees real identity or her relationship with nicholas easter as soon as marlee had left fitch ordered his people to go after her when she was nearly back home in biloxi marlee told the police that she was being followed two of fitchs goons were arrested later that evening nicholas slipped out of the motel and met marlee who told him all about her trip to new orleans wendall rohr thought the court was tired of listening to scientists talk about lung cancer and smoking so on thursday morning he called lawrence krigler as his next witness lawrence krigler had worked for pynex hed left in the middle of a lawsuit with the company hed sued pynex and theyd sued him which had been settled out of court while he was there he did research on the possibility of growing an experimental tobacco leaf which contained much less nicotine but the company wasnt interested nicotine was addictive more nicotine meant more smokers which meant more sales and more profits it was an important moment in the trial everyone was listening carefully over lunch the jury were silent did they really hear right did tobacco companies keep nicotine levels high so people became addicted in the afternoon cable tried to introduce a lot of details into kriglers testimony to confuse the jury but during coffee nicholas explained to them what cable was doing by the end of thursday the price of pynex shares was down krigler was quickly flown out of biloxi by rohrs security people pynex had paid him three hundred thousand dollars out of court just to get rid of him they wanted him to agree never to testify in trials he refused and so his life would always be in danger chapter six the stillwater bay development millie duprees husband hoppy owned a struggling real estate agency in biloxi he worked hard with the little business that came his way somehow he took care of his family his wife millie and their five kids just before six on thursday a welldressed young businessman entered the office and asked for mr dupree his business card showed him to be todd ringwald of klx property group from las vegas nevada his company liked to work with smaller companies he said and hoppy had been highly recommended he showed hoppy a map mgm grand is coming here but no one knows it yet theyre going to build the biggest casino on the coast probably the middle of next year we want this on the map he pointed to a large area of land northwest of the proposed casino then he showed hoppy an artists drawing of the land labeled stillwater bay there were office buildings big homes smaller homes a dock parks a shopping mall even a proposed high school the whole thing will cost thirty million dollars these are just the first drawings ill show you more if you can come to our office in las vegas hoppys knees shook and he took a deep breath what kind of help were you thinking about from us first we need someone to arrange the purchase of the land then well need a real estate firm to advertise and sell the whole development how much will the land cost asked hoppy its expensive five million dollars but the sellers dont really want to sell so we have to move in quickly thats why we need a local agent ringwald watched as hoppy calculated his normal percent fee on the land sale three hundred thousand dollars hoppys heart beat faster and with the whole stillwater bay development he could be a millionaire in five years ringwald said im assuming your fee is percent thats what we normally pay of course said hoppy his tongue was dry from three hundred thousand dollars to four hundred thousand just like that who are the sellers the property is in the sixth district and the county supervisor is jimmy hull moke hoppy interrupted you know him everyone knows jimmy hull moke hes been in office for thirty years cleverest crook on the coast on a local level he controls everything perhaps we should arrange a meeting with mr moke meetings dont work what moke wants is cash lots of it in secret he doesnt get caught asked ringwald hes pretty bright those of us who work along the coast know how he operates i think the first step is for you to talk to mr moke i have a clean reputation said hoppy for twentyfive years hed worked honestly he wasnt going to change we dont expect you to get dirty ringwald paused we have ways of delivering what mr moke wants you wont have to touch it in fact you wont even know when anything happens hoppy liked it still he felt cautious he said hed like to think about it they chatted some more and said goodbye at eight after ringwald had left hoppy telephoned klx he spoke to mr ringwalds assistant madeline who explained that mr ringwald was out of the office so klx really did exist at thursday night lonnie shaver had a message that george teaker had called he rang back and for the first ten minutes answered nothing except questions about the trial lonnie confessed that it had been a bad day for the defense as lawrence krigler had made a big impression on all the jurors all except lonnie of course teaker said that the folks in new york were worried they were relieved that lonnie was on the jury and was reliable he said that they needed to arrange the final details of lonnies new contract he currently earned forty thousand dollars superhouse would give him fifty thousand with some share options and an extra annual payment which might be twenty thousand dollars an hour later lonnie stood at his window and told himself that hed soon be earning seventy thousand dollars a year not bad for a kid whose father drove a milk truck on thursday night hoppy dupree slept little the agreement with jimmy hull moke worried him hed never before been involved with anything dishonest he sat on his porch and thought but just before dawn on friday morning he started to feel better surely moke would know how not to get caught hoppy wouldnt get near the cash he decided that hed have a chat with moke and then report to ringwald on friday morning the wall street journal printed an article about krigler which said that he hadnt been a satisfactory employee and that there were mistakes in his research the company denied that tobacco was addictive the newspaper also said that pynex shares had risen then fallen judge harkin read the story he checked with lou dell that the jurors couldnt have seen it in court the defense tried to look relaxed for the day after krigler it was important that they didnt seem bothered they wore lightcolored suits and smiled at the jurors why are they so happy whispered one of the jurors they want us to think everything is under control whispered back nicholas wendall rohr called the next witness dr roger bunch hed become famous ten years earlier when hed worked for the government and had been fiercely critical of the tobacco industry since leaving office hed continued to criticize smoking he wanted to share his views with the jury cigarettes cause lung cancer and cigarettes are addictive tobacco companies spend billions deceiving the public they spend money on studies which claim that smoking is harmless bunchs study showed that cigarettes contain poisonous chemicals and trash swept off the floor he had the jurys attention hoppy arranged to meet jimmy hull moke at his office hed provided sandwiches and iced tea but he was too nervous to eat anything himself he showed moke the drawing of the stillwater bay development and presented the project whos doing this moke asked hoppy had practiced his answer he couldnt give a name not at this point moke frowned there could be problems with zoning and planning but as you know the supervisors make the final decisions my client is anxious to work with you you know i control everything in my district if i want this approved it will be if i dont like it its dead hoppy nodded moke said you know my son is a very fine consultant for projects like this i didnt know that my client would love to work with your son ringwald wanted hoppy to find out what moke wanted how much might he charge for his services a hundred thousand dollars hoppy didnt show any emotion klx had said the deal might cost up to two hundred thousand a penny less than that and ill kill the deal with one phone call i need to make a phone call hoppy said he walked into the front room and rang ringwald he returned to his office its ok he said slowly my client will pay it felt good to arrange this deal klx on one side moke on the other and hoppy in the middle with no involvement on friday afternoon fitch didnt attend the trial instead he continued to study the jury file from the cimmino case which hed received three days earlier three hundred possible jurors had received a summons one of them was a young man called david lancaster there was nothing strange in his file except a note saying that when he appeared on the first day there was no record of his summons being issued but he was able to show the relevant papers one of the jury consultants had noticed that lancaster seemed anxious to be on the jury however he wasnt selected fitch had learned that david lancaster had disappeared from allentown a month after the trial by wednesday night fitch was almost certain that david lancaster was nicholas easter carl nussman fitchs chief jury consultant had looked through the papers of another tobacco trial in oklahoma one of the possible jurors there was a young white male called perry hirsch he was almost selected for the jury but missed it at the last moment soon afterward he left town again no one knew anything about him fitch and his staff stared at the photos of hirsch lancaster and easter the three faces were of the same person after lunch a handwriting expert analyzed their writing he announced without any doubt hirsch and lancaster are the same people hirsch and easter are the same people therefore lancaster and easter must be the same all three are the same said fitch slowly thats correct and hes very very bright marlee called fitch late on friday night in his hotel no one outside his team knew where he was the call was put through to the hotels front desk but the hotel was being paid a lot of money to protect fitchs secrecy so they couldnt admit that he was a guest when marlee called again she was put through to fitch on his orders hi fitch sorry to call so late no problem he said hows your friend lonely tonight was the night for jurors personal visits why didnt you visit your lover who said were lovers i tell you fitch krigler really worked well for the plaintiff they listened to every word tell me some good news rohrs worried whats worrying rohr he asked looking at his puzzled face in the mirror he felt betrayed you he knows youre trying to think up all kinds of ways to get to the jury how often do you talk to him a lot hes sweeter than you fitch he doesnt tape my calls or send goons to follow me so rohr knows how to charm a girl yes but he hasnt got as much money as you how much of my money do you want later fitch i must run theres a suspiciouslooking car across the street it must be some of your goons fitch showered and tried to sleep at am he drove to the casino by dawn hed won nearly twenty thousand dollars chapter seven a fire the first saturday in november was unusually cool for the near tropical climate of the coast the jurors accompanied by lou dell and her husband five parttime deputies and two other court officials went by private bus to new orleans they shopped at outdoor markets bought souvenirs and at four went on a sightseeing trip on a boat they were back home at ten tired and ready for sleep early that same morning hoppy was just making coffee when he heard the doorbell two young men stood on the doorstep when hoppy heard fbi he nearly fainted mr dupree agent nitchman said when the introductions were completed wed like to ask you some questions about what hoppy asked his voice dry questions about stillwater bay jimmy hull moke things like that nitchman explained hoppy grabbed the door oh my god he said may we come in agent napier said no please not here the children my office please there were no sounds from upstairs the kids were still sleeping he dressed fast and thought about calling todd ringwald or his lawyer he thought of the public shame how could he have been so stupid nitchman started are you familiar with stillwater bay yes have you met a man by the name of todd ringwald yes have you signed any kind of contract with him no what was the purpose of your meeting with jimmy hull moke to discuss the development of stillwater bay napier cleared his throat weve been investigating mr moke for the last six months we agreed to make things easier for him if he helped us did you offer money to mr moke no hoppy said he hadnt actually offered money hed made it possible for his client mr ringwald to offer money nitchman took out a pocket tape recorder and put it on the table sure he asked he pressed a button hoppy held his breath then there was his voice and then mokes hoppy stared at the tape recorder defeated when he finally looked at them his eyes were red so what will happen to me for trying to bribe a government official id say three to five years in prison the microphone had been hidden in a pen which was sitting in a jar with other pens and pencils on hoppys desk ringwald had put it there on friday morning when hoppy had left his office briefly from the desk the recording had been sent to a van recorded onto tape and delivered to fitchs office moke of course wasnt involved he was simply behaving like he always did trying to make money from bribes ringwald napier and nitchman all worked for a security firm that fitch often used the hoppy scam would cost the fund eighty thousand dollars a tiny amount for them hoppy mentioned legal representation but it was important that hoppy didnt talk to a lawyer whod want names and addresses we know youre not a crook nitchman said softly you just made a mistake added napier lets keep this quiet for twentyfour hours we need time to think about your situation there may be a way out for you mr dupree well meet here tomorrow at nine oclock in the morning its a deal said hoppy since the hoppy scam was going well fitch decided to act early sunday morning pang and dubaz another of fitchs employees dressed as workmen broke into nicholass apartment dubaz went straight to the camera hidden above the refrigerator and removed it pang managed to remove the back of the computer and take out what he needed while dubaz searched for more computer disks it didnt take long lets go said pang they threw the computer onto the sofa and covered it with pillows and clothing then they poured lighter fuel on top walked to the door and dubaz threw a match onto the heap when the flames were near the ceiling they left quickly locking the door behind them downstairs they pulled a fire alarm then they began banging on the front doors of the other apartments there were screams as people came out into the hallways make damn sure you dont kill anyone fitch had warned them as the crowd went out into the parking lot pang and dubaz separated when the firemen arrived they disappeared no one died and no one was injured four apartments were destroyed eleven badly damaged easters computer disks were almost impossible to read they were so secure that fitchs computer experts were defeated however they did manage to read one disk on it there were current news items about the tobacco industry information about other legal cases and a poem about rivers it was impossible to decide whether easter was sympathetic to smokers or just interested in the law finally they found a twopage letter to easters mother a mrs pamela blanchard in gardner texas in it he apologized for not writing sooner and said hed found a job in a casino although he still thought about being a lawyer he doubted hed ever return to his law studies he signed the letter love jeff fitch immediately sent two people by private plane to gardner there was one other important piece of information a list of people registered to vote in harrison county from a through k there were names and addresses the list itself wasnt secret but two things about it were odd first it was on a disk which meant that somehow easter had managed to steal the information from a court computer second why did easter need it fitch knew that easter was quite capable of altering the list to have his own name entered as a possible juror in the wood vs pynex case hoppys eyes were red and swollen as he drank coffee at his desk early on sunday morning at nine napier and nitchman entered with a third older man he was introduced as george cristano from washington department of justice his handshake was cold hoppy could we have this little chat elsewhere they left town in a big black lincoln town car and drove to a dock near bay st louis hoppy followed cristano onto a boat named afternoon delight sit down hoppy said cristano the boat rocked slightly cristano sat opposite hoppy ill be brief we have a deal for you which means that you can walk away no arrest no trial and no prison in fact hoppy no one will ever know im listening interrupted hoppy this deal has nothing to do with the law its political therell be no record of it in washington are you worried about crime and drugs hoppy of course everythings political these days were constantly fighting with the government and with the president do you know what we need in washington we need more good republicans wholl give us money and keep out of our way the democrats are always talking about budget cuts and the rights of criminals we have to protect our friends hoppy and you can help us cristano paused and looked up and down the dock he leaned closer your wife can help millie its the trial hoppy guess who gives most money to republican candidates the tobacco companies they give millions of dollars because theyre annoyed by government rules they believe people should be free to smoke if they want to if they lose this trial therell be a flood of lawsuits the companies will lose millions of dollars and so well lose millions of dollars in washington can you help us hoppy sure i guess but how talk to your wife and make her see that this case is dangerous she needs to stand up against the liberals who might want a big verdict for the plaintiff can you do that of course i can ill see her tonight in fact they talked about the best way to persuade millie hoppy asked what would happen if millie voted with the tobacco company but the rest of the jury disagreed cristano promised that if millie voted correctly everything would be all right hoppy almost danced along the dock as he returned to the car he was a new man judge harkin wouldnt allow the jurors to go to their different churches on sunday instead he arranged for a service to be held at the siesta motel at two relatives started arriving with clean clothes for the jurors as easter had no close relatives in the area willis drove him to his apartment the fire had been out for some hours the narrow front garden and sidewalk were full of burnt items and wet clothing neighbors were cleaning up nicholas felt weak at the knees he walked to the first group of people when did this happen he asked this morning about eight a woman answered do you live here yes easter m its totally destroyed thats probably where the fire started the security guard led nicholas up the steps to the second floor there was nothing left of his apartment except the kitchen wall no furniture and to his horror no computer sunday evening from pm was personal visits hoppy arrived first and started to talk about the trial to millie nicholas managed to leave the jurors wing of the motel unnoticed and went up to the second floor where marlee had booked a room marlee and nicholas had first met in lawrence kansas where she worked as a waitress and he was at law school marlees mother had died a few years previously and shed inherited almost two hundred thousand dollars they fell in love nicholas hated studying law and finally left law school in their four years together theyd traveled to half a dozen countries theyd also followed tobacco trials staying in places such as allentown and now biloxi together they knew more about nicotine lung cancer jury selection and rankin fitch than any group of experts rohr spent sunday evening meeting with the other trial lawyers whod each given a million dollars toward fighting this case they were discussing how many more witnesses for the plaintiff should be called the trial was now three weeks old rohr had enough experts to continue for at least two more weeks although cable had his experts defense witnesses normally took less than half the time of the plaintiff however this tobacco trial was unique because of the sequestered jury and at some point this jury would rebel the lawyers argued for an hour rohr thought that the jury had heard enough and he wanted to use only two more witnesses other lawyers disagreed quoting evidence from the jury consultants rohr felt he could understand the jury better himself chapter eight family backgrounds nicholas had a private meeting with judge harkin on monday morning he assured him that he was fine in spite of the fire he was just a student with little to lose except a fine computer and some good security equipment since they were alone harkin asked him how the other jurors were it would have been more appropriate if the lawyers had been present but he could trust this kid everythings fine nicholas said is the case being discussed no when were together we try not to talk about it good let me know if theres a problem and lets not talk about this meeting to anyone sure said nicholas they shook hands and he left rohrs next witness was leon robilio he was led into the courtroom through a side door a deputy helped him sit down he was old and pale dressed in a dark suit white shirt and no tie he had a hole in his throat covered with a bandage and hidden under a white scarf when he swore to tell the truth he did so by holding a pencillike microphone to his throat his voice was flat he was a victim of throat cancer hed lost part of his throat eight years earlier and had learned to talk in this way hed smoked heavily for almost forty years and his habit had almost killed him the jury quickly became accustomed to robilios mechanical voice he told them that hed worked for twenty years for the tobacco industry hed left the job when he got cancer and when he realized that even with the disease he couldnt stop smoking he was addicted he still worked full time but now was fiercely critical of smoking in his previous job hed seen a lot of studies of cigarettes and the tobacco industry he referred to kriglers evidence robilio regretted many things that hed done when he promoted the tobacco industry but he most regretted his denials that the industry aimed its advertising at teenagers we spent millions studying kids we knew that they could name the three most advertised brands of cigarettes we knew that almost percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands so what did the companies do they increased the advertising did you know how much money the tobacco companies were making from cigarette sales to children rohr asked about two hundred million dollars a year the tobacco companies know that kids start smoking every day and that nearly all adult smokers start as teenagers so they have to target young kids they know that onethird of the kids who start smoking today will die from their addiction the jury was fascinated by robilio rohr took a few steps forward then he asked how did you answer the arguments that nicotine is addictive i helped the tobacco companies think of the answer it goes something like this smokers choose the habit so its a matter of choice cigarettes arent addictive but even if they are no one forces anyone to smoke i used to make this argument sound good the trouble is its not true why isnt it true because the issue is addiction and an addict cant make choices and kids become addicted quicker than adults hoppy came to the trial that monday morning for the first time millie was thrilled to see him his sudden interest in the trial was strange however hed talked about nothing else for four hours the night before after a coffee break cable started to question robilio for the defense he started well when robilio admitted that he was being paid for attending at court cable then tried to make robilio lose his temper he asked robilio about his children whod all smoked and reminded him about the work the industry was doing to stop teenagers smoking robilio wasnt persuaded the industry will spend a little money to look responsible but they do that because they know the truth if they spend two billion dollars next year advertising cigarettes more young people will become addicted and youre a fool if you dont believe this judge harkin leaned forward mr robilio that is unnecessary sorry your honor and sorry to you mr cable youre just doing your job its your client i hate why cable immediately regretted asking the question because these tobacco people are clever theyre bright intelligent educated and dishonest theyll tell you that cigarettes arent addictive and they know its a lie no further questions said cable nicholas was silent during lunch he avoided glances and looked sad the mood was generally serious the jurors could still hear leon robilios mechanical voice three thousand kids start to smoke each day onethird of these will die from their addiction one of the jurors asked jerry fernandez how old were you when you started smoking fourteen why did you start the marlboro man the jurors thought of the image in the advertisement the cowboy on the horse the hat the snow on the mountains behind why would a young boy of fourteen not want to be the marlboro man are you addicted rikki coleman asked jerry i dont know he said i guess i could stop ive tried to stop a few times sure it would be nice to stop you dont enjoy it rikki asked oh there are times when a cigarette is just what i want but i smoke two packs a day now and thats too much i was sixteen when i started sylvia admitted i started at fourteen herman offered gave up when i was forty did anybody start smoking after the age of eighteen not a word nitchman met hoppy for a sandwich hoppy was nervous about being seen in public with an fbi agent and was relieved when nitchman arrived wearing jeans nitchman handed hoppy a piece of paper he said it had just come from cristano at the justice department in fact the document had been written by two of fitchs people it was a faxed copy of a report on leon robilio hoppy read it quickly while eating french fries robilio was being paid half a million dollars to testify hed been fired from his job for dishonesty he had a history of mental illness and his throat cancer was probably the result of his alcohol abuse really hoppy said his mouth full of potatoes mr cristano thought you should somehow give this to your wife nitchman said she should only show it to people she can trust on the jury right hoppy folded the paper and put it in a pocket nicholass mother pamela blanchard lived in the old part of gardner she was married to the president of a local bank he wasnt the father of nicholas or jeff or whoever he was she had two sons by a previous marriage which ended in divorce one was in alaska one was a lawyer or studying to be a lawyer something like that fitchs people finally found a college teacher who told them that jeff kerr had gone to law school in kansas fitch arranged for a local security firm to start searching lawrence kansas for any trace of jeff kerr they discovered that jeff kerr had registered as a law student but didnt receive a degree a local investigator found a lawyer whod been a student with jeff and went to see him the lawyer tom ratliff said he hadnt seen jeff in four years jeff had left law school because he suddenly hated the idea of being a lawyer also he fell in love who was the woman claire she worked in a bar mulligans i heard that he and claire left town but i never heard from him again employment records at mulligans gave her full name claire clement on monday afternoon in court an economist gave some information about jacob woods finances he told the court what mr woods salary was when he died and calculated how much his future earnings would have been one of the defense lawyers tried to challenge the figures but the lost salary was just the beginning rohr would add pain and suffering medical care and the price of the funeral an hour before the end of the day rohr announced his last witness mrs celeste wood the jury hadnt realized that the plaintiff was almost finished several of them smiled tonight would be their seventh night in sequestration according to nicholass theory the defense would take no more than three days they did the math they could be home by the weekend celeste wood was fiftyfive thin with short gray hair she worked for a library and had brought up three children shed practiced what she was going to say and she answered rohrs questions easily she talked about her husband kids and grandchildren her husband had wanted to stop smoking but he couldnt the addiction was too strong cable didnt question her what could he ask judge harkin looked at his jury they were tired ladies and gentlemen he said i have good news and bad the good news is obvious the plaintiff is calling no more witnesses the defense has fewer witnesses the bad news is that the lawyers and i have to deal with other business concerning the trial well have to do that tomorrow probably all day nicholas raised his hand you mean we have to sit around at the motel all day tomorrow im afraid so i dont understand why what do you want to do we could hire a big boat and go fishing i cant ask the taxpayers to pay for that mr easter im sure that the lawyers wouldnt mind paying rohr answered first wed be happy to pay half its a great idea judge said cable loudly nicholas put up his hand again excuse me your honor maybe some jurors would prefer to shop in new orleans no problem rohr and cable would divide the costs rohr and his team had presented ten witnesses to the jury including the video of jacob wood it had taken thirteen days if the jury hadnt been sequestered rohr would have called at least three more experts but he knew it was time to stop this was no ordinary jury with a blind man as foreman at least two strikes and lists of demands the jury didnt seem ordinary to fitch either he had huge experience of influencing juries things were going well only one fire and no broken bones but marlee had changed everything with her he could purchase a verdict in this the biggest tobacco trial ever his lovely marlee would hand him a verdict a victory over rohr in biloxi would make future litigation much more difficult it might even save the industry when fitch counted the jurys votes he thought there were four jurors with him and one that could go either way another would probably vote against the tobacco companies that left easter and the remaining five whod vote with easter nine votes were needed by either side for a verdict or the trial would have to take place again in his office rohr was sure that he had nine votes chapter nine buying a verdict in lawrence kansas fitchs local investigator tried too hard small spoke to a girl called rebecca whod worked at mulligans with claire clement small went to see her in the bank where she worked didnt you work with claire clement a few years ago small asked maybe who wants to know do you know where she is now no why are you asking well shes a possible juror in a trial my firm has been asked to investigate her background wheres the trial cant tell you you worked at mulligans right yes that was a long time ago have you talked to her recently not in the last four years now please im very busy and youre wasting your time when small had gone rebecca rang the number of an apartment in st louis and left a recorded message for her friend claire they chatted at least once a month though they hadnt seen each other in a year claire and jeff lived an odd life never staying long in one place only the apartment in st louis stayed the same claire had warned rebecca that people might come and ask difficult questions shed hinted that she and jeff were working for the government when marlee checked her messages at the st louis apartment she was worried she called rebecca and managed to sound perfectly normal though her mouth was dry rebecca was able to remember the whole conversation are you ok rebecca asked her friend oh were fine marlee assured her they said goodbye to each other and promised to keep in contact neither marlee nor nicholas had believed theyd be traced to lawrence whod found them which side fitch or rohr more likely fitch because he was smarter and had more money what had been their mistake how much did these people know she needed to speak to nicholas but he was on a boat with his fellow jurors fitch was in the office when the call came hello marlee he said to the girl of his dreams hey fitch what are the chances of a meeting without your goons hiding behind the bushes the chances are excellent youre lying lets do it this way lets meet and talk and if my people see your people this is the end its a deal im at casellas a seafood restaurant at the end of the biloxi dock im waiting when fitch arrived at the restaurant marlee was sitting at a wooden table with an umbrella above it she was wearing jeans sunglasses and a fishing cap i got a call from lawrence this morning she said and fitch swallowed it seems you have some goons up there trying to find things out i dont know what youre talking about fitch didnt sound very certain so it was fitch his eyes betrayed him right one more phone call like that and youll never hear my voice again she said nothing for a moment fine whatever you want i just wish i knew what you were talking about said fitch she was silent for a moment then finally fitch said when do we stop playing games now wonderful how much money do you want ill name a price later it depends on what you want the jury can do one of four things it can deliver a verdict for the plaintiff it can split down the middle and there will have to be a retrial it can vote nine to three in your favor and you have a huge victory it can vote twelve to zero in your favor and you and your clients can relax for several years i know all this of course you do if we forget a verdict for the plaintiff then you have three choices what can you deliver anything i want including a verdict for the plaintiff so the other side is willing to pay were talking tell me how the deal works its very simple we agree on the verdict you want then we agree on the price you get your money ready we wait until the lawyers finish their closing arguments and the jury withdraws to discuss the case at that moment i give you instructions about which bank you send the money to when the bank confirms theyve received the money the jury delivers your verdict but theres no guarantee he protested she leaned forward do you doubt me fitch fitch would pay hed decided a week earlier to pay whatever she wanted and he knew that when the money left the fund there were no guarantees he didnt care he trusted his marlee hed love to ask her lots of questions but he knew she wouldnt answer he also knew shed deliver his verdict shed worked too hard to fail im not totally helpless in this you know he said trying to look in control of course not fitch i know youve laid traps for at least four of the jurors shall i name them no he didnt want her to name them how did he know if she was telling the truth it simply wasnt fair i feel you doubt whether im in control what if i get a juror removed from the jury say lonnie shaver fitch tried not to react no hes harmless i think we should keep lonnie but i cant agree a deal without details without any hesitation she said and im not agreeing to anything as long as you keep investigating my past are you hiding something no but i dont like getting phone calls from my friends one more call and ill never speak to you again dont say that i mean it fitch stop your people if you dont ill talk to rohr he might want to do a deal a verdict for him means you have no job and your clients lose billions you cant afford it fitch she was right about that im hungry she said ill call you in a couple of days im hungry too he said no thanks ill eat alone the boat traveled eighty kilometers from the coast where half the jury started fishing one of the jurors angel weese got sick but recovered with the help of some medicine and actually caught the first big fish nicholas and jerry had decided to chat to lonnie shaver nicholas was friendly with jerry who sometimes agreed to say what nicholas wanted him to it was a game to him he had no idea what nicholas was really doing they made sure that lonnie had a supply of cold beer and after a few cans he talked more easily i wonder how many experts the defense will call nicholas said they dont have to call any lonnie said staring at the sea youve had enough nicholas said damned ridiculous a man smokes for thirtyfive years then wants millions for his family after he kills himself jerry and i thought that you would support the defense nicholas said and what about you lonnie asked me im still openminded jerrys leaning toward the defense because hes addicted to nicotine he thinks he can stop smoking if he really wants to so jacob wood should have stopped long before he got cancer right thats about right jerry said the boat returned soon after five its arrival was reported to fitch he was in his office with one of his people swanson replacing the goons that had annoyed marlee with another firm who guaranteed not to get caught swanson was going to kansas city to direct operations fitch couldnt lose marlee but he had to know who she was there was something hidden in her past angel weese was in love with and planned to marry derrick maples a young man who was between jobs and between wives he was in the process of divorcing his first wife they had two young children and his wife and her lawyer wanted six hundred dollars a month the situation wasnt good angel was two months pregnant though shed told no one except derrick derricks brother marvis had once been a deputy sheriff and was now a parttime minister marvis was approached by a man named cleve who said hed like to meet derrick introductions were made cleve was known as a runner he ran cases for wendall rohr his usual task was to find good death and injury claims and make sure that they went to rohrs office cleve had to work carefully looking for clients like this wasnt considered acceptable behavior on his business card he was called an investigator over a beer cleve talked to derrick and quickly realized that he had financial problems he started asking questions about angel and the trial why dont you tell me what this is about derrick asked my client is willing to purchase influence for cash five thousand dollars half now half after the trial derrick smiled and i do what you talk with angel when you see her during personal visits and you make sure she knows how important this case is to the plaintiff just dont tell her about the money or about me or any of this not now maybe later why not because this is illegal ok if the judge found out that i was talking to you offering you money to talk to angel then both of us would go to jail understand ten thousand five now five when the trial is over ok ten durwood cable was in charge of keeping d martin jankle away from any alcohol fitch and jankle had fought over the question of whether or not jankle could drink on the night before he testified fitch accused jankle of having a drink problem jankle cursed fitch for trying to tell him the ceo of pynex if when and how much he could drink cable got involved in the argument he insisted that jankle stay in his office to prepare his testimony and then practice it jankle performed adequately nothing special cable made him watch a video of his performance when he was finally taken to his hotel after ten he found that fitch had replaced the alcoholic drinks in his room with juices he cursed and went to his overnight bag where he kept a bottle hidden in a leather case fitch had removed that too at am nicholas silently opened his motel room door and looked up and down the hall the guard was gone probably asleep marlee was waiting in a room on the second floor they kissed she hurriedly told him about her chat with rebecca in lawrence then she tried to recall every word of her conversation with fitch they were both shocked to realize that theyd been partly discovered they were sure it was fitch and they wondered how much he knew they were certain that jeff kerr would have to be discovered in order to find claire clement although jeffs background was harmless claires had to be protected or they wouldnt be able to continue with their plan there was little that they could do except wait derrick entered angels room through the window he couldnt wait until tomorrow night he told her because he loved her and missed her she noticed hed been drinking they awoke at dawn and angel was nervous because she had a man in her room and this was against the judges orders derrick wasnt worried hed been thinking and hed decided that angels vote was worth a lot more than ten thousand dollars hed suggest to cleve that they paid him cash now and then a percentage of the money granted to the plaintiff after the verdict there would never be a chance like this for him again chapter ten the case for the defense on wednesday morning an analyst named walter barker wrote in an article in mogul a popular weekly financial magazine that the jury would decide against pynex and that the sum of money pynex would have to pay out would be enormous his opinions were listened to and he was usually right wall street was shocked the share price dropped from seventysix to seventy one and a half the jury arrived in court at nine harkin welcomed them went through his normal questions and then promised that there would be a speedy end to the trial jankle was called as a witness and the defense began free from the effects of alcohol jankle was ready he smiled and seemed to welcome the chance to defend his tobacco company sitting on the second row was taunton the black lawyer whom lonnie had met in charlotte it didnt take long for their eyes to meet lonnie managed to nod and smile because it seemed like the polite thing to do tauntons message was clear the defense was speaking and it was important for lonnie to understand that he should believe every word that was said by the witness no problem with lonnie jankle described the different brands of cigarettes his company made showing the jury a colorful chart of the eight brands each with the nicotine levels labeled beside it by offering this wide selection of brands pynex allowed each person to decide how much nicotine he or she wanted choose the number of cigarettes you smoke each day choose what you do to your body with cigarettes the message was choice choice choice cigarettes were responsible products if used carefully however like many other products alcohol butter sugar and handguns for example they could become dangerous if they were abused fitch watched all of jankles testimony from a seat near the back to his right was luther vandemeer ceo of trellco the largest tobacco company in the world and the unofficial head of the big four fitch and vandemeer had lunch at mahoneys alone they were relieved by jankles success that morning but they knew the trial would become more difficult how much influence do you have with the jury asked vandemeer fitch wasnt going to answer truthfully he wasnt expected to no one knew some of the things he did except his own agents the usual maybe the usual is not enough vandemeer was scared with good reason the pressure was enormous a large plaintiffs verdict would mean an immediate percent loss in shareholder value and that was just the beginning there could be one million lung cancer lawsuits during the five years after such a verdict the legal fees would average one million dollars for each case nobody dared predict the cost of one million verdicts the government might try to ban cigarettes do you have enough money vandemeer asked i think so answered fitch wondering for the hundredth time how much his dear marlee might want the fund should have a lot of money it does vandemeer chewed on a tiny piece of grilled chicken why dont you choose nine jurors and give them a million dollars each he said with a little laugh as if he was joking believe me ive thought about it its just too risky people would go to jail vandemeer stopped smiling we have to win rankin you understand we have to win spend whatever it takes with a jury exhausted by sequestration durwood cable didnt want to extend the case hed cut his list of witnesses to five and hed planned for their testimony to run for no more than four days in the afternoon jankle was questioned by wendall rohr rohr started with a vicious question and things went from bad to worse isnt it true mr jankle that your company spends hundreds of millions of dollars trying to persuade people to smoke but when they get sick your company wont pay a dime to help them jankle said something that no one could hear im sorry mr jankle i didnt hear that when was the last time i heard the question i cant recall one so you say that cigarettes dont cause sickness only if theyre abused so tell us please mr jankle how does one abuse a cigarette by smoking too much and how much is too much id say more than two packs a day rohr spoke more softly will you describe to the jury how you have warned the public that smoking more than forty cigarettes a day is dangerous the damage was done but rohr saved the best moment until the end he showed a video of jankle together with the other ceos giving evidence before a group of politicians one by one they were asked if nicotine was addictive they all clearly said no jankle was last and when he made his angry denial the jury knew he was lying fitch and cable had a tense meeting fitch was bothered about jankles defense cable who didnt like being criticized by a nonlawyer whom he hated anyway explained that theyd begged jankle not to talk about cigarette abuse fitch thought the jury might be tired of cable why couldnt another defense lawyer talk to a few witnesses there were a lot of them fitch and cable shouted at each other across a desk after theyd both tried to become calmer they did agree that the defense should be brief and last no more than three days fitch banged the door shut as he left the office in his car fitch read faxes there was a summary of the investigations into claire clement in kansas the car went past a store and fitch suddenly wanted a beer he was an exalcoholic and hadnt had a drink for nine years he knew that if he had one drink hed go on drinking he stopped thinking about beer where was marlee and why hadnt she called he closed his eyes thought of the jurors and dreamed of marlee derrick chose a different place for his meeting with cleve it was a bar in the black section of biloxi cleve insisted that they meet in the parking lot first he arrived late i dont think this is a good idea cleve said im the only white face here and you expect me to go into the bar with five thousand dollars and hand it over to you if you want the money meet me at the waffle house sitting in the waffle house they drank coffee derrick was nervous as he spoke so im thinking that ten thousand dollars isnt enough know what i mean i thought we had a deal said cleve showing no emotion things are different now i want fifty thousand dollars plus a percentage of the sum of money that the plaintiff gets i think percent would be fair oh you do youre crazy we made a deal for ten thousand anything larger and well be caught cleve got up and hurried out to the parking lot derrick ran after him and caught up with cleve in his car cleve got out lit a cigarette and looked at derrick look what im offering you is illegal dont get greedy if you do youll be caught but if you offer a percentage angel will work harder to persuade the other jurors to decide on a large sum of money you dont understand if theres a verdict for the plaintiff itll be years before the money is actually paid take the money talk to angel twentyfive thousand per vote per vote sure angel can deliver more than one cleve finished his cigarette ill have to talk to my boss it was time for personal visits at the siesta motel hoppy had arrived early with some chinese food and a bottle of wine he and millie made love and then talked about the kids hoppy spoke sadly about her absence everyone missed her he dressed and turned on the television youre not going to believe this he said taking a piece of paper out of his pocket what is it said millie taking the paper and reading it it was a copy of the document which fitchs people had written with false information about leon robilio millie looked suspiciously at her husband where did you get this she demanded who sent it dont know looks like it came from washington hoppy hated lying to millie but napier and nitchman were out there somewhere just waiting why didnt you just throw it away i dont know i you know its wrong to show me stuff like this hoppy millie threw the paper on the bed and walked closer to her husband what are you trying to do nothing somebody just faxed it to my office thats all what somebody knew your fax number knew that your wife was on the jury knew that leon robilio testified and that person also thought that youd be stupid enough to try to influence me i want to know whats going on nothing i swear said hoppy why have you taken such a sudden interest in the case i can tell when somethings bothering you hoppy nothing relax this case is difficult for both of us im sorry i showed you it millie finished the wine and sat on the bed hoppy sat next to her mr cristano had suggested that millie showed the document to all of her friends on the jury hoppy didnt know how to tell mr cristano that this wouldnt happen as he thought about this millie started crying i want to go home she said with red eyes hoppy put his arm round her and squeezed tightly im sorry he said she cried even harder hoppy felt like crying too the meeting hadnt been successful the trial would end soon he had to persuade millie to vote for a defense verdict hoppy would be forced to tell millie the truth not tonight but surely during the next personal visit chapter eleven a jurors dismissal colonel herreras routine never varied he got up at exactly fivethirty did his exercises and took a cold shower at six he had breakfast in the motel dining room at eight he returned to his room at on thursday morning nicholas greeted the colonel in the dining room and had a brief conversation about the weather he then went quietly down the hall took a pile of newspapers from a drawer in his room and used a key hed stolen from the front desk to enter the colonels room he put the pile of newspapers and magazines under the colonels bed one was a copy of yesterdays mogul he went to his room and phoned marlee marlee called fitch hey fitch go to the middle pay phone at the corner of fourteenth and beach drive ill call in seven minutes damn it fitch screamed he shouted for jose and they rushed to his car the phone was ringing as they got there hey fitch juror number seven herrera is really annoying nick i think well lose him today dont do it marlee hes on our side oh fitch theyll all be on our side when its over anyway be in court at nine to see what happens fitch controlled himself and walked calmly to the car whatever she wanted it didnt matter judge harkin lived in gulfport fifteen minutes from the courthouse as he was getting ready to leave for the courthouse the phone rang judge im sorry to bother you at home said a nervous voice its nicholas easter whats the matter the judge wondered how nicholas had obtained his phone number but said nothing its about herrera nicholas said i think maybe hes reading things that arent on the approved list this morning when i went into the dining room he was there alone and he tried to hide a copy of mogul from me isnt that some kind of business magazine yes it is replied harkin if easter was telling the truth and why should he doubt him then herrera would be sent home immediately the reading of any unauthorized material meant dismissal do you think hes discussed it with anyone else i doubt it like i said he was trying to hide it from me but ill listen carefully you do that ill ask colonel herrera to come in and see me this morning well probably search his room please dont tell him i reported him i feel really bad about doing it its ok the trials almost over nicholas im asking the lawyers to be as quick as they possibly can on his way to the court harkin called the sheriff and asked him to go to the siesta motel and wait he then called lou dell who told him that mogul wasnt sold at the motel he wondered how a sequestered juror could have got a copy of it when harkin arrived in court he told rohr and cable what hed learned without telling them whod told him both lawyers were unhappy cable was annoyed because everyone thought that herrera would vote with the defense rohr was cross because they were going to lose a juror and there was a danger the trial might have to be repeated herrera was called to the judges chambers where he was told he had to answer some questions he felt like a criminal have you been reading any materials not specifically authorized by me in particular a business weekly magazine called mogul asked the judge not since ive been sequestered herrera replied will you agree to a search of your room the colonel went red what are you talking about he demanded i have reason to believe that you have been reading unauthorized materials at the motel i think a search of your room would settle the matter replied the judge herrera knew there was nothing in his room then search it he said between his teeth in the motel the sheriff and two deputies found the newspapers and magazines under herreras bed they took them to the judges chambers the judge showed them to herrera these items were found under the bed in room just minutes ago herrera was speechless theyre not mine he said angrily somebody must have put them there the fact is that these were found in your room i have no choice you are dismissed from jury service there were many questions herrera wanted to ask but he suddenly realized hed be on the golf course by lunchtime whatever you say judge the jurors took their seats a few minutes after ten in the courtroom the jury watched silently as judge harkin showed them a copy of mogul he asked if anyone had read it or heard what was in it no one juror number seven frank herrera has been dismissed and replaced by the extra juror mr henry vu fitchs newspaper dropped several inches as he stared at the new juror he was scared because herrera had gone and thrilled because his girl marlee had done exactly what shed promised fitch looked at easter who stared back cables first witness on thursday was dr denise mcquade the defense wanted to answer leon robilios claims that kids were targeted by the cigarette industry dr mcquade was beautiful and clever shed written four books and many articles she quickly made her point advertising is everywhere children are familiar with commercials for all kinds of things that kids eat and drink like hamburgers and soft drinks no one accuses those companies of dishonestly targeting the young dr mcquades testimony made perfect sense to the jury rohr spent his lunch hour with cleve discussing what they should do about derrick this is what well do said rohr well give him fifteen thousand dollars now and the other ten after the verdict well promise him twentyfive thousand for the other votes well also record the interview if we get our verdict we wont pay and if he causes problems well threaten to call in the fbi i like it cleve said get the cash you must see him this afternoon cleve met him in a cheap bar but derrick had other plans he wanted angels twentyfive thousand dollars in cash now and he also wanted an advance payment for each of the other jurors eighty thousand dollars in cash now youre crazy cleve said and youre a crook replied derrick theres no way we can pay eighty thousand cash fine ill go to the tobacco company you do that said cleve on thursday morning the search for claire had a small success they got information about another friend of claires her name was beverly monk and she lived in greenwich village in new york swanson flew to new york and phoned her pretending to be nicholas hed practiced imitating nicholass voice many times its jeff kerr oh yes maybe she remembered him maybe she didnt im in the city and i wondered if youd heard from claire recently im looking for her i havent talked to claire in four years look im real busy now sure swanson called fitch they decided to offer beverly monk cash fitch knew marlee would ring on friday morning hi fitch lonnie shavers bothering nicholas oh damn no you cant do that youve got to stop this marlee fitch was aware of how desperate he sounded dont do it please lets talk about this well meet in an hour fulton street number fitch walked to fulton street he went alone are we ready to talk money he asked with a nasty grin yes you send me ten million dollars before the verdict you must be joking she never stopped looking at him ten million fitch and theres no discussion how much is in the fund the what he said no one knew about the fund dont play games fitch i want ten million dollars sent to a bank in singapore before the jury withdraws to discuss their verdict otherwise the deals off what happens if the deals off one of two things either nicholas will split the jury or hell persuade it to vote nine votes to three for the plaintiff the game was over she was in control so we have a deal yes said fitch they shook hands swanson approached beverly monk in a corner coffee shop excuse me are you beverly monk she looked up surprised and said yes who are you a friend of claire clements what do you want she was nervous but the shop was crowded you called me yesterday didnt you yes i did i lied i said i was jeff kerr im not im jack swanson i work for some lawyers in washington is claire in trouble no swanson gave a quick explanation of claires summons to jury service for a huge trial in the future well pay for information he said how much a thousand dollars cash to tell me everything you know about claire clement swanson took out an envelope and placed it on the table beverly stared at it then grabbed it and put it in her purse theres not much to tell she said i worked with her for six months then i left town i called her once or twice then we lost contact where did she go to college somewhere in the midwest claire was a very secretive person she didnt talk about her past i didnt ask swanson thanked her as he was leaving she offered to make a few phone calls she obviously wanted more money swanson said fine and gave her his business card hoppy sat in the back of a long black chrysler car with mr cristano nitchnian and napier were in the front hoppy had met with nitchnian and napier the day before and admitted that millie hadnt reacted too well to the document when do you see her again cristano asked tonight think the time has come hoppy for you to tell her the truth hoppys eyes watered as he stared out the window he cursed himself for his stupidity if he had a gun he could almost shoot todd ringwald and jimmy hull moke he could definitely shoot himself i guess so he whispered youll have to tell her that if she doesnt support the defenses case you will go to prison for five years hoppy started crying in the front nitchman grinned chapter twelve hoppy duprees confession fitch met with marlee an hour after the previous meeting ended how much does rohr know he asked he knows nothing we never met i made you think id met him but it never happened promise me you wont get rid of lonnie shaver fitch said tell me why if were working for the same verdict then we have to be honest all i can say is that lonnie has been bought and paid for how many votes does nicholas have now hell have nine votes before the jury withdraws maybe more he just needs a bit of help with a few like rikki coleman for instance we might have some information about her you keep playing games so will i what about millie dupree nicholas had noticed hoppys sudden interest in the trial and he and marlee had their suspicions that fitch was trying to use hoppy to persuade millie fitch decided to be cautious nothing on millie he said they discussed the other jurors briefly marlee asked for another twentyfive thousand dollars to bribe jerry fernandez and another juror then gave new instructions for the transfer of the ten million dollars the meeting was over later on friday fitch instructed each of the big four ceos to send two million dollars each to the fund immediately there was no time for explanations he then transferred ten million dollars from the funds bank account to a new account which he opened in the netherlands antilles by friday evening it was all done at first fitch was relieved but he knew his work wasnt finished he didnt know the real marlee and why she was doing this fitch didnt like the unknown he soon became angry and worried again at eight on friday evening derrick went to durwood cables office he was nervous and when he asked for a mr gable by mistake he was told that no one of that name worked there in court judge harkin was worried about the jury it was five on friday they were bored and tired the lawyers were worried too the jurors werent reacting to testimony as they should be they were staring blankly into space or trying to stay awake nicholas wanted the jurors to be tired theyd listen to him more willingly he persuaded all the jurors to sign a letter to judge harkin asking for the trial to continue on saturday judge harkin agreed the trial should be over monday afternoon he said well have closing arguments on monday morning and youll receive the case before noon thats the best i can do there were smiles from the jury with the end in sight they could manage one more weekend together there would be personal visits tonight tomorrow night and sunday hoppy arrived in millies room late he sat on her bed and put his face in his hands whats the matter hoppy she asked frightened he finally told her mr todd ringwald stillwater bay jimmy hull moke napier nitchman and the tape how could he have been so stupid millie began crying but there was more when he got to the part where he did a deal with mr cristano millie stopped crying but im not sure i want to vote for the tobacco company she said wake up millie if you dont i go to prison for five years thats not fair millie was shocked what about the kids hoppy asked hed planned his arguments in advance millie felt shed been hit by a bus its not fair to the people in the trial she said i know honey he replied i know im a total failure believe me ive even thought about shooting myself dont be silly she said and started to cry again after hoppy had left millie couldnt sleep at midnight she went down to the party room for a snack she found nicholas alone why are you up so late he asked you look troubled i am can you help me nicholas ill try she told him everything nicholas suspected a scam but didnt tell millie that she promised to do nothing until they spoke again he went to his room and rang marlee in court on saturday cable decided to start with a bit of action his witness was a dr olney whod done research on laboratory mice he had a video of the mice over some years the mice had been given huge doses of cigarette smoke not one had developed lung cancer hoppy was in court listening hed promised millie that hed come to show his support derrick sat at the back and continued to plot rikki colemans husband was also in court so were the families of some of the other jurors marlee had been working since six on saturday morning she called newspaper reporters the police fbi information lines and government information services she soon decided that the whole hoppy affair was a scam arranged by fitch fitch arrived for a meeting with marlee at ten earlier that morning hed received a report on the investigations into claire clement before she arrived in lawrence in the summer of she hadnt existed while in lawrence she made no long distance phone calls after she left lawrence the trail led nowhere shed probably changed her identity whoever she was she was smart weve got problems with rikki coleman said marlee nicholas thinks she wants a big verdict without comment fitch handed marlee a piece of paper so she was pregnant youre sure this is her positive you have nothing on herman grimes nothing replied fitch nicholas will have to deal with him hes getting paid for it if theres a problem cant you get him removed were thinking about it fitch shook his head in amazement do you realize what youre doing i think so thats all for now fitch i have work to do later that day marlee received a call from an fbi agent in biloxi called madden he confirmed that nitchman napier and cristano werent fbi agents and hed love to talk to them marlee said shed try to arrange a meeting at three on saturday afternoon the defense finished the jurors were free to go there would be trips to a football match or movie theater arranged for saturday night followed by personal visits on sunday the jurors could go to church and in the evening there would be more personal visits millie had no interest in movies and certainly none in football hoppy arrived with some food which they ate slowly after dinner they talked about their problems again there were more tears and more apologies finally millie confessed that shed told nicholas everything he could be trusted she said at tenthirty nicholas back from the football game visited millies room he explained to hoppy and millie that the whole thing was a scam a close friend had made phone calls which confirmed that napier nitchman and cristano werent government agents and that klx property group didnt exist hoppy had been tricked at first hoppy felt even more stupid then he had questions what did it mean was it good news or bad what about the tape he asked of me and jimmy hull moke im not worried about it nicholas said confidently the tape was obtained illegally forget it what sweet words youre serious yes hoppy the tape will never be played again millie leaned over and kissed hoppy this time her tears were of joy on sunday morning some of the jurors went to church hoppy went to his office at ten hed called napier at eight on sunday morning with the news that he had important developments to discuss he said hed managed to persuade his wife and she was influencing other jurors napier called cristano who called fitch fitch was delighted and authorized the meeting napier and nitchman arrived in hoppys office at eleven hoppy was making coffee he started talking to his visitors another guest quietly entered the building through the front door which hoppy had left unlocked he knocked on hoppys door and opened it agent alan madden fbi he said showing his badge napier and nitchman went pale as their hearts stopped the fbi is already here said hoppy acting perfectly looking at madden then the other two then madden you guys dont know each other fbi madden said show me your identification i can explain nitchman said his voice higher than normal you see were not really fbi agents were private investigators and well what screamed hoppy youve been telling me for ten days that youre fbi agents whats going on here who are you madden asked the two men there was no response he took out a gun and searched them then he led them from the building where another fbi agent was waiting they got into a car and drove away in the car napier and nitchman invented a story theyd been hired to investigate some real estate one thing led to another and their boss had made them pretend to be fbi agents no harm done really madden was a young agent and thought it was a minor crime he gave them a lecture about pretending to be fbi officers and told them to stay out of mississippi when fitch heard the story he was so angry that he broke a lamp he sent pang to fetch the two men three hours later napier and nitchman were sitting in a room next to fitchs office with cristano start at the beginning he said i want to hear every word they remembered nearly everything after theyd left fitch sat and thought hoppy would tell millie tonight millie would be lost as a defense juror in fact she would probably go right over to the other side and want billions of dollars for the poor widow wood marlee could rescue the situation only marlee chapter thirteen closing speeches beverly monk had some information shed managed to trace a friend of claires phoebe when she called phoebe she found out that phoebe had also received a call from someone pretending to be jeff kerr she knew it wasnt but had spoken to him anyway she hadnt seen claire clement in four years beverly told phoebe that she wanted to contact claire again phoebe told her claires real name it was brant gabrielle brant she was from columbia missouri she had a boyfriend who was crazy and so she changed her name and left town i think her fathers dead her mother was a professor at the local university is she still there i have no idea ill try to find her through her mom thanks phoebe beverly took an hour trying to reach swanson on the phone to sell him this information after checking with fitch swanson offered her two and half thousand dollars they bargained for ten minutes and finally settled on four thousand in cash swanson immediately flew to new york arrived at dusk and called beverlys roommate who told him that she might be at a party he called the pizzeria where she worked and was told shed been dismissed he drank coffee made phone calls and waited marlee wanted one more meeting with fitch fitch could have kissed her feet when he saw her he decided to tell her everything about hoppy and millie and the scam which had gone wrong nicholas must talk to millie immediately before she spoke to the other jurors what would she do when she learned the truth it would be a disaster no question about it marlee listened without reacting as fitch told the story it amused her to see fitch sweat i think we should get her off the jury fitch declared when he was finished relax fitch nicholas and millie are quite close millie will vote the way he wants fitch tried to smile just out of curiosity how many votes do we have right now nine look fitch youre worrying too much youve paid your money youve got the best now relax and wait for your verdict its in very good hands will we get all twelve nicholas is determined to get them all out of the building fitch was almost dancing jose had never seen his boss so happy wendall rohr and durwood cable were each practicing their closing speeches in a conference room in front of seven lawyers wendall rohr walked forward and back speaking softly with carefully chosen words to his jury his voice was warm and rich filled with sympathy one minute and hard words for the tobacco companies the next he lectured and persuaded he was funny and he was angry he finished in fiftyone minutes the closing speech had to be an hour or less judge harkins orders the comments from his audience were tough rohr agreed to perform again it had to be perfect victory was so close cable had a larger audience he was videotaped so he could watch himself he was determined to do it in half an hour the jury would like that rohr would no doubt go on for longer cable delivered his closing speech then watched the video again and again throughout sunday afternoon and into the night by the time fitch arrived at the beach house he was his normal pessimistic self again the four ceos were waiting having just finished a fine meal jankle was drunk fitch was questioned about the two million dollars hed required from each of them he explained that the defense had a very large unplanned expense do you have the votes fitch asked one of the ceos i believe i do the verdict has been purchased his voice held a touch of pride how ill never tell fitch said coolly the details are not important they stared at him eight times theyd been to the edge of disaster and each time rankin fitch had saved them now hed done it again how much jankle demanded ten million ive purchased the verdict for ten million dollars thats all ill say of course nothing is guaranteed you never know until the jury comes back well it ought to be guaranteed at a price of ten million dollars but the ceos said nothing there was a general feeling among the jurors that sunday night would be their last in sequestration the mood was more relaxed and many of the jurors packed up their things it was the third night of personal visits marlee and nicholas ate pizza in his room and discussed their plans marlee left at nine nicholas went to see hoppy and millie they were full of thanks millie was worried about staying on the jury shed discussed it with hoppy and didnt feel she could be fair after what had happened nicholas had anticipated this and wanted millie to stay on the jury if she told judge harkin what had happened then the judge would probably order the trial to be held again its our job millie nicholas said weve been chosen to decide this case its our responsibility to reach a verdict millie agreed her new friend nicholas made everything easier after failing to meet with cable derrick had to deal with cleve they met in the nugget casino on sunday night and drank a beer cleve gave derrick a packet containing fifteen thousand dollars the other ten thousand would be paid after the verdict as long as angel voted for the plaintiff after cleve had left derrick stayed behind to gamble he bet heavily the beers kept coming down to seven thousand dollars he wanted to cry but his luck changed and he left the casino with nearly eleven thousand dollars although it was too late for personal visits he got in his car and started to drive to the siesta motel soon he noticed blue lights behind him he stopped the car have you been drinking asked a policeman derrick was taken to jail a fivehour stay was automatic for drunk drivers he couldnt phone angel from jail but he had to reach her before she left for court at fivethirty on monday morning marvis arrived at the police station to collect derrick derrick gave his brother two hundred dollars and borrowed his car he raced to the siesta motel and tried to wake angel by throwing stones at her window dont move said a voice behind him derrick turned to see chuck one of the deputies with a gun hands up derrick was taken to jail for the second time that night angel slept through it all on monday morning while nicholas helped mrs grimes prepare hermans breakfast he dropped four small tablets into hermans coffee they wouldnt kill him herman would be sick for four hours then recover completely nicholas carried their breakfast back to the grimess room mrs grimes thanked him such a nice young man the drama started half an hour later the door to the grimess room was open and herman was bent double on the bathroom floor lou dell ran to the phone and rang the emergency services nicholas said to rikki that maybe it was a heart attack herman had had one six years ago the ambulance arrived and herman was taken away in the confusion nicholas managed to knock over the coffee cup lou dell called judge harkin pynex shares opened high on monday morning there was good news coming out of biloxi though no one knew the source all tobacco shares rose in early heavy trading judge harkin arrived in court at ninethirty hed been arguing with rohr and cable cable wanted a new trial after the loss of another juror but the judge didnt agree fitch sat in amazement how do you give someone a heart attack was marlee capable of poisoning a blind man thank god she was on his side judge harkin told the jurors that herman wasnt in danger everyone was very relieved and shine royce took hermans place the judge asked wendall rohr to start his closing speech it went well lasting fortyeight minutes and he ended it with some figures you could value jacob woods life at a million dollars add some other damages and the total sum that the family were due was two million but there was also the role of punitive damages how do you punish a company that has million in cash he was careful not to suggest a figure in response durwood cable took slightly more than half an hour to dismiss the idea that you should give millions to the family of a man whod smoked for thirtyfive years it was just a means of getting money he appealed to the jurys sense of fairness asking them to judge the case on facts not emotions he had the jurys complete attention the judge told the jury that the case was now for them to decide he asked them to select a new foreman in place of herman grimes as the jury left nicholas turned and looked at fitch fitch nodded fitch left the court and went to his office marlee phoned fitch i have new transfer instructions for the money she wanted it sent to a bank in panama city you have twenty minutes fitch the jury is eating lunch if i dont have confirmation by twelvethirty then the deals off and nicholas will change direction within ten minutes the money was on its way he received confirmation by fax at marlee called her banker in panama who confirmed receipt of ten million dollars marlee was in a motel room ten kilometers away with a fax machine after five minutes she instructed the same banker to transfer the money to a bank in the cayman islands nicholas called at twelvethirty to learn that the money was safe marlee went straight to the airport where a small plane was waiting swanson had waited patiently for beverly shed rung him at am monday morning obviously drunk and arranged to meet him at am in the coffee shop she was four hours late and looked drugged but swanson could have kissed her have you got the money there was no doubt what the money would be spent on yes but tell me about claire beverly gave him the information shed got from phoebe now give me the money she said swanson handed her the envelope thanks he said and disappeared he finally reached fitch on the phone just after one by then swanson was on his way to missouri chapter fourteen the verdict in the jury room they were ready to do what theyd been dreaming about all month they took their places and stared at the empty seat at the end of the table the one that herman had occupied guess we need a new foreman said jerry and i think it should be nicholas millie added quickly there wasnt any doubt about who the new foreman would be no one else wanted the job and nicholas seemed to know as much about the trial as the lawyers nicholas started judge harkin wants us to consider all the evidence including the reports before we start voting he said im ready to vote now said lonnie shaver not so fast said nicholas this is a very complicated case and it would be wrong to rush things were not going to read all that stuff are we asked sylvia i have an idea said nicholas well each take a report read it fast and then make a summary for everyone else they started work marlees flight from biloxi to george town grand cayman took ninety minutes she went through customs with a new passport which showed her to be lane macroland a canadian she took a taxi to the royal swiss trust bank the tropical air was warm but marlee hardly noticed she was greeted by a receptionist and within minutes had met a young man named marcus theyd spoken many times on the phone the money had arrived he told her in his office a secretary bought coffee and marlee ordered a sandwich pynex shares were still strong when marlee made her first trade she sold shares in pynex at seventynine dollars using a system which was popular with experienced investors if the price of shares was going to fall trading rules allowed them to be sold first at the higher price then purchased later at the lower one with ten million dollars in cash marlee would be allowed to sell approximately twenty million dollars worth of shares later shed buy them back and if their price had fallen shed make a profit on the difference in price marcus confirmed the trade and marlee then sold shares in two other big four companies and then more in pynex she paused and instructed marcus to watch pynex closely shed just sold shares and was worried about the effect on wall street i think its safe now said marcus whod been watching the share price closely for two weeks sell more she said without hesitation she was very calm marcuss heart missed a beat then he completed the trade thats approximately twentytwo million dollars ms macroland i think we should stop more sales will need approval from my superior one question when do you anticipate movement on these shares tomorrow early if you want your other clients to think youre really smart then you should suggest that they follow my example marcus sent for a company car to take marlee to her hotel marlees present seemed under control but her past was being discovered at the university of missouri records were found of a dr evelyn y brant shed died in age fiftysix and left everything to her daughter gabrielle age twentyone gabrielle had received nearly on the death certificate it stated that dr brant had died of lung cancer by the time fitch was told this they knew more dr brants husband dr peter brant had died in at the age of fiftytwo leaving everything to his dear wife evelyn and his daughter gabrielle hed also died of lung cancer fitch took the telephone call from swanson alone with the door locked at first he was too shocked to react both of marlees parents had died of lung cancer he wrote it down on a yellow pad as if he could analyze it as if he could somehow make it fit in with her promise to deliver a verdict he closed his eyes and rubbed his head he must stay calm there was nothing he could do to stop the jurys discussions they were in there with deputies by the door fitch made a list of possible things he could do all of which would be dangerous illegal and would fail he slowly rose to his feet and took the glass lamp in both hands konrad and pang were standing outside and heard a crash as the lamp hit the wall fitch shouted something about the money then the desk hit the wall find the girl he screamed find the girl after the period of forced concentration nicholas decided that some debate was needed he started by summarizing a report on the state of jacob woods lungs his audience was bored i have an idea rikki coleman said lets see if we can all agree that cigarettes cause lung cancer fine with me said nicholas raise your hands if you believe that cigarettes cause lung cancer twelve hands went up in the air who thinks nicotine is addictive another yes vote lets keep united folks nicholas said its really important that we walk out of here voting the same way most of the jurors had heard him say this before the legal reasons werent clear but they believed him anyway they continued to work through the reports they left the room to smoke and to stretch lou dell and two deputies guarded the door after another juror had summarized a report on the contents of cigarette smoke lonnie shaver spoke i thought wed decided that cigarette smoke was harmful he looked at nicholas i say we get on with the voting ill go first he took a deep breath and everyone turned to watch him my position is easy i believe cigarettes kill thats why i leave them alone nobody can force you to smoke but if you do youll suffer the consequences dont smoke for thirty years and then expect me to make you rich these crazy lawsuits need to be stopped do you know when i started smoking said angel weese i remember the exact day i was thirteen and i saw this really goodlooking guy all smiles perfect teeth with a beautiful girl on his arm and a cigarette in one hand what great fun i thought theres the good life so i went home got my money and bought a pack of cigarettes dont try and tell me anyone can give up im addicted lonnie said nothing the arguments continued then the jury returned to their reading at five oclock judge harkin called them back youve had the case for five hours id like to know if youre making progress nicholas stood up i think so your honor were determined to finish and have a verdict sometime tonight wonderful thank you dinner is on the way ill be in my chambers if you need me dinner was over at sixthirty and the jury agreed to vote are you willing to hold pynex responsible for the death of jacob wood asked nicholas four jurors voted yes four no the rest werent sure i think its time for you to say what you think lonnie said to nicholas ok he said hed practiced this speech and spoke very persuasively im certain that cigarettes are dangerous they kill people a year and they are full of nicotine i think cigarettes killed jacob wood and i am also certain that tobacco companies lie and cheat and do everything in their power to persuade kids to smoke they are selfish and greedy and should be punished rikki coleman and millie dupree felt like clapping you want punitive damages asked jerry the verdict means nothing if its not significant it has to be huge they went round the table again seven for the plaintiff three for the defense how much money do you have in mind for celeste wood asked rikki a billion dollars mouths fell open thats ridiculous said lonnie at that moment most of the other jurors agreed the discussions continued finally they agreed ten votes to two that celeste wood should receive two million dollars in actual damages after the mention of a billion dollars two million seemed a very small amount again they voted ten to two for punitive damages any idea of how much asked nicholas i have an idea said jerry get everyone to write down their amounts on a piece of paper then add them up and divide by ten that way well see what the average is the jurors quickly wrote their numbers on pieces of paper nicholas slowly unfolded each piece of paper and called the numbers out to millie who wrote them down one billion one million fifty million ten million one billion one million five million five hundred million one billion and two million millie did the math the average is three hundred fiftysix million nine hundred thousand lonnie jumped to his feet youre crazy he said and left the room banging the door behind him another juror looked shocked i cant do this im retired ok i have enough money but i cant understand these figures these numbers are real nicholas said and the company is very rich it has eight hundred million in cash weve got to think big or they wont take any notice what will happen to the tobacco industry if we bring back a big verdict like this asked angel therell be a lot of action the industry will have to examine their advertising plans again theyll go to the government and demand special laws but i suspect theyll get less and less help the industry will never be the same nicholas answered we need to decide on an amount folks if we want to go home i have an idea said jerry lets take it up to four hundred million half their cash count the votes said nicholas nine hands went up he filled in the verdict form and made everyone sign it lonnie returned weve come to a verdict lonnie what a surprise how much two million dollars and four hundred million dollars care to join us hell no answered lonnie nicholas walked to the door and asked lou dell to inform judge harkin that his jury was ready while they waited lonnie whispered to nicholas is there any way i can say that i didnt agree he was more nervous than angry sure dont worry the judge will ask each one if this is our verdict when he asks you make sure everyone knows you dont agree with it thanks chapter fifteen fitchs surprise lou dell delivered a note from nicholas to the judge in it nicholas asked for a deputy to accompany him from the courthouse as soon as the trial was finished he said he was scared the judge gave the necessary instructions and then went into the courtroom the atmosphere was full of anticipation lawyers were walking around nervous and wildeyed it was almost eight oclock i have been informed that the jury has reached a verdict harkin said loudly please bring in the jury they came in looking serious lou dell took the verdict form from nicholas and handed it to the judge his face showed no reaction to the extraordinary news he was holding he was very shocked but there was nothing he could do it was technically correct there would be action to reduce it later on but he couldnt do anything now he gave it back to lou dell who asked nicholas to read it we the jury find in favor of the plaintiff celeste wood and grant her damages of two million dollars wendall rohr and his lawyers breathed a huge sigh of relief theyd just made history but the jury wasnt finished and we the jury find in favor of the plaintiff celeste wood and grant punitive damages of four hundred million dollars cable sank down into his chair as if hed been shot the other defense lawyers stared at the jury box mouths open eyes wide in total disbelief oh my god one of them said rohr was all smiles as he put his arm around celeste wood whod started crying the other lawyers with rohr congratulated each other oh the thrill of victory the thought of sharing percent of this verdict now ladies and gentlemen of the jury judge harkin said i am going to ask each of you individually if you voted in favor of this verdict i did answered nicholas easter and six others when it came to lonnie he said loudly no your honor i did not i disagree with this verdict entirely two more jurors said they hadnt voted for the verdict but the final two sylvia and jerry stated theyd supported it the vote was nine to three nicholas was extremely worried that fitch wasnt in court how much did he now know nicholas wanted to get out of the courtroom and leave town the judge thanked the jury and told them that they couldnt tell anyone about the discussions theyd had they were dismissed fitch was watching from the viewing room in his office he was alone all the jury consultants had been dismissed hed discussed what he could do with swanson they could kidnap easter but he wouldnt talk and theyd go to jail for it they decided to follow him hoping hed lead them to marlee but what could they do if they found her they couldnt report her to the police fitch was trapped whatever he did nicholas left court quickly without saying goodbye to anyone at the back entrance the sheriff was waiting for him in his car judge said you needed some help nicholas directed him to a large apartment building north of town and got out thanking the sheriff he then got in a new rental car that marlee had left there two days ago and drove to hattiesburg where a private plane was waiting he arrived in george town with new canadian papers marlee met him at the airport they kissed have you heard he asked sure its all over cnn she said was that the best you could do she asked with a laugh they kissed again they went to the beach and sat in the sand alone as the waves washed across their feet what a moment it was their fouryear operation was over their plans had finally worked perfectly marlee went alone to the royal swiss trust bank the following day marcus greeted her in his office your trade in pynex shares seems to have been extremely successful ive been on the phone to new york and things are really confused the verdict has surprised everyone except you i guess there were so many questions he wanted to ask but he knew there would be no answers they might stop trading for a day or two he looked at his computer and spoke to someone in new york theyre offering pynex shares at fifty dollars two minutes passed his eyes never left the computer screen theyre at fortyfive now yes or no no what about the others marcuss fingers danced across the keyboard the entire tobacco industry is down check pynex again marlee said still falling fortytwo with a few small buyers buy shares at fortytwo a few seconds passed before he said confirmed the marlee nicholas team had just made seven hundred and forty thousand dollars less the banks fees she went on buying slowly the quick kill was happening shed planned this very carefully and shed never have another opportunity a few minutes before noon with the market still very upset shed finished marcus wiped his forehead not a bad morning ms macroland youve made over eight million dollars less fees i want the money transferred to a bank in zurich she handed him written instructions immediately please she packed quickly then nicholas and marlee flew first class to miami where they waited two hours and flew on to amsterdam they watched the news in the plane wall street was going round in circles experts were speaking every where judge harkin had no comment cable couldnt be found but rohr finally came out of his office and took the credit for the victory from amsterdam they flew to geneva where they rented a hotel apartment for a month fitch left biloxi three days after the verdict his future as director of the fund was in doubt but his firm had plenty of other work not as well paid as the fund however a week after the verdict he met with luther vandemeer and d martin jankle in new york and confessed every detail of his deal with marlee it wasnt a pleasant meeting he also discussed with other new york lawyers the best way of attacking the verdict the fact that easter had disappeared immediately was suspicious herman grimes had agreed to release his medical records which showed that hed been fit and healthy until that morning he remembered an odd taste to his coffee then he was on the floor colonel frank herrera had already given a sworn statement which said that the magazines under his bed werent his the mystery surrounding the verdict increased the new york lawyers didnt know about the marlee deal they never would cable was planning to ask permission to interview all the jurors an idea that judge harkin seemed to like how else could they find out what had happened in there lonnie shaver was particularly anxious to talk hed received his promotion and was ready to defend american business the appeal would be long and difficult rohrs future was filled with opportunity extra staff were employed just to answer the phone calls from other lawyers and possible victims wall street seemed more sympathetic to rohr than to the tobacco industry the share prices stayed low antismoking groups openly predicted the bankruptcy and eventual death of the tobacco industry six weeks after he left biloxi fitch was eating lunch alone in a tiny indian restaurant near dupont circle in washington it was snowing outside she appeared from nowhere hi fitch she said and he dropped his spoon what are you doing here he said without moving his lips he remembered how pretty she was her hair seemed shorter just came to say hello youve said it and the money is being returned to you as we speak im transferring it back to your account all ten million dollars fitch he could think of no quick response he was looking at the lovely face of the only person whod ever beaten him how kind of you he said i started to give it away you know to some of the antismoking groups but we decided against it hows nicholas hes fine why are you returning it its not mine i never planned to keep the money i just wanted to borrow it tell me fitch did you find gabrielle yes we did and her parents we know where they are does it make more sense now it makes more sense yes they were both wonderful people they were intelligent and energetic and loved life they both got addicted to cigarettes in college and i watched them fight their habit until they died they died terrible deaths fitch i was their only child my mother died at home on the sofa because she couldnt walk to her bedroom she paused but her eyes were surprisingly clear it must have been sad but fitch could feel no sympathy when did you start this operation graduate school i studied finance thought about law and then i dated a lawyer and heard stories of tobacco litigation the idea grew an amazing idea thanks fitch from you thats a nice thing to hear are you finished with us no well watch the appeal closely and if your lawyers go too far attacking the verdict then ive got copies of the bank transfers be careful fitch were proud of that verdict and were always watching and remember fitch next time you go to trial well be there the end
