the the town where no one got off ray bradbury crossing the oontinental united states by night by day on the train you flash past town after wilderness town where nobody ever gets off or rather no person who doesnt belong no person who hasnt roots in these country graveyards ever bothers to visit their lonely stations or attend their lonely views i spoke of this to a fellow passenger another salesman like myself on the chicagolos angeles train as we crossed iowa true he said people get off in chicago everyone gets off there people get off in new york get off in boston get off in la people who dont live there go there to see and come back to tell but what tourist ever just got off at fox hill nebraska to look at it you me no i dont know anyone got no business there its no health resort so why bother wouldnt it be a fascinating change i said some year to plan a really different vacation pick some village lost on the plains where you dont know a soul and go there for the hell of it youd be bored stiff im not bored thinking of it i peered out the window whats the next town coming up on this line rampart junction i smiled sounds good i might get off there youre a liar and a fool what you want adventure romance go ahead jump off the train ten seconds later youll call yourself an idiot grab a taxi and race us to the next town maybe i watched telephone poles flick by flick by flick by far ahead i could see the first faint outlines of a town but i dont think so i heard myself say the salesman across from me looked faindy surprised for slowly very slowly i was rising to stand i reached for my hat i saw my hand fumble for my own suitcase i was surprised myself hold on said the salesman whatre you doing the train rounded a curve suddenly i swayed far ahead i saw one church spire a deep forest a field of summer wheat it looks like im getting off the train i said sit down he said no i said theres something about that town up ahead ive got to go see ive got the time i dont have to be in la really until next monday if i dont get off the train now ill always wonder what i missed what i let slip by when i had the chance to see it we were just talking theres nothing there youre wrong i said there is i put my hat on my head and lifted the suitcase in my hand by god said the salesman i think youre really going to do it my heart beat quickly my face was flushed the train whistled the train rushed down the track the town was near wish me luck i said luck he cried i ran for the porter yelling there was an ancient flakepainted chair tilted back against the stationplatform wall in this chair completely relaxed so he sank into his clothes was a man of some seventy years whose timbers looked as if hed been nailed there since the station was built the sun had burned his face dark and tracked his cheek with lizard folds and stitches that held his eyes in a perpetual squint his hair smoked ashwhite in the summer wind his blue shirt open at the neck to show white clock springs was bleached like the staring late afternoon sky his shoes were blistered as if he had held them uncaring in the mouth of a stove motionless forever his shadow under him was stenciled a permanent black as i stepped down the old mans eyes flicked every door on the train and stopped surprised at me i thought he might wave but there was only a sudden coloring of his secret eyes a chemical change that was recognition yet he had not twitched so much as his mouth an eyelid a finger an invisible bulk had shifted inside him the moving train gave me an excuse to follow it with my eyes there was no one else on the platform no autos waited by the cobwebbed nailedshut office i alone had departed the iron thunder to set foot on the choppy waves of platform lumber the train whistled over the hill fool i thought my fellow passenger had been right i would panic at the boredom i already sensed in this place all right i thought fool yes but run no i walked my suitcase down the platform not looking at the old man as i passed i heard his thin bulk shift again this time so i could hear it his feet were coming down to touch and tap the mushy boards i kept walking afternoon a voice said faintly i knew he did not look at me but only at that great cloudless spread of shimmering sky afternoon i said i started up the dirt road toward the town one hundred yards away i glanced back the old man still seated there stared at the sun as if posing a question i hurried on i moved through the dreaming late afternoon town utterly anonymous and alone a trout going upstream not touching the banks of a clearrunning river of life that drifted all about me my suspicions were confirmed it was a town where nothing happened where occurred only the following events at four oclock sharp the honneger hardware door slammed as a dog came out to dust himself in the road fourthirty a straw sucked emptily at the bottom of a soda glass making a sound like a great cataract in the drugstore silence five oclock boys and pebbles plunged in the town river fivefifteen ants paraded in the slanting light under some elm trees and yet i turned in a slow circle somewhere in this town there must be something worth seeing i knew it was there i knew i had to keep walking and looking i knew i would find it i walked i looked all through the afternoon there was only one constant and unchanging factor the old man in the bleached blue pants and shirt was never far away when i sat in the drugstore he was out front spitting tobacco that rolled itself into tumblebugs in the dust when i stood by the river be was crouched downstream making a great thing of washing his hands along about seventhirty in the evening i was walking for the seventh or eighth time through the quiet streets when i heard footsteps beside me i looked over and the old man was pacing me looking straight ahead a piece of dried grass in his stained teeth its been a long time he said quietly we walked along in the twilight a long time he said waitin on that station platform you i said me he nodded in the tree shadows were you waiting for someone at the station yes he said you me the surprise must have shown in my voice but why you never saw me before in your life did i say i did i just said i was waitin we were on the edge of town now he had turned and i had turned with him along the darkening riverbank toward the trestle where the night trains ran over going east going west but stopping rare few times you want to know anything about me i asked suddenly you the sheriff no not the sheriff and no i dont want to know nothing about you he put his hands in his pockets the sun was set now the air was suddenly cool im just surprised youre here at last is all surprised surprised he said and pleased i stopped abruptly and looked straight at him how long have you been sitting on that station platform twenty years give or take a few i knew he was telling the truth his voice was as easy and quiet as the river waiting for me i said or someone like you he said we walked on in the growing dark how you like our town nice quiet i said nice quiet he nodded like the people people look nice and quiet they are he said nice quiet i was ready to turn back but the old man kept talking and in order to listen and be polite i had to walk with him in the vaster darkness the tides of field and meadow beyond town yes said the old man the day i retired twenty years ago i sat down on that station platform and there i been sittin doin nothin waitin for something to happen i didnt know what i didnt know i couldnt say but when it finally happened id know it id look at it and say yes sir thats what i was waitin for train wreck no old woman friend come back to town after fifty years no no its hard to say someone something and it seems to have something to do with you i wish i could say why dont you try i said the stars were coming out we walked on well he said slowly you know much about your own insides you mean my stomach or you mean psychologically thats the word i mean your head your brain you know much about that the grass whispered under my feet a little you hate many people in your time some we all do its normal enough to hate aint it and not only hate but while we dont talk about it dont we sometimes want to hit people who hurt us even kill them hardly a week passes we dont get that feeling i said and put it away we put away all our lives he said the town says thus and so mom and dad say this and that the law says such and such so you put away one killing and another and two more after that by the time youre my age you got lots of that kind of stuff between your ears and unless you went to war nothin ever happened to get rid of it some men trapshoot or hunt ducks i said some men box or wrestle and some dont im talkin about them that dont me all my life ive been saltin down those bodies puttin em away on ice in my head sometimes you get mad at a town and the people in it for makin you put things aside like that you like the old cave men who just gave a hell of a yell and whanged someone on the head with a club which all leads up to which all leads up to everybodyd like to do one killin in his life to sort of work off that big load of stuff all those killins in his mind he never did have the guts to do and once in a while a man has a chance someone runs in front of his car and he forgets the brakes and keeps goin nobody can prove nothin with that sort of thing the man dont even tell himself he did it he just didnt get his foot on the brake in time but you know and i know what really happened dont we yes i said the town was far away now we moved over a small stream on a wooden bridge just near the railway embankment now said the old man looking at the water the only kind of killin worth doin is the one where nobody can guess who did it or why they did it or who they did it to right well i got this idea maybe twenty years ago i dont think about it every day or every week sometimes months go by but the ideas this only one train stops here each day sometimes not even that now if you wanted to kill someone youd have to wait wouldnt you for years and years until a complete and actual stranger came to your town a stranger who got off the train for no reason a man nobody knows and who dont know nobody in the town then and only then i thought sittin there on the station chair you could just go up and when nobodys around kill him and throw him in the river hed be found miles downstream maybe hed never be found nobody would ever think to come to rampart junction to find him he wasnt goin there he was on his way someplace else there thats my whole idea and id know that man the minute he got off the train know him just as clear i had stopped walking it was dark the moon would not be up for an hour would you i said yes he said i saw the motion of his head looking at the stars well ive talked enough he sidled close and touched my elbow his hand was feverish as if he had held it to a stove before touching me his other hand his right hand was hidden tight and bunched in his pocket ive talked enough something screamed i jerked my head above a fast flying night express razored along the unseen tracks flourished light on hill forest farm town dwellings field ditch meadow plowed earth and water then raving high cut off away shrieking gone the rails trembled for a little while after that then silence the old man and i stood looking at each other in the dark his left hand was still holding my elbow his other hand was still hidden may i say something i said at last the old man nodded about myself i said i had to stop i could hardly breathe i forced myself to go on its funny ive often thought the same way as you sure just today going crosscountry i thought how perfect how perfect how really perfect it could be business has been bad for me lately wife sick good friend died last week war in the world full of boils myself it would do me a world of good what the old man said his hand on my arm to get off this train in a small town i said where nobody knows me with this gun under my arm and find someone and kill them and bury them and go back down to the station and get on and go home and nobody the wiser and nobody ever to know who did it ever perfect i thought a perfect crime and i got off the train we stood there in the dark for another minute staring at each other perhaps we were listening to each others hearts beating very fast very fast indeed the world turned under me i clenched my fists i wanted to fall i wanted to scream like the train for suddenly i saw that all the things i had just said were not lies put forth to save my life all the things i had just said to this man were true and now i knew why i had stepped from the train and walked up through this town i knew what i had been looking for i heard the old man breathing hard and fast his hand was tight on my arm as if he might fall his teeth were clenched he leaned toward me as i leaned toward him there was a terrible silent moment of immense strain as before an explosion he forced himself to speak at last it was the voice of a man crushed by a monstrous burden how do i know you got a gun under your arm you dont know my voice was blurred you cant be sure he waited i thought he was going to faint thats how it is he said thats how it is i said he shut his eyes tight he shut his mouth tight after another five seconds very slowly heavily he managed to take his hand away from my own immensely heavy arm he looked down at his right hand then and took it empty out of his pocket slowly with great weight we turned away from each other and started walking blind completely blind in the dark the midnight passengertobepickedup flare sputtered on the tracks only when the train was pulling out of the station did i lean from the open pullman door and look back the old man was seated there with his chair tilted against the station wall with his faded blue pants and shirt and his sunbaked face and his sunbleached eyes he did not glance at me as the train slid past he was gazing east along the empty rails where tomorrow or the next day or the day after the day after that a train some train any train might fly by here might slow might stop his face was fixed his eyes were blindly frozen toward the east he looked a hundred years old the train wailed suddenly old myself i leaned out squinting now the darkness that had brought us together stood between the old man the station the town the forest were lost in the night for an hour i stood in the roaring blast staring back at all that darkness
