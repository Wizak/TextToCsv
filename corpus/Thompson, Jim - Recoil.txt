recoil by jim thompson copyright doc luther quietly he tested the door of lilas bedroom and saw that it was locked and then he went into his own room leaving the door open to hear any movement of hers and opened his briefcase he took the insurance policies from the briefcase scanned them perfunctorily and slipped them into his inside coat pocket they would go into the safety deposit box tomorrow he dipped into the briefcase again and drew out other papers he studied them frowning with much of the disturbing feeling that he had for the insurance policies with a grunt of irritation he shuffled them into a kind of chronological order and began to read sandstone state reformatory luther psychological clinic capital lee sts capital city gentlemen this is a rather unusual application for employment i hope you will read it to the end and give it your earnest consideration i am thirtythree years old a high school graduate and through reading and study possess the equivalent of at least two years of college i weigh one hundred and seventy pounds and am five feet eleven inches tall despite serious handicaps i have kept myself in good physical condition i am not familiar with your business and do not know what type of job you might have at your disposal but i will welcome the chance for any kind of work within the state and at whatever wage you care to pay for the past fifteen years i have been an inmate of this institution serving a sentence of ten years to life for bank robbery the crime was not one to be taken lightly and have not but in all humility cannot see that any good purpose is served in detaining me here longer i became eligible for parole approximately five years ago unfortunately my parents had died and my only other relative a married sister was not and is not in a position to act in my behalf i was of course too young to have formed business associations at the time of my commitment as you doubtless know a prospective parolee must have a job before he can be released he must establish his ability to support himself i am asking that you help me to do this may i please hear from you on second thought will you simply take action on my case with the parole board in the normal way of an interested party for an inmate you can find out anything you wish to know about me from the board and this will obviate any misunderstanding that might arise here from my writing you very truly yours patrick m cosgrove librarian sandstone state reformatory sandstone luther thought hed become accustomed to rottenness yet sandstone never failed to outrage him it wasnt a prison it was a madhouse in which the keeper and not the inmates was mad there was only one way to survive there to become tougher and more tortuousminded than that keeper if you did that if you amused the man with the preternaturally brilliant eyes and the unpredictable laughter you not only survived but did so in comparative comfort but there could be no letting down you might tire of the game but the man never did and when you tired or became careless sandstone state reformatory office of the warden dr roland luther capital lee sts capital city in re pat airplane red cosgrove dear doc sure was good to hear from you and wish i was right there in the big town with you i always say you was one perfect host and know how to entertain a man and that was sure some time the last time me and you and them other fellows got together well i was pretty hot when i got your letter and i was going to go right in and give that sob something to think about but since you ask otherwise why thats the way it is and hands off and anyway i could not help laughing when i got to thinking about it you know the chief my secretary well i know chief got that letter and probly a hundred others out for him but just try and make them say so i bet we could hang them both and they wouldnt i am a great admirer of loyalty and mind your business and know you are too so you fix things up anyway you want but let me know how and i will play with you as far as i can just give me a ring when you are coming i will close now as i am writing this myself instead of that sob chief and we will give them both a hell of a surprise yr obdt frnd servt yancey fish ps doc you know it is against the rules to bring whiskey into the prison and if i find a case or two on you i will have to confiskate it ha ha yf well fish hadnt hanged them but he had threatened them with everything else and while each had faced the harangue in his own way the results had been identical the chief a fullblooded indian serving three life sentences had merely grinned insolently and made noncommittal replies the redhaired blueeyed cosgrove had talked at length polite mildly humorous insistently grammatical and without saying anything he would not turn on the man the chief who had obviously helped him no threat or bribe could make him he luther had been a little troubled by cosgroves patent intelligence but still he fitted specifications in every other detail and he would be given nothing for that intelligence to work on office of the governor to yancey l fish warden sandstone state reformatory greetings whereas it appears you now have in your keeping one patrick m cosgrove and whereas the said patrick m cosgrove has served fifteen years of an indeterminate sentence and has met certain other conditions by which he becomes eligible for parole and whereas one roland t luther phd a citizen in good standing has guaranteed employment for the said patrick m cosgrove during the two years succeeding the date of this instrument pledging moreover that he will in every way assist the said cosgrove to a righteous manner of living therefore let it be known that patrick m cosgrove is hereby paroled in the custody of roland t luther for a period of two years or until and or unless it should become necessary to remand the said cosgrove to his present place of incarceration let it further be known that upon satisfactory completion of the aforementioned term of parole the said patrick m cosgrove is to be restored to full citizenship and all rights and privileges accruing thereto witness our hand and seal louis clements clay governor and president board of parole well there it was the beginning and the end of everything and now that he had examined it item by item he could not dispel the thought that it was both foolish and dangerous if hardesty had not been positive that it would work but hardesty had been positive he was certain that under the circumstances they were creating the insurance companies would have to pay and pay promptly that was hardestys best legal advice and hardesty had never yet been wrong about a legal matter well luther sighed and began to undress it was done now he wished that cosgrove wasnt such a likeable person but that unfortunately or otherwise was necessary there had to be some reason for getting him out of sandstone he heard lilas door open and he paused in the act of removing a shoe she stopped in the hail her fur coat over her arm couldnt sleep eh he said well i trust youve got something arranged its a little late at night for a pickup she smiled weakly apologetically after all doc i am human interesting he said letting the shoe drop to the floor an interesting if debatable statement you you dont mind my going out i dont care what you do i need some money doc ill get it for you in the morning i could take a check you he said can do exactly what youre told exactly do you understand i understand she said slowly perfectly cosgrove it is five oclock in the morning of my second day here and i have been lying awake since one excited and happy i suppose i suppose that beneath this bleached mask which does duty as a face i am still shouting with wonder and delight but a man can only enjoy so much and then comes sleep i wish i had taken nothing to drink on the way here yesterday i am positive almost that i said and did nothing out of the way and yet of course i cannot be absolutely positive i had nodded agreeably when he explained he never drank while driving and i expressed my gratitude for his understanding of my need to forget i drank without urging and when about a third of the pint was gone the questions began why had i chosen him to write to that was simple the only periodicals we received in the prison were bragbookscontrolled circulation publications issued for the purpose of squeezing money from individuals and firms who were doing or hoped to do business with the politicians in power i had got his address from a complimentary advertisement in one of these i had obtained the address of everyone else i appealed to in the same way did i understand why he had put me through that rigamarole with warden fish i was not prepared to question his actions i said but i believed i understood he demanded absolute loyalty from his associates he would have no use for a man who would abandon loyalty for expediency did i have any close relatives or friends no i had a married sister who wrote me a brief note each christmas at her request i did not reply our only tie was the accident of birth what had i read everything in the prison library contributions to which seemed to have stopped about all of shakespeare dickens swift twain addison and steele rabelais schopenhauer marx scottjules verne wilde cervantes machiavelli the rover boy series lewis carroll the bible the as i talked i adjusted the windwing on the window next to me until i picked up dr luthers reflection in its nickeled frame he seemed well pleased with my replies although due to three slightly protruding upper teeth the mere relaxation of his features sometimes gives him the appearance of smiling he is about fifty i should judge but here again it is hard to be certain his hair is thin and sandy he is considerably overweight for his height which is something less than mine his eyes bulge behind thicklensed glasses add to that a soft voice which switches abruptly from the grammatical and precise to the slangy and vulgar and you have a man whose age like himself is no matter for hasty estimation i went on talking and watching him as the miles sped by knowing that my words were becoming blurred knowing then not knowing when i awakened hours later we were only about ten miles from the city and the car was turning into a roadhouse near the edge of a large lake the establishment had apparently been pretty swank at one time but that had been a long while ago it was gone to seed now we were the only patrons looking through the window i could see why what i thought was a lake was actually a river a broad sluggishly moving expanse of greasy sludge and mud and water the waste from the citys oil field despite the tightly closed windows and the airconditioning system there was a faint and unpleasant smell of sulphur a little present from the oil companies he said with a sudden sour laugh theyve taken a billion dollars out of this field and theyre taking more every day but they cant afford to dispose of their sludge i didnt say anything and he laughed again the same way staring down at his almost untouched food i should talk he said harshly pat im going to lay my cards on the table play straight tell you something youd find out in the next twentyfour hours anyway yes sir call me doc everyone does all right doc im a qualified psychologist but havent practiced in years i cant give you a job at the clinic because i havent any its just a front for my lobbying grafting in plain english i gave him a straight steady look you got me out of sandstone doc i said thats all i need to know about you well im not apologizing of course hell they didnt call this state the heart of balkan america for nothing when its a choice of eat or be eaten whats a sensible man to do eat i said he chuckled and made a feinting motion at my chin with his fist youll do pat now what i had in mind for you was a job with the state something that wont require any training how would that suit you anything you do will suit me fine i said but yes how can i be of any use to you if i dont work for you why should you have to be of any use to me his voice was an angry snarl isnt it conceivable that i might want to help you unselfishly give you a break when no one else would i didnt mean to offend you i said i merely hoped to do something in return for what youve done for me well skip it he said maybe we ought to be getting out of here later than i thought it was he drove slowly glancing out at the curving river of mud which except for its smell was gradually being lost in the darkness we passed through the business district through part of the residential section and reached the state capital its grounds as you may know occupy a square mile on the outskirts of the city the last level land in that neighborhood doc took a street to the south one leading up a canyon and after about a mile turned in at a house which sat in a cutback against a hillside it was a rather oldfashioned twostory squarebuilt house with a long veranda across the front except for the ivyclad trellises which practically concealed the windows it seemed out of place in that setting doc drove the car down the driveway and parked it in the one empty stall in the fourstall garage a couple a sports roadster and another sedan all late models occupied the others we walked back down the driveway and around to the front door it was standing open and the lights were on there was a hall with rooms on each side leading straight back to the rear glancing up the stairs i saw that the second floor was arranged the same way doc motioned me to follow him up the stairs upstairs we stopped in front of the first door on his right doc lifted his hand music seeped out to us faintly and i could hear a man talking in a quiet hoarse voice and a womans light laugh doc tapped softly the talking and the laughter ceased then there was a rustling and the click of a door closing whos there doc oh the hoarse voice had an undertone of annoyance a key turned in the lock and the door was thrown open the man was about fifty short rather fat not dissimilar to doc in physique despite his tousled hair his drinkflushed face and the pajamas he was wearing he looked pompous he ignored doc and scowled at me who the hell are you he demanded this is the young man from sandstone said dr luther pat i want you to meet senator burkman the senator was very helpful in getting your release burkman widened his eyes exaggeratedly and poked a stubby finger at my chest the hell he is he wheezed you cant kid me hes a fugitive from a country sunday school thats what he is doc gave him a very thin smile perhaps no smile at all those overhung upper teeth were deceptive well said the senator seizing my hand pat pat cosgrove isnt it glad i could be of service to you sorry i couldnt have met you under more auspicious circumstances he laughed and gave my shoulder a pat i hope i didnt disturb you said doc i was afraid you might leave before i had a chance to see you pat needs a job i thought you were going to give him a job ive done enough im sorry you feel that way said doc i wonder if there isnt something i could say to change your mind he stared at burkman thoughtfully the three protruding teeth resting on his lower lip and burkman reddened id like to doc its just that i need every job ive got for my own district ive got a tight race coming up man why not try flanders or dorsey or milligan they have tight races too well burkman hesitated scowling oh hell ill dolt send him around to the highway commission tomorrow shall i mention your name to fleming yes no ill talk to him myself he closed the door quickly as if he was afraid of being asked for something else doc and i went back down the stairs he picked up his hat from the bench inserted a key in the door next to the entrance and waved me inside dear he called oh lila then leaving me standing he strode into the adjoining room and through the rest of the apartment i looked around to my mind the room was a little too crowded to be in good taste there were wellfilled bookcases a piano and a combination radiophonographtelevision set there was a long window seat at the front a longer divan at the opposite side of the room a chaise longue and three overstuffed chairs in the approximate center of the room was a mirrored coffee table with a builtin flower pot doc returned slamming the connecting door mrs luther isnt around he said harshly not i suppose that i really expected her to be well a knock on the outer door interrupted him he flung it open and where he demanded of the whitejacketed negro before him have you been with the north suite party sir the negro a slender cleanfeatured youth smiled placatingly one of the gentlemen was a little ill mrs luther leave any message for me no sir huh said doc i suppose you have that south rear room ready or did you forget about it i believe its ready sir i mean to say come along you too pat we went down the hail doc striding ahead and the negro and i following at the last door to the right the negro stepped swiftly to the front took a brasstagged key from his pocket and turned the lock he snapped on the light and doc brushed past him it was a room such as you might find in any firstclass hotel the few touches of individuality consisted of a small twobottle bar with the bottles a cigarette humidor on a revolving stand with three kinds of cigarettes and a magazine rack with a variety of magazines doc switched on the bathroom light and turned on the negro again everything all ready eh he said what about pajamas tooth brush comb shaving articles what about socks and underwear and shirts all that stuff i told you to get i have them sir everything i just havent had time to well get on it and get that telephone out of here i doc shot me a look of curt apology i didnt think youd want one pat not at all i said he slumped down into a chair and let his head loll back he removed his glasses and began wiping them thoughtfully i felt sorry and embarrassed for him it is always a little saddening to see a man upset over a woman who obviously cares nothing about his feelings the negro unplugged the handset telephone and went out he returned in a minute or two and began stowing various articles away in the chest of drawers and in the bathroom doc had him fix us a drink when he had finished im pretty tired tonight willie he said as he took the glass from the youths hand im sorry if i was abrupt thats quite all right doctor if mrs luther should return within the next hour please tell her im back here yes sir the negro left closing the door noiselessly doc motioned with his glass well pat think you can struggle along in here i dont know about that i said you know how it is at sandstone the best of everything and the guest is always right he smiled and i told him it wasnt necessary to put himself out so much on my account i could hole up anywhere and id be just as grateful to him forget it pat he said i havent anything simplier than this at any rate i dont feel inclined to discriminate against my one deserving guest what did you think of the senator im not forming any opinions i said for the next two years at least i intend to borrow them from you i gather that you mean exactly that i do he swished the whiskey around in his glass staring down into it i hope very much pat that everything goes all right frankly youre considerably different from what id imagined youd be i didnt think that i could develop such a strong personal interest in a well bank robber i didnt work at the trade long doc of course im glad i have he went on but what im trying to say is id take it much harder than i thought i would if anything unpleasant should happen to you unpleasant i said about your parole he said with a haste i could not understand i suppose you know it wasnt strictly on the level i swallowed hard you mean theres some danger that now dont get excited ijust thought id warn you that we are in a little hell when we face myrtle briscoe tomorrow morning you know who she is the state commissioner of corrections also the head of the parole board i know i said i hope myrtle would let you rot in hell before shed parole you to me or any of my connections willingly but myrtle necessarily is sometimes absent from the capital and legally the governor then becomes acting commissioner hes legally the head of every department during the absence of its nominal head but hes not supposed to use that power not except in emergencies which i cant conceive as arising its a serious abridgement of democratic principles myrtles elected god knows how many times incidentally because the people like what she stands for the governor whos only in office to get as much as he can gives them something else what i swallowed again what can she do doc i dont want to get you in an uproar pat you seemed like such a coolheaded guy i thought i could discuss things with you you can i said ill keep my sandstone shakes to myself well theres nothing she can do nothing she will do oh of course she could go to the newspapers and throw her weight around generally but the object lesson shed give us wouldnt be worth the trouble youre out now her tactic will be to take advantage of the fact how can she do that more ways than i care to think about he yawned and eased himself from his chair thats my department though well hear some of them in the morning when we pay our courtesy call cant we do we have to see her i said oh yes any kind of delay would be very dangerous moreover i imagine youll have to see her every month during the term of your parole i dont think shed trust a case like you to a runofthemill probation officer well i said forewarned forearmed he chuckled and moved toward the door thats better im glad to see i was right about you a worrier could be very annoying i understand i said ill try not to bother you well dont get corked up youll need a lot of help in getting squared away and im glad to give it i just dont want you upsetting yourself and me with senseless fretting we said goodnight i began to undress wondering what made him tick and why the ticks were as they were it settled down to who he really was the threatening coldeyed man who had bullied burkman or the man who had been angry over the pollution of a river and ashamed of being part of the general pattern of pollution whichever was the case one thing was certain he was a considerable improvement over warden fish whatever happened to me nothing could be worse than being back in sandstone i would be better off dead than there i went to sleep on that thought the little alarm clock at my bedside went off at seven and after i had showered and was shaving another whitejacketed negro wheeled in a breakfast cart he introduced himself as henry and made a polite but reserved mention of the fact that he was willies brother he was in and out of the room in five minutes including the time it took to remove the silver covers from the dishes fill my cup with coffee and prop a morning paper against the pot i slipped into my clothes and sat down at the table docs cook apparently was as topnotch as his other servants there were tiny hot biscuits sectioned grapefruit packed in shaved ice oatmeal cooked so that each flake was separate from the others and a golden and puffy bacon omelet that was almost light enough to float doc had me drive his sedan into town i was a little reluctant to try it but he insisted and it was easy enough after i got used to the steeringwheel gear shift i hadnt been in capital city since my senior year in high school at that time it had been a big sprawling town with a great many parks clean wide streets and modest comfortable appearing homes now the streets were jammed and dirty two and sometimes three shacks stood on a lot once occupied by a single neat cottage and the parks were islands of oil well derricks surrounded by barbedwire fences there were fine homes certainly some of them occupying an entire block with their wide wellkept lawns but they pointed up rather than detracted from the general picture of decay and squalor i put the car on a parking lot doc directed me to and we sat there several minutes while he turned through the paper at last he folded it carelessly tossed it into the back seat and took out his wallet heres forty dollars pat itll give you something to rattle until payday i i know youre grateful and you hope to show your appreciation and if i see an opportunity for you to do so for this or any other favor past or impending ill let you know anything else i was going to thank you i said but i guess id better not you just have now lets see about some clothes we crossed the street and walked up to the corner where he led me to the entrance of a store a tall grayhaired man in a black coat and striped pants strolled out to us ah doctor he said i hope were to be allowed to serve you in some way doc shook hands with him indifferently i think ill let you take care of my friend he said this is mr cosgrove williams it will be a pleasure williams beamed giving my hand a tender shake he didnt seem to notice my clothes mr cosgrove has been ill for a long time doc went on hell need a complete outfitting but we have an appointment within the hour can you fix him up in something casual immediately and get his measurements for a couple of suits and whatever he needs in the way of accessories send it out to the house later certainly said williams well be very prompt with mr cosgrove now if i may show you inside doc hesitated a moment studying a tweed sports coat he half turned and started to enter the store then he glanced across the street he stiffened i wont be able to go in he said quickly meet me at the car when youre through pat williams im putting mr cosgrove in your hands thank you doctor hell use my account of course doctor if you please mr cosgrove doc swung off across the street moving in quick angry strides i let williams lead me into the store the next thirty minutes were like a comedy shoes were being slid on and off my feet while my shoulders were draped and undraped with coats i tried on trousers while hats were being placed on my head a swarm of frockcoated salesmen moved around me with coats pants ties and shirts hats and shoes and williams said quite and exactly and im afraid not then they were all gone except williams and a clerk who was fitting a linen handkerchief into my breast pocket while williams turned me toward a threeview mirror i dont see how you did it i said at last and it is hard to say who felt the better about it they or i williams escorted me to the entrance and we shook hands again i crossed the street to the parking lot it had filled up considerably by this time and there were cars on both sides of docs i didnt know there was anyone with him until i was almost behind the sedan then the door slammed and i heard the other man curse youre being a fool he said youll spoil everything with your damned jealousy dont give me cause to be jealous then doc snarled shes my wife youd better remember that ive told you it was simply business business or not to hell with you try pulling something and see how far you get the man came bounding out of the lane between the two cars head down blind with rage i bumped into him bringing my heel down on his instep when he doubled i let him have a touch of elbow across the windpipe i had to grab him then to keep him from keeling over he was a handsome fortyish sort dark keeneyed bold looking i could see why mrs luther might like him i felt an instinctive almost unwilling liking for him myself id given him a jolt but after one murderous glance he was trying to grin doc got out and helped hold him up and he looked at me as though he wasnt too wellpleased are you all right bill he said can i do something the man shook his head just just give me a second ill come out of it you shouldnt have done that pat said doc it was entirely unnecessary im sorry i said it was an accident well it might have been very serious from what i saw oh stop bawling him out the man straightened up and spoke in a normal tone pat thought you were in trouble and tried to help you now cut out the scolding and introduce me of course said doc mr hardesty pat cosgrove mr hardesty is an attorney pat he was instrumental in obtaining your release from sandstone another one i thought how many how much why and i was glad to have the chance hardesty wrung my hand they gave you a mighty raw deal son im glad to see you came through it so well thank you very much i said my pleasure entirely i like the cut of your jib pat i like to see a man who sticks up for his friends his warm dark eyes traveled over me admiringly he looks like a million dollars doesnt he doc pat and i have got to be going said doc weve got to see the commissioner of corrections about pats parole mad myrtle huh hardesty chuckled cant say that i envy you if she gives you too much trouble i think i can handle her said doc if you cant she cant be handled hardesty agreed he grinned nodded to me and strolled away whistling i crawled in at docs side and headed the car toward the capitol he was silent for several blocks seemingly absorbed in his newspaper finally he repeated an action that was to become familiar to me folded and tossed the newspaper over his shoulder and spoke what did you hear of my conversation with hardesty not very much i said i asked you what you heard well i heard you tell him to keep away from mrs luther and he swore and said you were just jealous doc turned in the seat and i felt the full power of the gaze that raged out through the thicklensed glasses yet something something i implausibly sensed as fear held back the explosion perhaps i didnt make myself clear pat he said softly youve got an excellent memory ive tested it on several occasions now give me a word for word account of what you heard i did it i repeated it word for word and what do you make of that pat any questions youd like to ask i dont make anything of it i said i havent any questions doc settled back in the seat he laughed quietly hardestys a nice fellow he said but hes a little too quick to fly off the handle you rather cooled him off im sorry about that i said i thought you might want him so i tried to stop him for you and i appreciated it he put his hand on my knee for a moment however it wasnt necessary as you know now hardesty and i are actually pretty good friends he went on mrs luther fell heir to a small estate some time ago and hes been handling it for her hes the kind of man that cant talk to anyone male or female without getting personal and i should have known he didnt mean anything by his attitude toward mrs luther but im afraid im not very reasonable where shes concerned i understand well lets forget it he said you did an excellent job on your clothing pat i had to look twice to recognize you williams should get the credit for that i said ill give it to him he smiled at me in the mirror ill also give him credit for the bill just in case you were worrying about it its nice to hear you say so i said dont give it another thought he said well here we are i parked in one of the drives on the capitol grounds proper and we walked across a stretch of lawn and started up the marble steps of the main entrance we pushed our way through the crowded corridors doc speaking and being spoken to occasionally and took a jerkilymoving elevator to the fourth and top floor renegades roost doc whispered as we stepped off the car we turned off the central corridor and wound through a series of narrow hallways just when i was beginning to believe doc was lost we came to a door marked department of corrections myrtle briscoe commissioner doc threw away his cigarette and removed his hat mine was already in my hand he gave his tie a final pat straightened his shoulders and opened the door a hatchetfaced girl with greasy hair and hornrimmed glasses was pecking away at a typewriter she looked up when we came in started to smile and made a point of changing her mind the nostrils of her oily nose quivered well she said how do you do said doc will you please tell miss briscoe that dr luther and mr cosgrove are here i certainly will snapped the girl and how she got up walked over to a door marked private and knocked she opened it and stuck her head inside miss briscoe doctor luther and mister cosgrove are here to a roar cut her off so he showed up did he well lock the vault and send him in send em both in the girl turned flushed smiling meanly come right in gentlemen we went in and the girl closed the door behind us i imagine every convict and exconvict in the country has heard of myrtle briscoe shed held an elective office in a politicians graveyard for thirty years and remained honest she was about five feet tall including the red discolored topknot of her hair she wore a white shirtwaist with a high collar hightopped button shoes and a skirt that resembled a horse blanket she stood up as we entered but she didnt offer to shake hands sit down there she snapped no no keep your chairs together i want you birds where i can watch you doc said really miss briscoe is that shut up she bellowed shut your big bazoo and keep it shut until i tell you to open it cosgrove where did you get those clothes you look like a pawnshop salesman miss briscoe said doc i will not tolerate will you shut up cosgrove doctor luther bought them for me why its too cold to go without any i said and the state fund for buying them seems to be exhausted so she leaned back in her chair eyes glinting any idea why it is exhausted no maam i said but ive been in prison for fifteen years she chuckled sourly all right young cosgrove i stepped into that one now im going to tell you the secret behind that nonexistent state fund im going to tell you why you dont have any money to buy books at sandstone why the food is slop why this one of the richest states in the union has become a begger among the other commonwealths im sorry miss briscoe i said i didnt mean its because were eaten up by rats rats do you understand thats the only name for them and i dont give a damn how nicely they dress and talk or how generous generous hell they are to people who play along with em who else but rats would foist inferior textbooks upon children force an entire generation to grow up in ignorance who else would take money at the cost of leaving dangerous highways unrepaired who else would build firetraps for helpless old men and women who else would place two thousand men in the care of a maniac to be starved and tortured yes and killed well what do you say cosgrove you of all people ought to agree with me i read the brookings institution report i said oh you did well well but what did you do when my investigators were there at sandstone did you talk to them tell them exactly what you were up against no maam i said no youre damned right you didnt you expect one woman with the lowest budget of but i know some that did talk i said oh she said flatly and for a full minute she was silent then she sighed scowled and looked at doc doctor why wasnt the application for cosgroves parole made in the usual way i uh doc hesitated drawing his lip down over the protruding teeth senator burkman thought that senator burkman never had a thought in his life and you can tell him i said so you were confident i wouldnt parole anyone to you werent you oh dont bother to answer where will cosgrove be employed in that brothel of yours miss briscoe said doc dangerously i dont care for your language woof woof myrtle briscoe grinned well i plan on getting him a job with the state of course hes technically in my employ until i know i know the routine and you cosgrove youre willing to be another hog at the public trough i smiled at her and she grimaced wryly foolish question huh doc give you any reason for all this dough hes blowing on you whatever is spent on me i said i intend to pay back how she spoke as though doc were not in the room any idea what a caper of this kind costs red hardesty was in on it so was burkman so were the several legislators he horsetraded into bringing pressure on the governor miss briscoe doc if you dont shut up ill put you out of the office so thats your picture red or most of it i dont mean that doc spent much actual cash in getting you out what he and his crowd spent were pledges they tacitly cancelled certain favors owing them and obligated themselves for others they used up a lot of their steam steam they could use right now now why do you think they did that red i know why i said but id prefer that doc explained it to you smart she said eyes narrowed can you cook too miss briscoe said doc i want you to believe i helped pat for just one reason because he needed help and deserved it and i was in a position to give it i know you want me to believe that pat served fifteen years for a robbery in which nothing was lost and no one was hurt he served it not because he was a criminal but because he wasnt he should never have been sent to anything but a juvenile correctional institution youre right there said miss briscoe grudgingly pat stayed on in sandstone five years after he was eligible for parole ten years would have been a terrible punishment but he stayed five years more he could have spent his whole life there solely because he had no friends or money and you got him out solely out of the goodness of your heart put it this way said doc slowly ive ive made a lot of mistakes maybe this will help wipe some of them out myrtle briscoe stared at him elbows on her desk hands under her chin dammit doc id like to believe that its the truth maybe maybe not ive lived so much of my life surrounded by crooks that she broke off pat red sandstone isnt a very nice place is it suppose i said yes i said or no never mind but theres more than one kind of prison red they dont all have walls around them i know i said i worked in the library miss briscoe well i hope you learned something youve had a bad time i hope youre not in for something worse not that it makes much difference im like everyone else i have to play ball doc knew i would didnt you doc i hoped for your cooperation certainly miss briscoe ill play this time but dont get in a rut doc theres an election coming up and im pretty sick of trying to clean house with a whiskbroom myrtle briscoe came around the desk and gripped me by both arms and looked up into my face i was kidding about the clothes she said you look good and youre going to have to be good hard as it may be and even if we both think its nonsense you know what i mean no drunks no wild women no rough stuff thats what the books say thats what i say as long as they say it yes maam i said maybe she said maybe oh get the hell out of here there was a restaurant in the basement of the capitol and doc and i ate lunch there neither of us was very hungry and we had only a salad rolls and a bottle of ale each several people stopped by our table there was a senator flanders with a man who as nearly as i could make out was a textbook salesman there was a commissioner of somethingorother whose name i didnt catch another senator named kronup several people i saw them all later from time to time around docs house burkman came in just as we were finishing the ale and took a chair at our table there were pouches under his eyes and his voice was even more hoarse than it had been the night before doc told him about myrtle briscoe myrtle dropped a hint about not running next time a threat rather nonsense i happen to know shes already lining up her campaign material anyway she doesnt need to run shed get a big enough writein vote to be elected burkman cursed itd be about like the old bitch to pull something like that were going to have to baby her along a little bit doc get her some better offices let her have another investigator it might not be a bad idea youd better tour around with me this afternoon doc i want you to tell the governor burkman paused looking from me to doc i meant to tell you pat i got that job for you drop around to the highway commission tomorrow morning and ask for mr fleming thank you very much i said about what time senator oh suit yourself some time in the forenoon what does it pay doc asked two and a half best i could do right now doc shrugged it could be worse what about it pat do you think you can accept a job at two hundred and fifty a month im very grateful i said i only hope ill be able to do the work burkmans eyes widened then he leaned back and roared with laughter doc chuckled the job wont be too difficult he said pointedly reaching for our check im going to be tied up for the next couple of hours is there anything youd like to do why nothing in particular i said i wouldnt mind strolling around the building thats a good idea give the people a chance to see what the welldressed man is wearing come back here and have something more to eat or drink if you like i think ill just walk around i said where shall i meet you oh he glanced at his watch make it the front entrance i said id be there shook hands with the senator and left it took me almost an hour to find the state historical museum most of the cases and cabinets were empty tacked on the front of them were small ageyellowed signs exhibit on temporary loan i went from the museum to the state library closed for repairs then since my time was running short i located the highway commission offices and went out to the entrance to wait for doc i was leaning against the stone balustrade and starting to light a cigarette when she came out i dislike trying to describe her because the physical facts of a person so seldom add up to what that person really is she was no youngster every line of her full but compact body spoke the mature woman and she made no attempt to appear one superficial facts to the contrary she was just herself a forever young and gay self and i could not picture her as acting or dressing in any other way than she did she wore a plain blue dress with a white collar and a little white belt tied in the back she wore lowheeled shoes and i think her firm round legs were bare she had a black straw hat with a saucerlike brim which was slung over her arm by its elastic band her crisp brown hair was pulled back in a single thick curl barely reaching to her shoulders and tied with a tiny white ribbon she stood at the top of the steps for a minute breathing deeply happily her brown eyes and her small straight nose her entire face crinkling with good humor she smiled at me without actually seeing me of course impersonally simply because it was a nice day and she was alive and that was good then she went jauntily down the steps the hat swinging over her arm the little belt spanking her gently on her bottom i wanted to run after her ask her name hold her somehow never let her go away and i remembered who i was doc myrtle briscoe sandstone and i could only stand and watch feeling sick and empty lost near the end of the walk she stepped over into the driveway and started down the row of parked cars she stopped at docs big black sedan glanced casually over her shoulder and opened the door i stood where i was for a moment unable or unwilling to believe what i had seen then i went down the steps three at a time i cut across the driveway and ran stooping along the far row of cars i came parallel with docs sedan vaulted silently over a bumper and dropped down behind her she was kneeling on the seat of the car her back well not her back exactly to me she pulled a zipper on the seat cover reached in between the cover and the seat and fumbled for a moment she brought out a long thick brown envelope she put a foot down on the running board and started to back out i was in the way she wiggled a little not realizing that someone was behind her she pushed and i pushed back she looked around then oh she gasped and her mouth dropped open then the crinkled smile returned and she cocked her head on one side now really she said in a teasingscolding tone dont you think you should ask a girl first i backed off a step feeling my face go red im with dr luther i said nodding at the car i saw you take something that envelope nooo her mouth formed an o of exaggerated awe what do people call you you pretty redhaired man my name is cosgrove i said patrick cosgrove and ill take that envelope bet you wont she said instantly her eyes dancing now look miss flournoy madeline flournoy you say that like it should mean something to me i said but it doesnt im afraid i work for doc he sent me after these contracts now is that good enough for you or do you want to wrestle if you work for doc i said you wont mind my walking back with you to where he is i dont mind at all patsy she said promptly but ive made it a lifelong principle never to give in to a redhead im sorry i said ill either have togo with you or have you wait here until doc comes she put the papers and her hat behind her lowered her head and walked right into me she pushed against me and i could hear her teeth gritting i tried to reach around her and grab the papers instead i caught hold of her hat breaking the band that held it to her arm it struck the running board and rolled between us now see what you did she said reproachfully im sorry i said we both reached for it at the same time our heads bumped painfully it gave me a bad jolt and i know it must have hurt her worse her face went momentarily white i said i was sorry again and started to pick up the hat she brought her knee against my chin with a force that almost knocked me out it was instinctive a natural animal reaction to pain what i did was also instinctive i grabbed her by the ankles and jerked upward she sailed through the door of the car open fortunately and landed bouncing on the seat her feet went up in the air and her dress flew over her head just what the hell said dr luther is going on here his hat was jammed low on his sandy hair and there was a fleck of spittle beneath the overhung teeth he pushed me to one side and almost jerked her off the seat what in the name of god is the matter with you madeline he said harshly i sent you after those contracts thirty minutes ago and i waited and waited until my parties gave up and left and then i come out here and find you showing your backside to to was not backside she pouted was underneath side to hell with that stuff youre not a kid youre not being paid kids wages if you cant snap out of it and do your work like youre supposed to ill get someone who will bet you couldnt she said bet you couldnt get any one that knows she stressed the word ever so lightly half as much as i do but dammit he stared at her helplessly swallowing whatever else he had been about to say its my fault doc i said i saw her get those papers out of the car and i jumped to the wrong conclusion and i was nasty to him said madeline in my own peculiar way i can imagine doc said well i guess im as much at fault as anyone id forgotten about pat waiting there at the entrance by the way you two had better meet each other he introduced us casually and opened the door of the car make another copy of those contracts tonight madeline he said and bring them out here in the afternoon same place same time on time i was going to a show tonight go ahead get up early in the morning and work i dont care when you do them well she stood near the door pouting and with her left hand she scrawled an address in the dust on the cars side and wrote noon beneath it well you and mr cosgrove can drive me home then weve something important to do said doc coolly come along pat i rubbed out the writing nodded to her and walked on around the car as i drove away she put her hands behind her and stuck her tongue out at doc that woman he muttered if she wasnt so valuable to me shes your secretary call her that shes actually a great deal more does things that arent ordinarily included in secretarial work she knows well you heard her she knows i see i said theres a perfect example of what being sorry for a person can get you into he went on wearily when i first ran into her i thought she was one of the most pitiable helpless little tykes that ever came out of business college raised by an aunt who kicked her out when she was sixteen i can understand why now worked her way through school as a waitress with all the big bad men insulting her just wanted to work real hard for a nice fatherly man like me who would give her good advice well i laughed appreciatively isnt she a pretty disrupting influence to have around she gets on my nerves plenty yes but shes smart and fast and people like her in spite of themselves they let their guards down around her before they realize shes not half as giddy as she appears to be she excuse me doc i said where did you want to drive to why home i suppose unless youve got some place youd like to go not at all i said i just thought i understood you to say that that was a brushoff i have to use her in my business i dont have to cart her around give her any kind of a personal hold on me incidentally pat yes i said knowing what was coming i want you to keep away from her too i know youre loyal and grateful to me that you wouldnt deliberately do anything that might injure me but its simply a bad idea for two people so close to my affairs to get on an intimate basis you understand pat i wont tolerate it he turned to look at me i nodded emphatically not trusting my voice he said im counting on you i let him out at the front of the house and drove the car on back to the garage then another car the sports roadster id seen the night before swept down the driveway it shot into the stall next to the sedan tires sliding and banged noisily but apparently harmlessly against the rear of the garage a woman got out and came swiftly toward me smiling hand extended she was above average height and slender yet there was a soft billowy look about her her hair was ash blonde and she had the smooth flawless complexion which should but so seldom does accompany it she wore a tailored fawncolored suit with a fox fur scarf around the shoulders briefly she was a very beautiful woman of thirty or thereabouts a little theatrical in her actions but beautiful and absolutely nothing else youre pat cosgrove she announced dipping her hand a little to take hold of mine doctors told me so much about you im lila luther how do you do mrs luther i said i was going to drop in last night and say hello but doctor said you were tired and of course he snatched you away this morning before i got my eyes open well i said do come along she linked her wrist over my arm i want you to show me your room doctor assured me you were made utterly comfortable but naturally he wouldnt know if you werent isnt he a weird man but sweet very sweet i like him i said trying not to make it sound like a reproof and the room is fine i oh well she shrugged of course you would like him not that youre not sincere i could see instantly that you were do you know mr hardesty i like him very much dont you hes such a smooth earnest man so uh so unweird she chattered incessantly as we went up the driveway and around the walk to the house apparently so intrigued with the sound of her own voice that my tense silence went unnoticed at the door of her apartment hers and docs she rapped briskly and called doctor ill be with mr cosgrove for a few minutes then without waiting for a reply she urged me down the hall her long soft thigh brushing against mine i unlocked the door of my room and pushed it open for her she took my arm and we went in together well she said glancing around critically they havent done too badly by you its far better than anything ive had i said theres really nothing i need mrs luther nothing at all she gave my arm a sly squeeze well i do i need a drink mrs luther i said do do you what she raised one delicate glossy eyebrow oh some of that bourbon will be all right with just a little water please i nodded and went over to the bar hearing the door ease shut almost the moment my back was turned doc would resent my ordering her out no matter what he might think about her himself he would resent anyone elses implication that she was less than she could be i could only hope he would not let jealousy get the better of his common sense surely he must realize that i would not play loose with his wife i mixed the drink and brought it over to her i lighted her cigarette i tried not to notice as she toed off her highheeled suede slippers do sit down pat she said then oh wheres your drink i dont drink very much mrs luther i said i dont think i want one just now but i never drink alone i mean im very serious about it mrs luther lila or dont you like the name i like it very much but say it then lila i said flatly what happened then was so completely insane that i am almost doubtful it did happen she set her glass on the floor and arose letting the fox scarf slide from her shoulders she put her arms around me and turned turning me and slumped backwards she went down on the bed drawing me down with her her eyes were closed and she was breathing deeply and her head rocked a little from side to side on its thick pallet of ash blonde hair her lips parted and she raised them up toward mine and almost i bent down to them i wanted to i wanted her i believe it must have been the red of her mouth which brought me to my senses lipstick evidence penalty or perhaps i heard the soft footsteps in the thickly carpeted hallway although that does not seem possible whatever the case was i did not bend down i reversed the trick she had pulled on me i moved up and backwards swiftly jerking her upright before she could release her hold i caught her by the elbows literally swung her in an arc and dropped her into the chair i swept the hair back from her face i dropped the scarf around her shoulders i slipped the shoes on her feet and thrust the glass into her hand i made a leap for the door it was locked she had turned the latch i turned it again turning the knob noisily at the same time as i did so i felt it turn from the other side and dr luther walked in oh i said i was going to call you doc mrs luther thought you might have time for a drink with us he shook his head curtly and looked at her he looked her over very carefully are you through with that drink yet it doesnt look like it does it drink it up then or take it with you she stared at him smiling in a funny way swinging one long perfect leg lila he said a note of apology in his voice dont you think ill tell you what i think she said arising i think youd better take it and she hurled the contents of the glass squarely into his face i wanted to slap her i hoped no matter what happened to me that doc would instead he merely stood there helplessly the whiskey dripping down from his glasses running in little rivulets toward his mouth and chin mrs luther laughed shortly she turned and gave me a bright vacant smile sorry about the carpet pat she said and she strolled out of the room closing the door behind her doc i said doc he turned and looked at me slowly his glasses misted over by the whiskey he made a pawing motion at them with one hand doc i said again helplessly and he took a hesitating step toward me he took another step and i moved out of the way he went past me and into the bathroom and i heard water being turned on i went over to the bar and poured myself a stiff drink straight i was tilting the bottle for the second time when the bathroom door opened make that two will you pat said doc casually certainly i said and i poured another one trying to keep the bottle from rattling against the glass hed washed and tidied himself up and he looked pretty much the same as he always had the terrific inner strain was apparent only in the tight line of his mouth the unconsciously selfconscious way in which he kept his lips drawn over the protruding teeth he sat down in one of the upholstered chairs i handed him a glass and sat down across from him well he smiled at me almost timidly heres how pat how i said and then i banged the glass down slopping whiskey onto the coffee table dammit to hell doc i said im going to tell you a few things you may not like dont bother pat i dont think you can tell me anything i dont already know you cant know or yes yes i can know all right and still not accept fight against accepting i think it might be better if i told you a few things about myself when you know them you can understand about lila you dont need to explain anything to me doc i said i i should have done it before youll be hearing things from other people and you may as well get the straight story from me do you recall one of myrtle briscoes opening remarks this morning the one about locking the vault why i nodded yes that little barb was intended for me pat you and i have at least one thing in common you mean that that you robbed a bank too just a safe a vault in the college where i was an instructor he smiled wryly and shook his head i made about as big a botch of it as you did even though i didnt go to prison i sometimes wonder whether that was a break whether i wouldnt have been better off if no i said no ones better off for that its something ill never know i guess how about another drink i got the bottle and brought it over to the table he added a little to the drink i poured for him and took most of it at a swallow he shuddered and smacked his lips it happened about ten years ago pat he said abruptly breaking into speech i was about your age a few years older perhaps and my prospects didnt look half as good id scraped and starved and slaved through the best years of my life to get an education and all id got out of it was an assistant professorship in a jerkwater college it would be years i knew before i got any more than that before i became a full professor and finally if i was lucky a department head the last thing i should have done from a practical standpoint was to get married i got married anyway he took another drink glancing at me over the rim of his glass i see the full significance of that escapes you pat you cant understand what it means to have income staked at a definite and unchangeable level and to take on an obligation which far exceeds it we didnt plan it that way of course lila was a student of mine working her way through as i had we were going to keep the thing secret until she finished school and i or the two of us together was making enough to establish a home thats the way we planned it what happened was she became pregnant she had to quit school and her parttime job she had to have money and she was going to have to have more when the baby came and afterward i got it for her one day when the registrar was out of his office and the safe was standing open doc i said when he had been silent for several seconds are you sure you want to tell me all this i i think so he rubbed his eyes about the money it didnt take them long to discover it was missing nor to prove that id taken it i admitted it said id lost it gambling they let me resign and the police gave me twentyfour hours to get out of town i didnt dare go near lila i was afraid even to send her a message she had to have that money you see had to have it i came here about as far away from the other place as i could get i rented an office on credit and slept on the floor at night and fixed my own meals whenever had the money to buy food inside of a year id built up a pretty fair practice as a consulting psychologist so i sent for her id only written her one other letter before that i hadnt signed it or given any address and i was afraid to say much except that i was well and she wasnt to worry well she came here pat alone ill never forget the look on her face when i asked her where the baby was i you see she thought id abandoned her all those months shed thought that the baby had been born dead im sorry doc i said after all though it wasnt your fault im afraid you and i arent the best judges of that pat he said slowly were not equipped to judge anything about her well want to hear the rest of the story if you dont mind telling it theres not much more id had to use my own name to establish my right to practice so it didnt take long for my past to catch up with me people found out who i was they found out but just a little late a psychologist learns things that could be embarrassing and theres an unusual number of such things to be learned around a state capitol when the professional groups began cracking down on me i was already in i had to agree to stop practicing but i was in ive stayed in and you wish you were out i said naturally he shrugged ive never belonged in this game any more than you belonged in sandstone aside from the fact that im constantly forced to go against all my instincts and training ijust dont fit i dont know my way around i had the few original contacts and ive used this place to get more but ive had to depend on people like well our friend hardesty to steer me being dependent upon anyone in a game of this kind has serious disadvantages yes i said i can see that it would he stretched lazily and stood up frowning absently at the small clock on the writing table well ill run along now i didnt mean to stay so long but i thought id put your mind at rest about a few things and on that seemingly commonplace remark dr ronald luther exprofessor of psychology turned lobbyist left the room henry brought in my dinner and cleaned up the mess on the carpet i ate unpacked the clothes that had come from the store and tried to read a while i couldnt i went to bed sleep wouldnt come doc came in the next morning while i was finishing my coffee and sat down on the bed he asked me if id slept well and said the new suit looked nice on me i made the proper replies not much was said after that until we reached the capitol we were starting up the long steps of the main entrance when he cleared his throat with a trace of embarrassment and spoke i know youre as anxious to avoid unfavorable impressions as i am if mrs luther should visit your room again it might be best to leave the door open what i said and turned in my tracks and looked at him but doc i didnt finish the sentence although it was an effort to choke it off the look of stubborn embarrassment on his face stopped me hed convinced himself all over again that lila couldnt be at fault she couldnt so someone else had to be that was that all right doc i said ill remember that fine he said obviously relieved do you think you can find your way home all right tonight i dont know when ill be leaving and of course you dont know your hours yet i told him id be all right by myself he hurried off seething inside i walked on toward the highway department it was on the main floor of the building and occupied an entire wing a long counter facing the entrance door stretched the length of it a series of cages similar to those in banks fronted on the counter it was nine oclock when i arrived but no one was there finally at a quarter after nine an autolicense clerk entered his cage and pointed out flemings office to me i went down the aisle to a door at the end it opened into a reception room with an immense executivetype desk and a whiteleather upholstered lounge with matching chairs i knocked on a door marked private and tried the knob i sat down in one of the chairs and lighted a cigarette the nearest ash tray stood by the desk id got up to move it over by me when the door behind me opened and a woman bustled in breathlessly she was about fifty trim sharpfeatured what are you doing here she demanded and before i could answer she had pushed around me and was trying the drawers of the desk anything missing i said what do you want i was supposed to see mr fleming about a job i said im patrick cosgrove she gave me a tightlipped smile im mr flemings secretary i dont remember his mentioning your name senator burkman spoke to him about it oh her face cleared burkman well that accounts for it it probably slipped his mind when will mr fleming be in i asked im not sure that he can see you when he does come in oh well drop back in an hour or so if you like ill see what i can do i thanked her and left far from happy with the situation i thought id better talk things over with doc before i went back to flemings office and i went down to the restaurant hoping to catch him there he wasnt there and neither was burkman i was on the point of leaving when hardesty hailed me he was alone at his table how are you pat he arose beaming and shook hands sit right down out pretty early arent you are you by yourself i didnt think it was early i said but i guess it is i was looking for doc hes tied up anything i can do its about the job i was supposed to have i thought i had one with the highway department but im not sure now well now he smiled reassuringly that wont do at all tell me about it mr fleming wasnt in his office and his secretary practically threw me out she told me i could come back later but i got the impression that it wouldnt do me much good lets see burkman was sponsoring you wasnt he hmm thats not so good you dont think ill get a job oh yes youll get your job i was just thinking of the matter uh objectively he nodded his head flemings over there a few tables well tag him when he starts out thanks very much i said i was getting pretty worried glad to do it no trouble at all he stirred his coffee thoughtfully smiling his warm confident smile quite a little fracas we had yesterday eh pat im sorry about that i said ill see that nothing of the kind happens again oh im not blaming you for it but i couldnt help feeling a little annoyed with doc after all i did just about as much work on your parole as he did he should have told you about me beforehand i suppose youre right i said carefully one serious misstep something of the kind that happened yesterday for example and doc or no one else could save you from going back to sandstone for that matter doc himself yes i said oh well i probably shouldnt say anything like that he might as well have said it that doc himself might take a notion to have me returned to prison why dont you drop up to my office sometime pat i think you and i have a great many things to talk about ill be glad to come i said good he smiled well here comes your man fleming just a moment a tall fat man turned slowly away from a group that was starting for the door and looked at us sourly hardesty took me by the elbow and drew me forward mr fleming i want you to shake hands with pat cosgrove he said heartily pats supposed to go to work in your department you know work fleming took the cigar out of his mouth and barely touched my hand with fat hard fingers dont you ever look at the calendar hardesty hardesty laughed pats a good friend of burkmans the senator spoke to you about him burkmans a goddam nuisance said fleming and annoyed remembrance flickered in his small eyes pats all set and rarin to go said hardesty jovially would you like to talk to him here or up in your office the fat man grunted office see rita without another word he turned and rolled slowly away thats his secretary hardesty explained rita kennedy fleming will have called her by the time you get there its all settled i said sure shell fix you up he slapped me on the back ill have to run now dont forget that other matter ill remember i said i went back to flemings office not feeling any too sure of myself but the moment i stepped through the door i knew the job was mine rita kennedy was hardly effusive but she gave me one of her tightlipped smiles and motioned for me to draw a chair up to the desk all right pat she said briskly drawing a heavy manila folder from her desk i believe were all organized now here are your gasoline mileage books and these are your dailyexpense blanks youre allowed one dollar per meal and this is your carrequisition card you know where the state garage is just two blocks south yes maam i said but oh yes i knew there was something id forgotten excuse me a moment she got up locked the drawer of the desk and bustled into the main offices in a minute or two she was back with a thick stack of mimeographed sheets covered with writing and figures these are the survey forms pat you use one for each day you can turn them in as many as you complete every three or four days i see i nodded but what am i supposed to do with them miss kennedy keep your mouth shut and dont leave your car parked too long in front of beer joints the newspapers have given us some awful ridings about stuff of that kind but oh i said you should kick she smiled faintly easing me toward the door dont forget what i said about the beer joints ill remember i said i left the capitol and started south thinking wondering why i should feel ashamed of myself a little more than fifteen years before on a day like this id walked into the first state bank of selby and pointed my sixteen gauge shotgun at the cashier i cant tell you why i did it i only know it wasnt planned id started for the river to go hunting when i discovered i only had two shells and all id intended when i entered the bank was to draw a dollar out of my savings account it was around noon and old briggs the cashier was by himself i was carrying my gun because i didnt want to leave it in my strippeddown modelt briggs gave me a funny teasing look and half raised his hands and then his hands were going higher and his look was frightened and was stuttering something that sounded like nnow im not i i dont mean i i i wont hhurt you mr briggs he toppled down to the floor inside the cage and i started to run out on the street and call for help instead of that i scooped up half a dozen packets of bills and shoved them down inside my sweater and most of them fell out as i ran out the door my car was parked around the corner and sheriff nick nickerson was sitting on the running board been wantin to see you boy think i got er fixed sos you can go to the u next fall gosh i said thanks mr nickerson writ my nephew up there an he says you want to make yourself handy around his garage he can swing your board and room an a little spendin money thats swell i said i can get enough for the tuition and books glad to do it there aint nothing around here for a bright young fellow seems like the brighter they are the quicker they go to rot i thanked him again and got in the car and then the alarm in the bank began to clatter and he started running and i drove off slowly dazed then faster as fast as i could go about a mile out of town the car begun to sputter and pop and i knew i was almost out of gas i turned in at the airport and drove across the field frank miller was spinning the prop of his little old patchedup three seater it caught and he ran around and crawled inside and i was out of my car and crawling right in behind him judge lipscomb lacy was in the passengers seats he weighed more than three hundred pounds and he was spread all over both of them frank said what the hell you think youre doin red judge lacys got portant business in the city an get goin i said ill blast you frank ill ill blast you i swear to god i will i squeezed in the gun jammed right into judge lacys guts and i said id blast them both id blast him if frank didnt do what i said and then id blast frank judge lacys eyes went shut and his face turned green and his head lolled and frank said all right you crazy bastard and we were in the air and down again bouncing rocking from side to side it wont lift us red honest to gawd it wont i know i said you want i should dump him out i guess not he looks awfully sick what the hell do you want i dont know the door of the plane opened a long time later it opened and there was a big crowd out there and sheriff nick nickerson reached inside and took the gun out of my hands come on now boy he said you just come along now an well see about this so i got out and it was all over all over except for the trial with a courtappointed lawyer and judge lipscomb lacy presiding id never been ashamed of that i was not ashamed now of that the garage manager glanced at my requisition card and turned me over to a young negro in overalls he led me back to the rear past the motorcycles and the blackandwhite trooper cars yes sir he said stopping what kind o car you like now i can have any one i want i asked weell dont believe id take none of them big babies thats a mightly nice little coupe right there no ones got no call on that it was practically new and a plain unadorned black only the license plates identified it as a state car itll do i said what time do i bring it back in you live here in town sir yes i do i said well most of the genlemen that lives in town jus keeps their cars that sounds like a pretty good arrangement i said yes sir he grinned hardly no one ever kicks on it i gave him a dollar tip put my papers up in back of the seat and drove out madeline flournoys apartment was on the second floor of a twostory brick building in a semiresidential district a furniture store occupied the first floor the upstairs entrance was on a side street and there were no windows on that side the blank wall of a warehouse rose on the other side of the street there was a door at the head of the stairs and another a few steps up the hallway i hesitated then remembered the single mail slot downstairs both doors were hers i knocked on the first one it opened almost immediately riding or walking she didnt seem surprised to see me where did you park your car down the street two blocks on a lot come on in she was wearing a pair of shorts very short and a gray wool sweat shirt her feet and legs were bare the long curl of her hair was pulled up on top of her head and fastened with a single pin the crisp brown end of it stuck out even with her forehead like a little brush now dont look in there she said nodding the brush and of course i did look in there into the bedroom with its rumpled bed i just got up that doc she yawned nothings too hard for him as long as someone else has to do it up pretty late i said mmm come on i need coffee perhaps i should tell you i said doc warned me i wasnt to see you pooey on doc she said trust him to order people around who the hell is he to tell us what to do well i said hes in a pretty good position to tell me what to do yeah she looked at me blankly well he wont know about it no one ever comes around here during the day but no one she gave my arm an impatient tug and i went with her there was an areaway to our right almost wholly blocked by a worn plush lounge she closed the connecting door into the living room pushed me down on the lounge and squeezing past my knees went into the kitchen she came back with two cups of coffee and gave me one then she sat down or rather stood on her knees facing me youd better put your legs up too she said theres hardly room for them that way this is all right i said what you squirming for she crinkled her eyes have to go to the bathroom its right there thanks no i said now you look here she said shaking the brush of hair the doors closed and weve got those other rooms between us and the hallway and anyway no one ever comes up here during the day good gosh if id known you were such a scaredycat i thought you knew i said or i wouldnt have come today it might make a difference in your wanting to know me know what what am i supposed to know ive just been released from sandstone i said doc got my parole for me oh she said softly fifteen years bank robbery im awfully sorry pat how old were you almost eighteen almost eighteen she said you didnt hurt anyone did you i didnt even get any money i said and i told her a little about it and oddly enough i found myself laughing she giggled delightedly she rocked forward on her knees and burrowed her head against my shoulder i put my coffee cup on the floor beside hers and slid my arm around her she lifted her head and looked at me ive ive never known anyone quite like you i said of course not she said promptly you never will either im in a rather peculiar position madeline i cant say and do things id like to that a man normally would yes she said you are well i was somewhat taken back by her answer we seem to be in agreement i wonder if it had occurred to you that i might be in a pretty peculiar position myself it had i said and it bothered me a great deal why because i like you to use an understatement to give you a fuller explanation id have to go into the details of what i think are the peculiarities of your position there will now be a brief pause she said while madame flournoy goes into a trance and interprets professor cosgroves message i think you know what i mean i said quiet she said and turning she lay down and put her head in my lap i bent my head and kissed her she gave me two quick kisses in return before moving her mouth away there was something about them something so warm and confiding and innocent that i wanted to thrust my hands into my pockets and keep them there to sit on them if necessary and of course i didnt she opened her eyes and looked up at me she raised one small finger and put it on my lip and moved it up and down she lowered the hand and let it lie on mine what are you doing in in all this anyway i said what are you thats hardly the same thing isnt it she said you did an impulsive seemingly easy thing something that seemed to promise a lot when you were too young to judge the consequences so did i i lighted a cigarette tossing the match into my saucer she pursed her lips and crinkled her eyes at me and i lowered the cigarette while she took a long deep puff well she said puffing the smoke out in rings its hard for me to imagine i said that youd put up with anything over any very long period that you didnt want to you put up with sandstone didnt you she took another puff from my cigarette and bobbed her head emphatically when i first saw you on the capitol steps yesterday oh yes i did see you i thought there thats it i thought the same thing i know you did honey she patted my cheek and i made up my mind to bump into you on the way back or or drop something or fall down in front of you anything to get to know you and then i found you were with doc and it made me kind of sick inside but still i know i said you must have had some pretty strong friends to set doc in motion if they could get him to swing the parole they can probably get him to put through a pardon did i say something wrong i dont have any friends i said doc got me out on his own huh she gestured with her hand you mean just like that just like that i told her about the letter id written him id never seen him before but why pat you didnt agree to you didnt promise what could i promise i said but i know i said theres a reason but the only one i can think of doesnt make sense that im valuable or will be valuable to him just by being what i am that he thinks i will be thinks its just a hunch i nodded he had a reason for getting me out someone else had another his plan isnt going to come off and the other will now that doesnt make sense she said believe me pat that guy knows what hes doing always ive worked for him for years and ive been on the inside of every crooked deal hes pulled i i dont feel bad about it i said for a person who hasnt had to work at it to stay alive youre pretty good what i dont understand lying pretending youre docs right hand you knew that he was getting me out of sandstone you know why he got me out why dont you tell me what has he got on you that makes you afraid to talk is that why you came here today pat to pump me i didnt think id have to pump you i thought you had some of the same feeling for me that i have for you i oh i do pat she thrust herself upwards and clung to me tightly you must believe me honey ido feel that way tell me then dont dont let him make you do anything pat talk to me first dont do anything without talking to me will you promise that i my scalp crawled suddenly did you lock that hail door i probably didnt no one ever comes up here during the day someone did i said and i nodded at the glass panel of the connecting door just as he looked through it grinning he was about my height though heavier and he had a lipless tobaccostained mouth and little redrimmed pig eyes and a nose that might have been made out of soiled putty he wore a blue serge suit without a vest a snapbrimmed gray hat and black hightopped shoes shoes and hat were spotless the suit wasnt i knew what he was before he ever spit the toothpick out of his mouth and showed his credentials i nodded and handed them back to him this gentleman is with the probation department madeline i said hes caught me in a pretty serious violation of my parole huh she stared at him fiercely that doesnt give him a license to housebreak wheres your warrant you you dont understand madeline this gentleman can have me sent back to sandstone now just close the door and lock it this time we dont want to be disturbed while were talking do we sir he grinned and the caution in his pig eyes disappeared now i said smiling staring straight into his eyes what did you have in mind sir how would a couple of cnotes do two cs his ugly face lit up then contorted into a scowl huhuh aint half enough make it five would that be enough i said so didnt i for five its a deal youre making a mistake i said its worth much more than five hundred for me to stay out of sandstone im afraid i cant tell you how much it is worth to me id have to show you now dont be alarmed sir he was alarmed or beginning to be but i was smiling and holding his eyes and so he stood and watched while i slid out of my coat and shirt and undershirt i heard madeline gasp he gulped and whistled softly my god he whispered you were looking at those welts sir i said why they were nothing relatively speaking a little annoying perhaps when you get them full of gnats and salt sweat and rock dust but nothing compared to those ribs you should have seen them popping out through the flesh like splinters bursting through tree bark you should have seen this arm the day a friend tried to chop it off for me thats right sir a friend he got thirty days in the hole and i got three weeks in the hospital i hope i didnt upset you sir i said i just wanted to demonstrate that i dont and wont have enough to pay you to stay out of sandstone which brings us to our problem since i cant pay you what can i do to show how highly i value your silence what can i give you that will last and always be enough that youll never want any more of he took a step backwards bbetter watch out now red his voice cracked and rose bbetter watch out kkeep away from me aint nno hharm done ijust a joke nno hharm in jjokin he stumbled and tried to throw his hands in front of his face i chopped down and in with the edge of my hands getting both kidneys at once his arms came down and i cuffed him spinning him around i jerked his tie tight as tight as i could get it took a turn around his neck with each end and knotted it in the back i let him drop to the floor and watched him thrash about scratching and clawing at his throat as from a distance i heard madeline say hell ddie pat dont let him die a few oranges i said in a net bag or a flour sack and something to cut the tie what do you want with the oranges youd better hurry i said and i kicked him away as he tried to crawl up my legs she came running back with a paring knife and four or five oranges in the bottom of a red net bag i swung the sack with both hands it struck him in the chest and flattened him it frightened him to the last degree he could be frightened i beat him all over the chest and stomach and thighs and then i turned him over and beat him up and down the back i jerked him upright cut the necktie and tossed him into a chair he sat there panting pawing at his throat his eyes rolling up and down in his head i had madeline bring me a washrag and a comb and i sponged off his face and combed his hair for him i set his hat back on his head and buttoned up his coat do you understand i said thats what it means i he nodded his head i gget you you might not make a charge stick i said and if you did id still find a way of seeing you i cant lose any more and you can lose and keep losing so id see you once i wouldnt have to see you after that i jerked a thumb toward the door youve got it keep it he wasnt hurt no one who was hurt could have got out of there that fast i laughed a little as the door slammed madeline grinned a slow fixed grin you see i didnt kill him i said i didnt even hurt him what about the way the oranges thats the old dummychuckers trick you know the fakeaccident racket i guess i dont know pat she said slowly much of anything a mans supposed to have been in an accident but he doesnt have any marks on him so a confederate takes a bag of oranges and beats him with them they dont hurt him but they turn him black and blue hes a mass of bruises oh our friend struck me as being unusually susceptible to fear hell probably believe to his dying day that he barely escaped being killed and he didnt did he i thought i had explained no i said shortly not that time i picked up my undershirt and put it on i put on my shirt and tie i reached for my coat but she was ahead of me she held it for me pushing it up onto my shoulders and then she slid around in front holding me tight around the waist i understand pat oh i do understand honey i guess i said you understand too much its all right pat i dont blame you but oh lets just forget it i made you afraid i said with what i did to that guy youre afraid ill do the same thing to doc whats doc to you madeline what is he planning that makes you think i might try to kill him if i found it out she shook her head stubbornly theres nothing i can tell you pat she said nothing if you love me youll have to believe that all right i said she gave me a final squeeze betcha everythings going to be all right she declared brightly betcha it will betcha i said i knew she was crying the second the door closed behind me hardesty had a suite of offices on the top floor of the citys tallest skyscraper the legend on the series of doors leading to the reception room read hardesty hardesty attorneys at law and the receptionist a querulous elderly woman with a suspicious stare presided over a room as old fashioned as the building was new i put my cigarette out and folded my hands after some fifteen minutes hardesty came out of his office he nodded to me tossing some papers on the receptionists desk ill be tied up the rest of the morning mrs smithson he told her just make a note of any calls i have will you tied up she exclaimed youre supposed to be in court at eleven oclock clark will handle it nothing important he said come right on in pat he closed the door on her disapproving grunt an abashed smile on his darkly handsome face friendly little thing isnt she an old employee i said one of my grandfathers he put a match to his cigarette and held it for mine he and my father were partners in case youre wondering about the firm name that must make it one of the oldest law firms in the state i think it is he nodded quite an outfit eh when my father died i planned on fancying things up a bit but you can see how far i got i imagine if the other building we were in hadnt been condemned i wouldnt even have got us moved over here anyhow stodginess is an asset with the kind of clientele we have yes i said i suppose it would be not quite what you expected huh he gave me a shrewd glance you didnt think an old and respectable law firm would be mixed up with a guy like doc frankly no i said although im not being critical of doc mmm of course not well confidentially pat im not involved with doc a bit more than i can help you know how it is you want to swing a piece of business with the state and the first thing you know you find doc or someone like him in your path and you either work with him or you dont put your deal across i nodded noncommittally the less i had to say about doc i felt the better lets see now how long have you been out of sandstone almost three weeks and youre pretty badly worried oh dont be afraid to say so pat all right i said but its a pretty hard thing to put into words the trouble is is mrs luther she wont leave me alone oh she came back to my room the second night i was there and she almost got me in very serious trouble with doc shes followed the same line of conduct ever since she does things that well look like hell mmm murmured hardesty thats embarrassing all right but iwouldnt be too disturbed about it doc wont blame you for it he shouldnt i said but he does icant tell him it isnt my fault i cant brush her off i cant let her go on whatever i do or dont do i have doc angry with me im afraid it might lead to my parole being canceled umm and if you thought it was going to be youd try to make a run for it well we cant have that cant have that at all i wonder if youd have enough influence with her to make her stop i said weell he pursed his lips yes yes i can do that little thing for you ill appreciate it very much i said that isnt all youre worried about pat no i said just no youve trusted me with this other matter i think you must know i said i cant help wondering why doc got me out of sandstone you cant feature doc doing that unless he stood to cash in on it i didnt say that i said i do feel it strange that he did it at this particular time judging by the way burkman was treated and some other things ive seen and heard docs crowd may lose out at the election they need everything theyve got for themselves why should they use up a lot of their steam in helping me a good question pat but the answer is simple enough ever hear of fanning arnholt president of the national phalanx the big patriotic organization the superpatriotic organization hardesty corrected what arnholt and the phalanx says we common mortals feel obliged to heed and obey yes i said arnholts slated to make six speeches in this state the first here in the capital about two weeks from today hes going to attack a number of the textbooks now in use on the grounds that theyre subversive when he does its going to be an easy matter to get those texts thrown out and a new line adopted i see i said but i know youre wondering why we fool with books when weve got the oil crowd to play with but we docs gang does get to the oil companies a big stink about textbooks diverts the publics attention from them its worth heavy dough to them to get that attention diverted we take a double rackoff he grinned and spread his hands watching me out of warm dark eyes a dirty business all the way around pat but with a boob crop like weve got here you just naturally find a threshing crew and its worked out to your advantage doc set this deal up and agreed to cut his associates in on it in return for that they put through your parole but that still doesnt answer my question i said why did doc want me paroled well he hesitated im not sure that i can help you there you must know i said you have a great deal more to lose than burkman and the others you wouldnt have taken a hand in this unless you knew exactly where it was leading you mean unless i was certain of getting as much as doc he shook his head maybe not pat there are other things besides money youre putting words in my mouth i said my point is that you know why doc wanted me out of sandstone i might but why should i tell you well i was stumped by the flatness of the question i cant give you anything for the information but you indicated that you were my friend that i could trust you did you believe me well well you see how it is pat he said grinning engagingly youre asking for something that you wont give and as you pointed out a moment ago i have a great deal to lose tell me dont you have any ideas of your own none at all theres nothing i can do for anyone i dont have anything that i can see but a bad reputation very bad he nodded you mean thats something in itself lets just say its something for you to think about but i dont see how go on pat youre doing fine then theres mrs luther i said if she got doc sore enough at me to have my parole canceled his plan whatever it is would fall through id be right back where i started and all his time and effort would be wasted of course i know hes unreasonable about her but think pat cant you think of a set of circumstances where it might be profitable to anyone for you to be returned to sandstone i stared at him blankly he nodded narroweyed i can see that you cant he said but you will youll see that and the other angle as well when you do when you begin to get an inkling of their significance well have a talk thanks i said and i shook hands limply youll be all right for the time being theres this arnholt matter nothings going to happen until thats wound up im glad to know that i said you can depend on it meanwhile ill see what i can do about getting mrs luther off your neck shes rather fond of me you know he winked and poked me in the ribs i let him lead me out the hall door of his office i trust our little talk will remain confidential he said as he shook hands with me again he gave me a final smile and nod and very gently closed the door suddenly everything was all right again as right as it had been in the beginning i didnt have to avoid lila luther she made a point of keeping out of my way and on those rare occasions when we did encounter each other she was barely polite almost overnight the constraint which i had seen building up in doc disappeared he became the old doc alternately slangy and grammatical flippant and profound generous good natured a man who made the best of a shabby situation i got paid the week following my visit to hardesty on friday as i remember i hadnt worked a full month but i was paid for one i gave the check to doc to cash for me and he brought the money back to my room the next night smiling he refused to take a cent of it just hang onto your money pat he said you wont want to stick in one of those political jobs always and you probably wont be able to anyway hang onto it and youll have something to operate on when your parole runs out i wonder if i should start a bank account i said thats a good idea he said well do that some day soon when i can spare the time to go down and introduce you i left the house every morning at a reasonably early hour and never returned before five in the afternoon usually i spent an hour or so at madelines the rest of the time i saw picture shows or read in the public library or drove around one morning a few days after payday i drove out to the place where doc and i had stopped my first night out of sandstone the place where the sludge from the oil wells had widened the river into an expanse of stinking and treacherous mud i dont think i sought the spot consciously it was no attraction which would justify a drive of ten or twelve miles but i found myself there suddenly and i pulled the car off the road and walked up to the stone bench i sat down on it and leaned forward carefully i scooped up a handful of pebbles and began dropping them down into the mud now and then i caught the faint dull clatter of pipe tongs or the muted deeeropp itt of some faraway roughneck and the bank after bank of quadruple boilers belched lazy smoke into the air and even here where i was there was a rhythmic tremble to the earth a constant shivering as the mudhog pumps growled and spat out their burden i took a long deep breath and slowly let it out again it was good to be here here or any place that wasnt sandstone every day i realized a little more how good it was to be able to be off guard to smile or laugh when you wanted to just to breathe easily to think instead of scheme i leaned forward and smiled down into the black surface below and back came another smile my reflection thoughtful but reassuring hang on to yourself red hang on or a hand came down on my shoulder better hang on to the bench red you might fall in in one unthinking instant i had lowered my shoulders caught the arm and shifted my weight forward and upward luckily she yelled and a reflex action set in against the first one otherwise myrtle briscoe would have gone into the river instead of down on to the bench and i the chances are would have gone with her with a bullet through my head there was a highway patrol car parked near mine and a state trooper was bounding up the slope tugging at his holstered he almost had it out when myrtle briscoe leaped up from the bench and waved her arms at him hold it tony she gasped then she got her breath and yelled dammit to hell hold it the trooper paused you sure youre all right miss briscoe hell yes she let out a snort of laughter and made brushing motions at her clothes shook up but all together the trooper looked from me to her an expression of sullen disappointment on his swarthy face you sure you dont want me to i want you to go back to the car and sit there he turned and went back myrtle sat down shaking her head dont know why it is she said give a guy a gun and he cant wait to use it ive noticed that i said sitting down at her side im sorry if i startled you miss briscoe oh well one good startle deserves another what are you doing so far from town red i didnt think it was far arent you working i still have my job i said im caught up for a few hours okay she said now let me tell you something red tony and i gave you a long tail all the way from town about an hour ago we lost you we go on down the road about twenty miles and then we come back and here you are how do you explain that you mean i was trying to shake you i said i didnt even know you were following me how come we didnt see you or at least your car thats simple for one thing there were probably other cars between yours and mine mainly however you didnt want to see me you wanted to believe i was skipping out you were so certain i was going to that you probably wouldnt have seen me if id waved a red flag at you now look red you know doggone well what im talking about what about that car it belongs to the state you know that miss briscoe her mouth dropped open and her eyes flashed she jerked a paper from the pocket of her oldfashioned skirt and thrust it at me it was one of those small legal papers which list title transfers and mortgages and similar information myrtle brisco put her fingers on a redcircled item under automobile transfer capital car co to patrick m cosgrove fd cp i suppose its another cosgrove said myrtle sarcastically go on tell me it is i shook my head i didnt know what it was all about but i knew it wouldnt be another cosgrove it was all done too neatly id drawn a check for after allowing for a months expenses id have a surplus of just about to spend on a car i hadnt done it but wouldnt dare tell myrtle that shed never liked the idea of my being paroled to doc if she got the idea that he was using me that there was something seriously wrong i was in a trap and i couldnt go out by the door that led back to sandstone i had to stay in until i found my own exit im sorry i said i didnt know it was a violation of my parole who said it was what i want to know is why you bought it that title was transferred yesterday but the car was still on the sales lot this morning i thought id pick it up over the week end i said but why did you buy it a jalopy like that when the state lets you have a first class car for nothing its simple enough i said since i dont need it for myself i obviously intend to resell it im pretty handy with tools i can fix it up in my spare time and make a little money on it well she stared at me suspiciously thats what i intend to do miss briscoe now she nodded thats what you intend to do now what did you did you honesttogod buy that car red i dont understand i dont either but let it go get that car off the lot today and dont lose any time about reselling it yes maam i said do you want me to drive back to town ahead of you that wont be necessary she snapped and then her voice and her face softened im trying to help you red and thats all i am trying to do why dont you give me a chance yes maam come out of it for gods sake come out of your shell before you rot in it she put a hand on my knee and leaned toward me im sure youre in a jam a damned bad one tell me about it theres nothing i can tell you i said there you see you dont even have to think any more you slide off center automatically docs got you mixed up in something and you dont know how to get out of it hasnt he why should doc do that red she sighed and removed her hand suppose i said this to you suppose i told you i knew you were on the level and wanted to stay that way and any trouble you were in wasnt your own fault theres nothing to tell at the moment i said carefully but something might come up yes red i understand you always keep your word i said you always make good on a threat or a promise so make that supposition of yours a little more specific and ill believe you tell me youll trust me to do what i have to what i think is right and that youll keep me from going back to sandstone well she laughed irritatedly thats a pretty big load to buy blind red i nodded but no bigger than the one youre asking me to buy yes it is you see red theres such a hell of a lot more involved than just you and me for almost ten years now docs crowd has been riding high and handsome this time in this coming election it looks like theyre going to lose out theyre getting desperate theyre looking for some way to discredit me you could be it i dont see how i could be used i said anyway ive been given to understand that you can stay in office as long as you want to ive stayed in for thirty years but that doesnt mean i can keep on doing it and when i go whatever small reform element there is goes with me a firstclass scandal will put any officeholder in the street and the straighter hes been the harder itll hit him hell either lose out entirely or hell have to do so much horsetrading that he wont be able to do anything in his job but yeah i know i didnt sign your parole but i did consent to it and youre my obligation let you get in a really bad scrape and itll come back on me let me get it in the neck and the whole reform slate will collapse that automatically leaves docs crowd in the saddle this is a oneparty state the people dont vote for candidates they vote against them i understand i said but how am i going to be used to discredit you i dont know red but i can think of any number of things you could do that would pull the trick thats why i want you to level with me and ill go along with you as far as i can red thats a promise she stood up tiredly and began brushing at her perpetually wrinkled skirt the sun was full outby now and it etched every line of her harsh haggard face her faded topknot of hair was more gray than red i stood up also and she looked up into my face for a moment squinting her eyes against the sun then she took hold of my arm pushed me gently aside and strode past me and down the hill watching her watching the firm unfaltering stride i somehow felt ashamed and i wanted to run after her or call her back and i stayed where i was and kept my mouth closed i knew i was making a mistake just how bad a one i was yet to discover but i knew of nothing else to do the capital car company had a blocklong sales lot on the outskirts of the downtown business district a salesman directed me to a small frame office surrounded and almost hidden by cars i introduced myself to the manager a brisk goldtoothed little man named rivers oh sure he said instantly wife bought it for you very fine lady very fine want to take a look at it i thought id take it with me i said take it or leave it wife said you might want to leave it a while a fine lady that fine i said he led me halfway down a row of automobiles and stopped before a ford coupe it wasnt junk by any means despite the scratched and lustreless body the tires were new i lifted the hood and saw an engine as clean as though it had been scrubbed with soap and water gettin a buy there rivers declared why i bet you i coulda got two two and a quarter for that car this morning if i hadnt already sold it little old lady was down here lookin at it tell she knew cars too a negro youth an employee of the company drove the car out to docs house for me rivers followed in another car to take the youth back to town i left the coupe and the state car at the curb and went up the walk to the house as i climbed the steps the venetian blind at one of the front windows moved and when i opened the front doors mrs luther was standing in the door of her apartment she was wearing a flowered silk house coat with a bodice of some very sheer material she smiled and stood back from the door inviting me in now arent you a bad man she cried you found out about our surprise is doc here i said oh no hes gone for the day come in i stepped inside stopping as near the door as i could without standing close to her she closed the door gave me another bright chiding smile and led me to one of the overstuffed lounges now she said pushing me down on the lounge with a playful gesture how did you find out wasnt i supposed to i said of course not not yet oh i hesitated well you can probably guess mrs luther the highway department gets a daily list of title transfers i saw that i owned a car so i went down and got it shouldnt i have well as long as you did of course we intended to give it to you on your birthday that was very nice of you i said but i wonder if you havent made a mistake my birthday was in march more than two months ago oh no she said why doctor thought it was in may thats too bad if you or doc want to get your money back she shook her head doubtfully she was sure doc wouldnt want to do that i murmured more thanks wondering what went on beneath that vapidly beautiful face may and march the months could easily have been confused and the present of a car wasnt at all out of keeping with docs other acts of generosity toward me i didnt need one immediately but circumstances might change to where i would what actually was there to be suspicious about i looked up at lila luther suddenly and caught a peculiar expression in her eyes something that was a mixture of shame and hunger i smiled at her and she smiled back shyly a faint blush spreading across the tawny cheeks she felt the blush too and tried to fix her face against it i put out my hand and let the fingers trail across her breasts she gasped but she didnt pull away she sat and waited biting at her lip youre out of character mrs luther i said or are you in character its got to be one way or the other i i dont know what you mean i could feel her mind racing trying to think and not to think at the same time yyouve got no right to question me you made one pass at me after another i said and you werent particular where or when you made them and then hardesty told you to lay off and you did you didnt count on my making the passes you dont know what to do now that i have i her eyes were glazing i know what to do spill it you were told to begin you were told to stop whats it all about she didnt answer she wriggled moving closer to me and her lips parted and her eyelids flickered lazily she seemed to have taken a deep swelling breath and held it it was a good act if it was one i decided to see if it was and if so how good i caught the bodice with both hands and pulled out and down it came apart like paper and she fell against me flinging her arms around me and crying ppat it was almost a sob frantic hysterical with passion oh pat i let her draw me forward and down we still lay together but i was thinking the ashblonde hair was sweetly damp against my face and her lips brushed my ear kissing whispering and the soft ripe body began to move again in tentative rhythm but i was thinking what if doc should come in now i thought what if the door should open and the door did open a silverbacked hair brush stood on edge on the coffee table mirroring the opening door mirroring doc and then as gently as it had opened it closed again it closed and cautiously the screen door opened and closed seconds later i heard the quiet purr of a distant motor distant then more distant doc the insanely jealous had seen this this and driven away it all had taken place in seconds not more than a minute too swiftly for shoek and fear to follow and lila luther hadnt seen or heard i sat up shock was gripping me at last a cold weak feeling spread up through my chest and throat and cold sweat broke out on my forehead darling she sat up also anxiety and hunger blending on her face whats the matter i dont know i said felt sick all of a sudden she whispered maybe youd better go and i went i wanted to tell her to explain and reason that had become unreason held me silent perhaps she shouldnt know perhaps it would precipitate a crisis if she did why and how i didnt know but i sensed the danger she couldnt be trusted shed lied about the car shed lied figuratively ever since id come to this house she knew what was going on and i didnt and if i told her this i didnt know i didnt know what might happen but i wasnt going to tell her and find out the sign on the pebbleglassed door read ea eggleston investigations the office was in an old fivestory building down near the public market he couldnt be too good id thought being in that location he didnt have to be good to know what i wanted to and i didnt want anyone that would be really sharp that would get ideas and follow them up he was tall and thinfaced and drowsy looking his scuffed crepesoled shoes were up on his desk when i went in and his big bony hands were folded across his stomach a crumpled gray hat was pulled low on his forehead he didnt shift the hat or his position during the half hour or so that i was there cosgrove he said in a soft deep voice what do you do cosgrove do you have to know that i said got to know whether youre worth killing whether youre in a business say which would suffer from your permanent absence im not heavy on the cuff to anyone anyone out real dough if you kick off no no dependent nor close relatives no wife no but you think you may have been insured without your knowledge i yes why well i dont actually think that i am i said i just thought that i might be he didnt say anything for a minute or more finally when i was beginning to think hed dozed off he spoke went to a dentist one time to get a tooth pulled knew the one that needed pulling would hurt like hell so i pointed out another one to him looks like youre about as smart as i was i laughed im not deliberately lying to you eggleston there are people who would be hurt pretty badly if they knew id made an inquiry like this i cant let them know that i have so about a month ago a certain party did me a very expensive favor since then ive received several others id never met this party before and i cant think of any way i could provide a return on the investment unless ive been insured ask this party why he or she had done said favors not a straight question the implication was that they were pure philanthropy that doesnt fit in with what i know about this party he sat motionless silent staring down at his hands i thought there might be some sort of underwriters bureau that could give you the information i said without of course letting this party know that id asked um he said itll cost you twenty dollars mr cosgrove thats reasonable i said and i took out a twenty and laid it on the desk he lifted a foot slightly and dragged the bill under his heel youre not insured mr cosgrove anything else now look i said i paid for certain information which you received on very good authority ive done a great deal of insurance work no one has taken out a policy on you providing youve told me the truth ive told it but for one party to insure another he must have what is known as an insurable interest he must present reasonably good evidence that he has little or nothing more to gain by the insureds demise than he has by his continued existence the insureds death must represent a sentimental loss as in the case of husband and wife a monetary one or both no one it would appear has an insurable interest in you apparently he had little to do but sleep and insurance was a hobby of his he continued to talk for almost fifteen minutes scarcely moving or altering the deep soft monotone covering every phase of the business that might possibly concern me at last he stopped and i stood up by the way mr cosgrove yes anyone with the education which you ostensibly have should have known he wasnt insured anyone who gets around at all would know it maybe i dont get around very much i said my own thought from what i knew i said i was pretty sure i wasnt insured but i thought things might have changed recently not that recently mr cosgrove youre still a young man you couldnt have been out of circulation very long goodbye i said known the party about a month hedroned did you a very great favor and youre suspicious why dont you remove yourself from this partys vicinity from the state for that matter i stopped and turned he nodded drowsily you cant leave can you so yes you cant leave im beginning to think you might have excellent grounds for your suspicions another twenty please i went back to the desk and laid a second bill on it he raked it under his heel how long were you in mr cosgrove fifteen years of ten to life and you were unacquainted with the party who got your parole bought it shall we say thats right so are you mr cosgrove you have good reason for alarm a pardon could have been obtained as cheaply and easily with a pardon you could have gone away far out of your benefactors periphery he is not a philanthropist goodbye i said so he nodded and seemed to fall asleep and i left more information which i didnt know how to use one of the worst things that prison does to a man is imbue him with the feeling that he is always in the wrong that others may rightfully do what they will with him while the things he does through error or otherwise are wholly inexcusable i felt that way about doc about the way he had seen lila and me i was certain by now that i was being forced to work against myself i was sure that i owed him nothing apologies included still i did feel guilty i did and i couldnt help it i stayed away from the house until almost midnight that night and got away early the next morning by the evening of that day some of my sense of guilt had worn off i was still uneasy but i hoped if he noticed the fact he would attribute it to the business over the car i brought the subject up as soon as he stepped inside my room mmm he nodded thoughtfully i should have known that myrtle would read the legal papers i appreciate it just the same i said dont mention it pat well try to do better next year he left after a quick drink with me i flopped down on the bed relieved and hating myself for being relieved willie came in to remove my dinner dishes and i tried to tell myself that it was he and not doc who had looked in on lila and me he would have been in the house while doc would have had no reason to be there but i knew better than that it had been doc hed expected me to come there because of the car probably hed followed me from the sales lot and when hed seen lila and me why hadnt he reacted as he should as the insanely jealous doc i knew would have did he intend to settle with me later when i was least expecting it or had he held off for purely practical reasons because a blowup would spoil the plan in which i played a part it could be either way or both and it could be i sat up on the bed suddenly it could be that doc actually didnt care about his wife that the jealousy was all an act i got up and paced the floor excited almost seeing the answer to the riddle it had been an act looking back now i could see the falsity of it how badly it had been overplayed doc showing up always at the most embarrassing moment lila haughtily dramatic taunting him throwing whiskey in his face it had been rotten acting but i had been taken in by it i had been so impressed that i was afraid doc might drop my parole id told hardesty that hinted that i might skip out and immediately the funny business had stopped they didnt want me to leave theyd wanted only to build doc up in my mind as a certain type of person it all added up hardesty had told doc howl felt and doc had told lila to leave me alone hed followed me to the house the day before to reassure me in case lila fell down on the job and when he saw lila apparently was doing more than all right hed gone quietly away again but what about hardesty why when he so obviously distrusted and detested doc had he told him of my visit he wanted me to share his distrust and hatred he meant to work me up to the point where i would that was my answer i was not yet in his opinion sufficiently worked up i was not ready to be used until i was he was chiefly interested in seeing that i did nothing which might cause me to be returned to sandstone myrtle briscoe i stopped in my pacing and sat down again myrtle she was using me to get doc i was a rope she was giving him with which to hang himself and doc doc had foreseen that she would know and guessed that she would react as she had he was tolling out rope of his own he was certain he could tighten it before she could tighten hers and mrs luther was she working with one of the three or did she too have a plan and madeline no not madeline id never had the slightest doubt about her my instinct told me just one thing about her that she was good and that she loved me if i was wrong about that then i was wrong about everything and maybe i was i didnt know anything all i had was guesses guesses which when you probed them and tried to follow them out became ridiculous if eggleston was wrong about the pardon then most of my conjecturing collapsed doc might be my friend it could be that he had become aware that we were being pressed toward a dangerous situation and that he intended to avoid it at all costs oh hell though that couldnt be right it i gave up i undressed and got in bed yes and i went to sleep you can only think so much and i was far ahead of my quota for the day the next day was the beginning of my second thirtyday period on parole i called myrtle briscoes office from a drug store and asked what time i should report she told me curtly that i neednt bother to come in unless there was something i wanted to tell her i said there wasnt she banged down the receiver it wasnt much after nine when i reached madelines apartment and she was still in bed instead of coming to the living room door she stuck her head out the other one the one to her bedroom she closed it after me gave me a fiercely affectionate hug and flung herself down on the bed again she was wearing white sleeping shorts and a white sleeveless pullover she sprawled out on the pillows raised her legs straight in the air and grinned at me impishly guess ill just stay here all day she announced all alone i said guess i wont either she let her legs down sat up and yawned sooo tired make me some coffee huh honey all right i said ill get into something while youre gone so you wont be thinking evil thoughts i told her i never had such things and went on back to the kitchen i put a pot of coffee on the stove and slipped a couple of pieces of bread into the toaster while they were getting ready i put a napkin on a tray laid out marmalade and butter and sliced an orange the whole business didnt take more than five minutes i was pretty practiced in getting her breakfast i picked up the tray and started for the bedroom and then i halted there in the kitchen door and stood staring the bedroom door was still open as i had left it and i could see her almost as plainly as though id been in the room with her and what i saw sent a cold chill of shock along my spine the sleeping trunks and pullover lay on the floor at her feet shed got into a pair of thin white panties and her hands were behind her working at the clasp of her brassiere she was completely lost in thought she wasnt thinking about dressing but about something someone and those thoughts were anything but pleasant always before even when she was serious shed appeared gay good humored light hearted id never seen her any other way shed never let me see her any other way and now not a vestige of that gaiety and good humor remained i could hardly believe it was the same girl the same woman this woman whose face was a hideous and sinister mask of hatred i stepped back into the kitchen and waited a minute or two then i began to whistle and started for the bedroom again well she said as put the tray down on a reading stand what took you so long oh i took my time i said carelessly i didnt want to catch you undressed noo she said im sure you wouldnt want to do that i poured coffee and sat down on the bed with her shed put on a pair of slacks and a sweater and was propped up on the pillows her knees drawn up good she said nibblingon an orange slice very good for the first time since i had met her i found it difficult to talk to respond to her aimless impish chatter it was grotesque in the light of what i had just seen i had the impression of being drawn into a game while a flood tide rose around my neck she finished eating and i lighted a cigarette for her my hand trembled a little as i held out the match and she steadied it with her own hand whats the matter with you this morning pat matter she didnt say anything she merely lay back waiting her brown eyes inscrutable ive been a little worried i said maybe thats it worried about what about whats going to happen to me about what is happening to me is yes i said and i told her about the car and my talk with myrtle briscoe at some point in the telling she suddenly sat up and gripped my fingers pat she said had you thought about telling myrtle yes said looking squarely at her ive thought about telling her everything about everyone and everything it might send me back to sandstone but i think id have plenty of company on the trip you might she released my fingers why dont you do it her voice was flat her gaze as steady as mine id made a threat and what it had got me i didnt know advice or another threat im sorry i said youre the only person i know to turn to and turning to you doesnt seem to do any good theres no reason why it should of course why you should help me do you really believe that pat i dont know i said what to believe no she nodded and theres your answer to everything you dont see anyones problems but your own you dont trust anyone but yourself the fact that i wont tell you everything i know is interpreted to mean that im against you thats all you can see i dont think that i said yes you do pat and youre wrong in doing it i havent told you any more than i have because it isnt a good thing for you to know it youd blunder into something that youre not big enough to handle im supposed to sit still and do nothing thats about it her face softened that has to be it for the present honey whenever theres anything to be done ill let you know she squeezed my hand and then she sat up and put her arms around me she drew me down to the pillows her cheek against mine her lips moving against my ear poor redhaired pat she whispered he mustnt worry any more in just a little while now all his troubles will be over the trap was snapping shut i could feel it a sensation of things rushing in on me from every side on monday morning i stopped by the capitol to leave a bunch of the survey forms for rita kennedy they were meaningless of course but appearances had to be kept up firmly entrenched as the highway department crowd was even they were not taking unnecessary chances in an election year rita kennedy wasnt in and shed left word that she wanted to see me i passed the day reading and driving and went back to the capitol again that evening rita took the forms i handed her with a crisp smile i hope i didnt inconvenience you by not being here this morning pat not at all i said im glad to hear it is it raining out i said it was at least its starting to oh damn she said ill never be able to get a taxi this time in the evening and of course this is one day when i wouldnt bring an umbrella ive got my car here i said the state car that is if youd care to have me i would she said instantly get down my coat while im locking my desk i want to get out of here i helped her on with her coat and she gave my arm a little squeeze as we went out the door she held onto my arm all the way down the corridor and out to the car and she didnt exactly lean away from me ive been meaning to have a talk with you for some time pat she said as i pulled the car away from the curb can you talk while youre driving why yes i said perhaps id better not have you this traffic makes me nervous and the rain makes it worse well wait until we get to my apartment fine i said you dont have to hurry home for any reason not at all well wait then i wont keep you long itll be all right if you do i said i wont dont talk any more please she gave me her address and i kept quiet all the way i stopped in front of a large apartment house and a doorman with an umbrella ushered us to the door an elevator shot us up to some floor near the top i dont know how many rooms there were in the apartment but i know it must have been large and expensive it was the kind of place you have when you like good things and have had the money to buy them for a long time a negro maid in a white cap took our wraps and rita asked me what id like to drink scotch will do me fine ill have the same sit down there by the fire pat i took a chair in front of the fireplace and rita came over and stood by the mantel pausing on the way to arrange a vase on the grand piano when the drinks came she nodded to me over her glass lifted it and set it down almost empty something tells me thats quite a bit better than they serve in sandstone yes i said it is dont be so sensitive about it she said we went into your background thoroughly pat believe it or not were extremely careful about whom we hire in the highway department you must be i said and she chuckled i think youll get along all right pat if youll come to your senses have you found yourself a new sponsor yet burkmans out you know no i said i didnt know he was out oh yes losing the election is only a formality we werent positive when we took you on and we never put the lid on until we are positive fortunately for you and a lot of others i said well were the largest of all the departments we have the most jobs that enables us the top handful to perpetuate ourselves if we see a likely looking candidate we may start handing him patronage even though the election is a year off when we see a man on the downgrade we shake him we kick his jobholders out we lick him with his own people and let the new man in weve shaken burkman and youre kicking his people out weve kicked them out all except you i thought we might make a trade with you what kind of a trade i said a job for some information i dont have any information you could use im probably a better judge of that than you are were curious we think there may be straws in the wind that we cant see docs taken a lot of trouble with you hes pretty good at playing both ends against the middle himself whats the answer i shook my head i hardly knew her this was going too far too fast i dont know the answer i said and i couldnt tell you if i did doc took me out of sandstone and he could send you back yes but i dont need threats to keep me from doublecrossing my friends she nodded smiling a little as if shed expected me to say that i think a stretch in the penitentiary might do a lot of my acquaintances some good pat well you can have the job anyway another drink no thanks i said and perhaps youd better not let me keep the job nonsense she said youre being melodramatic if you can pick up any valuable information around there ill split the proceeds with you no the only way youll be able to help doc is to give him part of your salary ill be glad to do that i said youre planning to stay with us then i wondered you see we watch car transfers very closely i thought you might be going away no maam i said its an old car ijust bought it to knock around in oh i understood that you were keeping the state car after hours i am i said what ill probably do is fix up the one i bought in my spare time and resell it i see i couldnt leave miss kennedy id be breaking my parole so i understood she said i wondered if you did youd have a great deal to lose by leaving pat what would you gain nothing im not leaving she smiled shaking her gray head slightly have you read a book called sappho pat no yes alphonse daudet wasnt it the hero had strong obligations too if you remember a career a proud family and all he had to gain was a harlot an unusually lovely harlot but arent they all when a man falls in love with them i dont know what youre talking about i said im talking about mrs luther i said oh and i think i sighed inwardly with relief it would be very easy for you to be in love with her i wouldnt blame you at all but im not she couldnt have heard anything if there was that much talk if it had already got to her what would you do if i called you a liar well i smiled from you id take it consider it said then youre the worst possible kind of liar all right i said if i were you id do a great deal of thinking doc has never made any impression upon me except in a slippery sort of way but hes gone through a lot for that wife of his and he wont give her up easily theres a blind spot in every man theres something hed kill for leave mrs luther alone dont have anything to do with her and dont let her have anything to do with you maybe i hesitated maybe i dont see what youre driving at miss kennedy mrs luther is inclined a little to make up to a man whether the man is interested or not that isnt what i mean well will you have another drink im going to have to start dressing in about five minutes no thank you i got up i appreciate your talking to me miss kennedy i said but you seem to have heard something that just isnt true someones been misrepresenting me to you i said no one misrepresents anything to me well i dont blame you for not wanting to stick your neck out but if theres talk going around goodnight pat this conversation was strictly between us you dont need to worry about that what do i need to worry about goodnight she smiled but she sounded angry or rather disgusted it was almost as if she said good god i rode back downstairs and jumped in the car slamming the door after me it was late now and the rain made the night darker i didnt know he was there until he spoke until a match flared and raised up to a face beneath a slouchbrimmed hat i recognized him just in time to keep from swinging or rather to stop the swing id started that i said settling back on the seat is a good way of getting killed mr eggleston there is no good way of getting killed mr cosgrove i see your point though i didnt realize i was quite so invisible how did you find me find you you mean youre trying to avoid discovery you know what i mean yes well it wasnt a task that strained my professional capabilities whoever got your parole would have strong political connections those connections would almost certainly be used in getting you a job a few hours of observation a few discreet inquiries and here i am you followed me from the capitol so i thought it would be better say than calling you at dr luthers i turned the switch key and stepped on the starter his cigarette arced down to the floor and i heard his heel grind it out i heard something else too going some place mr cosgrove i thought id drive some place where we could talk i said we can talk very well here but drive on if you like i only hope you will do nothing that will make it necessary for me to shoot you hell i laughed and i shut off the motor why would i do anything like that because you might feel i was dangerous to you whereas im actually your buckler and your shield i have much more to sell you than silence something even more golden from any standpoint lets hear it i said a question or two first and please for your own sake be very accurate with your answers number one what prompted dr luther to get your parole did you talk with him while he was visiting sandstone or i wrote him a letter him and probably a hundred others he was the only one to respond oh good very good you had no acquaintance with him whatsoever right right i said ive already told you that question number two how long was it after you wrote this letter before dr luther acted in your behalf i dont know exactly as i say it was one of a number of letters and i didnt keep track of them i think it must have been around three months i think it must have been too mr cosgrove in fact id take an oath on it now just a minute i said how do you know that because the time corresponds with another act a series of acts i should say by dr luther acts which provide the motive for your parole now question number three has anything happened which would incline you to believe that you might be forced into a disastrous quarrel with dr luther yes i said mrs luther mrs luther i dont believe ive had the pleasure of meeting the lady is she a raving beauty the kind to successfully inspire a mortal quarrel not for my money i said but a lot of men would be crazy about her youve probably seen her type tall blonde beautiful and a bum he grunted with surprise it seemed but when he spoke it was in his usual flat monotone well thats about all mr cosgrove except for a rhetorical question have you dwelt any on the fact that dr luther is now approaching the end of his political career and that he must have seen the beginning of that end at about the time he received your letter ive thought about it a great deal i said and all right i said im curious im more than curious what have you got to tell me nothing more mr cosgrove until im convinced in a very concrete manner that my words will be appreciated how much five hundred i havent got it a technicality you can get it any man whos done as much time as you have in a place like sandstone knows how to get money you think im going to i think youre going to do whatever is necessary to get that five hundred what are you going to tell me for the five hundred the answer to your riddle how to keep patrick cosgrove alive and at liberty when you know what i know and make certain parties acquainted with that fact your troubles will vanish even as the legendary snowball in hell im pretty much mixed up i said i dont see how how soon do you want the money not later than tomorrow night say six oclock that isnt much time i dont think you have very much mr cosgrove from the way things are shaping up i think your time is running out very fast unless you know what i know by tomorrow night i dont think it will be of much value to you or to me but six oclock i said something might come up that i couldnt get away that early could you make it after dinner around eight that will be after dark he said the other tenants will be out of their offices what of it thats right what ill be expecting trouble from you expecting it mr cosgrove so i wouldnt bring anything with me if i were in your place but the money oh hell i laughed what would it get me eight oclock then ill be there ill be there before eight ill be there when you get back from your dinner doc was backing his car out as istepped off the porch and i stood and waited for him to pass he stopped and called to me smiling hows the job going pat he said havent kicked you out yet have they why no i said showing a proper amount of surprise at the question were they supposed to maybe not it may be a little early yet they havent said anything to you about burkman eh not a word i shook my head is there some trouble weell he hesitated nothing that you need to worry about well have to get you a new sponsor but that shouldnt be difficult any number of the boys should be glad to come through for you fine i said im glad to hear it but i suspect we should be getting you a little better acquainted suppose you make it a point to be on hand tomorrow night around eight oclock im having a group in at that time i said id be there with a sigh of relief i watched him back out the driveway and drive off if hed said tonight at eight i couldnt have met eggleston and ill missed out on that it would have been far better for me if i had missed out i drove out to the capitol building circled around it and headed back toward town i backtracked on my trail several times making sure that no one was following me and reached the business district in about an hour there i put the car on a parking lot and went to a picture show i left the show by a side street exit ate lunch and spent a couple of hours at the public library after that i did some shopping i bought a small but strong pair of wire snips a roll of adhesive tape a pair of gloves and a pocket flashlight all in different stores i went into a public toilet unwrapped the articles and stowed them away in my pockets i came out to the street again and sauntered slowly toward the market district it was now a little after five in the afternoon cattycornered to the building in which eggleston had his offices was a workingmans bar it was a grimy unattractive place unpleasantly but effectively advertised by its odor of stale beer and fried fish i wouldnt have eaten in it for pay and i was sure eggleston wouldnt i sat down at the bar near the entrance and ordered a drink i glanced out the flyspecked window the view wasnt as good as id liked to have had i could see the windows of egglestons offices but i couldnt see the entrance to the building that was on the side street back near the alley i sipped my drink waiting watching his office windows i didnt think hed seen through my plan it seemed to me that if he had hed have said so since it would get him nothing to let me go ahead he might not go out to dinner of course in that case id have to think of something else at six oclock lights started coming on in the building some of them stayed on but most went off after a few minutes the shades at egglestons windows were drawn and i had to stare hard to determine whether the lights were on or not at last around sixthirty when it was getting dark i saw the broken lines of light around the shades i saw them just in time to see them disappear that left all the offices on his floor dark it was better than i had hoped for i waited fifteen minutes more then left the bar there were two elevators in the building but only one was running at this time of night i began looking at the office directory help you with somethin mister i shook my head without looking around he muttered something under his breath and his stool creaked as he sat down again then the elevator signal buzzed and he said goddam and he got up and rattled the control going up mister i didnt say anything and i didnt look around he banged the door shut and the car went up i jerked open the door to the stairs and raced up them at the third floor landing i heard the elevator coming down and i waited until its lights flashed on the foyer and disappeared then i ran down the corridor and around the corner jerking the gloves over my hands egglestons outer office the reception room had a long pebbleglassed transom extending from the wall to the door casing a short metal chain at each end allowed it to hang open a few inches i cut the chains with the wire snips and let the transom drop gently inward i swung myself up and through the opening i landed inside swinging my feet just in time to avoid crashing down on a chair i pushed the chair beneath the transom climbed up on it and took out the adhesive tape i moved the transom back in its original position and taped the chains together again i sat down and rested my wrist watch said seven oclock now eggleston had been gone approximately thirty minutes since our appointment was for eight hed hardly return before another half hour that left me a lot of time to do what i started to light a cigarette then put the package and the match back in my pocket he might notice the smoke someone might notice the flare of the match i turned the pencilbeam of the flashlight on my watch again thirty minutes or more and not much to do but wait i didnt know what to look for at any rate hed hardly leave anything like this on paper it would be in his head something he could tell me i wondered how hard it would be to make him talk i hefted the wire snips and stood up how close to the door could i stand without being seen against the glass and which side would be best to stand on here on the left or on the other side where i could be behind it when it opened probably here he might sense something and hed be armed i might not be able to get out from behind the door fast enough i sat down and waited and gradually i felt my head turning toward the right toward the door of the inner office it was closed and the office was dark and of course he wasnt there he wouldnt be sitting in there in the dark he hadnt expected me to do what ihadso why would he be there i thought that one over and my head kept turning toward the door and finally i got up and walked over to it and turned the knob it was unlocked i pushed it open slowly i ducked back and flattened myself against the partition and then i moved away from it and stepped inside and flicked on the flashlight the beam moved across the desk he was bent forward a little on his elbows his hands lay on top of each other carelessly and the chair was drawn close to the desk holding his body against it he wouldnt be talking that night or any other he was through talking for all time i knew what had happened before i looked at his head he had pulled the chair up close to the desk and put his elbows on it because he had wanted to count something money and that was the natural way to do it he had sat there counting his suspicions lulled by the fact that the money had been paid quietly without argument and then the person the man or woman who had handed it over so readily i moved the flashlight i couldnt see his face his chin was resting on his chest and his hat was pulled too low but i could see his head even with the hat on part of it was oozing right out through the crown of the hat hed never known what hit him i wasnt sorry he was dead id seen good men killed for no reason and he hadnt been good or even fair hed meant to collect from both sides from one for keeping quiet and from the other from me for talking i might have foreseen that he would try that the murderer had i walked around the desk and opened a drawer there was nothing in it but a pipe a can of tobacco and a halfempty pint of cheap whiskey if there was anything significant in the thin file of letters the dogeared ledger or the several dozen receipted and unreceipted bills i didnt know what it was probably there wasnt anything i felt his pockets as best i could without moving him i found a few pads of matches a wallet containing his credentials and six dollars a package and a half of cigarettes and a fullyloaded automatic i put those things back where id found them and looked down at the desk there was nothing on it but a daytoday calendar the date showing was the following day i didnt think anything of it for a moment i turned away and looked around the room carefully trying to find i dont know what i was trying to find i looked down at the calendar again and then it came to me it wasnt a mistake this was one day that eggleston wouldnt have slipped up on i flipped back one of the little white leaflets there was the date today and scrawled across it were two notations mrs luth p cos i pulled it loose from the staples and tore it into shreds i went through the expired calendar slips and tore off a dozen or more of them i dropped them into the sink burned them into ashes and flushed them down the drain one missing slip might mean something a number of missing ones wouldnt the phone rang and i jumped i moved back from it automatically and then i lifted it up let it bang against the desk and held the receiver against my ear i waited and whoever was calling waited at last there was a whisper mr eggleston i couldnt tell whether it was a man or a woman you cant tell with whispers the same i whispered back i cant talk very loud mr eggleston im in the same position that sounded like him i hoped im sorry i couldnt keep our appointment mr eggleston personally was it all right im afraid it isnt i whispered im afraid ill have to insist that you come down thats impossible i didnt say anything why is it necessary for me to come down i think you know why you got the money didnt you you were taken care of it wasnt going to work i wasnt going to get him or her to come down that left only one thing to do startle that whisper into a recognizable voice yes i said in a deeper whisper im all taken care of im sitting here with the top of my head bashed in dead that didnt work either there was a short silence then the receiver at the other end of the wire went down with a bang i pushed egglestons body back from the desk and searched it thoroughly i might as well i knew now because i couldnt leave it here the time of death couldnt be fixed exactly thirty minutes or an hour would be about as close as the police could come to it and that since the real murderer would have a foolproof alibi left me the only suspect there was a chance that the elevator boy wouldnt remember my loitering around the lobby there was chance that he couldnt describe me if he did remember but i a man on parole a man with a criminal record couldnt take those chances someway id have to get the body out of the building hide it the river would probably be best my search produced nothing but a few keys some coins and another partly filled package of cigarettes i dropped them back into his coat pocket and stood back studying him hed bled very little and that had been absorbed by his hat and hair he wasnt bleeding at all now there were no stains to clean up nothing to do but get him out of there that was all i tested the outer door and found it unlocked i could have walked in instead of climbing i glanced at the snipped chains of the transom they would be discovered and arouse comment but without the body they didnt mean anything in time of course egglestons absence would arouse inquiries but by that time i hoped i would have the riddle of dr luther solved i would know what eggleston had known and hence who had killed him but that was something to work out later when perhaps i had more to work on right now egglestons body had to be got out of there i opened the door glanced out and let it close again going back into the other office i picked the body up in my arms carried it to the door and pulled it open with my fingers it was still clear outside the other offices were quiet and dark i let the door close behind me and walked swiftly down the corridor to the turn i stuck my head around it all clear there too i broke into a trot moving as rapidly as i could with the dead weight i was carrying i reached the elevators and set the body down in front of the door of the unused one panting i pressed the signal button my car was parked two blocks away i needed a total of at least five minutes two minutes to get there a minute to get the car off the lot two minutes to get back just five minutes i heard the elevator door clang at the bottom of the shaft cables whined i flattened myself against the wall and waited light bobbled on the corridor as the elevator moved past and then came back to the landing the door rattled and banged open going down came a sullen snarl i held my breath clenched my fist into a hard leathercovered ball going he stuck his head out ugh my fist came up hammerlike beneath his chin his head went back and then he toppled straight forward i caught him stretched him out on the floor of the car and felt his heart the beat was fast but steady aside from a cut lip where his teeth had snapped into it he wasnt hurt the door had closed automatically i opened it again holding it with my foot while i reached out and dragged eggleston inside a moment later having worked out the simple controls of the elevator i brought it to a stop between two floors i sank down on the stool brushing the sweat from my eyes almost instantly the memory of that automatic door brought me back to my feet i couldnt prop the door open while i went after my car not with a dead man in one corner and a senseless one in another there might not be much traffic in the building at night but obviously there was some otherwise an elevator wouldnt be in operation feeling through the operators pockets i found what i was looking for something id seen used at various times it was a short thin piece of metal rod an elevator key thrust through two small overlapping holes in the elevator doors it permitted them to be opened from the outside i dropped it into my pocket shut off the lights and slowly lowered the car to the first floor looking through the small glass door panel i saw that the lobby was empty i stepped out and the door snapped shut and i hurried away when i got back i made a careful left turn and drew up just short of the building entrance the street was unlighted the only illumination came from the dimmed lights of the lobby i set the throttle so that the motor was barely turning over then easing the left door off the catch i slid out the right one leaving it open behind me i stepped toward the entrance and i stopped my heart stopped for a moment someone was in there pounding on the elevator door pounding and now shouting i forced myself to walk on i walked on slowly glancing inside as i passed i couldnt get a good look at him and he didnt look in my direction at all he was too busy with his angry pounding and kicking on the elevator door i waited a moment at the alley and turned and walked back again time id run over my margin of safety minutes ago even without that pounding the elevator operator was due to come to his senses any moment and if it kept on if i couldnt get in there the racket rose to a thunderous crescendo then it stopped and footsteps crossed the lobby and there was another sound the slamming of the door to the stairs hed given up hed decided to walk i ran for the entrance glancing up and down the street all clear thank god this building was where it was that this was a side street racing through the lobby i yanked the elevator key from my pocket and jammed it through the overlapping holes in the door from inside the car came a steady rattling buzz signal buttons someone wanted to come down several people from the sound of things probably some of them had already started to walk down were already on the stairs and i couldnt wait thered be more what if i was penned up there with a dead man and something was holding the door of the car pressing against it it wouldnt open it opened a few inches but but the clatter of the signals was growing louder and above it from somewhere upstairs i heard the vicious slamming of a door then another then voices calling to each other and the hollow echo of footsteps coming downward the door slid open another agonizing inch i dropped the key got both hands into the opening and threw everything i had into one gigantic tug it grated and groaned and then it shot open and the elevator operator sagged through it hed revived partly hed been leaning against the door holding it with his weight he fell forward knees limp head down igave him a swinging right he shot backward into the car struck the back wall and fell faceforward to the floor too hard i hadnt meant to hit him so hard but no time to think of that now no time to look at him i lifted egglestons body i clawed the door open with one hand and staggered outside only seconds now only a few seconds to get the body into the car and get away the steps on the stairs were rushing downward theyd passed the second floor any moment the lobby door would open and i ran toward the entrance only a few feet to go out of the lobby and across the walk into the car only a few feet and and i couldnt make them i couldnt go back and i couldnt go forward someone had stepped into the entrance a blueuniformed cop he had been looking at something down the street as he stepped into the entrance and his head was still turned now i stopped dead in my tracks paralyzed for the moment with shock and fear then as his head started to turn toward me i acted i did the only thing there was to do i ran forward and hurled the body at him it struck him high in the chest obstructing his vision i hoped and bowling him over backwards he yelled and grappled with it blindly and i darted around to one side and sprang for the car i brought my foot down on the accelerator grabbing at the doors they banged shut and the motor stuttered and roared and the car leaped ahead as i shot past the entrance i caught a confused picture of two figures rolling on the sidewalk and another running toward them from the lobby then i was out of that block and in the middle of the next one nearing the second intersection and the speed indicator read seventy miles an hour somehow i got control of myself i brought my foot down on the brake and the car skidded perilously i eased up on it for a split second then brought it down again at something near the legal speed limit i swept through the intersection fortunately there were no traffic lights this far down and very little traffic at least it was fortunate at that particular moment in the long run i knew safety would lie where the traffic was thickest i rolled on slower and slower breathing heavily nervous sweat rolling down into my eyes i turned left at the next corner entering an arterial street which led through the center of the downtown district not until then did i hear far to the rear of me the shrill clatter of a police whistle moving automatically with the traffic i drove through town i was safe but for how long and who could i turn to for help if i needed it if that cop had spotted my license plates or if the elevator operator could describe me wrapped in thought driving blindly i came out on the other side of the business district i passed an apartment house and suddenly i thought of hardesty he lived in this neighborhood and he wanted something from me the man who wants something is a good man to drive a trade with i found his address an apartment hotel near the park and parked my car across the street from it the lobby clerk was working the switchboard his back to me i got into the automatic elevator punched a button and rode up hardesty came to the door in a dressing gown he started to smile when he saw me then his eyes widened and the smile faded into a startled frown and he grabbed my shoulder abruptly and jerked me inside why the hell did you come here he snarled slamming the door havent you got sense enough to breaking off with an angry curse he strode across the room to a large radio and flicked the switch it burst into raucous sound and cursing again he turned down the volume listen he said curtly i listened additional information on the man who a few minutes ago beat an elevator operator in the haddon building unconscious murdered a tenant of the building and escaped after slugging a police officer with the dead mans body the murderer is about six feet four inches tall and has red hair his complexion is swarthy he is welldressed he is believed to be driving a latemodel coupe with an out of state license the elevator operator believes him to be the same man he saw loitering around the building earlier in the evening no motive is yet apparent for the radio switch clicked hardesty looked at me grinning smiling in affable apology sorry pat he said i was listening to that when you knocked and i thought well that red hair and all his voice trailed off and he frowned again oh he said softly so it was you im the man theyre looking for i nodded but i didnt kill anyone i found the body i was afraid the murder might be pinned on me so i tried to get it out of the building i gave him a brief account of what happened he listened absently with only a pretense of interest but his face cleared well he shrugged they seemed to have you tabbed wrong anyway even to the license on your car the only thing theyve got right is your hair and they cant haul in every redhaired man in town they can haul in all those who have criminal records i said and that elevator operator could identify me if he saw me again i doubt it he shook his head and how are the police going to know that the murderer had a criminal record no just sit tight for a few days keep out of that neighborhood and youll be all right three or four days from now that elevator jockey wouldnt know you even if you did have the bad luck to run into him i hope youre right i said im sure of it pat i know how those things go it would have been better of course if youd just walked out after you discovered the body but that cant be helped now sit down and have a drink i think you could use one now he said when he had poured two stiff drinks i wonder if there isnt something else you should tell me pat for instance i tossed down my drink and poured another one for instance how you happened to be in this detectives office i had an appointment with him i said i supposed you had he was going to tell me what this was all about why i was paroled from sandstone i see he sat with his arms on his knees bent forward a little the glass cupped in his hands there was a faint smile on his lips he was going to tell you something he got killed what conclusion would you draw from that you mean i shouldnt be curious thats exactly what i mean pat i i think youre wrong i said i think i should be a damned sight more curious than i have been the murder is proof that im playing blind in a game where a life means nothing before tonight i was just worried now i know that ive got to find out whats going on oh he said softly how do you propose to go about that pat ive already got an opening wedge mrs luther had an appointment ahead of me tonight i think its safe to assume that what eggleston knew was about her mmm he took a sip of the whiskey go on but she didnt keep that appointment she told someone else about it and whoever that was came and killed eggleston in other words her escort wasnt just important to her in fact i hesitated it wasnt as important to her as it was to others the murderer for example how he said do you figure that because she didnt handle it herself it wouldnt have meant enough to her to commit murder and murder had to be done therefore she wasnt allowed to keep the appointment i see good reasoning he nodded not very i said or you wouldnt say so it all rests on the assumption that it was mrs luther who telephoned there to the office tonight im sure now that it wasnt he laughed and made a pass at slapping me on the knee i drew my leg back this isnt getting you anywhere pat he said sobering i told you id straighten everything out for you when the proper time came now why dont you just forget it all for the present and well have a good talk some day soon when youre not so upset id like to know now i said what do you want with me you and doc and whoevers working with you im sorry pat i dammit i said youre going to have to tell me sometime you want me on your side of the fence and i cant be there unless i know your plans now what is it youre a very smart young man pat far too shrewd for my liking thanks i said and i wont be ready for you to act for several weeks yet probably a month or so if i explained things now well you see why i cant why take chances particularly when i dont have to i see i said you want to spring it on me suddenly without giving me a chance to think ill have to jump one of two ways and yours will look the best well pat you want me to kill doc i said why now pat he laughed nervously where do you get that idea all right i said ill kill him ive had about all i can take im going to do it tonight and then im skipping out pat he gripped my arm you mustnt not now i mean i i shook off his arm grinning at him not now i said but later thats it isnt it you do want me to kill him lets have the rest of it ive got nothing more to say pat youd better leave i nodded and got up and then my hand went out in a stiffarm and he shot backwards off of the ottoman i dived over the coffee table and on top of him straddling his chest i grabbed up a whiskey glass and struck the rim against the coffee table part of it fell away and i gripped it by the base holding the long jagged splinters above his face his eyes rolled and he stopped squirming all right i said im waiting this he gasped this wont get you anywhere pat talk dont talk said a voice behind me and something hard and round and cold pressed against the back of my neck betcha ill shoot if you dont get up from there honey betcha i dropped the glass and stood up my hands raised i turned around she was grinning that cute crinkled grin and her brown eyes were dancing with gay good humor whatsa matter baby arent ums glad to see mama god i said god almighty poor poor baby so sweet and trusting and obliging with madeline and all for a little petting he didnt even get to sleep with her no i said i didnt ive got that to be thankful for at least tsk tsk she said grinning again sour grapes dont you think so bill very sour said hardesty he had risen from the floor and kicked the glass into the fireplace and now he moved over to her side and put his arm around her she leaned against him her crisp brown hair brushing against his neck she took his hand into one of hers and raised it up and pressed it tightly against her breast there she said comfortably hold the gun will you bill it makes my lil fingers tired hardesty took the gun and dropped it into his pocket we wont need that he said pats ready to listen to reason arent you pat reason i said reason im sorry boy he said and he sounded like he meant it some things you can only do the hard way and this is one of them youve never had a chance youve been licked from the start so i see i said dully doc knows youve been seeing madeline you were supposed to see her you were bound to see that something was wrong to be disturbed about it it was madelines job to keep you from taking any action let you take it out in talk more or less never mind i said i understand i guess ive understood from the beginning i just wouldnt let myself believe it was true madelines grin faded i didnt want to hurt you pat i didnt want you to get hurt i told you to see me before you did anything and you promised you would if youd kept that promise this wouldnt have happened i dont think youd better say any more i said im afraid if you keep on talking to me ill try to kill you and nothing will stop me but being killed you dont want that yet it would spoil your plans hardesty shook his head sympathetically we are sorry pat believe me i hope theres no hard feelings over her i laughed shortly all right im going now like another drink first no i said and i started for the door madelines voice stopped me wait pat no wait this is business bill maybe we should tell him now that car im worried about that doc shouldnt have bought it so soon you mean the one for for pats birthday hardesty made a gesture of disgust of course he shouldnt have but you know doc hes always got to be a jump ahead of everyone else even if he jumps in the ditch but this is different he wouldnt go in for gestures at a time like this ive got a feeling that nonsense this arnholt deal breaks tomorrow night itll take him at least a month to wind it up follow it through the legislature and collect how could he he their eyes met and he jerked his head at me she nodded slowly i suppose youre right well be in a terrible spot if you arent of course im right said hardesty pat i dont want to seem discourteous but perhaps i heard a suppressed laugh as i went out the door i drank a great deal of whiskey that night and the more i drank the more sober i became around midnight when the stuff was virtually running out my ears i went into the bathroom and vomited for what seemed like hours when it was all out of me i started drinking again and i kept on until i fell asleep in this fine house i went to bed drunk with my clothes on for the first time in my life a long hot and cold shower and a close shave did wonders toward pulling me together afterwards i had one short drink and got the morning paper from beneath the door egglestons picture and a halfcolumn story about him were on the front page since the dead man had not been robbed it was believed that the private detective long a familiar figure in divorce court proceedings may have unearthed secrets which someone probably a client felt it unsafe for him to know im almost certain that our tall redhaired stranger and the murderer are the same man det lt rube hastings declared probably he only intended to throw a scare into egglestonjudging by his actions id say that was what he had in mind he walked up to the office fearing perhaps that the elevator operator might want to accompany an afterhours caller but he didnt mind being seen by the operator as he would have if hed contemplated murder something made him decide that hed have to kill eggleston or perhaps he lost his temper then he realized that hed have to get the body out of the building the time of death could be approximated and his presence in the building could be established the only solution was to remove the body and hide it the facts that the murderer apparently was well acquainted with eggleston and feared identification prove that he is a local man who intends to remain here according to hastings he was unable to explain why a permanent resident of the city was driving a car with an outofstate license but he wouldnt be unable to explain very long not if he was only half as bright as this story made him out to be this was capital city there were hundreds of cars here with official license plates the white plates with the square s at each end that cop last night had only got a glimpse of my plates and hed put them down as belonging to some other state but he wouldnt be long in changing his mind having it changed by det lt hastings i got the wallet out of my trousers and counted the money it contained only nine dollars but there was a hundred and fifty more in the drawer of my writing desk doc had said it would be right there until he could get time to go to the bank with me a hundred and fiftynine dollars i could travel quite a ways on that if i had to i took a look at the clock scooped up the clothes i had worn the night before and put them in the closet the elevator operator had said i was wearing a dark suit it was blue black shoes they were tan and a gray hat correct i laid out a brown hat a light gray suit and brownandwhite oxfords i finished dressing and picked up the paper again another frontpage picture and story caught my eye phalanx leader speaks tonight fanning arnholt president of the national phalanx and authority on subversive activities will open his statewide lecture series tonight with an address at in orpheum hall speaking on our schools battleground of the underground arnholt is expected to launch an allout attack on a large group of textbooks which he claims are subversive his appearance here is sponsored by local chapters of the phalanx the scarlet poison of unamericanism is flowing unchecked through the educational arteries of this great state the noted patriotic leader declared upon his arrival here last night the antidote is an aroused citizenry which will force its legislative representatives into the proper and drastic action so that docs crowd could make one last raid on the treasury i tossed the paper aside and got up to help henry with the breakfast tray i told him to take everything back but the toast orange juice and coffee he fidgeted around the table uncomfortably doing everything twice something on your mind henry i asked well he hesitated you know that money you had mr cosgrove there in your desk i nodded what about it well dont know whether you noticed yet or not but its gone dr luther took it i thought id better tell you in case it slips his mind since willie and i are in your room so much i understand i said did the doctor say why he was taking it no sir he just came in while i was cleaning up yesterday and got it thanks i said thanks for telling me henry i wont mention that you said anything he gave me a grateful smile and left i sat down at the table and munched at a piece of toast nine dollars nine instead of a hundred and fiftynine sipping my suddenly tasteless orange juice i knew what his explanation would be without looking around i knew something else that he was there in the room with me i dont know whether henry had left the door ajar or whether he had opened it very quietly but he was standing there leaning against the wall staring at me ref lectively through the thickrimmed glasses i poured coffee took a swallow of it and halfturned my head good morning doc coffee good morning pat he said tiredly no thanks he crossed to the bed and sat down i turned my back again and went on with my breakfast listening to the rattle of the newspaper pat yes doc i took the money you had in your desk i thought wed get that bank account opened for you fine i said i wont be able to get down today though maybe we can make it tomorrow fine i repeated for i had expected that and what else was there for me to say the paper rattled again and there was another long silence i drank my coffee and waited waited for him to read the story about eggleston to reread it perhaps and then stare at me looking at my hair and my clothes and remembering that i had been out late last night his voice was overly casual when he spoke thats a nicelooking outfit you have on pat i dont believe ive seen you in it before thank you i said i thought id put on something light with the weather getting so warm i heard him light a cigarette i even heard his slow meditative puffing why dont you drive your own car today pat the batterys apt to run down if you dont drive it once in a while i think i will i said you can put the state car here in the garage thank you ill do that he didnt speak again until i was drinking the last of my coffee coffee that i didnt want by the way pat that group im having in tonight id like to use your room for them if you dont mind anything you say doc i said well have to shift the furniture around a bit bring in some other chairs and so on if you can get your dinner outside itll give us a chance to get everything ready before our guests get here ill be glad to help i said no no henry and willie can take care of everything just drop in at eightthirty or a few minutes before rather well be listening to a radio program and i dont want anyone coming in after its started i nodded and turned around he got up from the bed and sauntered toward the door his eyes shifting so that they avoided mine its a tough world isnt it pat he said in a tired flat voice i used to think so said until you came along what do you mean by that he flicked me a sharp glance i was referring to all youd done for me i said the clothes the job the car the home the well the friendship youve given me unselfishly simply because i needed help how can i feel its a bad world as long as theres a man like you in it a slow flush spread over his face his lower lip drew back from beneath the protruding teeth see you tonight pat he said abruptly and the door slammed behind him i called rita kennedys office i heard the sharp intake of her breath as i identified myself ive got some more of the forms ready i said i wonder if youd like me to bring them in today i dont bother she said just forget about them and leave your car at home well send someone to pick it up in a day or two oh i said you mean im fired im sorry pat your check will be drawn up as of the close of business last night were unable to keep a man like you on the payroll that that isnt any reflection on your work you understand i understood thered been inquiries already and rita had answered them truthfully a tall redhaired man no we have no one like that when will i receive the check i asked itll be several days im afraid i wouldnt wait on it im broke miss kennedy i said broke she said oh good lord and then the concern went out of her voice and it was as clipped and curt as it had been at our first meeting thats too bad pat ive done all i can much more than i should have i know i said i appreciate it dont bother to thank me for it ever i havent really done anything i cant be expected to remember everyone who ever worked for us of course not i said goodbye miss kennedy pat yes maam why did you do it i didnt but ill never be able to convince anyone of the fact did it have something to do with doc something i said but i dont know what there was a short disbelieving laugh and then the click of the receiver that ended me with rita kennedy as far as she was concerned i no longer existed it was too late now to turn to myrtle briscoe i couldnt go to her now with a rap for murder hanging over me i drove downtown cruising slowly past the building where eggleston had had his offices there wasnt anything to see there of course it was just something to do some way of killing part of the long day ahead of me perhaps the last day of freedom id have if id had my way id have stayed at the house but doc had made it very clear that he didnt want me there before tonight and going back would mean bringing on a showdown i was going to have to face one very soon but there was no sense in jumping toward it if doc was certain that i was going to be washed up hed be the first man to throw a bucket of water hed feel that he had to regardless of what his plans had been for me i turned the corner and idled the car up the street i didnt feel like seeing a show i didnt want to go to the library i didnt want a drink either but i had to do something iran the car on a parking lot waiting in it while the attendant parked another car he came hustling up to me a big smile on his face and then the smile froze and i knew that that was the last place in town i should have come to yessir he said trying to keep his voice casual how long you going to be sir just long enough to get a tire fixed i said you fix them dont you well uh he hesitated staring at me well how about it i said irritably i havent got all day uh some of the suspicion went out of his face and a flush of anger replaced it i can get it fixed for you mister you leave your car here and i can have someone come and fix it oh hell isaid ive got no time for that routine wheres a garage near here yyou you work for the state mister work for the state i snorted would i be driving a wreck like this if i worked for the state now do you know where i can get a tire fixed or not he shook his head not in answer to my question but to the one in his mind i wasnt the same guy he wasnt going to be a hero i said something under my breath about dumbbells just loud enough for him to hear it a couple of cars drove in just then and he didnt have a chance to say anything more and i didnt have to he trotted off sullenly and i drove away within the next ten minutes i drove a good five miles away i picked a quiet residential street brought the car down to a steady fifteen miles an hour and turned the radio to catch the police calls i drove and listened until noon and nothing came over the air they werent looking for me yet around noon i stopped at a drivein and had a hamburger and a bottle of beer in the car the check brought my nine dollars down to less than eightfifty it also started me to thinking again about that one hundred and fifty that doc had appropriated the more i thought about it the more certain i became that hed taken the money to keep me from running away hed never intended to open any bank account for me and he didnt now and then something had happened or was going to happen that made it unsafe for me to have that money longer it couldnt have anything to do with eggleston since he couldnt have foreseen how id be involved in that and the only thing impending was the fanning arnholt scheme so somehow he must be intending to use me in that i was going to be used and not several weeks from now but tonight i grinned to myself thinking of madeline and hardesty this was going to spoil their plans the thing was going to explode on them before they were ready for it and theyd have to do their own dirty work whatever it was instead of dragging me in on it they werent going to like that not a bit hardesty in particular with the secure and respectable position he held in the city was going to hate being caught with his neck out thered be a blowup between him and doc and madeline i might get enough to clear myself of egglestons murder i wondered how doc was going to wind up the arnholt scheme tonight something that even i could see should take two or three weeks and i remembered those rare outofcharacter glimpses id had of him as on my first night out of sandstone and i knew exactly how he was going to wind it up i felt certain that this if nothing else would bring on a quarrel with madeline and hardesty madeline i tried not to think about her when i thought about her i hated myself because well i couldnt hate her i couldnt no matter what shed done or might do and i knew i never could slowly the afternoon passed i drove around until three and had more beer at another drivein and then i did more driving still sticking to the residential streets and around five oclock i stopped at a neighborhood bar and restaurant i sat down at the end of the bar and had a ham sandwich potato salad and coffee it was a small sidestreet place and i was the only customer my ankles ached from the days almost steady driving i decided to kill some of my remaining time there after id eaten i had a brandy and dropped a few nickels in the juke box i rolled dice with the bartender for drinks and won once and lost twice by seven oclock i was pretty well relaxed as relaxed as i could be under my circumstances and then the cop came in he was a big lumbering fellow with a broad red face and he had little round unblinking eyes he came through the door slowly twirling his club as though it were an extension of his fingers and stopped at the front of the bar he looked the place over walls ceiling floor and fixtures studying it as if he might be considering its purchase then he lumbered down to us the bartender finished his roll and passed the cup to me i picked it up numb fingered and the cop swung the club up caught it and pointed it over his shoulder that your coupe out there yes i said easing my feet off the stool rungs its mine buy it new no how long you had it not very long i said he stared at me blankfaced the club came down and began to twirl again whatd you pay for it a hundred and seventyfive whod you buy it from capital car sales he caught the club under his arm took a pencil from the side of his cap and a notebook from his hip pocket he wrote in the book his lips moving with the movement of his hand he closed it returned it to his hip and replaced the pencil in its clip been lookin for a good cheap coupe he said think ill go down and see them people and then he turned and lumbered out the club spinning and twirling at his finger tips i had two more drinks stiff ones and got out of there at eightfifteen i turned up the long wooded drive which led to dr luthers house three blocks from the house a convertible was parked against the curb i was swinging out to pass it when a woman stepped into the beam of my headlights and held up her arm lila oh pat she said as i stopped beside her im so glad you came along i seem to be out of gas thats too bad i said if youll steer your car ill push it home for you oh thats a lot of bother she said and she opened the door of my car and climbed in lets just leave it here ill send one of the boys back after it i closed the door for her but i didnt drive on she could have walked home in five minutes why wait for me for obviously she had waited for me i turned and looked at her and she smiled at me brightly in the darkness well pat hadnt we better be going doc told you to wait there for me lila i said why now what are you talking about pat she laughed i told you i was out of gas do you know what youre doing lila or are you just running blind doing as youre told she shook her head not answering lila i said i think youre pretty straight i think youd like to be straight but youre mixed up in something damned bad if you keep on the same thing that happened to eggleston may happen to you eggleston her voice was puzzled whos he you know who he was the private detective i dont know anyone named eggleston any private detectives dont hand me that i said you had an appointment with him last nightand he was murdered murdered she said blankly and i had an appointment with him youre joking pat i grabbed her by the arms and started to shake her and then i let go and slid under the wheel again yes i said i was joking now ill drive you home i really dont know anything about it honest i dont no i nodded you dont egglestons appointment was with mrs luther youre not mrs luther she gasped and whirled on me thats not true why why she laughed a little hysterically i never heard of such a thing all right then i said well say that you are mrs luther youre docs wife and marriage doesnt mean a thing to you youre docs wife and you killed eggleston last night or you had him killed that got her hit her hard from two directions it hurt her pride deeply and it frightened her even more yyou you guessed it she said at last i didnt tell you no i said you didnt tell me doc did he told me enough so that i should have seen it how did it start lila were you a patient of his nnot she shivered not at first i met him on the train years ago about ten years i guess it was when he was coming here for the first time i id been losing a lot of sleep and i thought i might be going crazy he talked with me and afterwards i felt better and when he opened his offices here i started consulting him i he found out what was worrying me what was it i kept my voice gentle sympathetic had you killed someone my husband i i didnt mean to i dont think i meant to but iguess that doesnt matter i was tired of waiting on him i suppose and igave him too much of the medicine they all said id killed him they couldnt prove anything but they kept saying it i had to leave there and doc picked up where your neighbors left off i said he convinced you that you had committed murder i imagine he even got you to admit it didnt he she turned and looked at me eyes widening you sound like like you dont think i of course you didnt do it intentionally i said doc wanted to use you so he made you believe youd killed your husband lets see if i know what happened then after he had you start posing as his wife he no need to guess about it pat she said and she told me how it had been doc had used her in a kind of high class badger game with the capital big shots he didnt take money money might have led to a charge of blackmail and at any rate the easy money crowd seldom had heavy cash assets so when doc caught his wife in a compromising situation with one of the big boys he simply demanded to be cut in on the political gravy that gave him his in enabled him to get out of the game fast for of course it couldnt be worked indefinitely as it was talk began to circulate that lila luther was too promiscuous to actually be so and that doc seemed jealous only when he could profit by it his victims couldnt charge him with blackmail but they could run him out of town if they learned the truth they could fix it so that even in the shadiest political circles no one could afford to become involved with him i guess thats why he hates me so much lila concluded its been years since ive been of any use to him but hes had to go on keeping me hes had to treat me as a man in his position would be expected to treat his wife i guess in the long run ive gotten a lot more from him than i got for him how have you felt about it lila i dont know pat she shrugged wearily i dont know any more put up a fight at first but then ijust kind of gave up im not very bright theres no point in telling you that theres no work im any good for and doc had that hold over me and well ijust gave up i didnt know what else to do do you know what docs plans are about fanning arnholt fanning arnholt she looked blank the textbook deal i dont know anything about it pat really i dont i threw a few more questions at her trying to trip her up but she was telling the truth she didnt know anything of docs plans she simply did as she was told and no questions asked ill tell you something i said and i want you to believe me lila youre on a hell of a spot almost as bad a spot as im on doc isnt going to be around any more after tonight youre going to be left alone without any money and probably even without a place to live and youre going to be right in the middle of one of the biggest scandals that ever hit capital city she turned on me startled then she laughed incredulously but how why i mean i cant explain now it would take too much time it wouldnt make sense to you but heres something to think about since you arent mrs luther who is who she laughed again why well no one i mean doc just made huhuh he didnt make the story up hed know it would be checked he was married under exactly the circumstances he said he was and his wife followed him here after he reestablished himself hes kept her out of the dirty work as much of it as he could and used you instead and now that the elections are going sour well what do you think is going to happen lila i she frowned trying to think and getting absolutely nowhere i dont tell me what to do pat you were supposed to pick me up here tonight yes i was supposed to make it look like like wed been out together it seemed like the showdown but i couldnt be positive and if i jumped the gun there wouldnt be any proof i could set the deal up only once and if it fell through id never get another chance tell me what to do pat i hesitated then i took a notebook and a pencil from my pocket do exactly what you first intended to i said but do this also when if i give you the nod excuse yourself and call this party tell her to go to i hesitated again to go to docs house no no he couldnt leave from there thered be things hed have to take with him clothing toilet articles and soon and he couldnt take them from the house tell her to come to this address and bring some help with her tell her to stake the place out and i ran through it a couple of times spelling it all out because it was simple enough but so was she i tore the page from my notebook watched her tuck it into her purse and stepped on the starter i drove on to the house i parked the car in the garage and opened the door for her she followed me up the drive lagging a few steps behind then as we neared the porch she caught up with me and linked her arm through mine she clung to it tightly letting her long soft hip brush against me we entered the hall and she pulled me around suddenly and kissed me on the mouth i grinned and patted her on the arm i didnt say anything i didnt wipe off the lipstick it was just eightthirty arm in arm we went down the hall and into my room there were about a dozen people in the room doc was there of course and hardesty then there was burkman flanders and kronup and a couple of the textbook men the others i didnt know although id seen most of them around the house or the capitol from time to time my bed had been pushed against the wall along with the desk table and reading stand doc was sitting on a stool in front of the radio the others were lounging in a halfcircle of chairs facing the instrument the air was blue with cigar and cigarette smoke everyone except doc had a glass in his hand lila and i sat down in two straight chairs the only unoccupied ones and for a moment every eye was on us and the room was completely silent every eye was on us and then on doc watching his startled scowl the protruding teeth that bared suddenly unconsciously it seemed in anger he stared at us turning the dial of the radio this is it he said slowly and the announcers quick falsely excited voice filled the room ladies and gentlemen we take you tonight to orpheum hall where mr fanning arnholt president of the national phalanx is speaking on our schools battleground of the underground as you doubtless know mr arnholt has long been in the vanguard of those alert and courageous citizens who are fighting the good battle against subversive influences he has then they were all staring at the radio which had suddenly gone dead i dont know doc shook his head at their unspoken question the things working all right it if you will stand by for just a moment it was the announcer again there seems to be mr arnholt was right here on the platform with me a moment ago but he seems to have been called away i wonder yes there he is now hes talking to some other gentlemen and he looks quite quite ill and stand by please the two textbook men looked at each other nervously someone said what the hell and there was a chorus of shhs i glanced at lila i nodded i hadnt known quite what to expect but i knew this was the beginning of it she got up and left the room quietly and i saw or thought i saw a peculiar look in docs eyes but he didnt say anything and no one else seemed to notice her departure they were all too interested in what was or wasnt coming from the radio it wasnt completely silent now we could hear the subdued roar of the audience and the sound of several voices apparently near the microphone two of them rose above the others but mr arnholt is the scheduled speaker isnt speaking were paying for time all right ill take over the microphone popped and rattled and the announcer came back again thank you for waiting friends due to the unforeseen circumstances which will be explained to you mr arnholt will be unable to address you tonight i will now turn your over to mr ralph edgars state president of the national phalanx if you please mr edgars thank you said another voice uh i didnt come here prepared to talk folks and im sorry that i have to its my job to tell you that i and the organization which i head in this state seem to have been pretty badly taken in he paused and cleared his throat and the audience was as absolutely silent as this room where we sat even i who had expected something like this leaned forward straining to hear a few minutes before mr arnholt was scheduled to speak tonight a number of documents or i should say photostats of documents were delivered to me on this stage i was amazed and dismayed to find that they cast serious doubts on mr arnholts motives for being here and on the entire series of talks he intended to make in this state briefly these documents tend to prove that mr arnholt was launching an attack on certain textbooks so that the books of rival firms might be adopted by the state in their place in the absence of any satisfactory explanation from mr arnholt they did prove that under the circumstances we local leaders of the phalanx cancel his talk and offer you our apologies for several reasons i will not now name the persons and firms who seem to be involved with mr arnholt in this swindle we have cleaned our own house or will clean it shortly it is not for us to take over the work of the courts however the names of these persons and firms will be made known to you shortly and proper action will be taken against them the documents the photostats in my possession will be presented to the state attorney general tomorrow morning and i am authorized to promise you that they will not be pigeonholed or forgotten i can promise you that doc snapped the radio off he swiveled around on the stool and waited hardesty was the first to speak for a moment he looked as sick and bewildered and frightened as any of the others but then his face tightened and he forced a laugh well he said there goes the ball game there it goes burkman nodded slowly there ggoes and his pot belly trembled and he put his hands over his eyes and began to cry flanders laughed harshly whatd i tell you doc didnt tell you that dumb sonof abitch would screw himself up and us in the bargain if youd spent the same money and effort in the regular channels how about the money anyway it was one of the textbook salesmen harry and me are both in for twentyfive hundred how the hell are we going to explain a deal like this to our companies we aint going to have to explain said the other one bitterly were washed up out we wont be able to sell a book in the southwest for the next twentyfive years kronup shook his finger at doc snarling moneys the smallest part of it were not only out and facin prosecution but theres no one we can turn to now or any time we aint going to be able to keep a finger in we aint going to be able to elect anyone thats halfway reasonable what youve done doc is put the whole damned reform crowd in office put em there for good and im sayin sonofabitch sobbed burkman ssonofabbitch will you shut up yelled flanders doc didnt i tell you that im talkin kronup shouted i say this phony psychologist made a deal i say he sold us out he shouted the accusation again for they were all talking now all shouting and snarling and growling at once frightened surly halfhysterical animals only doc and hardesty were silent hardesty was staring at doc a puzzled but bitter frown on his toohandsome face doc sat with his hands folded looking down at the floor his mouth was working he might have been muttering to himself he might have been but he wasnt i was beginning at last to read his expressions he was laughing his mouth stopped moving and he looked up he shook his head and the room grew quiet dont be a damned fool he said coldly to kronup how could i sell out what would i get out of it how could i make a deal with the reform crowd theres no way they could give me anything even if they wanted to but but nothing said doc anyway we dont know how much of the deal was spilled to edgars a very little would be enough to get arnholt and thats probably all edgars has hes trying to throw a bluff into us if we sit tight and keep quiet it may blow over there was a growl of dissent you dont believe that said flanders arnholts going to sing his head off regardless of what edgars has or hasnt got in the way of documentary proof its going to be enough to wash us up were through and you know it snuffled burkman angrily all we can do now is grab what we can before the ceiling falls in on us maybe youre right doc shrugged his quietness seemed to madden burkman he tried to speak and his throat choked with fury and then he was pointing at me shaking a trembling finger in my direction you got some kind of scheme youre pullin with that redhead there i dont know what it is but i know it must be good the trouble you went to gettin him out youre cuttin me in on it youre cutting all of us in on it corrected flanders im not said doc levelly cutting anyone in on it that deal is off im letting cosgrove return to sandstone tomorrow id been expecting that but the cold fact of its happening jolted me i lighted a cigarette and my hand trembled thats pretty sudden doc i said would you mind explaining if you need an explanation said doc his voice clipped ive done a great deal for you intended to do a great deal more and all ive asked of you is that you leave lila alone you wouldnt do it youve carried on an affair right in front of me recently you gave her the money to buy a car for you you intended to jump your parole and leave town with her leave me holding the bag both ways im beating you to the punch a low murmur went around the room kronup cleared his throat with embarrassment say thats too bad doc he said i been hearing things out around the capitol but of course youve heard things i said doc wanted you to hear them and there was a certain basis of truth in them lila did buy that car for me she has thrown herself at me ive known the talk was spreading but i didnt know what to do i well i know what to do said doc getting up from the stool gentlemen i suggest that we get together in the morning and see what can be done about this arnholt matter frankly i cant think clearly enough tonight to discuss it they began to get up brushing at their clothes and moving toward the door a few stared at me most of them deliberately avoided doing so for the moment docs problem had become paramount to theirs just a minute i said theres one thing you havent told these gentlemen doc lila isnt your wife the movement toward the door stopped abruptly they stared from me to doc and his jaw fell slack and then hardestys voice boomed out breaking the silence so what he demanded reasonably he couldnt get a divorce from his wife so he hasnt been able to marry lila that has no bearing on the matter shes been more to him than most wives are to their husbands yes said doc a great deal more well well all get along now said hardesty bluffly but id keep an eye on cosgrove if i were you he isnt going to like going back to sandstone ill keep an eye on him said doc they filed past him out the door they were in a hurry to get out now the news about lila had value some highly placed people would be very interested in hearing it they didnt know as i did that doc wasnt going to be around to face the music at last only hardesty and doc remained and doc took hardesty by the arm and urged him toward the door hardesty hung back i think id better have a little talk with pat let him know how things stand later said doc not looking at me not now i really think i dont give a damn what you think said doc ill do the explaining when the time comes for it right now i want to get away from here hardesty suddenly remembered something you blew this arnholt deal didnt you what the hell was the idea ill explain about that too said doc now come on were liable to have some callers as soon as that crowd starts telephoning we cant afford to get tied up here what about him hell keep said doc and he literally dragged hardesty through the door and slammed it i fixed myself a drink and sat down on the bed faintly i heard the last of the cars pulling away from the front of the house clearly a few minutes later i heard the smooth purr of docs sedan as it rolled out the driveway i finished my drink and lay back on the bed i felt very comfortable relaxed for the first time since id left sandstone id told lila to beat it as soon as she made the telephone call there was nothing to do now but take things easy i lay thinking grinning a little when i thought of the surprise that doc and hardesty were in for and then i thought of madeline and my grin went away regardless of what shed done i couldnt take any pleasure in what was going to happen to her i let my mind wander wishthinking wondering if i could be wrong about her after all she had suggested that i go to myrtle briscoe and lay my cards on the table she hadnt insisted on it but how could she when i obviously was as i was ready to do anything that would keep me out of sandstone she could be working with myrtle she could be and her actions with hardesty didnt prove that she wasnt shed have had to lead him on she couldnt let me beat the truth out of him perhaps even kill him she oh hell how crazy could a guy get shed been working in docs dirty racket for years and it was an easy step from that to but she might not have known what she was getting into doc would have pulled her into it a little at a time until she was in over her head i cursed and sat up things didnt happen that way they never had so why should they begin now my whole life had been fouled up the best i could hope for now was to keep my parole she was as rotten and crooked as the rest of them and shed have to suffer with the rest but i wished i could stop thinking about her almost twenty minutes had passed when willie tapped on the door and came in with the telephone he plugged it into the wall by the bed and handed it to me he went out as quietly as he had come in and i spoke into the mouthpiece i spoke and listened all right doc i said ill be right over i hung up the phone and took a last long look around the room then i got my car out of the garage and drove straight to madelines place i parked my car behind docs and went silently up the stairs i listened at the door to the bedroom and then i moved over to the other one it doesnt make sense hardesty was saying angrily our end of the deal was worth twentyfive grand and we could have wound it up in a couple weeks i dont see why the hell all right docs voice cut in we make that killing the last one we could possibly make and then i do my fadeout how does that look the same way it looked in the beginning said hardesty thats the way we planned it if you didnt like it why didnt you say something then things have changed since then said doc the police are looking for pat or will be shortly we had to wind up the deal tonight but you intended to wind it up tonight before they ever started looking for cosgrove said hardesty why didnt you tell madeline and me i had reasons oh hell said hardesty disgustedly i dont get you said doc slowly id have had two or three weeks overhead to pay thats not peanuts id have had to pay several grand in past due bills that ive been stalling all that would have had to come out of our end you wouldnt have had more than five or six gs for your cut whats five or six grand to you especially when you stand to pick up a clear five i just dont like it said hardesty i can see you dont but i wonder why forget it said hardesty just forget the whole damned thing there was silence then i raised my fist and knocked pat it was madeline yes i said come in i went in and closed the door hardesty and madeline were seated on the lounge she was wearing a nightgown under a blue woolly robe and her hair had been hastily piled up and pinned on top of her head she looked like a child suddenly roused out of a deep sleep and she gave me a childs questioning but trustful smile i looked away from her to doc hed changed clothes and he was taking more articles of clothing from a pile of bags and packages and putting them into a suitcase which stood on a chair in front of him he smiled at me narrow eyed and jerked his head at madeline i dont believe you two have met formally he said mr cosgrove mrs luther madeline flirted a hand at me lo mr cosgrove she said in a weak voice i nodded to her dropping into a chair how do you do mrs luther i said well said doc with a note of reproof you dont seem particularly surprised pat im not i said im only surprised that i didnt see it a long time ago oh yes i said you gave me a tip at the outset that morning i bought my clothes youd been having an argument with hardesty and you told him to keep away from your wife you wanted to be sure of what id overheard whether youd mentioned madeline by name i remember said doc shooting an unpleasant glance at hardesty i remember very well now that you mention it then there was the matter of the baby i said i didnt believe youd invented the story i was sure that your wife had had a baby well id seen lila at pretty close range thanks to you and i knew she couldnt have had a baby so i didnt tell him the rest that id seen the striae the marks made by giving birth on madelines body i wanted to talk about murder to have him and hardesty talk about it with myrtle briscoe and her boys listening in hardesty let out an impatient snort for gods sake doc he said are we going to sit around here talking all night theres no hurry said doc pats got a right to some answers hes entitled to know where he stands pat i believe you talked to lila tonight yes i said and she told you the truth she doesnt have enough sense to do anything else do you see the spot i was in i was desperate for money and she fell right into my lap waiting to be used and when id used her i didnt dare get rid of her i couldnt separate from a woman i was supposed to be madly in love with i knew shed talk if she ever got out from under my thumb and do you see the spot i was in pat said madeline quietly as a matter of fact i said im not particularly interested doc grinned and then his expression changed and he shook his head dont think too hard of her she doesnt deserve it we all make mistakes and we all pay for them you were only eighteen when you robbed a bank madeline was only eighteen when she came here to capital city i know i said shes a very loyal little woman very pat to herself as well as me weve been husband and wife in name only shes worked for the money ive given her would that work include murder egglestons you mean he shook his head calmly she had nothing to do with that he found out about our marriage and demanded money from her and i went to make the payoff she didnt know i was going to kill him i didnt either i didnt even know whod hired him or whether he was working on his own i didnt have to talk with him very long however to realize that he couldnt be trusted that left me only one thing to do i nodded that took me off the hook for the murder now to wrap up the rest of it doc glanced at the hall door casually then back at me and there was that peculiar look in his eyes again the one id seen back at the house when lila had left the room theres one thing i dont understand doc i said why didnt you go through with this fanning arnholt deal why did you set it all up and then blow it to pieces thats what id like to know snapped hardesty im just lucky that theres nothing that can be pinned on me well doc hesitated grinning faintly why dont you make a guess pat i can think of a couple of reasons i said one is that you were trying to get a few marks on the credit side of the ledger after what happened tonight this states going to be as clean as a whistle yes i think thats what you thought you were doing i said what you persuaded yourself you were doing actually i think you had another motive youd got all you could you intended to make sure that nothing would be left for anyone else docs fingers tightened on the package he was unwrapping he stared down at it blindly and then he went on picking at the string he didnt say anything hardesty scowled at him angrily well by god he said and then he raised his shoulders in a shrug of helplessness pat im sorry but im talking to doc i said lets see if ive got things straight youd been wanting to break loose for a longtime doc you knew that the next election was going to force you to you needed to make one last big killing and when you got my letter from sandstone you saw a way of doing it with madelines and hardestys help you insured yourself heavily in madelines your wifes favor you got me out to kill you ostensibly after a quarrel actually of course you wont get killed itll be made to look like killed you and dumped you in the river where no one could find you but it wont be that way youll clear out and go into hiding and hardesty will push the insurance claims through for madeline and after a year or so when its absolutely safe shell join you is that what you planned that said doc is what im going to do incidentally pat what about lila well what about her my wife wouldnt live with me but she insisted on the protection of insurance thats the story it looks to me like the insurance companies will claim fraud no company would knowingly insure a man with such potentially dangerous living arrangements correct doc nodded too bad they didnt look into the matter more closely as it is theyve accepted my premiums and madelines down as the beneficiary its a binding contract and theyll have to pay i see i said how much are you going to have to live on the rest of your life how much insurance have you got well he hesitated for a second i guess theres no reason why shouldnt tell you ten policies for ten thousand each itll come to a hundred thousand double indemnity whats hardestys share sixtyfive thousand roughly a third i shook my head i couldnt think of anything to say for a moment it seemed to me that everything had been said that needed to be and it was time for myrtle to by the way pat as i started to mention a moment ago yes i said it was a nice try but im afraid myrtle isnt going to be with us i checked on her whereabouts just before our little soiree at the house shes out of town i swallowed and my adams apple stuck in my throat and i think i must have looked as sick as i felt doc grinned sympathetically you werent going to tell me that you tipped off the police theyd grab you on that eggleston rap and before you could get clear of it no i said i didnt go to the police i was just going to say that that how can you do it doc youre sentencing me to death doesnt that bother you i suppose it should said doc but no it doesnt not much pat youd have died in sandstone if i hadnt got you out this way at least you have had a little fling that car lila bought for me doesnt really mean anything i said im going to be allowed to get away im afraid not pat not finding my body is one thing not finding the man who is supposed to have killed me is another it would be more than would be swallowed comfortably youll have to be caught im afraid somewhere near the spot of our nominally fatal quarrel and you dont see any danger in my being caught you mean youll talk he smiled faintly shucking a pair of socks out of a paper bag whos going to believe a fantastic story such as youll have to tell when all the evidence points to murder it isnt going to work doc i said oh itll work all right pat he grinned its just improbable enough to seem completely plausible youre the best evidence of that yourself youve had the puzzle in front of you for weeks yet you never arrived at the motive for my getting you out of sandstone that isnt what i meant i said im talking about the insurance companies theyre not going to make settlement on those policies they wouldnt ordinarily he nodded they wouldnt pay a death claim without positive proof of death a body in other words but where the evidence is so clear cut well what makes you so sure of that i said our friend hardesty here doc perked his head one of our leading legal lights regardless of what you may think of him on other grounds hardesty says theyll have to pay if he says so they will that was true hardesty would know but why then had he wanted me to suddenly it hit me the last piece of the murderous puzzle fell into place and i laughed i was caught stuck in the middle no matter what i did but i couldnt help laughing hardesty recrossed his legs shifting nervously on the lounge his right hand crept into the pocket of his coat and remained there doc i said youre not very bright doc not about some things ive had a feeling all along that you were into something beyond your depth but i didnt think you were quite this simple no he grinned but a tinge of red was creeping into his cheeks just how simple am i supposed to be pat simple enough to believe a man who hates you and loves your wife simple enough to believe that hed be content with a third of that two hundred thousand when he and she can take the whole pile sure he knows what the insurance companies will and wont do but theres a hell of a big difference between what he knows and what hes told you i doc looked from hardesty to madeline and then back to me i dont understand theres nothing to understand said hardesty curtly dont pay any attention to him doc he think it over doc i said and while youre doing it hardesty can make me his offer i want you to see why youre going to be killed but youll have to think fast i wont be able to play my part in this little drama if the police catch up with me doc stared at me silently his eyes blinking behind the thick lenses i nodded to hardesty all right i said whats it going to be do i kill him and get away or do you do it and let me get caught pat madeline cried dont but hardestys hand had already come out of his pocket you do it he said and he tossed the snubnosed automatic to me you do it and get away i caught the gun and motioned with it all right i said stand up all three of you pat said hardesty you up i said and yanked him to his feet i lined the three of them up and searched them i shoved madeline to one side and looked at doc and hardesty now i said im going to call the police police they spoke the word simultaneously i know i said they wont believe me probably they wont but ive got to try but whats it going to get you hardestys face was dead white you could get away pat well ill see that you have plenty of money to i dont think so i said a man cant get away from himself youre talking in riddles snapped doc youve knocked this insurance scheme in the head ive cleaned up the political mess let it go at that and sure said hardesty be sensible pat were all kind of off on the wrong foot here tonight but its not too late to straighten things out doc why dont we shake hands all around and why not said doc heartily and his hand shot out it closed around my wrist he bore down on it with all his weight and hardesty stepped in close swinging and i laughed again it was too easy it didnt give me an excuse to really get rough to give them the only punishment theyd probably ever get i weaved around a few of hardestys windmill swings letting him wear himself out then i gave him an openpalmed uppercut and he rose up on his toes and shot backwards and went down in a heap against the wall doc was still struggling with my gun hand i let it sag suddenly jerked upward again and he went back against the wall with hardesty they sprawled there looking at me dazedly i looked at madeline and she was smiling at me happily joyously hugging herself and before i could think wonder if i had been right if just this one time something would go right the bedroom door banged open myrtle briseoe walked in myrtle and two state troopers she blew a whistle and two more troopers burst through the hall door she pointed and the troopers took hold of hardesty and doc she jerked her head and they started toward the hall with them it happened in split seconds so fast that doc and hardesty lacked even time for surprise they went out the door wordlessly tottering between the troopers and myrtle patted madeline on the shoulder our girl friend beat you to the tipoff red she grinned had yourself a pretty bad thirty minutes didnt you i uh yes maam i said well you asked for it tried toget you to level with me didnt she i tried didnt i yes maam well her eyes swept over me swiftly that little tussle doesnt seem to have hurt you any i was afraid there might be shooting if i busted in on it couldnt let you get shot before i got you a pardon no maam what i said why not said myrtle briscoe i think the governors going to sign just about anything i lay in front of him and she clumped out the door slamming it behind her and madeline was in my arms that i believe is about all i got my pardon i got the job which i still have as investigator with the department of corrections madeline got her divorce and we got married doc got ninetynine years for egglestons murder plus an additional thirty years to run consecutively for bribery and attempted fraud hardesty got a total of forty years thats a lot of gots and there are still more concerning burkman and flanders and the rest of docs old gang but i wont go into those ill only say that doc doesnt lack for friends if they can be called that there in sandstone lila well lila did quite well for herself everything considered she sold her life story ghostwritten of course to a newspaper syndicate that got her a nice chunk of money and a great deal of publicity very valuable as it turned out the last i saw of her madeline and i she was headed for hollywood with a bpicture contract she stopped to say goodbye to us before she left afterwards i caught madeline looking at me thoughtfully im wondering she said im wondering if lever will know what went on between you and that dame what went on i said surely you dont think id do that mrs cosgrove uhhah ill bet you wouldnt well i said i dont know of anything lean say to convince you and you cant think of anything to do either as a matter of fact i said i believe i can youve given me an idea it wasnt a new idea but it proved to be a very very good one good enough to make madeline forget all about lila good enough period about the author james
