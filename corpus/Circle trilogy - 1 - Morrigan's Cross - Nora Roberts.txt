 prologue it was the rain that made him think of the tale the lash of it battered the windows stormed the rooftops and blew its bitter breath under the doors the damp ached in his bones even as he settled by the fire age sat heavily on him in the long wet nights of autumn and would sit heavier still he knew in the dark winter to come the children were gathered huddled on the floor squeezed by twos and threes into chairs their faces were turned to his expectant for hed promised them a story to chase boredom from a stormy day he hadnt intended to give them this one not yet for some were so young and the tale was far from tender but the rain whispered to him hissing the words hed yet to speak even a storyteller perhaps especially a storyteller had to listen i know a tale he began and several of the children squirmed in anticipation its one of courage and cowardice of blood and death and of life of love and of loss are there monsters one of the youngest asked with her blue eyes wide with gleeful fear there are always monsters the old man replied just as there are always men who will join them and men who will fight them and women one of the older girls called out and made him smile and women brave and true devious and deadly i have known both in my time now this tale i tell you is from long ago it has many beginnings but only one end as the wind howled the old man picked up his tea to wet his throat the fire crackled shot light across his face in a wash like gilded blood this is one beginning in the last days of high summer with lightning striking blue in a black sky the sorcerer stood on a high cliff overlooking the raging sea chapter eire the region of chiarrai there was a storm in him as black and vicious as that which bullied its way across the sea it whipped inside his blood outside in the air battling within and without as he stood on the rainslickened rock the name of his storm was grief it was grief that flashed in his eyes as bold and as blue as those lightning strikes and the rage from it spit from his fingertips jagged red that split the air with thunderclaps that echoed like a thousand cannon shots he thrust his staff high shouted out the words of magic the red bolts of his rage and the bitter blue of the storm clashed overhead in a war that sent those who could see scurrying into cottage and cave latching door and window gathering their children close to quake and quail as they prayed to the gods of their choosing and in their raths even the faeries trembled rock rang and the water of the sea went black as the mouth of hell and still he raged and still he grieved the rain that poured out of the wounded sky fell red as blood and sizzled burning on land on sea so that the air smelled of its boiling it would be called ever after the night of sorrows and those who dared speak of it spoke of the sorcerer who stood tall on the high cliff with the bloody rain soaking his cloak running down his lean face like deaths tears as he dared both heaven and hell his name was hoyt and his family the mac cionaoith who were said to be descended from morrigan faerie queen and goddess his power was great but still young as he was young he wielded it now with a passion that gave no room to caution to duty to light it was his sword and his lance what he called in that terrible storm was death while the wind shrieked he turned putting his back to the tumultuous sea what he had called stood on the high ground she for she had been a woman once smiled her beauty was impossible and cold as winter her eyes were tenderly blue her lips pink as rose petals her skin milk white when she spoke her voice was music a sirens who had already called countless men to their doom youre rash to seek me out are you impatient mac cionaoith for my kiss you are what killed my brother death is heedless of the rain she pushed back her hood complex you are too young to understand its glories what i gave him is a gift precious and powerful you damned him oh she flicked a hand in the air such a small price for eternity the world is his now and he takes whatever he wants he knows more than you can dream of hes mine now more than he was ever yours demon his blood is on your hands and by the goddess i will destroy you she laughed gaily like a child promised a particular treat on my hands in my throat as mine is in his he is like me now a child of night and shadow will you also seek to destroy your own brother your twin the ground fog boiled black folded away like silk as she waded through it i smell your power and your grief and your wonder now on this place i offer this gift to you i will make you once more his twin hoyt of the mac cionaoiths i will give you the death that is unending life he lowered his staff stared at her through the curtain of rain give me your name she glided over the fog now her red cloak billowing back he could see the white swell of her breasts rounding ripely over the tightly laced bodice of her gown he felt a terrible arousal even as he scented the stench of her power i have so many she countered and touched his arm how had she come so close with just the tip of her finger do you want to say my name as we join to taste it on your lips as i taste you his throat was dry burning her eyes blue and tender were drawing him in drawing him in to drown aye i want to know what my brother knows she laughed again but this time there was a throatiness to it a hunger that was an animals hunger and those soft blue eyes began to rim with red jealous she brushed her lips to his and they were cold bitter cold and still so tempting his heart began to beat hard and fast in his chest i want to see what my brother sees he laid his hand on that lovely white breast and felt nothing stir beneath it give me your name she smiled and now the white of her fangs gleamed against the awful night it is lilith who takes you it is lilith who makes you the power of your blood will mix with mine and we will rule this world and all the others she threw back her head poised to strike with all of his grief with all of his rage hoyt struck at her heart with his staff the sound that ripped from her pierced the night screamed up through the storm and joined it it wasnt human not even the howl of a beast here was the demon who had taken his brother who hid her evil behind cold beauty who bled he saw as a stream of blood spilled from the wound without a heartbeat she flew back into the air twisting shrieking as lightning tore at the sky the words he needed to say were lost in his horror as she writhed in the air and the blood that fell steamed into filthy fog you would dare her voice gurgled with outrage with pain you would use your puny your pitiful magic on me i have walked this world a thousand years she slicked her hand over the wound threw out her bloody hand and when the drops struck hoyts arm they sliced like a knife lilith you are cast out lilith you are vanquished from this place by my blood he pulled a dagger from beneath his cloak scored his palm by the blood of the gods that runs through it by the power of my birth i cast you back what came at him seemed to fly across the ground and struck with the feral force of fury tangled they crashed over the cliff to the jagged ledge below through waves of pain and fear he saw the face of the thing that so closely mirrored his own the face that had once been his brothers hoyt could smell the death on him and the blood and could see in those red eyes the animal his brother had become still a small flame of hope flickered in hoyts heart cian help me stop her we still have a chance do you feel how strong i am cian closed his hand around hoyts throat and squeezed its only the beginning i have forever now he leaned down licked blood from hoyts face almost playfully she wants you for herself but im hungry so hungry and the blood in you is mine after all as he bared his fangs pressed them to his brothers throat hoyt thrust the dagger into him with a howl cian reared back shock and pain rushed over his face even as he clutched at the wound he fell for an instant hoyt thought he saw his brother his true brother then there was nothing but the screams of the storm and the slashing rain he crawled and clawed his way up the cliff his hands slippery with blood and sweat and rain groped for any hold lightning illuminated his face tight with pain as he inched his way up rock tore his fingers in the clawing his neck where the fangs had scraped burned like a brand breath whistling he clutched at the edge if she waited he was dead his power had waned with exhaustion drained with the ravages of his shock and grief he had nothing but the dagger still red with his brothers blood but when he pulled himself up when he rolled to his back with the bitter rain washing over his face he was alone perhaps it had been enough perhaps hed sent the demon back to hell as he had surely sent his own flesh and blood to damnation rolling over he gained his hands and knees and was viciously ill magic was ashes in his mouth he crawled to his staff used it to help him stand breath keening he staggered away from the cliffs along a path hed have known had he been blinded the power had gone out of the storm as it had gone out of him and now was merely a soaking rain he smelled home horse and hay the herbs hed used for protection the smoke from the fire hed left smoldering in the hearth but there was no joy in it no triumph as he limped toward his cottage his breath whistled out hisses of pain that were lost in the rise of the wind he knew if the thing that had taken his brother came for him now he was lost every shadow every shape cast by the stormtossed trees could be his death worse than his death fear of that slicked along his skin like dirty ice so that he used what strength he had to murmur incantations that were more like prayers for whoever or whatever would listen his horse stirred in its shelter let out a huff as it scented him but hoyt continued shakily to the small cottage dragging himself to the door and through inside was warmth and the ripple from the spells hed cast before hed gone to the cliffs he barred the door leaving smears of his and cians blood on the wood would it keep her out he wondered if the lore hed read was fact she couldnt enter without an invitation all he could do was have faith in that and in the protection spell that surrounded his home he let his soaked cloak fall let it lay in a sodden heap on the floor and had to fight not to join it there he would mix potions for healing for strength and would sit through the night tending the fire waiting for dawn hed done all he could for his parents his sisters and their families he had to believe it was enough cian was dead and what had come back with his face and form had been destroyed he would not could not harm them now but the thing that had made him could he would find something stronger to protect them and he would hunt the demon again his life he swore it now would be dedicated to her destruction his hands long of finger wide of palm were tremulous as he chose his bottles and pots his eyes stormy blue were glazed with pain the aches of his body of his heart guilt weighed on him like a shroud of lead and those demons played inside him he hadnt saved his brother instead he had damned and destroyed him cast him out and away how had he won that terrible victory cian had always been physically superior to him and what his brother had become was viciously powerful so his magic had vanquished what hed once loved the half of him that was bright and impulsive where he himself was often dull and staid more interested in his studies and his skills than society cian had been the one for gaming and taverns for wenches and sport his love of life hoyt murmured as he worked his love of life killed him i only destroyed that which trapped him in a beast he had to believe it pain rippled up his ribs as he shucked off his tunic bruises were already spreading creeping black over his skin the way grief and guilt crept black over his heart it was time for practical matters he told himself as he applied the balm he fumbled considerably cursed violently in wrapping the bandage over his ribs two were broken he knew just as he knew the ride back home in the morning would be a study in sheer misery he took a potion then limped to the fire he added turf so the flames glowed red over them he brewed tea then wrapped himself in a blanket to sit to drink to brood he had been born with a gift and from an early age had soberly meticulously sought to honor it hed studied often in solitude practicing his art learning its scope cians powers had been less but hoyt remembered cian had never practiced so religiously nor studied so earnestly and cian had played with magic after all amusing himself and others and cian had sometimes drawn him in lowered hoyts resistance until theyd done something foolish together once theyd turned the boy whod pushed their younger sister in the mud into a braying longeared ass how cian had laughed it had taken hoyt three days of work sweat and panic to reverse the spell but cian had never worried a whit he was born an ass after all weve just given him his true form from the time theyd been twelve cian had been more interested in swords than spells just as well hoyt thought as he drank the bitter tea hed been irresponsible with magic and a magician with a sword but steel hadnt saved him nor had magic in the end he sat back chilled to his bones despite the simmering turf he could hear what was left of the storm blowing still splattering on his roof wailing through the forest that surrounded his cottage but he heard nothing else not beast not threat so was left alone with his memories and regrets he shouldve gone with cian into the village that evening but hed been working and hadnt wanted ale or the smells and sounds of a tavern of people he hadnt wanted a woman and cian had never not wanted one but if hed gone if hed put aside his work for one bloody night cian would be alive surely the demon couldnt have overpowered both of them surely his gift would have allowed him to sense what the creature was despite her beauty her allure cian would never have gone with her had his brother been by his side and their mother would not be grieving the grave would never have been dug and by the gods the thing they buried would never have risen if his powers could turn back time he would give them up abjure them to have that one night to relive that single moment when hed chosen work over his brothers company what good do they do me what good are they now to have been given magic and not be able to use it to save what matters most damn to them all then he flung his cup across the little room damn to them all gods and faeries he was the light of us and youve cast him into the dark all of his life hoyt had done what he was meant to do what was expected of him he had turned away from a hundred small pleasures to devote himself to his art now those who had given him this gift this power had stood back while his own brother was taken not in battle not even with the clean blade of magic but through evil beyond imagination this was his payment this was his reward for all he had done he waved a hand toward the fire and in the hearth flames leaped and roared he threw up his arms and overhead the storm doubled in power so that the wind screamed like a tortured woman the cottage trembled under its might and the skins pulled tight over the windows split cold gusts spilled into the room toppling bottles flapping the pages of his books and in it he heard the throaty chuckle of the black not once in all of his life had he turned from his purpose not once had he used his gift for ill or touched upon the black arts perhaps now he thought he would find the answers in them find his brother again fight the beast evil against evil he shoved to his feet ignoring the scream in his side he whirled toward his cot and flung out both hands toward the trunk hed locked by magic when it flew open he strode to it reached in for the book hed shut away years before in it were spells dark and dangerous magicks spells that used human blood human pain spells of vengeance and greed that spoke to a power that ignored all oaths all vows it was hot and heavy in his hands and he felt the seduction of it those curling fingers that brushed the soul have all have any are we not more than the rest living gods who take whatever is desired we have the right we are beyond rules and reasons his breath came short for he knew what could be his if he accepted it if he took in both hands what hed sworn never to touch unnamed wealth women unspeakable powers life eternal revenge he had only to say the words to rebuke the white and embrace the black clammy snakes of sweat slithered down his back as he heard the whispers of voices from a thousand ages take take take his vision shimmered and through it he saw his brother as hed found him in the muck on the side of the road blood pooled from the wounds in his throat and more smeared his lips pale hoyt thought dimly so very pale was his face against that wet red blood now cians eyes vivid and blue opened there was such pain in them such horror they pleaded as they met hoyts save me only you can save me its not death im damned to tis beyond hell beyond torment bring me back for once dont count the cost would you have me burn for all eternity for the sake of your own blood hoyt help me he shook it wasnt from the cold that blew through the split skins or the damp that whirled in the air but from the icy edge on which he stood i would give my life for yours i swear it on all i am on all we were i would take your fate cian if that were the choice before me but i cant do this not even for you the vision on the bed erupted in flames and its screams were past human on a howl of grief hoyt heaved the book back in the trunk he used the strength left to him to charm the lock before he collapsed on the floor there he curled up like a child beyond all comfort perhaps he slept perhaps he dreamed but when he came to the storm had passed light seeped into the room and grew bold and bright and white to sear his eyes he blinked against it hissing as his ribs protested when he tried to sit up there were streams of pink and gold shimmering in the white warmth radiating from it he smelled earth he realized rich and loamy and the smoke from the turf fire that was still shimmering in the hearth he could see the shape of her female and sensed a staggering beauty this was no demon come for blood gritting his teeth he got to his knees though there was still grief and anger in his voice he bowed his head my lady child the light seemed to part for her her hair was the fiery red of a warrior and flowed over her shoulders in silky waves her eyes were green as the moss in the forest and soft now with what might have been pity she wore white robes trimmed in gold as was her right by rank though she was the goddess of battle she wore no armor and carried no sword she was called morrigan you have fought well i have lost i have lost my brother have you she stepped forward offered him a hand so he would rise you stayed true to your oath though the temptation was great i might have saved him otherwise no she touched hoyts face and he felt the heat of her you would have lost him and yourself i promise you you would give your life for his but you could not give your soul or the souls of others you have a great gift hoyt what good is it if i cannot protect my own blood do the gods demand such sacrifice to damn an innocent to such torment it was not the gods who damned him nor was it for you to save him but there is sacrifice to be made battles to be fought blood innocent and otherwise to be spilled you have been chosen for a great task you could ask anything of me now lady aye a great deal will be asked of you and of others there is a battle to be fought the greatest ever waged good against evil you must gather the forces i am not able i am not willing i am god i am tired he dropped to the edge of his cot dropped his head in his hands i must go see my mother i must tell her i failed to save her son you have not failed because you resisted the dark you are charged to bear this standard to use the gift youve been given to face and to vanquish that which would destroy worlds shake off this selfpity his head rose at the sharp tone even the gods must grieve lady i have killed my brother tonight your brother was killed by the beast a week ago what fell from the cliff was not your cian you know this but he continues hoyt got shakily to his feet he lives it is not life it is without breath without soul without heart it has a name that is not spoken yet in this world it is vampyre it feeds on blood she said moving toward him it hunts the human takes life or worse much worse turns that which it hunts and kills into itself it breeds hoyt like a pestilence it has no face and must hide from the sun it is this you must fight this and other demons that are gathering you must meet this force in battle on the feast of samhain and you must be victorious or the world you know the worlds you have yet to know will be overcome and how will i find them how will i fight them it was cian who was the warrior you must leave this place and go to another and another still some will come to you and some you will seek the witch the warrior the scholar the one of many forms and the one youve lost only five more six against an army of demons my lady a circle of six as strong and true as the arm of a god when that circle is formed others may be formed but the six will be my army the six will make the ring you will teach and you will learn and you will be greater than the sum of you a month to gather and one to learn and one to know the battle comes on samhain you child are my first you would ask me to leave the family i have left when that thing that took my brother may come for them the thing that took your brother leads this force i wounded her it i gave her pain and the memory of that bubbled up in him like vengeance you did aye you did and this is only another step toward this time and this battle she bears your mark now and will in time seek you out if i hunt her now destroy her now you cannot she is beyond you at this time and you my child are not ready to face her between these times and worlds her thirst will grow insatiable until only the destruction of all humankind will satisfy it you will have your revenge hoyt she said as he got to his feet if you defeat her you will travel far and you will suffer and i will suffer knowing your pain for you are mine do you think your fate your happiness is nothing to me you are my child even as you are your mothers and what of my mother lady of my father my sisters their families without me to protect them they may be the first to die if this battle you speak of comes to pass it will come to pass but they will be beyond it she spread her hands your love for your blood is part of your power and i will not ask you to turn from it you will not think clearly until you have assurance they will be safe she tipped back her head held her arms up palms cupped the ground shook lightly under his feet and when hoyt looked up he saw stars shooting through the night sky those points of light streamed toward her hands and there burst into flame his heart thumped against his bruised ribs as she spoke as her fiery hair flew around her illuminated face forged by the gods by the light and by the night symbol and shield simple and true for faith for loyalty these gifts for you their magic lives through blood shed yours and mine pain sliced over his palm he watched the blood well in his and in hers as the fire burned and so it shall live for all time blessed be those who wear morrigans cross the fire died and in the goddesss hands were crosses of gleaming silver these will protect them they must wear the cross always day and night birth to death you will know they are safe when you leave them if i do this thing will you spare my brother you would bargain with the gods aye she smiled an amused mother to a child you have been chosen hoyt because you would think to do so you will leave this place and gather those who are needed you will prepare and you will train the battle will be fought with sword and lance with tooth and fang with wit and treachery if you are victorious the worlds will balance and you will have all you wish to have how do i fight a vampyre ive already failed against her study and learn she said and learn from one of her kind one she made one who was yours before she took him you must first find your brother where not only where but when look into the fire and see they were he noted in his cottage again and he was standing in front of the hearth the flames spiked up became towers became a great city there were voices and sounds such as hed never heard thousands of people rushed along streets that were made of some kind of stone and machines sped with them what is this place he could barely whisper the words what world is it it is called new york and its time is nearly a thousand years from where we are evil still walks the world hoyt as well as innocence as well as good your brother has walked the world a long time now centuries have passed for him you would do well to remember that is he a god now he is vampyre he must teach you and he must fight beside you there can be no victory without him such size he thought buildings of silver and stone taller than any cathedral will the war be in this place in this new york you will be told where you will be told how and you will know now you must go take what you need go to your family and give them their shields you must leave them quickly and go to the dance of the gods you will need your skill and my power to pass through find your brother hoyt it is time for the gathering he woke by the fire the blanket wrapped around him but he saw it hadnt been a dream not with the blood drying on the palm of his hand and the silver crosses lying across his lap it was not yet dawn but he packed books and potions oatcakes and honey and the precious crosses he saddled his horse and then as a precaution cast another protective circle around his cottage he would come back he promised himself he would find his brother and this time he would save him whatever it took as the sun cast its first light he began the long ride to an clar and his family home chapter he traveled north on roads gone to mud from the storm the horrors and the wonders of the night played through his mind as he hunched over his horse favoring his aching ribs he swore should he live long enough he would practice healing magic more often and with more attention he passed fields where men worked and cattle grazed in the soft morning sunlight and lakes that picked up their blue from the late summer sky he wound through forests where the waterfalls thundered and the shadows and mosses were the realm of the faerie folk he was known here and caps were lifted when hoyt the sorcerer passed by but he didnt stop to take hospitality in one of the cabins or cottages nor did he seek comfort in one of the great houses or in the conversations of monks in their abbeys or round towers in this journey he was alone and above battles and orders from gods he would seek his family first he would offer them all he could before he left them to do what hed been charged to do as the miles passed he struggled to straighten on his horse whenever he came to villages or outposts his dignity cost him considerable discomfort until he was forced to take his ease by the side of a river where the water gurgled over rock once he thought he had enjoyed this ride from his cottage to his family home through the fields and the hills or along the sea in solitude or in the company of his brother he had ridden these same roads and paths felt this same sun on his face had stopped to eat and rest his horse at this very same spot but now the sun seared his eyes and the smell of the earth and grass couldnt reach his deadened senses fever sweat slicked his skin and the angles of his face were keener as he bore down against the unrelenting pain though he had no appetite he ate part of one of the oatcakes along with more of the medicine hed packed despite the brew and the rest his ribs continued to ache like a rotted tooth just what good would he be in battle he wondered if he had to lift his sword now to save his life he would die with his hands empty vampyre he thought the word fit it was erotic exotic and somehow horrible when he had both time and energy he would write down more of what he knew though he was far from convinced he was about to save this world or any other from some demonic invasion it was always best to gather knowledge he closed his eyes a moment resting them against the headache that drummed behind them a witch hed been told he disliked dealing with witches they were forever stirring odd bits of this and that in pots and rattling their charms then a scholar at least he might be useful was the warrior cian that was his hope cian wielding sword and shield again fighting alongside him he could nearly believe he could fulfill the task hed been given if his brother was with him the one with many shapes odd a faerie perhaps and the gods knew just how reliable such creatures were and this was somehow to be the front line in the battle for worlds he studied the hand hed bandaged that morning better for all if it had been dreaming im sick and tired is what i am and no soldier at the best of it go back the voice was a hissing whisper hoyt came to his feet reaching for his dagger nothing moved in the forest but the black wings of a raven that perched in shadows on a rock by the water go back to your books and herbs hoyt the sorcerer do you think you can defeat the queen of the demons go back go back and live your pitiful life and she will spare you go forward and she will feast on your flesh and drink of your blood does she fear to tell me so herself then and so she should for i will hunt her through this life and the next if need be i will avenge my brother and in the battle to come i will cut out her heart and burn it you will die screaming and she will make you her slave for eternity its an annoyance you are hoyt shifted his grip on the dagger as the raven took wing he flipped it through the air it missed but the flash of fire he shot out with his free hand hit the mark the raven shrieked and what dropped to the ground was ashes in disgust hoyt looked at the dagger hed been close and would likely have done the job if he hadnt been wounded at least cian had taught him that much but now he had to go fetch the bloody thing before he did he took a handful of salt from his saddlebags poured it over the ashes of the harbinger then retrieving his dagger he went to his horse and mounted with gritted teeth slave for all eternity he muttered well see about that wont we he rode on hemmed in by green fields the rise of hills chased by cloud shadows in light soft as down knowing a gallop would have his ribs shrieking he kept the horse to a plod he dozed and he dreamed that he was back on the cliffs struggling with cian but this time it was he who tumbled off spiraling down into the black to crash against the unforgiving rocks he woke with a start and with the pain surely this much pain meant death his horse had stopped to crop at the grass by the side of the road there a man in a peaked cap built a wall from a pile of steely gray rock his beard was pointed yellow as the gorse that rambled over the low hill his wrists thick as tree limbs good day to you sir now that youve waked to it the man touched his cap in salute then bent for another stone youve traveled far this day i have yes though he wasnt entirely sure where he was there was a fever working in him he could feel the sticky heat of it im to an clar and the mac cionaoith land what is this place its where you are the man said cheerfully youll not make your journeys end by nightfall no hoyt looked down the road that seemed to stretch to forever no not by nightfall thered be a cabin with a fire going beyond the field but youve not time to bide here not when youve so far yet to go and time shortens even as we speak youre weary the man said with some sympathy but youll be wearier yet before its done who are you just a signpost on your way when you come to the second fork go west when you hear the river follow it there be a holy well near a rowan tree bridgets well that some now call saint there youll rest your aching bones for the night cast your circle there hoyt the sorcerer for theyll come hunting they only wait for the sun to die you must be at the well in your circle before it does if they follow me if they hunt me i take them straight to my family theyre no strangers to yours you bear morrigans cross its that youll leave behind with your blood that and your faith the mans eyes were pale and gray and for a moment it seemed worlds lived in them if you fail more than your blood is lost by samhain go now the suns in the west already what choice did he have it all seemed a dream now boiling in his fever his brothers death then his destruction the thing on the cliffs that called herself lilith had he been visited by the goddess or was he simply trapped in some dream maybe he was dead already and this was merely a journey to the afterlife but he took the west fork and when he heard the river turned his horse toward it chills shook him now from the fever and the knowledge that the light was fading he fell from his horse more than dismounted and leaned breathlessly against its neck the wound on his hand broke open and stained the bandage red in the west the sun was a low ball of dying fire the holy well was a low square of stone guarded by the rowan tree others whod come to worship or rest had tied tokens ribbons and charms to the branches hoyt tethered his horse then knelt to take the small ladle and sip the cool water he poured drops on the ground for the god murmured his thanks he laid a copper penny on the stone smearing it with blood from his wound his legs felt more full of water than bone but as twilight crept in he forced himself to focus and began to cast his circle it was simple magic one of the first that comes but his power came now in fitful spurts and made the task a misery his own sweat chilled his skin as he struggled with the words with the thoughts and with the power that seemed a slippery eel wriggling in his hands he heard something stalking in the woods moving in the deepest shadows and those shadows thickened as the last rays of sunlight eked through the cover of trees they were coming for him waiting for that last flicker to die and leave him in the dark he would die here alone leave his family unprotected and all for the whim of the gods be damned if i will he drew himself up one chance more he knew one and so he ripped the bandage from his hand used his own blood to seal the circle within this ring the light remains it burns through the night at my will this magic is clean and none but clean shall bide here fire kindle fire rise rise and burn with power bright flames shimmered in the center of his circle weak but there as it rose the sun died and what had been in the shadows leaped out it came as a wolf black pelt and bloody eyes when it flung itself into the air hoyt pulled his dagger but the beast struck the force of the circle and was repelled it howled snapped snarled its fangs gleamed white as it paced back and forth as if looking for a weakness in the shield another joined it skulking out of the trees then another another yet until hoyt counted six they lunged together fell back together paced together like soldiers each time they charged his horse screamed and reared he stepped toward his mount his eyes on the wolves as he laid his hands upon it this at least he could do he soothed lulling his faithful mare into a trance then he drew his sword plunged it into the ground by the fire he took what food he had left water from the well mixed more herbs though the gods knew his selfmedicating was having no good effect he lowered to the ground by the fire sword on one side dagger on the other and his staff across his legs he huddled in his cloak shivering and after dousing an oatcake with honey forced it down the wolves sat on their haunches threw back their heads and as one howled at the rising moon hungry are you hoyt muttered through chattering teeth theres nothing here for you oh what i wouldnt give for a bed some decent tea he sat the fire dancing in his eyes until they began to close as his chin drooped to his chest hed never felt so alone or so unsure of his path he thought it was morrigan who came to him for she was beautiful and her hair as bold as the fire it fell straight as rain its tips grazing her shoulders she wore black a strange garb and immodest enough to leave her arms bare and allow the swell of her breasts to rise from the bodice around her neck she wore a pentagram with a moonstone in its center this wont do she said in a voice that was both foreign and impatient kneeling beside him she laid her hand on his brow her touch as cool and soothing as spring rain she smelled of the forest earthy and secret for one mad moment he longed to simply lay his head upon her breast and sleep with that scent filling his senses youre burning up well lets see what you have here and well make do she wavered in his vision a moment then recrystallized her eyes were as green as the goddesss but her touch was human who are you how did you get within the circle elderflower yarrow no cayenne well i said wed make do he watched as she busied herself as women would dipping water from the well heating it with his fire wolves she murmured shivered once and in that shudder he felt her fear sometimes i dream of the black wolves or ravens sometimes its the woman shes the worst but this is the first time ive dreamed of you she paused and looked at him for a long time with eyes of deep and secret green and still i know your face this is my dream she gave a short laugh then sprinkled herbs in the heated water have it your way lets see if we can help you live through it she passed her hand over the cup power of healing herbs and water brewed this night by hecates daughter cool his fever ease his pain so that strength and sight remain stir magic in this simple tea as i will so mote it be gods save me he managed to prop himself on an elbow youre a witch she smiled as she stepped to him with the cup and sitting beside him braced him with an arm around his back of course arent you im not he had just enough energy for insult im a bloody sorcerer get that poison away from me even the smell is foul that may be but it should cure what ails you she simply cradled his head on her shoulder even as he tried to push free she was pinching his nose closed and pouring the brew down his throat men are such babies when theyre sick and look at your hand bloody and filthy ive got something for that get away from me he said weakly though the smell of her the feel of her was both seductive and comforting let me die in peace youre not going to die but she gave the wolves a wary glance how strong is your circle strong enough hope youre right exhaustion and the valerian shed mixed in the tea had his head drooping again she shifted so she could lay his head in her lap and there she stroked his hair kept her eyes on the fire youre not alone anymore she said quietly and i guess neither am i the sun how long till dawn i wish i knew you should sleep now who are you but if she answered he didnt hear she was gone when he woke and so was the fever dawn was a misty shimmer letting thin beams eke through the summer leaves of the wolves there was only one and it lay gored and bloody outside the circle its throat had been ripped open hoyt saw and its belly even as he gained his feet to step closer the sun beamed white through those leaves struck the carcass it erupted into flame that left nothing behind but a scatter of ashes on blackened earth to hell with you and all like you turning away hoyt busied himself feeding his horse brewing more tea he was nearly done when he noticed his palm was healed only the faintest scar remained he flexed his fingers held his hand up to the light curious he lifted his tunic bruises still rained over his side but they were fading and when he tested he found he could move without pain if what had come to him in the night had been a vision rather than a product of a fever dream he supposed he should be grateful still hed never had a vision so vivid nor one whod left so much of itself behind he swore he could smell her still and hear the flow and cadence of her voice shed said shed known his face how strange that somewhere in the center of him he felt hed known hers he washed and while his appetite had come back strong he had to make do with berries and a heel of tough bread he closed the circle salted the blackened earth outside it once he was in the saddle he set off at a gallop with luck he could be home by midday there were no signs no harbingers no beautiful witches on the rest of his journey there were only the fields rolling green back to the shadow of mountains and the secret depths of forest he knew his way now would have known it if a hundred years had passed so he sent his mount on a leap over a low stone wall and raced across the last field toward home he could see the cook fire he imagined his mother sitting in the parlor tatting lace perhaps or working on one of her tapestries waiting hoping for news of her sons he wished he brought her better his father might be with his man of business or out riding the land and his married sisters in their own cottages with young nola in the stables playing with the pups from the new litter the house was tucked in the forest because his grandmother she who had passed power to him and to a lesser extent cian had wanted it so it stood near a stream a rise of stone with windows of real glass and its gardens were his mothers great pride her roses bloomed riotously one of the servants hurried out to take his horse hoyt merely shook his head at the question in the mans eyes he walked to the door where the black banner of mourning still hung inside another servant was waiting to take his cloak here in the hall his mothers and her mothers tapestries hung and one of his fathers wolfhounds raced to greet him he could smell beeswax and roses cut fresh from the garden the turf fire simmering in the grate he left them behind walked up the stairs to his mothers sitting room she was waiting as hed known she would be sitting in her chair her hands in her lap clasped so tightly the knuckles were white her face carried all the weight of her grief and went heavier yet when she saw what was in his eyes mother youre alive youre well she got to her feet held out her arms to him ive lost my youngest son but here is my firstborn home again youll want food and drink after your journey i have much to tell you and so you will all of you if you please madam i cannot stay long im sorry he kissed her brow im sorry to leave you there was food and there was drink and the whole of his family save cian around the table but it was not a meal like so many he remembered with laughter and shouted arguments with joy or petty disagreements hoyt studied their faces the beauties the strengths and the sorrows as he told them what had passed if there is to be a battle i will come with you fight with you hoyt looked at his brotherinlaw fearghus his shoulders were broad his fists ready where i go you cant follow youre not charged with this fight its for you and eoin to stay here to protect with my father the family the land i would go with a heavier heart if i didnt know you and eoin stand in my stead you must wear these he took out the crosses each of you and all the children who come after day and night night and day this he said and lifted one is morrigans cross forged by the gods in magic fire the vampyre cannot turn any who wear it into its kind this must be passed on to those who come after you in song and story you will swear an oath each of you that you will wear this cross until death he rose draping a cross over each neck waiting for the sworn oath before moving on then he knelt by his father his fathers hands were old hoyt noted with a jolt he was more farmer than warrior and in a flash he knew his fathers death would come first and before the yule just as he knew he would never again look in the eyes of the man whod given him life and his heart bled a little i take my leave of you sir i ask your blessing avenge your brother and come back to us i will hoyt rose i must gather what i need he went up to the room he kept in the topmost tower and there began to pack herbs and potions without any real sense what would be needed where is your cross he looked toward the doorway where nola stood her dark hair hanging to her waist she was but eight he thought and held the softest spot in his heart she didnt make me one he said briskly i have another sort of shield and theres no need for you to be worrying i know what im about i wont cry when you go why would you ive gone before havent i and come back handily enough youll come back to the tower shell come with you he nestled bottles carefully in his case then paused to study his sister who will the woman with red hair not the goddess but a mortal woman one who wears the sign of the witch i cant see cian and i cant see if youll win but i can see you here with the witch and youre afraid should a man go into battle without fear isnt fear something that helps keep him alive i dont know of battles i wish i were a man and a warrior her mouth so young so soft went grim you wouldnt be stopping me from going with you the way you stopped fearghus how would i dare he closed his case moved to her i am afraid dont tell the others i wont aye the softest place in his heart he thought and lifting her cross used his magic to scribe her name on the back in ogham script it makes it only yours he told her mine and the ones wholl have my name after me her eyes glimmered but the tears didnt fall youll see me again i will of course when you do the circle will be complete i dont know how or why what else do you see nola she only shook her head its dark i cant see ill light a candle for you every night until you return ill ride home by its light he bent down to embrace her ill miss you most of all he kissed her gently then set her aside be safe i will have daughters she called after him it made him turn and smile so slight he mused and so fierce will you now it is my lot she told him with a resignation that made his lips twitch but they will not be weak they will not sit and spin and knead and bake all the damn day now he grinned fully and knew this was a memory he would take with him happily oh wont they what then young mother will your daughters do they will be warriors and the vampyre who fancies herself a queen will tremble before them she folded her hands much as their mother was wont to do but with none of that meekness go with the gods brother stay in the light sister they watched him go three sisters the men who loved them the children theyd already made his parents even the servants and stable boys he took one last long look at the house his grandfather and his father before had built of stone in this glade by this stream in this land he loved with the whole of his heart then he raised his hand in farewell and rode away from them and toward the dance of the gods it stood on a rise of rough grass that was thick with the sunny yellow of buttercups clouds had rolled to layer the sky so that light forced its way through in thin beams the world was so still so silent he felt as though he rode through a painting the gray of the sky the green of the grass the yellow flowers and the ancient circle of stones that had risen in its dance since beyond time he felt its power the hum of it in the air along his skin hoyt walked his horse around them paused to read the ogham script carved into the king stone worlds wait he translated time flows gods watch he started to dismount when a shimmer of gold across the field caught his eye there at the edge of it was a hind the green of her eyes sparkled like the jeweled collar she wore she walked toward him regally and changed to the female form of the goddess you are in good time hoyt it was painful to bid my family farewell best done quickly then he slid off the horse bowed my lady child you have been ill a fever broken now did you send the witch to me theres no need to send what will come on its own youll find her again and the others my brother he is first the light will go soon here is the key to the portal she opened her hand and offered a small crystal wand keep it with you keep it safe and whole when he started to remount she shook her head took the reins no you must go on foot your horse will get safely back home resigned to the whimsy of gods he took his case his bag he strapped on his sword hefted his staff how will i find him through the portal into the world yet to come into the dance lift the key say the words your destiny lies beyond humankind is in your hands from this point forward through the portal she repeated into the world yet to come into the dance lift the key say the words through the portal her voice followed him in between the great stones he locked his fear inside him if hed been born for this so be it life was long he knew it simply came in short bursts he lifted the stone a single beam of light speared out of those thick clouds to strike its tip power shot down his arm like an arrow worlds wait time flows gods watch repeat morrigan told him and joined him so that the words became a chant worlds wait time flows gods watch the air shook around him came alive with wind with light with sound the crystal in his uplifted hand shone like the sun and sang like a siren he heard his own voice come out in a roar shouting the words now as if in challenge and so he flew through light and wind and sound beyond stars and moons and planets over water that made his sorcerers belly roil with nausea faster until the light was blinding the sounds deafening and the wind so fierce he wondered it didnt flay the skin from his bones then the light went dim the wind died and the world was silent he leaned on his staff catching his breath waiting for his eyes to adjust to the change of light he smelled something leather he thought and roses he was in a room of some sort he realized but like nothing hed ever seen it was fantastically furnished with long low chairs in deep colors and cloth for a floor paintings adorned some of the walls and others were lined with books dozens of books bound in leather he stepped forward charmed when a movement to his left stopped him cold his brother sat behind some sort of table where the lamp that lit the room glowed strangely his hair was shorter than it had been shorn to the jawline his eyes were vivid with what seemed to be amusement in his hand was some sort of metal tool which instinct told hoyt was a weapon cian pointed it at his brothers heart and tipped back in the chair dropping his feet on the surface of the table he smiled broadly and said well now look what the cat dragged in with some confusion hoyt frowned scanning the room for the cat do you know me hoyt stepped forward farther into the light its hoyt its your brother ive come to kill me too late already long dead why dont you just stay where you are for the moment i see quite well in low light youre looking well fairly ridiculous really but im impressed nonetheless how long did it take you to perfect time travel i coming through the portal might have addled his brains he thought or it might be simply seeing his dead brother looking very much alive cian im not using that name these days its cain right at the moment one syllable take off the cloak hoyt and lets have a look at whats under it youre a vampyre i am yes certainly the cloak hoyt hoyt unhooked the brooch that held it in place let it drop sword and dagger a lot of weaponry for a sorcerer theres to be a battle do you think so that amusement rippled again coldly i can promise youll lose what i have here is called a gun its quite a good one really it fires out a projectile faster than you can blink youll be dead where you stand before you can draw that sword i havent come to fight you really the last time we met let me refresh my memory ah yes you pushed me off a cliff you pushed me off the bloody cliff first hoyt said with some heat broke my bloody ribs while you were about it i thought you were gone oh merciful gods cian i thought you were gone im not as you can plainly see go back where you came from hoyt ive had a thousand years give or take to get over my annoyance with you for me you died only a week ago he lifted his tunic you gave me these bruises cians gaze drifted over them then back to hoyts face theyll heal soon enough ive come with a charge from morrigan morrigan is it this time the amusement burst out in laughter there are no gods here no god no faerie queens your magic has no place in this time and neither do you but you do adjustment is survival money is god here and power its partner i have both ive shed the likes of you a long time ago this world will end they will all end by samhain unless you help me stop her stop who the one who made you the one called lilith chapter lilith the name brought cian flashes of memories a hundred lifetimes past he could still see her smell her still feel that sudden horrified thrill in the instant shed taken his life he could still taste her blood and what had come into him with it the dark dark gift his world had changed and hed been given the privilege or the curse of watching worlds change over countless decades hadnt he known something was coming why else had he been sitting alone in the middle of the night waiting what nasty little twist of fate had sent his brother or the brother of the man hed once been across time to speak her name well now you have my attention you must come back with me prepare for the battle back to the twelfth century cian let out a short laugh as he leaned back in his chair nothing i promise you could tempt me i like the conveniences of this time the water runs hot here hoyt and so do the women im not interested in your politics and wars and certainly not in your gods the battle will be fought with or without you cian without sounds perfectly fine youve never turned from battle never hidden from a fight hiding wouldnt be the term id use cian said easily and times change believe me if lilith defeats us all you know will be lost in this time for all time humankind will cease to be cian angled his head im not human is that your answer hoyt strode forward youll sit and do nothing while she destroys youll stand by while she does to others what she did to you while she kills your mother your sisters will you sit there while she turns nola into what you are theyre dead long dead theyre dust hadnt he seen their graves he hadnt been able to stop himself from going back and standing over their stones and the stones of those whod come after them have you forgotten all you were taught times change you say its more than change could i be here now if time was solid their fate is not set nor is yours even now our father is dying yet i left him i will never see him alive again slowly cian got to his feet you have no conception of what she is what she is capable of she was old centuries old when she took me you think to stop her with swords and lightning bolts youre more fool than i remember i think to stop her with you help me if not for humanity then for yourself or would you join her if theres nothing left of my brother in you well end this between us now hoyt drew his sword for a long moment cian studied the blade considered the gun in his hand then he slipped the weapon back in his pocket put your sword away christ hoyt you couldnt take me oneonone when i was alive challenge and simple irritation rushed into hoyts eyes you didnt fare very well the last time we fought true enough it took me weeks to recover hiding around in caves by day half starving i looked for her then you know lilith who sired me by night while i struggled to hunt enough food to survive she abandoned me so ive a point to square with her put the damn sword away when hoyt hesitated cian simply leaped in the blink of an eye he was up gliding over hoyts head and landing lightly at his back he disarmed his brother with one careless twist of the wrist hoyt turned slowly the point of the sword was at his throat well done he managed were faster and were stronger we have no conscience to bind us we are driven to kill to feed to survive then why arent i dead cian lifted a shoulder well put it down to curiosity and a bit of old times sake he tossed the sword across the room well then lets have a drink he walked to a cabinet opened it out of the corner of his eye he saw the sword fly across the room and into hoyts hand well done on you he said mildly and took out a bottle of wine you cant kill me with steel but you could if you were lucky enough hack some part of me off that id rather keep we dont regenerate limbs ill put my weapons aside and you do the same fair enough cian took the gun out of his pocket set it on a table though a vampire always has his weapon he offered a brief glimpse of fangs nothing to be done about that he poured two glasses while hoyt laid down his sword and dagger have a seat then and you can tell me why i should get involved in saving the world im a busy man these days i have enterprises hoyt took the glass offered studied it sniffed at it what is this a very nice italian red ive no need to poison you to prove it he sipped from his own glass i could snap your neck like a twig cian sat himself stretched out his legs then he waved a hand at hoyt in todays worlds what were having here could be called a meeting and youre about to make your pitch so enlighten me we must gather forces beginning with a handful there is a scholar and a witch one of many forms and a warrior that must be you no im no warrior im a businessman he continued to sit at his ease giving hoyt a lazy smile so the gods as usual have given you pitifully little to work with and an all but impossible task with your handful and whoever else is fool enough to join you youre expected to defeat an army led by a powerful vampire most likely with troops of her kind and other manner of demon if she deigns to bother with them otherwise the world is destroyed worlds hoyt corrected there are more than one youre right about that anyway cian sipped contemplated hed nearly run out of challenges in his current persona this at least was interesting and what do your gods tell you is my part in this you must come with me teach me all that you can about her kind and how to defeat them what are their weaknesses what are their powers what weaponry and magic will work against them we have until samhain to master these and gather the first circle that long sarcasm dripped what would i gain from all this im a wealthy man with many interests to protect here and now and would she allow you to keep that wealth those interests should she rule cian pursed his lips now there was a thought possibly not but its more than possible if i help you ill risk all that and my own existence when youre young as you are im the eldest not for the last nine hundred years and counting in any case when youre young you think youll live forever so you take all manner of foolish risks but when youve lived as long as i youre more careful because existence is imperative im driven to survive hoyt humans and vampires have that in common you survive sitting alone in the dark in this little house its not a house cian said absently its an office a place of business i have many houses as it happens that too is survival there are taxes and records and all manner of things to be gotten around like most of my kind i rarely stay in one place for long were nomadic from nature and necessity he leaned forward now resting his elbows on his knees there were so few he could speak to about what he was that was his choice that was the life hed made hoyt ive seen wars countless wars such as you could never imagine no one wins them if you do this thing youll die or become it would be a feather in liliths cap to turn a sorcerer of your power do you think there is a choice here oh yes he sat back again there always is ive made many in my lifetimes he closed his eyes now lazily swirling his wine somethings coming there have been rumblings in the world under this one in the dark places if its what you say its bigger than i assumed i shouldve paid more attention i dont socialize with vampires as a rule baffled as cian had always been sociable hoyt frowned why not because as a rule theyre liars and killers and bring too much attention to themselves and those humans who socialize with them are usually mad or doomed i pay my taxes file my reports and keep a low profile and every decade or so i move change my name and keep off the radar i dont understand half of what you say imagine not cian replied shell fuck this up for everyone bloodbaths always do and those demons who go about thinking they want to destroy the world are ridiculously shortsighted we have to live in it dont we he sat in silence he could focus and hear each beat of his brothers heart hear the faint electrical hum of the rooms climate controls the buzz of the lamp on his desk across the room or he could block them out as he most often did with background noises hed learned to do and not do a great deal over time a choice he thought again well why not it comes down to blood cian said and his eyes stayed closed first and last it comes to blood we both need it to live your kind and mine its what we sacrifice for the gods you worship for countries for women and what we spill for the same reasons my kind doesnt quibble about reasons he opened his eyes now and showed hoyt how they could burn red we just take it we hunger for it crave it without it we cease to be its our nature to hunt kill feed some of us enjoy it more than others just as humans do some of us enjoy causing pain inciting fear tormenting and torturing our prey just as humans do were not all of the same cloth hoyt you murder when you hunt the buck in the forest and take its life is it murder youre no more than that less often less to us i saw your death the tumble off the cliffs wasnt no i saw her kill you i thought it a dream at first i watched you come out of the tavern go with her in her carriage and couple with her as it drove out of the village and i saw her eyes change and how the fangs glinted in the dark before she sank them into your throat i saw your face the pain the shock and arousal cian finished ecstasy its a moment of some intensity you tried to fight but she was an animal on you and i thought you were dead but you werent not quite no to feed you simply take drain the prey dry if you choose but to change a human he must drink from the blood of his maker she sliced her own breast and pressed your mouth to her and still you tried to fight until you began to suckle on her like a babe the allure is powerful as is the drive to survive it was drink or die when she was done she threw you out into the road left you there it was there i found you hoyt drank deeply as his belly quivered there i found you covered with blood and mud and this is what you do to survive the buck is given more respect do you want to lecture me cian began as he rose to get the bottle again or do you want to know i need to know some hunt in packs some alone at wakening were most vulnerable from the first when we wake in the grave to every evening if weve slept through the day we are night creatures the sun is death you burn in it i see you know some things i saw they hunted me when i journeyed home in the form of wolves only vampires of some age and power or those under the protection of another powerful sire can shape shift most have to content themselves with the form in which they died still we dont age physically a nice bonus feature you look as you did hoyt replied yet not its more than the garb you wear or the hair you move differently im not what i was and that you should remember our senses are heightened and become more so the longer we survive fire like the sun will destroy us holy water if its been faithfully blessed will burn us as will the symbol of the cross if held in faith we are repelled by the symbol crosses hoyt thought morrigan had given him crosses part of the weight eased from his shoulders metal is fairly useless cian continued unless you manage to cut off our heads that would do the trick but otherwise he rose again walked over and picked up hoyts dagger he flipped it in the air caught the hilt neatly then plunged the blade into his chest blood seeped out on the white of cians shirt even as hoyt lunged to his feet forgot how much that hurts wincing cian yanked the blade free thats what i get for showing off do the same with wood and were dust but it must pierce the heart our end is agonizing or so im told he took out a handkerchief wiped the blade clean then he pulled off his shirt the wound was already closing weve died once and arent easily dispatched a second time and well fight viciously anyone who tries lilith is the oldest ive ever known shell fight more brutally than any he paused brooded into his wine your mother how did you leave her heartbroken you were her favorite hoyt moved his shoulders as cian looked up into his face we both know it she asked me to try to find a way in her first grief she could think of nothing else i believe even your sorcery stops short of raising the dead or undead i went to your grave that night to ask the gods to give her heart some peace i found you covered with dirt clawing out of the graves a messy business you were devouring a rabbit probably the best i could find cant say i recall the first hours after the wakening are disjointed theres only hunger you ran from me i saw what you were there had been rumors of such things before and you ran i went to the cliffs the night i saw you again at our mothers behest she begged me to find a way to break the spell its not a spell i thought hoped if i destroyed the thing that made you or failing that i would kill what youd become and did neither cian reminded him which shows you what youre up against i was fresh and barely knew what i was or what i was capable of believe me shell have cannier on her side will i have yours on mine you havent a prayer of winning this you underestimate me i have a great deal more than one prayer whether a year has passed or a millennium you are my brother my twin my blood you said yourself its blood first and last cian ran a finger down his wine glass ill go with you then held that finger up before hoyt could speak because im curious and a bit bored ive been in this place for more than ten years now so its nearly time to move on in any case i promise you nothing dont depend on me hoyt ill please myself first you cant hunt humans orders already cians lips curved slightly typical as i said i please myself first it happens i havent fed on human blood for eight hundred years well seven hundred and fifty as there was some backsliding why to prove that i could resist and because its another way to survive and well in the world of humans with their laws if theyre prey its impossible to look at them as anything more than a meal makes it awkward to do business and death tends to leave a trail dawns coming distracted hoyt glanced around the windowless room how do you know i feel it and im tired of questions youll have to stay with me for now you cant be trusted to go walking about the city we may not be identical but you look too much like me and those clothes have to go you expect me to wear what are those theyre called pants cian said dryly and moved across the room to a private elevator i keep an apartment here its simpler youll pack what you need and well go i dont travel by day and i dont take orders i give them now and have for some time i have a number of things to see to before i can leave you need to step in here what is it hoyt poked at the elevator walls with his staff a mode of transportation itll take us up to my apartment how cian finally dragged a hand through his hair look ive books up there and other educational matter you can spend the next few hours boning up on twentyfirstcentury culture fashion and technology what is technology cian pulled his brother inside pushed the button for the next floor its another god this world this time was full of wonder hoyt wished he had time to learn it all absorb it there were no torches to light the room but instead something cian called electricity food was kept in a box as tall as a man that kept it cold and fresh and yet another box was used to warm and cook it water spilled out of a wand and into a bowl where it drained away again the house where cian lived was built high up in the city and such a city the glimpse morrigan had given him had been nothing compared to what he could see through the glass wall of cians quarters hoyt thought even the gods would be stunned by the size and scope of this new york he wanted to look out at it again but cian had demanded his oath that he would keep the glass walls covered and he would not venture out of the house apartment hoyt corrected cian had called it an apartment he had books so many books and the magic box cian had called a television indeed the visions inside it were many of people and places of things of animals and though he spent only an hour playing with it he grew weary of its constant chatter so he surrounded himself with books and read and read until his eyes burned and his head was too full for more words or images he fell asleep on what cian had called a sofa surrounded by books he dreamed of the witch and saw her in a circle of light she wore nothing but the pendant and her skin glowed milkpale in the candlelight her beauty simply flamed she held a ball of crystal aloft in both hands he could hear the whisper of her voice but not the words still he knew it was an incantation could feel the power of it of her across the dream and he knew she was seeking him out even in sleep he felt the pull of her and that same impatience hed sensed from her within his circle within his own time it seemed for an instant that their eyes met across the mists and it was desire that pierced through him as much as power in that instant her lips curved opened as if she would speak to him what the hell is that getup he came awake and found himself staring up into the face of a giant the creature was tall as a tree and every bit as thick he had a face even a mother would weep over black as a moor and scarred at the cheek and surrounded by knotted hanks of hair he had one black eye and one gray both narrowed as he bared strong white teeth youre not cain before hoyt could react he was hauled up by the scruff of the neck where he was shaken like a mouse by a very large angry cat put him down king before he turns you into a small white man cian strolled out of his bedroom and continued lazily into the kitchen how come hes got your face hes got his own cian retorted we dont look that much alike if you pay attention he used to be my brother that so son of a bitch king dropped hoyt unceremoniously back on the sofa how the hell did he get here sorcery as he spoke cian removed a clear packet of blood from a locked cold box gods and battles end of the world blah blah king looked down at hoyt with a grin ill be damned i always thought half of that crap you told me was well crap hes not much for conversation before hes had his evening fix he said to hoyt you got a name brother i am hoyt of the mac cionaoith and you will not lay hands on me again thats a mouthful is he like you both hoyt and king demanded in unison wearily cian poured the blood in a tall thick glass then set it in the microwave no to both king manages my club the one downstairs hes a friend hoyts lips peeled back in disgust your human servant i aint nobodys servant youve been reading cian took out the glass and drank some vampires of rank have human servants i prefer employees hoyts come to enlist me in the army he hopes to raise to fight the big evil the irs in better humor cian grinned hoyt saw something pass between them something that had once only passed between himself and his brother if only no i told you ive heard rumblings apparently for a reason according to the gossip of the gods lilith of the vampires is amassing her own army and plans to destroy humanity take over the worlds war pestilence plague you can jest hoyt said in barely suppressed fury christ jesus hoyt were talking about vampire armies and time travel bloody right i can joke about it going with you is likely to kill me where are you going cian shrugged at king back to my past i suppose to act in an advisory capacity at least for general sobriety there i dont know if were to go back or forward or to the side hoyt shoved books over the table but we will go back to ireland we will be told where we travel next got a beer king asked cian opened the refrigerator took out a bottle of harp and tossed it so when do we leave king twisted off the cap took a long slug you dont i told you before when it was time for me to leave ill give you controlling interest in the club apparently that times come king simply turned to hoyt you raising an army general hoyt i am yes you just got your first recruit stop cian strode around the counter that separated the kitchen this isnt for you you dont know anything about this i know about you king returned i know i like a good fight and i havent had one in a while youre talking major battle good against evil i like to pick my side from the get if hes a king why should he take orders from you hoyt put in and the black giant laughed so hard and long he had to sit on the sofa gotcha misplaced loyalty will get you killed my choice brother king tipped the bottle toward cian once again something silent and strong passed between them with no more than a look and i dont figure my loyaltys misplaced hoyt go somewhere else cian jerked a thumb toward his bedroom go in there i want a word in private with this idiot he cared hoyt thought as he obliged cian cared about this man a human trait nothing hed read had indicated vampyres could have true feelings toward humans he frowned as he scanned the bedroom where was the coffin the books had said the vampyre slept in the earth of his grave in a coffin by day what he saw here was an enormous bed one with ticking as soft as clouds and covered with smooth cloth he heard the raised voices outside the door but set about exploring his brothers personal room clothes enough for ten men he decided when he found the closet well cian had always been vain but no looking glass the books said the vampyre cast no reflection he wandered into the bathroom and his jaw dropped the expansive privy cian had showed him before retiring had been amazing and was nothing to this the tub was large enough for six and there was a tall box of pale green glass the walls were marble as was the floor fascinated he stepped into the box began to play with the silver knobs that jutted out of the marble and yipped in shock when a shower of cold water spurted out of many flatheaded tubes around here we take our clothes off before getting in the shower cian came in shut the water off with one violent twist of the wrist then he sniffed the air on second thought clothed or otherwise you could sure as hell use one youre fucking rank clean up he ordered put on the clothes ive tossed out on the bed im going to work he strode out leaving hoyt to fumble through on his own he discovered after some time and chill that the temperature of the water could be adjusted he scalded himself froze but eventually found the happy medium his brother must have been telling pure truth when he spoke of his wealth for here was luxury never imagined the scent of the soap seemed a bit female but there was nothing else hoyt wallowed in his first twentyfirstcentury shower and wondered if he might find a way to duplicate it by science or magic once he returned home the cloths hanging nearby were as soft as the bed had been he felt decadent using one to dry his skin he didnt care for the clothes but his own were soaked he debated going out and getting the spare tunic out of his case but it seemed best to follow cians advice in wardrobe it took him twice as long to dress as it would have the strange fastenings nearly defeated him the shoes had no laces but simply slipped on the foot he was forced to admit that they were quite comfortable but he wished there was a bloody looking glass so he could see himself he stepped out then came up short the black king was still on the sofa drinking from the glass bottle thats an improvement king observed youll probably pass if you keep your mouth mostly shut what is this fastening here its a zipper ah youre going to want to keep that closed friend he pushed to his feet cains gone on down to the club its after sunset he fired me youre burned i have salve no shit he terminated my employment hell get over it he goes i go he dont have to like it he believes well all die hes right sooner or later you ever see what a vamp can do to a man i saw what one did to my brother kings odd eyes went grim yeah yeah thats right well its this way i dont figure to sit around and wait for one to do it to me hes right theres been rumbling theres going to be a fight and im going to be in it a giant of a man hoyt thought of fearsome face and great strength you are a warrior bet your ass ill kick some vampire ass in this believe me but not tonight why dont we go on down see whats jumping thatll piss him off to his what had cian called it his club you got it he calls it eternity i guess he knows something about that chapter she was going to find him if a man was going to drag her into his dreams push her into outofbody experiences and generally haunt her thoughts she was going to track him down and find out why for days now she had felt as if she stood on the edge of some high shaky cliff on one side there was something bright and beautiful and on the other a cold and terrifying void but the cliff itself while a little unstable was the known whatever was brewing inside her he was part of it that she knew not of this time not of this place guys just didnt ride around on horses wearing cloaks and tunics in twentyfirstcentury new york as a rule but he was real he was flesh and blood and as real as she was shed had that blood on her hands hadnt she shed cooled that flesh and watched him sleep off the fever his face she thought had been so familiar like something she remembered or had caught a glimpse of in dreams handsome even in pain she mused as she sketched it lean and angular aristocratic long narrow nose strong sculpted mouth good slashing cheekbones his image came true on paper as she worked first in broad strokes then in careful detail deepset eyes she remembered vividly blue and intense with an almost dramatic arch of brows over them and the contrast of that black hair those black brows and wild blue eyes against his skin just added more drama yes she thought she could see him she could sketch him but until she found him she wouldnt know whether she should jump off the edge of that cliff or scramble back from it glenna ward was a woman who liked to know so she knew his face the shape and feel of his body even the sound of his voice she knew without question he had power and she believed he had answers whatever was coming and every portent warned her it was major he was tied to it she had a part to play had known almost since her first breath that she had a part to play she had a feeling that she was about to take on the role of her lifetime and the wounded hunk with the clouds of magic and trouble all around him was slated to costar hed spoken gaelic irish gaelic she knew some of it used the language occasionally in spells and could even read some in a very rudimentary fashion but oddly enough shed not only understood everything hed said in the dream experience vision whatever shed been able to speak it herself like a native so somewhere in the past the good long past she determined and possibly somewhere in ireland shed done scrying spells and locator spells using the bloodied bandage shed brought back with her from that strange and intense visit to wherever shed been his blood and her own talent would lead her to him shed expected it to be a great deal of work and effort doubled by whatever work and effort would be involved in transporting herself or at least her essence to his time and place she was prepared to do just that or at least try she sat within her circle the candles lit the herbs floating on the water in her bowl once more she searched for him focusing on the sketch of his face and holding the cloth shed brought back with her i seek the man who bears this face my quest to find his time his place i hold his blood within my hand and with its power i demand search and find and show to me as i will so mote it be in her mind she saw him brow furrowed as he buried himself in books focusing she drew back saw the room apartment dim light just slanting over his face his hands where are you she asked softly show me and she saw the building the street the thrill of success mixed with absolute bafflement the last thing shed expected was to learn he was in new york some sixty blocks away and in the now the fates glenna decided were in an allfired hurry to get things started who was she to question them she closed the circle put away her tools and tucked the sketch in her desk drawer then she dressed puzzling over her choices for a bit what exactly did a woman wear when she went to meet her destiny something flashy subdued businesslike something exotic in the end she settled on a little black dress she felt could handle anything she traveled uptown by subway letting her mind clear there was a drumming in her heart an anticipation that had been building in her over the past weeks this she thought was the next step to whatever was waiting and whatever it was whatever was coming whatever would happen next she wanted to be open to it then shed make her decisions the train was crowded so she stood holding the overhead hook and swaying slightly with the movement of the car she liked the rhythm of the city its rapid pace its eclectic musics all the tones and hues of it shed grown up in new york but not in the city the small town upstate had always seemed too limited to her too closedin shed wanted more always more color more sound more people shed spent the last four of her twentysix years in the city and all of her life exploring her craft something in her blood was humming now as if it knew some part of her knew shed been preparing all of her life for these next hours at the next station people filed on people filed off she let the sound of them flow over her as she brought the image of the man she sought back into her head not the face of a martyr she thought thered been too much power on him for that and too much annoyance in him shed found it she could admit a very interesting mix the power of the circle hed cast had been strong and so had been whatever hunted him they chased her dreams too those black wolves that were neither animal nor human but something horribly of both idly she fingered the pendant she wore around her neck well she was strong too she knew how to protect herself she will feed on you the voice was a hiss rippling over the back of her neck icing her skin then what spoke moved seemed to glide and float in a circle around her and the cold from it had the breath that trembled from between her lips frosting the air the other passengers continued to sit or stand read or chat undisturbed unaware of the thing that slithered around their bodies like a snake its eyes were red its eye teeth long and sharp blood stained them dripped obscenely from its mouth inside her chest glennas heart tightened like a fist and began to beat beat beat against her ribs it had human form and worse somehow worse wore a business suit blue pinstripes she noted dully crisp white shirt and paisley tie we are forever it swiped a bloody hand over the cheek of a woman who sat reading a paperback novel even while red stained her cheek the woman turned the page and continued to read we will herd you like cattle ride you like horses trap you like rats your powers are puny and pathetic and when were done with you well dance on your bones then why are you afraid it peeled back its lips in a snarl and it leaped glenna choked on a scream stumbled back as the train streaked through a tunnel the thing vanished watch it lady she got an impatient elbow and mutter from the man shed fallen into sorry she gripped the hook again with a hand gone slick with sweat she could still smell the blood as she rode the last blocks uptown for the first time in her life glenna actively feared the dark the streets the people who passed by she had to struggle to not run when the train stopped had to suppress the urge to shove and push her way off and race across the platform to the steps leading up she walked quickly and even with the city noises she heard the rapid clip of her heels on the sidewalk and the fearful wheeze of her own breath there was a line snaking out from the entrance of the club called eternity couples and singles crammed together hoping to get the signal to go inside rather than wait she walked up to the man on the door she flashed a smile did a quick charm he passed her through without checking his list or her id inside was music blue light and the throb of excitement for once the press of humanity the pulse and beat didnt excite her too many faces she thought too many heartbeats she wanted only one and the prospect of finding him among so many suddenly seemed impossible every bump and jostle as she worked her way into the club jolted through her and her own fear shamed her she wasnt defenseless she wasnt weak but she felt both the thing on the train had been every nightmare and that nightmare had been sent to her for her it had known her fear she thought now and it had played with it taunted her until her knees were water and the screams inside her had slashed her mind like razors shed been too shocked too frightened to reach for the only weapon she held magic now anger began to eke through the terror shed told herself she was a seeker a woman who took risks valued knowledge a woman who possessed defenses and skills most couldnt imagine yet here she was quivering at the first real whiff of danger she stiffened her spine evened her breathing then headed straight for the huge circular bar halfway across the silver span of the floor she saw him the flood of relief came first then the pride that shed succeeded in this initial task so quickly a trickle of interest worked its way through as she veered in his direction the guy cleaned up very well his hair was carelessly styled rather than ragged a shining black and shorter than it had been during their first meeting then again hed been wounded troubled and in a hell of a fix he wore black and it suited him just as the watchful slightly irritable look in those brilliant eyes suited him with a great deal of her confidence restored she smiled and stepped into his path ive been looking for you cian paused he was accustomed to women approaching him not that he couldnt get some enjoyment from it particularly when the woman was exceptional as this one was there was a spark in her eyes jewel green and a flirtatious hint of amusement her lips were full sensuous and curved her voice low and husky her body was a good one and poured into a little black dress that showed a great deal of milky skin and strong muscle tone he might have amused himself with her for a few moments but for the pendant she wore witches and worse those who played at witchcraft could be troublesome i enjoy being looked for by beautiful women when i have time to be found he would have left it at that moved on but she touched his arm he felt something and apparently so did she for her eyes narrowed and the smile faded youre not him you only look like him her hand tightened on his arm and he sensed power seeking but thats not completely true either damn it she dropped her hand shook back her hair i shouldve known it wouldnt be so easy this time he took her arm lets get you a table in a dark quiet corner cian thought until he knew who or what she was i need information i need to find someone you need a drink cian said pleasantly and steered her quickly through the crowd look i can get my own drink if i want one glenna considered causing a scene but decided it would probably get her tossed out she considered a push of power but knew from experience that depending on magic for every irritation led to trouble she glanced around gauging the situation the place was stacked with people on every level the music was a throb heavy on the bass with the female singer purring out the lyrics in a sensual and feline voice very public very active glenna decided with a lot of chrome and blue lighting slicking class over sex what could he possibly do to her under the circumstances im looking for someone conversation she told herself keep it conversational and friendly i thought you were him the light in here isnt the best but you look enough alike to be brothers its very important i find him whats his name maybe i can help you i dont know his name and the fact that she didnt made her feel foolish and okay i know how that sounds but i was told he was here i think hes in trouble if youd just she started to shove at his hand found it hard as stone what could he do to her in these circumstances she thought again almost any damn thing with the first fresh flicker of panic tickling her throat she closed her eyes and reached for power his hand flinched on her arm then his grip tightened so youre a real one he murmured and turned those eyes as steely as his grip on her i think well take this upstairs im not going anywhere with you something akin to the fear shed felt on the subway worked its way into her that was low wattage believe me you dont want me to up the amps believe me and his voice was silky you dont want to piss me off he pulled her behind the curve of open spiral stairs she planted her feet prepared to defend herself by any and all means at her disposal she brought the fourinch spike of her heel down on his instep slammed a backfist into his jaw rather than wasting her breath on a scream she began an incantation her breath whooshed out when he lifted her off her feet as if she weighed nothing her only satisfaction came from the fact that in thirty seconds when she finished the spell hed be flat on his ass that didnt stop her from fighting she reared back elbows and feet and sucked in a breath to add a scream after all and the doors on what she saw was a private elevator whisked open there he was flesh and blood and so like the man currently heaving her over his shoulder she decided she could hate him too put me down you son of a bitch or ill turn this place into a moon crater when the doors of the transportation box opened hoyt was assaulted with noise and smells and lights they all slammed into his system stunning his senses he saw through dazzled eyes his brother with his arms full of struggling woman his woman he realized with yet another jolt the witch from his dream was halfnaked and using language hed rarely heard even in the seediest public house is this how you pay someone back for helping you she shoved at the curtain of her hair and aimed those sharp green eyes at him she shifted them scanned them up and down king snarled come on then she demanded i can take all three of you as she was currently over cians shoulder like a sack of potatoes hoyt wasnt certain how she intended to see the threat through but witches were tricky youre real then he stated softly did you follow me dont flatter yourself asshole cian shifted her effortlessly yours he said to hoyt i couldnt say deal with it cian dropped glenna back on her feet caught the fist aimed at his face just before it connected do your business he told her quietly then take off keep a lid on the magic both of you king he walked off after a grin and a shrug king trailed after him glenna smoothed down her dress shook back her hair what the hells wrong with you my ribs still pain me a little but im largely healed thank you for your help she stared at him then huffed out a breath heres how this is going to work were going to sit down youre going to buy me a drink i need one i i have no coin in these pants typical ill buy she hooked an arm through his to make sure she didnt lose him again then began to wind through the crowd did my brother hurt you what he had to shout how could anyone have a conversation in such noise there were too many people in this place was it some sort of festival there were women writhing in what must have been some sort of ritual dance and wearing even less than the witch others sat at silver tables and watched or ignored drank from clear tankards and cups the music he thought came from everywhere at once i asked if my brother hurt you brother that fits bruised my pride for the most part she chose the stairs moving up where the noise wasnt quite so horrific still clinging to his arm she looked right left then moved toward a low seat with a candle flickering on the table five people were jammed around it and all seemed to be talking at once she smiled at them and he felt her power hum hi you really need to get home now dont you they got up still chattering and left the table littered with those clear drinking vessels some nearly full sorry to cut their evening short but i think this takes precedence sit down will you she dropped down stretched out long bare legs god what a night she waved a hand in the air fingered her pendant with the other as she studied his face you look better than you did are you healed well enough what place are you from right to business she glanced over at the waitress who came to their table to clear it ill have a grey goose martini straight up two olives dry as dust she cocked a brow at hoyt when he said nothing she held up two fingers she tucked her hair behind one ear as she leaned toward him there were silver coils dangling from her ear in a celtic knot pattern i dreamed of you before that night twice before i think she began i try to pay attention to my dreams but i could never hold on to these until the last one i think in the first you were in a graveyard and you were grieving my heart broke for you i remember feeling that odd i remember more clearly now the next time i dreamed of you i saw you on a cliff over the sea i saw a woman with you who wasnt a woman even in the dream i was afraid of her so were you she sat back shuddering once oh yes i remember that now i remember i was terrified and there was a storm and you you struck out at her i pushed i remember i pushed what i had toward you to try to help i knew she was she was wrong horribly wrong there was lightning and screams she wished actively for her drink i woke up and for an instant the fear woke with me then it all faded when he still said nothing she drew in a breath okay well stick with me for a while i used my scrying mirror i used my crystal but i couldnt see clearly only in sleep you brought me to that place in the woods in the circle or something did why it was not my work it wasnt mine she tapped nails painted red as her lips on the table you have a name handsome im hoyt mac cionaoith her smile turned her face into something that all but stopped his heart not from around here are you no ireland i can hear that and in the dream we spoke gaelic which i dont not really but i think its more than where its when too isnt it dont worry about shocking me im immune tonight he waged an internal debate shed been shown to him and she had come within the circle nothing that meant harm to him should have been able to come within his protective ring while he had been told to seek a witch she was nothing nothing that hed expected yet shed worked to heal him and had stayed with him while the wolves had stalked his ring shed come to him now for answers and perhaps for help i came through the dance of the gods nearly a thousand years in time okay she whistled out a breath maybe not completely immune thats a lot to take on faith but with everything thats been going on im willing to take the leap she lifted the glass the waitress set down drank immediately especially with this to cushion the fall run a tab will you glenna asked and took a credit card out of her purse somethings coming she said when they were alone again something bad big fat evil you dont know i cant see it all but i feel it and i know im connected with you on this not thrilled about that at this point she drank some more not after what i saw on the subway i dont understand you something very nasty in a designer suit she explained it said she would feed on me she the woman on the cliff i think im going out on a limb here a really shaky one are we dealing with vampires what is the subway glenna pressed her hands to her eyes okay well spend some time later bringing you up to date on current events modes of mass transportation and so on but right now i need to know what im facing whats expected of me i dont know your name sorry glenna glenna ward she held a hand out to him after a brief hesitation he took it nice to meet you now what the hell is going on he began and she continued to drink then she held up a hand swallowed excuse me are you saying your brother the guy who manhandled me is a vampire he doesnt feed on humans oh good great points for him he died nine hundred and seventyodd years ago and youve come here and now from there and then to find him i am charged by the gods to gather an army to fight and destroy the army the vampyre lilith is making oh god im going to need another drink he started to offer her his but she waved him away and signaled the waitress no go ahead youre going to need it too i imagine he took a testing sip blinked rapidly what is this brew vodka martini you should like vodka she said absently seems to me they make it from potatoes she ordered another drink and some bar food to counteract the alcohol calmer now she listened to the whole of it without interrupting and im the witch there wasnt just beauty here he realized there wasnt just power there was a seeking and a strength some he would seek he remembered the goddess saying and some would seek him so she had i have to believe you are you my brother and i will find the others and begin begin what boot camp do i look like a soldier to you you dont no she propped a chin on her fist i like being a witch and i respect the gift i know theres a reason this runs in my blood a purpose i didnt expect it to be this but it is she looked at him then fully i know the first time i dreamed of you that it was the next step in that purpose im terrified im so seriously terrified i left my family to come here to do this thing i left them with only the silver crosses and the word of the goddess that they would be protected you dont know fear all right she reached out laid a hand on his in a kind of comfort he sensed was innate in her all right she repeated youve got a lot at stake but ive got a family too theyre upstate i need to make sure theyre protected i need to make sure i live to do what im meant to do she knows where i am she sent that thing to scare me off im guessing shes a lot more prepared than we are then prepared is what well get i have to see what youre capable of you want me to audition listen hoyt your army so far consists of three people you dont want to insult me we have four with the king what king the black giant and i dont like working with witches really she drew out the word as she leaned toward him they burned your kind just as hot as mine were kissing cousins merlin and you need me it may be that i do the goddess didnt say i had to like it did she i have to know your strengths and your weaknesses fair enough she said with a nod and i have to know yours i already know you couldnt heal a lame horse thats false and this time insult edged his voice it happens i was wounded and unable to mend a couple of broken ribs and a gash on your own palm so you wont be in charge of injuries if and when we manage to build this army its welcome you are to the task he snapped and building the army is what well do its my destiny lets hope its my destiny to get home in one piece she signed the check picked up her purse where are you going home i have a lot to do thats not the way we must stay together now she knows you glenna ward she knows all of us its safer we are and stronger together that may be but i need things from my home i have a lot to do theyre night creatures youll wait until sunrise orders already she tried for flip but the image of what had circled her in the subway came to her very clearly now he gripped her hand held her in her seat and felt the clash of their emotions in the heat that vibrated between their palms is this a game to you then no im scared a few days ago i was just living my life my terms now im being hunted and im supposed to fight some apocalyptic battle i want to go home i need my own things i need to think its fear that makes you vulnerable and foolish your things will be there in the morning just as they are now he was right of course added to it she wasnt sure she had the bravado or the courage to step back outside into the night and just where am i supposed to stay until sunrise my brother has an apartment upstairs your brother the vampire she flopped back against her seat isnt that cozy he wont harm you you have my word on it id rather have his if you dont mind and if he tries she held her palm up on the table focused on it a small ball of flame kindled just above her hand if the books and movies have it right his type doesnt do well with fire if he tries to hurt me ill torch him and your armys down by one hoyt merely laid his hand over hers and the flame became a ball of ice dont pit your skills against mine or threaten to harm my family nice trick she dumped the ice in her empty glass lets put it this way i have a right to protect myself from anyone or anything who tries to hurt me agreed agreed it will not be cian now he rose offered his hand i will pledge this to you here and now i will protect you even from him if he means you harm well then she put her hand in his got to her feet she felt it knew he did by the way his pupils dilated the magic yes but more i guess weve got our first deal as they went down turned toward the elevator cian cut across their path hold it where do you think youre taking her im going with him glenna corrected not being taken its not safe for her to go out not until daylight lilith already sent a scout after her check the magic at the door cian told glenna she can have the spare room tonight which means you get the couch unless she wants to share he can have the couch why do you insult her temper sizzled in the words shes been sent shes come here at risk i dont know her cian said simply and from now on i expect you to check with me before you invite anyone into my home he punched in the code for the elevator once youre up you stay up im locking the elevator behind you what if theres a fire glenna said sweetly and cian merely smiled then i guess youd better open a window and fly glenna stepped into the elevator when the doors opened then laid a hand on hoyts arm before the doors shut she flashed cian that smile again better remember who youre dealing with she told him we may do just that she sniffed when the doors shut i dont think i like your brother im not very pleased with him myself at the moment anyway can you fly no he glanced down at her can you not so far chapter the voices woke her they were muted and muffled so that at first she feared she was having another vision however much she might have prized her art she also valued sleep especially after a night of martinis and strange revelations glenna groped for a pillow to put over her head her attitude toward cian had leveled a bit after shed gotten a look at the guest room it boasted a sumptuous bed with lovely soft sheets and enough pillows to satisfy even her love of luxury it hadnt hurt that the room was spacious decked out with antiques and painted the soft warm green of forest shadows the bath had been a killer too she recalled as she snuggled in an enormous jet tub in gleaming white dominated a room nearly half the size of her entire loft with that same rich green for the acre of counters but it was the wide bowl of sink in hammered copper that had made her purr with delight shed nearly given in to the temptation to wallow in the tub indulge herself with some of the bath salts and oils housed in heavy crystal jars and arranged with fat glossy candles on the counter but images of movie heroines attacked while bathing had her putting that idea on hold all and all the vampires piedàterre she could hardly call such luxury a den made mincemeat of her little loft in the west village though she admired the vampires taste it didnt stop her from putting a protective charm on the bedroom door in addition to turning the lock now she rolled over shucked the pillow to stare at the ceiling in the dim light of the lamp shed left on low through the night she was sleeping in a vampires guest room shed displaced a twelfthcentury sorcerer to the sofa a gorgeous and seriousminded type who was on a mission and expected her to join in his battle against an ancient and powerful vampire queen shed lived with magic all of her life was gifted with skills and knowledge most people never dreamed existed in reality and still this was one for the books she liked her life the way it was and knew without a doubt that she would never have it quite that way again knew in fact she might lose that life altogether but what were her choices she couldnt very well do nothing couldnt put a pillow over her head and hide for the rest of her life it knew her and had already sent an emissary if she stayed pretended none of it had ever happened it could come for her any time anywhere and shed be alone would she fear the night now would she glance over her shoulder every time she was outside after sunset would she wonder if a vampire only she could see would slink onto the subway the next time she rode uptown no that was no way to live at all the only way to live the only real choice was to face the problem and handle the fear and to do just that along with joining her powers and resources to hoyts knowing sleep was no longer possible she glanced at the clock rolled her eyes at the early hour then resigned she climbed out of bed in the living room cian ended his night with a brandy and an argument with his brother he had on occasion returned to his living quarters at dawn with the sensation of loneliness a kind of hollowness he took no woman in the daylight even with the drapes closed sex was in cians mind a position of vulnerability as well as power he didnt choose to share that vulnerability when the sun was up it was rare for him to have company after sunrise and before dusk and those hours were often long and empty but hed discovered on stepping into his own apartment and finding his brother there he preferred the long and empty to the crowded and demanding you expect her to stay here until you decide your next move and im telling you that isnt possible how would she be safe otherwise hoyt argued i dont believe her safety is on my list of immediate concerns how much had his brother changed hoyt thought in disgust that he wouldnt immediately stand for a woman for an innocent were all at risk now everythings at risk now we have no choice but to stay together i have a choice and it isnt sharing my quarters with a witch or with you for that matter he added gesturing with the snifter i dont allow anyone in here during the day i was here through yesterday an exception cian got to his feet and one im already regretting youre asking far too much from one who cares far too little i havent begun to ask yet i know what must be done you spoke of survival and its yours at risk now as much as hers as mine more as your redhead might take it into her head to stake me while i sleep she isnt my frustrated hoyt waved that off i would never let her harm you i swear it to you in this place at this time youre my only family my only blood cians face went blank as stone i have no family no blood but my own the sooner you come to that hoyt accept that the better youll be for it what i do i do for myself not for you not for your cause but for me i said id fight with you and so i will but for my own reasons what are they then give me that at least i like this world cian eased down on the arm of a chair as he sipped brandy i like what ive carved out of it and i intend to keep it and on my own terms not on liliths whimsy thats worth the fight to me added to it a few centuries of existence has its eras of boredom i seem to be in one but i have limits having your woman tucked up in my quarters goes beyond them shes hardly my woman a lazy smile curved cians mouth if you dont make her so youre even slower than i remember in that area this isnt sport cian its a fight to the death i know more of death than you will ever know more of blood and pain and cruelty for centuries ive watched mortals again and again teeter close to their own extinction by their own hand if lilith were more patient she could simply wait them out take your pleasures where you find them brother for life is long and often tedious he toasted with his glass another reason ill fight its something to do why not join with her then hoyt spat out with the one who made you what you are she made me a vampire i made myself what i am as for why i align with you and not with her i can trust you youll keep your word for thats the way youre made she never will its not her nature and what of your word interesting question id like the answer to it glenna spoke from the doorway she wore the black silk robe shed found hanging in the closet with a number of other pieces of intimate female attire you two can squabble all you like its what men do and siblings but since my lifes on the line i want to know who i can count on i see you made yourself at home cian commented do you want it back when she angled her head reached for the tie cian grinned hoyt flushed dont be encouraging him hoyt said if youd excuse us for a moment no i wont i want the answer to your question and i want to know if your brother gets a little peckish is he going to look to me as a snack i dont feed on humans particularly witches because of your deep love of humanity because its troublesome if you feed you have to kill or word gets around if you change the prey youre still risking exposure vampires gossip too she thought it over sensible all right i prefer sensible honesty to lies i told you he wouldnt harm you i wanted to hear it from him she turned back to cian if youre concerned about me going after you id give you my word but why should you trust it sensible cian returned but your brothers already told me hed stop me if i tried he may find that more difficult than he believes but it would be stupid of me to try to kill you and alienate him given the situation were in im afraid but im not stupid id have to take your word for that as well idly she fingered the sleeve of her robe and sent him a mildly flirtatious smile if id intended to kill you id have already tried a spell youd know if i had youd feel it and if theres no more trust than this between the three of us were doomed before we start there you have a point what i want now is a shower and some breakfast then im going home she stays hoyt stepped between them when glenna started to step forward he merely lifted a hand and the force of his will knocked her back to the doorway just one damn minute be silent none of us leaves this place alone none of us if were to band together we start now our lives are in each others hands and a great deal more than our own lives dont flick your power at me again whatever i have to do ill do understand me hoyt shifted his gaze between them both of you dress yourself he ordered glenna then well go get whatever it is you think you need be quick about it in answer she stepped back slammed the door cian let out a short laugh you certainly know how to charm the ladies im going to bed hoyt stood alone in the living room and wondered why the gods thought he could save worlds with two such creatures at his side she didnt speak but a man who has sisters knows women often use silence as a weapon and her silence flew around the room like barbs as she filled some sort of carafe with water from the silver pipe in cians kitchen womens fashion might have changed radically in nine hundred years but he believed their inner workings were very much the same and still much of those remained a mystery to him she wore the same dress as the night before but had yet to don her shoes he wasnt certain what weakness it spoke to in him that the sight of her bare feet should bring on an unwelcomed tinge of arousal she shouldnt have flirted with his brother he thought with considerable resentment this was a time of war not dalliance and if she intended to stroll about with her legs and arms exposed shed just have to he caught himself he had no business looking at her legs did he no business thinking of her as anything but a tool it didnt matter that she was lovely it didnt matter that when she smiled it started something like a low fire in the center of his heart it didnt matter couldnt that when he looked at her he wanted to touch he busied himself with books returned her silence with his own and lectured himself on proper behavior then the air began to simmer with some seductive aroma he shot her a glance wondering if she was trying some of her womens magic but her back was to him as she rose on the toes of those lovely bare feet to take a cup from a cupboard it was the carafe he realized filled now with black liquid and steaming with an alluring scent he lost the war of silence in hoyts experience men always did what are you brewing she simply poured the black liquid from carafe to cup then turned watching him with chilly green eyes over the rim as she sipped to satisfy himself he got up walked into the kitchen and took a second cup down he poured the liquid as she had sniffed detected no poisons then sipped it was electric like a quick jolt of power both strong and rich potent like the drink the martini from the night before but different its very good he said then took a deeper drink in response she skirted around him crossed the room and went back through the doorway of the guest room hoyt lifted his gaze to the gods would he be plagued by bad tempers and sulks from both this woman and his brother how he asked how am i to do what must be done if already we fight among ourselves while youre at it why dont you ask your goddess to tell you what she thinks about you slapping at me that way glenna came back in wearing the shoes and carrying the satchel hed seen her with the evening before its a defense against what seems to be your argumentative nature i like to argue and i dont expect you to flick at me whenever you dont like what i have to say do it again and ill hit back i have a policy against using magic as a weapon but ill break it in your case she had the right of it which was only more annoying what is this brew she heaved a breath its coffee youve had coffee before i imagine the egyptians had coffee i think not the like of this he replied and because she smiled he assumed the worst of it was over im ready to go as soon as you apologize he should have known better such was the way of females im sorry i was forced to use my will to stop you from arguing the morning away so you can be a smartass this once ill accept that lets get moving she walked to the elevator pushed its button is it the fashion for women of this time to be aggressive and sharptongued or is it only you she glanced back at him over her shoulder im the only one you have to worry about right now she stepped into the elevator held the door coming shed worked out a basic strategy first she was going to have to spring for a cab whatever the conversation however strangely hoyt might behave a new york city cabbie would have seen and heard it all before added to that her courage wasnt quite back up to the level to let her ride the subway again as shed anticipated the minute they were out of the building hoyt stopped and stared he looked everywhere up down right left he studied the traffic the pedestrians the buildings no one would pay any attention to him and if they did theyd mark him as a tourist when he opened his mouth to speak she tapped a finger on her lips youre going to have a million questions so why dont you just line them up and file them well get to them all eventually for now im going to hail us a cab once were inside try not to say anything too outrageous questions might have been scrambling in his mind like ants but he cloaked himself in dignity im not a fool i know very well im out of place here no he wasnt a fool glenna thought as she stepped to the curb held up a hand and he was no coward either shed expected him to gawk but with having the rush and noise and crowds of the city thrust on him shed also expected to see some fear and there was none just curiosity a dose of fascination and a bit of disapproval i dont like the way the air smells she nudged him back when he joined her at the curb you get used to it when a cab cruised up to the curb she whispered to hoyt as she opened the door get in the way i do and just sit back and enjoy the ride inside she reached over him to pull the door shut and gave the cabbie her address when the cabbie shot back out into traffic hoyts eyes widened i dont know that much about it she said under the indian music pumping from the cabbies radio its a cab a kind of car it runs on a combustible engine fueled by gasoline and oil she did her best to explain traffic lights crosswalks skyscrapers department stores and whatever else came to mind she realized it was like seeing the city for the first time herself and began to enjoy it he listened she could all but see him absorbing and tucking all the information the sights the sounds the smells away in some internal data bank there are so many he said it quietly and the troubled tone had her looking over at him so many people he repeated staring out the side window and unaware of whats coming how will we save so many it struck her then a sharp weighted spear in the belly so many people yes and this was just part of one city in just one state we cant not all you never can she reached for his hand gripped it tight so you dont think of the many or youll go crazy we just take it one at a time she took out the fare when the cab pulled over which made her think of finances and how shed handle that little problem over the next few months she reached for hoyts hand again when they were on the sidewalk this is my building if we see anyone inside just smile and look charming theyll just think im bringing home a lover shock rippled over his face do you now and again she unlocked the door then squeezed with him into the tiny anteroom to call for the elevator with an even tighter squeeze they started up do all buildings have these elevators no but a lot of them do when they reached her apartment she pulled open the iron gate stepped inside it was a small space but the light was excellent her walls were covered with her paintings and her photographs and were painted the green of minced onions to reflect the light rugs shed woven herself dotted the floor with bold tones and patterns it was tidy which suited her nature her convertible bed was made up as a sofa for the day plumped with pillows the kitchen alcove sparkled from a recent scrubbing you live alone with no one to help you i cant afford help and i like living alone staff and servants take money and i dont have enough of it have you no men in your family no stipend or allowance no allowance since i was ten she said dryly i work women work just as men do ideally we dont depend on a man to take care of us financially or otherwise she tossed her purse aside i make my living such as it is selling paintings and photographs painting for the most part for greeting cards like notes letters messages people send each other ah youre an artist thats right she agreed amused that her choice of employment at least seemed to meet with his approval the greeting cards those pay the rent but i sell some of the artwork outright now and then i like working for myself too i make my own schedule which is lucky for you i dont have anyone to answer to so i can take time to do well what has to be done my mother is an artist in her way her tapestries are beautiful he stepped up to a painting of a mermaid rising up out of a churning sea there was power in the face a kind of knowledge that he took as inherently female this is your work yes it shows skill and that magic that moves into color and shape more than approval she decided admiration now and she let it warm her thanks normally that kind of thumbnail review would make my day its just that its a very strange day i need to change my clothes he nodded absently moved to another painting behind him glenna cocked her head then shrugged she went to the old armoire she used as a closet chose what she wanted then carried it into the bathroom she was used to men paying a little more attention she realized as she stripped out of the dress to the way she looked the way she moved it was lowering to be so easily dismissed even if he did have more important things on his mind she changed into jeans and a white tank letting the subtle glamour shed been vain enough to use that morning fade she did her makeup then tied her hair back into a short tail when she came back hoyt was in her kitchen fiddling with her herbs dont touch my stuff she slapped his hand away i was only he trailed off then looked deliberately over her shoulder is this what you wear in public yes she turned and just as deliberately invaded his space problem no you dont wear shoes not around the house necessarily his eyes were so blue she thought so sharp and blue against those thick black lashes what do you feel when were like this alone close unsettled thats the nicest thing youve said to me so far i mean do you feel something in here she laid a fist on her belly kept her eyes locked on his a kind of reaching ive never felt it before he felt it and a kind of burn in and under his heart as well you havent broken your fast he managed and stepped carefully back you must be hungry just me then she murmured she turned to open a cupboard i dont know what im going to need so im going to take whatever feels right im not traveling light you and cian have to deal with that we should probably leave as soon as possible hed lifted a hand was on the point of touching her hair something hed wanted to do since hed first seen her now he dropped it leave you dont expect to sit around in new york and wait for the army to come to you the portals in ireland and we have to assume the battles to take place in ireland or some mystical facet thereof we need the portal or at some point we will so we need to go to ireland he simply stared at her as she loaded bottles and vials into a case not dissimiliar from his own aye youre right of course youre right we need to start back a voyage will take much of the time we have oh jesus ill be sick as six dogs sailing home she looked over sailing we dont have time for the queen mary sweetie well fly you said you couldnt i can if its in a plane well have to figure out how to get you a ticket you dont have id you dont have a passport we can do a charm on the ticket agent the customs agent she brushed it away ill work it out a plain what she focused on him then leaned back against the counter and laughed until her sides ached ill explain later its not my purpose to amuse you no it wouldnt be but its a nice side pocket oh hell i dont know what to take what not to take she stepped back rubbed her hands over her face its my first apocalypse herbs flowers and roots grow in ireland and quite well i like my own which was foolish and childish but still ill just take what i consider absolutely essential in this area then start on books clothes and so on i have to make some calls too ive got some appointments that i need to cancel with some reluctance she closed her already loaded case and left it on the counter she crossed to a large wooden chest in the far corner of the room and unlocked it with a charm curiosity piqued hoyt moved over to study the contents over her shoulder what do you keep here spell books recipes some of my more powerful crystals some were handed down to me ah then youre a hereditary witch thats right the only one of my generation who practices my mother gave it up when she married my father didnt like it my grandparents taught me how could she give up whats inside her a question ive asked her many times she sat back on her heels touching what she could take and what she couldnt for love my father wanted a simple life she wanted my father i couldnt do it i dont think i could love enough to give up what i am id need to be loved enough to be accepted for what i am strong magic yeah she took out a velvet sack this is my prize from it she lifted the ball of crystal hed seen her with in the vision its been in my family a long time over two hundred and fifty years chump change to a man of your years but a hell of a run to me strong magic he repeated for when she held it in her hands he could see it pulse like a heart beating youre right about that she looked at him over the orb with eyes that had gone suddenly dark and isnt it time we used some isnt it time we do what we do hoyt she knows who i am where i am what i am its likely she knows the same about you about cian lets make a move she held the crystal aloft lets find out where shes hiding here and now cant think of a better time or place she rose jutted her chin toward the richly patterned rug in the rooms center roll that up will you its a dangerous step youre after taking here we should take a moment to think we can think while youre rolling up the rug i have everything we need for a locator spell everything we need for protection we can blind her to us while we look he did as she asked and found the painted pentagram under the rug he could admit that taking a step any step felt right and good but hed have preferred very much to take it alone we dont know if she can be blinded shes fed on magic blood and likely more than once shes very powerful and very sly so are we youre talking about going into battle within three months when do you intend to start he looked at her nodded here and now then she laid the crystal in the center of the pentagram and retrieved two athames from her chest she placed these in the circle then gathered candles a silver bowl crystal wands i wont be needing all these tools fine for you but i prefer using them lets work together merlin he lifted an athame to study its carving as she ringed the pentagram with candles will it bother you if i work skyclad aye he said without looking up all right in the spirit of compromise and teamwork ill keep my clothes on but theyre restricting she removed the band from her hair filled the silver bowl with water from a vial and sprinkled herbs on it generally i invoke the goddesses when casting the circle and it seems most appropriate for this suit you well enough youre a real chatterbox arent you well ready at his nod she walked to the opposite curve from him goddesses of the east of the west of the north of the south she began moving around the circle as she spoke we ask your blessing we call to you to witness and to guard this circle and all within it powers of air and water of fire and of earth hoyt chanted travel with us now as we go between worlds night and day day and night we call you to this sacred rite we cast this circle one times three as we will so mote it be witches he thought always rhyming but he felt the air stir and the water in the bowl rippled as the candles leaped to flame it should be morrigan we call on glenna said she was the messenger he started to do so then decided he wanted to see what the witch was made of this is your sacred place ask for guidance and cast your spell all right she laid down the sacred knife lifted her hands palms up on this day and in this hour i call upon the sacred power of morrigan the goddess and pray she grant to us her grace and prowess in your name mother we seek the sight ask you to guide us into the light she bent lifted the crystal into her hands within this ball we seek to find the beast who hunts all mankind while her eyes to us are blind make keen our vision our minds our hearts so the clouds within this ball will part shield us and show us what we seek to see as we will so mote it be mists and light swirled within the glass for an instant he thought he could see worlds inside it colors shapes movement he heard it beat as his heart beat as glennas heart beat he knelt as she did and saw as she did a dark place mazed with tunnels and washed by red light he thought he heard the sea but couldnt be sure if it was within the glass or just the roaring of power in his own head there were bodies bloodied and torn and stacked like cordwood and cages where people wept or screamed or simply sat with dull and deadened eyes things moved within the tunnels dark things that barely stirred the air some crawled up the walls like bugs there was horrible laughter high hideous shrieking he traveled with glenna through those tunnels where the air stank of death and blood down deep down in the earth where the stone walls dripped with wet and worse to a door scribed with ancient symbols of black magicks he felt the breath go cold in his body as they passed through she slept on a bed fit for a queen fourposted and wide with sheets that had the sheen of silk and were white as ice droplets of blood stained them her breasts were bare above the sheets and the beauty of her face and form were undiminished since last hed seen her beside her was the body of a boy so young hoyt thought with a terrible pity no more than ten years so pale in death with his cornsilk hair falling over his brow candles were guttering sending wavering light to flicker over her flesh and his hoyt gripped the athame lifted it over his head and her eyes opened stared into his she screamed but he heard no fear in it beside her the boy opened his eyes bared fangs and leaped up to skuddle along the ceiling like a lizard closer she crooned come closer sorcerer and bring your witch ill make a pet of her once i drain you dry do you think you can touch me as she leaped off the bed hoyt felt himself flying backward tearing through air so cold it was shards of ice in his throat then he was sitting within the circle staring into glennas eyes hers were dark and wide there was blood dripping from her nose she stanched it with a knuckle while she struggled to get her breath first part worked she managed the blinded part didnt take very well obviously she has power as well shes not without skill have you ever felt anything like that she asked him no neither have i she allowed herself one hard shudder were going to need a bigger circle chapter before she packed glenna took the time to cleanse the entire loft hoyt didnt disagree she wanted no trace of what theyd touched on no echoes no dregs of that darkness in her home in the end she put her tools and books back in the chest after what shed seen what shed felt she wasnt going to risk the pick and choose she was taking the whole lot along with her travel case most of her crystals some basic art supplies cameras and two suitcases she cast one longing look at the easel standing near the window and the barely started painting resting on it if she came back no when she corrected when she came back she would finish it she stood beside hoyt studying the pile of belongings as he did no comments she asked no arguments or sarcastic remarks about how i intend to travel to what end a wise stand now theres the little matter of getting all this out of here uptown and into your brothers place at which time i doubt hell be as wise as you but first things first she toyed with her pendant as she considered do we haul it all by hand or try a transportation spell ive never done anything of this scope he sent her a bland look wed need three of your cabs and most of what we have left of the day to deal with all of this so he considered the situation as well visualize cians apartment he ordered the room where you slept all right concentrate bring it fully into your mind the details the shape the structure she nodded closed her eyes i am he chose the chest first as he sensed it held the most power its magic would aid him in the task he circled it three times then reversed circled again while he said the words while he opened himself to the power glenna struggled to fix her focus there was something deeper richer about his voice something erotic in the way it spoke the ancient tongue she felt the heat of what he stirred on her skin and in her blood then a swift and solid punch of air when she opened her eyes the chest was gone im impressed more honestly she was amazed she was capable with considerable preparation and effort of transporting small simple objects some distance but hed simply and efficiently poofed a twohundredpound chest she could picture him now in billowing robes on the cliff hed spoken of in ireland challenging the storm charging himself with it and facing what no man should have to face with faith and with magic her belly tightened with sheer and simple lust was that gaelic you were speaking irish he said so obviously distracted she didnt speak again once more he circled focusing now on the cases that contained her photography and art equipment she nearly yipped a protest then reminded herself to have faith calling on it she closed her eyes again brought the guest room back into her mind gave him what she could of her own gift it took him fifteen minutes to accomplish what she was forced to admit would have taken her hours if she could have managed it at all well that was that was something the magic was still on him turning his eyes opaque rippling through the air between them she felt it like a ribbon wound around both of them tying them together her own arousal was so keen she had to step back deliberately break the bond between them no offense but are you sure theyre where we want them he continued to stare at her with those fathomless blue eyes until the heat in her belly grew so strong she wondered it didnt shoot fire from her fingertips it was nearly too much this pressure this need the mad beat of it at every pulse she started to step back again but he simply lifted a hand and stopped her in her tracks she felt the pull from him to him with just enough play for her to resist to snap that lead and escape instead she stood kept her eyes locked with his as he closed the distance between them with one easy stride then there was nothing easy he yanked her to him so that her breath expelled on a quick hitching gasp and that gasp ended on a moan when their mouths met the hot drugging kiss spun through her head through her body sizzling in her blood when she clung to him candles shed left in the room flashed into flame at once aggressive and desperate she dug her hands into his shoulders and plunged headfirst into the storm of sensation this this was what shed craved from the first moment shed seen him in dreams she felt his hands on her hair her body her face and everywhere he touched quivered no dream now just need and heat and flesh he couldnt stop himself she was like a feast after the fast and all he wanted was to gorge her mouth was full and soft and fit so truly to his it was as if the gods had formed it for only that purpose the power hed wielded had snapped back on him inciting an impossible hunger that ached in his belly in his loins in his heart and cried out to be sated something burned between them hed known it from the first instant even ill with fever and pain while the wolves stalked beyond his fire and he feared it nearly as much as he feared what they were fated to face together he drew her back shaken to the bone what theyd stirred was alive on her face sultry and tempting if he accepted and took what price would they both pay for it there was always a price i apologize i i was caught on the tail of the spell dont apologize its insulting women was all he could think touching you in that way isnt if i hadnt wanted you to touch me that way id have stopped you oh dont flatter yourself she snapped out when she read the expression on his face you may be stronger physically magically but i can handle myself and when i want an apology ill ask for one i cant find my balance in this place or with you frustration rippled out from him now as the magic had im not liking it or what im feeling for you thats your problem it was just a kiss he caught her arm before she could turn away i dont believe even in this world that was just a kiss youve seen what we have to face desire is a weakness one we cant risk everything we have must be charged toward what we have to do i wont risk your life or the fate of the world for a few moments of pleasure i can promise it would be more than a few but theres no point in arguing with a man who sees desire as a weakness lets chalk it up to the moment and move on im not after hurting you he began with some regret and she aimed a single quelling look apologize again and youre on your ass she picked up her keys her purse put out the candles would you and lets go i want to make sure my things arrived safely and weve got to arrange for flights to ireland and figure out how to smuggle you out of the country she grabbed sunglasses from a table put them on a great deal of her irritation faded at the baffled expression on his face shades she explained they cut the glare of the sun and in this case are a sexy fashion statement she opened the iron gate then turned looked back at her loft her things i have to believe ill come back here i have to believe ill see all this again she stepped inside pushed the button for the ground floor and left behind much that she loved when cian came out of his room glenna was in the kitchen cooking on their return hoyt had taken himself off to the study adjoining the living room hauling his books with him now and again she felt something ripple out and assumed he was practicing some spells it kept him out of her hair but it didnt keep him out of her head she was careful with men enjoying them certainly but she didnt share herself recklessly which is exactly what shed done with hoyt and she couldnt deny it it had been reckless impulsive and apparently a mistake and though shed said it had been just a kiss it had been as intimate an act as shed ever experienced he wanted her there was no question of that but he didnt choose to want her glenna preferred to be chosen desire wasnt a weakness not in her mind but it was a distraction he was right in that they couldnt afford distractions that strength of character and good solid sense were two of his appealing traits but considering her own jumpy system they were equally irritating ones so she cooked because it kept her busy and settled her down when cian came in looking sleek and sleepy she was briskly chopping vegetables mi casa is apparently su casa she kept right on chopping i brought some perishables among other things from home i dont know if you eat he looked dubiously at the raw carrots and leafy greens one of the advantages of my fate is i dont have to eat my vegetables like a good lad but hed scented what was on the stove and moved to it to sniff at the spicy tomato sauce simmering on the other hand this looks appealing he leaned back on the counter to watch her work so do you dont waste your questionable charm on me not interested i could work on that just to get under hoyts skin might be entertaining he tries not to watch you he fails her hand hesitated then she brought down the knife again im sure hell succeed eventually hes a very determined man always was if memory serves sober and serious and as trapped by his gift as a rat in a cage do you see it that way she set down the knife turned to him as a trap its not not for him not for me its a duty yes but its a privilege and a joy as well well see how joyful you are when youre in liliths path been there we did a locator spell at my place shes holed up in a cave with a series of tunnels near the sea i think near i think that cliffside where hoyt faced her she gave us a good solid blast we wont be so easy to push next time youre mad as fat tuesday the pair of you he opened his cold box took out a bag of blood his face tightened at the small sound glenna couldnt quite smother youll have to get used to it youre right i will she watched him pour the contents in a thick glass then set it in the microwave to heat this time it was a snicker she couldnt smother sorry but its just so damn odd he studied her obviously saw no rancor and relaxed want some wine sure thanks we need to go to ireland so im told no now as soon as it can be arranged ive got a passport but we have to figure out how to get hoyt out of this country and into another and well need a place to set up to stay and to well train and practice peas in a pod cian muttered pouring her a glass of wine its not a simple matter you know to delegate responsibilities for my businesses particularly since the man i trust to run the club downstairs is bound and determined to join hoyts holy army look i spent a lot of my time today packing transferring my rather limited funds so i could pay the rent on my place through october cancelling appointments and handing off a couple of what would be fairly lucrative jobs to an associate youll just have to manage he retrieved his own glass and what is it you do these fairly lucrative jobs greeting card art of the mystical variety i paint and do some photography you any good no i suck of course im good the paying photography is mostly weddings more arty stuff for my own pleasure and the occasional sale im adaptable at keeping the wolf from the door she lifted her wine how about you cant survive a millennium otherwise so well leave tonight tonight we cant possibly adapt he said simply and drank we need to check on flights buy tickets i have my own plane im a licensed pilot oh a good one he assured her ive several decades of air time so you neednt worry on that score vampires who drank blood out of pricey stemware and owned planes no what did she have to worry about hoyt doesnt have any identification no passport no papers i can work a charm to get him through customs but no need he crossed the room opened a panel on the wall she hadnt detected and revealed a safe once hed unlocked it he took out a lock box and coming back set it on the counter and flipped the combination he can take his choice cian said and pulled out a half a dozen passports well wow she plucked one opened it studied the picture handy you look so much alike the serious lack of mirrors in this place tells me the lore about no reflections hangs true no problem being photographed if youre using a reflector camera youd have a moment when the mirror engages when youd be very puzzled then it disengages as you shoot and there i am interesting i brought my cameras id like to try some pictures when theres time ill think about it she tossed the passport down i hope that plane of yours has plenty of cargo space because im loaded well manage ive calls to make and packing of my own to see to wait we dont have a place to stay it wont be a problem he said as he left the room ive something that will suit glenna blew out a breath looked back at the pot on the stove well at least well get in a good meal first it wasnt a simple matter even with cians money and connections laying a path the luggage and cargo had to be transported the ordinary and laborious way this time she could see all three of the men shed hooked her fate with looking for a way to cut down on her load she cut that route off with a firm it all goes and left it at that she had no idea what cian had in the single suitcase or the two large metal chests he packed she wasnt sure she wanted to know she couldnt imagine what they must have looked like the two tall dark men the enormous black man and the redhead with enough luggage to resink the titanic she enjoyed the privilege of being female and left it to the men to do the loading while she explored cians sleek and elegantly appointed private jet he wasnt afraid of color or of spending his money she had to give him credit for that the seats were a deep rich blue in buttery leather and generous enough to be comfortable for even a man of kings proportions the carpet was thick enough to sleep on it boasted a small efficient conference room two sophisticated bathrooms and what she initially took to be a cozy bedroom more than that she realized when she noted it had no windows no mirrors and its own half bath a safe room she wandered into the galley approved it and appreciated the fact that cian had already called ahead to have it stocked they wouldnt starve on the flight to europe europe she trailed her finger over one of the fully reclining seats shed always planned to go to spend as much as a month painting taking photographs exploring visiting the ancient sites shopping now she was going and getting there well above the firstclass level but she wouldnt be wandering the hills and the sacred grounds at her leisure well you wanted adventure in your life she reminded herself now youve got it she closed a hand around the pendant she wore and prayed shed have not only the strength but also the wits to survive it she was seated when the men boarded and making a show out of enjoying a glass of champagne i popped the cork she said to cian i hope you dont mind it seemed appropriate sláinte he moved directly to the cockpit want the twodollar tour she asked hoyt want to look around she explained i imagine kings flown in this little beauty before and is thoroughly jaded beats the hell out of commercial king agreed and got himself a beer in lieu of champagne the boss knows how to handle this bird he gave hoyt a slap on the shoulder no worries because he looked far from convinced glenna rose and poured another glass of champagne here drink relax were going to be in here all night in a bird made out of metal and cloth a flying machine hoyt nodded and because it was in his hand sipped the bubbling wine its a matter of science and mechanics hed spent two full hours reading of the history and technology of aircraft aerodynamics exactly king tapped the beer bottle to hoyts glass then glennas heres to kicking some ass you look like youre looking forward to it glenna commented damn straight who wouldnt we get to save the frigging world the boss hes been restless the last few weeks he gets restless i get restless ask me this is just what the doctor ordered and dying doesnt worry you everybody dies he glanced toward the cockpit one way or another sides a big bastard like me doesnt go down easy cian strolled in were cleared boys and girls have a seat strap in got your back captain king followed cian back into the cockpit glenna sat offered a smile as she patted the seat beside hers she was prepared to soothe hoyt through his first flight youll need your seat belt let me show you how it works i know how it works i read of it he studied the metal for a moment then locked the pieces together in the event there is turbulence pockets of air youre not the least bit nervous i came through a time portal he reminded her he began to play with the control panel amusement crossing his face when the back reclined came up again i think ill be enjoying this trip bloody shame its got to be done over water oh i nearly forgot she dug into her purse pulled out a vial drink this itll help drink it she repeated when he frowned at the vial its herbs and some powdered crystals nothing harmful it may help the queasiness the reluctance was clear on his face but he downed it you have a heavy hand with the cloves you can thank me when you dont have to use the barf bag she heard the engines hum felt the vibration beneath her spirits of the night give us wings to take this flight hold us safe within your hand until we touch upon the land she slid her eyes to hoyt it never hurts he wasnt ill but she could see that her potion and his will were fighting a hard battle to keep his system steady she made him tea brought him a blanket then reclined his seat brought up the footrest herself try to sleep a little too ill to argue he nodded closed his eyes when she was sure he was as comfortable as she could make him she moved forward to join the others in the cockpit there was music playing nine inch nails she recognized in the copilots seat king had kicked back and was snoring along with the beat glenna looked through the windscreen and felt her heart do a little dance of its own there was nothing but the black ive never been in a cockpit before awesome view i can kick that one out of here if you want his seat for a bit no im fine your brothers trying to sleep hes not feeling very well he used to turn green crossing the shannon i imagine hes sick as a dog by now no just queasy i gave him something at takeoff and hes got an iron will to add to it do you want anything he glanced back arent you the helpful one im too revved up to sleep too restless to sit so coffee tea milk i wouldnt mind the coffee thanks for that she brewed a short pot brought him a mug of it then stood behind him staring out into the night sky what was he like as a boy as i told you did he ever doubt his power ever wish he hadnt been given the gift it was a strange sensation having a woman question him about another man generally if they werent talking about themselves they were asking about him trying to nudge aside what some of them saw as a curtain of mystery not that he ever told me and he would have cian said after a moment we were close enough in those days was there someone a woman a girl for him back there no he looked and he touched and he had a few hes a sorcerer not a priest but he never told me of one special to him i never saw him look at any of the girls as he looks at you to your peril glenna id be saying but mortals are fools when it comes to love and id say if you cant love when youre facing death then deaths not worth fighting lilith had a child with her did he tell you that he didnt no you need to understand theres no sentiment there no softness a child is just easy prey and a sweet meal her stomach turned but she kept her voice even eight or ten years old id say she continued in the bed with her in those caves shed made him like her shed made that child like her that shocks and angers you well thats fine then shock and anger can be strong weapons in the right hand but remember this if you see that child or one like him put your pity away because hell kill you without thought or mercy unless you kill him first she studied cian now that profile that was so like his brothers yet so completely his own she wanted to ask if hed ever turned a child or fed on one but she was afraid the answer might be unforgivable and she needed him could you do that destroy a child whatever hed become without thought or mercy he glanced at her and she saw hed known the other question running in her mind and youre no good to us or yourself if you cant do the same she left him then without a word and went back to stretch out beside hoyt because the conversation with cian had chilled her she pulled her own blanket up to her throat curled toward hoyts body heat and when she slept finally slept she dreamed of children with sunny hair and bloody fangs she woke with a start to find cian leaning over her a scream clawed up to her throat until she realized he was shaking hoyt awake she pushed at her hair skimmed her fingers over her face for a quick glamour they were speaking in low tones and she realized in irish english please i cant follow that much especially with the accents both turned vibrant blue eyes on her and cian straightened as she brought her chair up im telling him weve about an hour flight time left whos flying the plane kings got it for the moment well be landing at dawn good great she barely stifled a yawn ill throw some coffee and breakfast together so dawn aye dawn i need a good cloud cover rain would be a bonus can you do this otherwise king will land it hes capable and ill be spending the rest of the flight and the day in the back of the plane i said i could do it and i will we can do it glenna corrected well be quick about it will you ive been singed a time or two and its unpleasant youre welcome she muttered when he left them ill get a few things from my travel case i dont need them hoyt brushed her aside got up to stand in the aisle this time itll be my way hes my brother after all your way then how can i help call the vision to your mind clouds and rain rain and clouds he retrieved his staff see it feel it smell it thick and steady with the sun trapped behind the gloom dusky light light without power or harm see it feel it smell it he held his staff in both hands braced his legs apart for balance then raised it i call the rain the black clouds that cover the sky i call the clouds fat with rain that streams from the heavens swirl and close and lay thick she felt it spin spin out from him spin out to the air the plane shook bucked trembled but he stood as if he stood on a floor of granite the tip of the staff glowed blue he turned to her nodded that should do it well okay then ill make coffee they landed in gloom with the rain like a gray curtain a little overdone in glennas opinion and it was going to be a miserable drive from the airport to wherever the hell they were going but she stepped off the plane and onto ireland and there it was a connection instant and surprising even to her she had a quick sense of memory of a farm green hills stone fences and a white house with clothes flapping on a line in a brisk wind there was a garden in the dooryard with dahlias big as dinner plates and calla lilies white as wishes it was gone almost as quickly as it had come she wondered if it was her memory from another time another life or simply a call through her blood her grandmothers mother had come from ireland from a farm in kerry she had brought her linens and her best dishes and her magic to america with her she waited for hoyt to deplane this would always be home for him she saw it now in the pleasure that ran over his face whether it was a busy airport or an empty field this was his place and part very much a part she understood now of what he would die to save welcome home it looks nothing like it did parts of it will she took his hand and squeezed nice job with the weather by the way well that at least is familiar king trotted over wet as a seal his thick dreads dripped rain cains arranging for most of the stuff to be delivered by truck take what you can carry or have to have right now the restll be along in a couple hours where are we going glenna demanded hes got a place here king shrugged so thats where were going they had a van and even then it was a tight squeeze and glenna discovered another sort of adventure altogether to sweep along through the pouring rain on wet roads many of which seemed as narrow as a willow stem she saw hedgerows ripe with fuchsia and those hills of wet emerald rolling up and back into the dull gray sky she saw houses with flowers blooming in dooryards not the one of her quick image but close enough to make her smile something here had belonged to her once now maybe it would again i know this place hoyt murmured i know this land see glenna patted his hand i knew some of it would be the same for you no this place this land he pushed up to grab cian by the shoulder cian mind the driver cian ordered and shook off his brothers hand before turning between the hedgerows and onto a narrow spit of a land that wound back through a dense forest god hoyt breathed sweet god the house was stone alone among the trees and quiet as a tomb old and wide with the jut of a tower and the stone aprons of terraces in the gloom it looked deserted and out of its time and still there was a garden outside the door of roses and lilies and the wide plates of dahlia foxglove sprang tall and purple among the trees its still here hoyt spoke in a voice thick with emotion it survived it still stands understanding now glenna gave his hand another squeeze its your home the one i left only days ago the one i left nearly a thousand years ago ive come home chapter it wasnt the same the furnishings the colors the light even the sound his footsteps made crossing the floor had changed turning the familiar into the foreign he recognized a few pieces some candlestands and a chest but they were in the wrong places logs had been set in the hearth but were yet unlit and there were no dogs curled up on the floor or thumping their tails in greeting hoyt moved through the rooms like a ghost perhaps thats what he was his life had begun in this house and so much of it had been woven together under its roof or on its grounds he had played here and worked here eaten and slept here but that was hundreds of years in the past so perhaps in a very true sense his life had ended here as well his initial joy in seeing the house dropped away with a weight of sadness for all that hed lost then he saw encased in glass on the wall one of his mothers tapestries he moved to it touched his fingers to the glass as she came winging back to him her face her voice her scent were as real as the air around him it was the last shed finished before i died cian finished i remember i came across it in an auction that and a few other things over time i was able to acquire the house oh about four hundred years ago now i suppose most of the land as well but you dont live here any longer its a bit out of the way for me and not convenient to my work or pleasures i have a caretaker whom ive sent off until i order him back and i generally come over once a year or so hoyt dropped his hand turned its changed change is inevitable the kitchens been modernized theres plumbing and electricity still its drafty for all that the bedrooms upstairs are furnished so take your choices im going up to get some sleep he started out glanced back oh and you can stop the rain if youve a mind to king give me a hand will you hauling some of this business up sure very cool digs if you dont mind a little spooky king hauled up a chest the way another man might have picked up a briefcase and headed up the main stairs are you all right glenna asked hoyt i dont know what i am he went to the window drew back heavy drapes to look out on the raindrenched forest its here this place the stones set by my ancestors im grateful for that but theyre not here the family you left behind its hard what youre doing harder for you than the rest of us we all share it i left my loft you left your life she stepped to him brushed a kiss over his cheek she had thought to offer to fix a hot meal but saw that what he needed most just then was solitude im going up grab a room a shower and a bed he nodded continued to stare out the window the rain suited his mood but it was best to close the spell even when he had it continued to rain but in a fine misty drizzle the fog crawled across the ground twined around the feet of the rose bushes could they be his mothers still unlikely but they were roses after all that would have pleased her he wondered if in some way having her sons here again together would please her as well how could he know how would he ever know he flashed fire into the hearth it seemed more like home with the fire snapping he didnt choose to go up not yet later he thought hed take his case up to the tower hed make it his own again instead he dug out his cloak swirled it on and stepped out into the thin summer rain he walked toward the stream first where the drenched foxgloves swayed their heavy bells and the wild orange lilies nola had particularly loved spread like spears of flame there should be flowers in the house he thought hed have to gather some before dusk there had always been flowers in the house he circled around drawing in the scent of damp air wet leaves roses his brother kept the place tended hoyt couldnt fault him for that he saw the stables were still there not the same but in the same spot they were larger than theyd been with a jut to one side that boasted a wide door he found it locked so opened it with a focused thought it opened upward to reveal a stone floor and some sort of car not like the one in new york he noted not like the cab or the van they had traveled in from the airport this was black and lower to the ground on its hood was a shining silver panther he ran his hands over it it puzzled him that there were so many different types of cars in this world different sizes and shapes and colors if one was efficient and comfortable why did they need so many other kinds there was a long bench in the area as well and all manner of fascinatinglooking tools hanging on the wall or layered in the drawers of a large red chest he spent some time studying them and the stack of timber that had been planed smooth and cut into long lengths tools he thought wood machines but no life no grooms no horses no cats slinking about hunting mice no litter of wriggling pups for nola to play with he closed and locked the door behind him again moved down the outside length of the stable he wandered into the tack room comforted somewhat by the scents of leather and oil it was well organized he saw just as the stall for the car had been he ran his hands over a saddle crouched to examine it and found it not so different from the one hed used he toyed with reins and bridles and for a moment missed his mare as he might have missed a lover he passed through a door the stone floor had a slight slope with two stalls on one side one on the other fewer than there had been but larger he noted the wood was smooth and dark he could smell hay and grain and he moved quickly now down the stone floor a coalblack stallion stood in the last of three stalls it gave hoyts heart a hard and happy leap to see it there were still horses after all and this one he noted was magnificent it pawed the ground laid back its ears when hoyt opened the stall door but he held up both hands began to croon softly in irish in response the horse kicked the rear of the stall and blew out a warning thats all right then thats fine who could blame you for being careful with a stranger but im just here to admire you to take in your great handsome self is all im about here have a sniff why dont you see what you think ah its a sniff i said not a nip with a chuckle hoyt drew back his hand a fraction as the horse bared his teeth he continued to speak softly and stand very still with his hand out while the horse made a show of snorting and pawing deciding bribery was the best tack hoyt conjured an apple when he saw the interest in the horses eye he lifted it took a healthy bite himself delicious would you be wanting some now the horse stepped forward sniffed snorted then nipped the apple from hoyts palm as he chomped it he graciously allowed himself to be stroked i left a horse behind a fine horse id had for eight years i called her aster for she had a star shape right here he stroked two fingers down the stallions head i miss her i miss it all for all the wonders of this world its hard to be away from what you know at length he stepped out of the stall closed the door behind him the rain had stopped so he could hear the murmur of the stream and the plop of rain falling from leaf to ground were there still faeries in the woods he wondered playing and plotting and watching the foibles of man he was too tired in his mind to search for them too tired in his heart to take the lonely walk to where he knew his family must be buried he went back to the house retrieved his case and walked up all the winding steps to the topmost tower there was a heavy door barring his way one that was deeply scribed with symbols and words of magic hoyt ran his fingers over the carving felt the hum and the heat whoever had done this had some power well he wouldnt be shut out of his own workroom he set to work to break the locking spell and used his own sense of insult and anger to heat it this was his home and never in his life had a door here been locked to him open locks he commanded it is my right to enter this place it is my will that breaks this spell the door flew open on a blast of wind hoyt took himself and his resentment inside letting the door slam shut behind him the room was empty but for dust and spiderwebs cold too he thought cold and stale and unused once it had carried the scent of his herbs and candlewax the burn of his own power he would have this back at least as it had been it would be again there was work to do and this was where he intended to do it so he cleaned the hearth and lit the fire he dragged up from below whatever suited him a chair tables there was no electricity here and that pleased him hed make his own light he set out candles touched their wicks to set them to burn by their light he arranged his tools and supplies settled in his heart in his mind for the first time in days he stretched out on the floor in front of the fire rolled up his cloak to pillow his head and slept and dreamed he stood with morrigan on a high hill the ground sheered down in steep drops slicing rolls with shadowy chasms all haunted by the distant blur of dark mountains the grass was coarse and pocked with rock some rose up like spears others jutted out in gray layers flat as giant tables the ground dipped up and down up again to the mountains where the mists fell into pockets he could hear hisses in the mists the panting breath of something older than time there was an anger to this place a wild violence waiting to happen but now nothing stirred on the land as far as his eye could see this is your battleground she told him your last stand there will be others before you come here but this is where you will draw her and face her with all the worlds in the balance on that day what is this place this is the valley of silence in the mountains of mist in the world of geall blood will spill here demon and human what grows after will be determined by what you and those with you do but you must not stand upon this land until the battle how will i come here again you will be shown we are only four more are coming sleep now for when you wake you must act while he slept the mists parted he saw there was a maiden standing on that same high ground she was slim and young with brown hair in a tumble down her back loose as suited a maiden she wore a gown of deep mourning and her eyes showed the ravages of weeping but they were dry now and fixed upon that desolate land as his had been the goddess spoke to her but the words were not for him her name was moira and her land was geall her land and her heart and her duty that land had been at peace since the gods had made it and those of her blood had guarded that peace now she knew peace would be broken just as her heart was broken she had buried her mother that morning they slaughtered her like a spring lamb i know your grief child her bruised eyes stared hard through the rain do the gods grieve my lady i know your anger she harmed no one in her life what manner of death is that for one who was so good so kind moiras hands bunched at her sides you cannot know my grief or my anger others will die even a worse death will you stand and do nothing what can i do how do we defend against such creatures will you give me more power moira held out her hands hands that had never felt so small and empty more wisdom and cunning what i have isnt enough youve been given all you need use it hone it there are others and they wait for you you must leave now today leave stunned moira turned to face the goddess my people have lost their queen how can i leave them and how could you ask it of me the test must be taken the gods themselves deemed this so if im not to be the one to stand in my mothers stead take sword and crown i still must bide here to help the one who does you help by going and this the gods deem so this is your charge moira of geall to travel from this world so you might save it you would have me leave my home my people and on such a day the flowers have not yet faded on my mothers grave would your mother wish you to stand and weep for her and watch your people die no you must go you and the one you trust most travel to the dance of the gods there i will give you a key and it will take you where you need to go find the others form your army and when you come here to this land on samhain youll fight fight she thought she had never been called to fight had only known peace my lady am i not needed here you will be i tell you to go now where youre needed now if you stay youre lost and your land is lost as the worlds are this was destined for you since before your birth it is why you are go immediately make haste they only wait for sunset her mothers grave was here moira thought in despair her life was here and all she knew im in mourning a few days more mother i beg you stay even one day longer and this is what befalls your people your land morrigan waved an arm parting the mists beyond them it was black night with only the silver ripple of light from the cold moon screams ripped through the air then there was smoke and the shimmering orange glow of fires moira saw the village overlooked by her own home the shops and cottages were burning and those screams were the screams of her friends her neighbors men and women ripped to pieces children being fed on by those horrible things that had taken her mother she watched her own uncle fight slashing with his sword while blood stained his face and hands but they leaped on him from above from below those creatures with fangs and eyes of feral red they fell on him with howls that froze her bones and while the blood washed the ground a woman of great beauty glided over it she wore red a silk gown tightly laced at the bodice and bedecked with jewels her hair was uncovered and spilled gold as sunlight over her white shoulders in her arms was a babe still swaddled while the slaughter raged around her the thing of great beauty bared fangs and sank them into the babes throat no hold your grief and your anger here and this will come the cold anger in morrigans voice pierced through moiras terror all you know destroyed ravaged devoured what are these demons what hell loosed them on us learn take what you have what you are and seek your destiny the battle will come arm yourself she woke beside her mothers grave shaking from the horrors shed seen her heart was as heavy as the stones used to make her mothers cairn i couldnt save you how can i save anyone how can i stop this thing from coming here to leave all shed ever known all shed ever loved easy for gods to speak of destiny she thought as she forced herself to her feet she looked over the graves to the quiet green hills the blue ribbon of the river the sun was high and bright sparkling over her world she heard the song of a lark and the distant lowing of cattle the gods had smiled on this land for hundreds of years now there was a price to be paid of war and death and blood and her duty to pay it ill miss you every day she said aloud then looked over to her fathers grave but now youre together ill do what needs to be done to protect geall because im all thats left of you i swear it here on this holy ground before those who made me ill go to strangers in a strange world and give my life if my life is asked its all i can give you now she picked up the flowers shed brought with her and laid some on each grave help me do this thing she pleaded then walked away he was waiting for her on the stone wall he had his own grief she knew but had given her the time shed needed alone he was the one she trusted most the son of her mothers brother the uncle shed seen cut down in the vision he jumped lightly to his feet when she approached and simply held open his arms going into them she rested her head on his chest larkin well hunt them well find them and kill them whatever they are i know what they are and we will find them kill them but not here not now she drew back morrigan came to me and told me what must be done morrigan at the suspicion on his face she was able to smile a little ill never understand how someone with your skills doubts the gods she lifted a hand to his cheek but will you trust me he framed her face kissed her forehead you know i will as she told him what shed been told his face changed again he sat on the ground shoving a hand through his mane of tawny hair shed envied his hair as long as shed lived mourning the fact that shed been given ordinary brown his eyes were tawny as well gilded shed always thought while hers were gray as rain hed been gifted with more height as well as other things she envied when she was finished she drew a long breath will you go with me id hardly let you go alone his hand closed over hers firm and steady moira how can you be sure this vision wasnt simply your heartbreak i know i can only tell you that i know what i saw was real but if its nothing more than grief well only have wasted the time it takes to go to the dance larkin i need to try then well try we tell no one moira listen to me urgently she gripped his wrists your father would do his best to stop us or to come with us if he believed me this isnt the way it isnt my charge one the goddess told me i was to take only one the one i trusted most it can only be you well write it down for him while were gone hell rule geall and protect it youll take the sword larkin began no the sword isnt to leave here that was a sacred oath and i wont be the one to break it the sword remains until i return i dont take my place until i lift it i dont lift it until ive earned my place there are other swords arm yourself she said so see that you do meet me in an hour tell no one she squeezed his hands now swear to me on the blood we share on the loss we share how could he deny her when tears were still on her cheeks i swear it to you ill tell no one he gave her arms a quick rub in comfort well be back by supper i wager in any case she hurried home across the field and up the hill to the castle where her blood had reigned over the land since it was created those she passed bowed their heads to her to show their sympathy and she saw tears glimmer and she knew when they dried many would look to her for guidance for answers many would wonder how she would rule so did she she crossed the great hall there was no laughter here now no music gathering the burdensome skirts of her gown she climbed the steps to her chamber there were women nearby sewing tending to children speaking in low voices so it sounded like doves cooing moira went quietly by and slipped into her room she exchanged her gown for riding clothes laced on her boots it felt wrong to put off her mourning garb so quickly so easily but she would travel more swiftly in the tunic and tewes she bound her hair back in a braid and began to pack she would need little but what was on her back she decided she would think of this as a hunting trip there at least she had some skill and so she got out her quiver and her bow a short sword and lay them on the bed while she sat to write a message to her uncle how did you tell a man whod stood in as father for so many years that you were taking his son into a battle you didnt understand to fight what was impossible to comprehend in the company of men you didnt know the will of the gods she thought her mouth tight as she wrote she wasnt certain if she followed that or simply her own rage but go she would i must do this thing she continued in a careful hand i pray you will forgive me for it and know that i go only for the sake of geall i ask that if i dont return by samhain you lift the sword and rule in my place know that i go for you for geall and that i swear by my mothers blood i will fight to the death to defend and protect what i love now i leave what i love in your hands she folded the letter heated the wax and sealed it she put on the sword shouldered her quiver and bow one of the women bustled out as she left her chambers my lady i wish to ride out alone her voice was so sharp her manner so curt that there was nothing but a gasp behind her as she strode away her belly shook but she didnt pause when she reached the stables she waved the boy away and saddled her mount herself she looked down at him his soft young face bursting with freckles when the sun sets youre to stay inside this night and every night until i tell you do you heed me aye my lady she wheeled her horse kicked her heels lightly at its flanks riding off at a gallop she would not look back moria thought she would not look back at home but forward larkin was waiting for her sitting loose in the saddle while his horse cropped grass im sorry it took longer women always take longer im asking so much of you what if we never get back he clicked to his horse walking it beside hers since i dont believe were going anywhere im not worried he sent her an easy smile im just indulging you id feel nothing but relief if this is nothing more than that but once again she urged her horse to a gallop whatever was waiting she wanted to meet it quickly he matched her pace as they rode as they had so often over the hills that sparkled in the sunlight buttercups dotted the fields with yellow giving swarms of butterflies a reason to dance in the air she watched a hawk circle overhead and some of the heaviness lifted from her her mother had loved to watch the hawk shed said it was moiras father there to look down on them while he flew free now she prayed her mother flew free as well the hawk circled over the ring of stones and raised its cry nerves made her queasy so she swallowed hard well we made it this far larkin shook back his hair what do you suggest are you cold do you feel the cold no its warm the suns strong today somethings watching she shivered even as she dismounted something cold theres nothing here but us but when he jumped down from his horse larkin laid a hand on the hilt of his sword it sees there were voices in her head whispers and murmurs as if in a trance she took her bag from the saddle take what you need come with me youre acting considerably strange moira with a sigh larkin took his own bag tossing it over his shoulder as he caught up with her she cant enter here never no matter what her power she can never enter this circle never touch these stones if she tries shell burn she knows she hates moira your eyes she turned them on him they were nearly black and they were depthless and when she opened her hand there was a wand of crystal in it you are bound as i am bound to do this thing you are my blood she took her short sword cut her palm then reached for his well bollocks but he held out his hand let her slice across the palm she sheathed the knife gripped his bloody hand with hers blood is life and blood is death she said and here it opens the way with his hand in hers she stepped into the circle worlds wait she began chanting the words that swirled in her head time flows gods watch speak the words with me her hand throbbed in his as they repeated the words the wind swirled whipping the long grass snapping their cloaks instinctively larkin put his free arm around her folding her into him as he tried to use his body as a shield light burst blinding them she gripped his hand and felt the world spin then the dark damp grass misty air they still stood within the circle on that same rise but not the same she realized the forest beyond wasnt quite the same the horses are gone she shook her head no we are he looked up he could see the moon swimming behind the clouds the dying wind was cold enough to reach his bones its night it was barely midday and now its night where the bloody hell are we where were meant to be thats all i know we need to find the others he was baffled and unnerved and could admit that he hadnt thought beyond the moment that would stop now for now he had only one charge to protect his cousin what were going to do is look for shelter and wait for sunrise he tossed her his pack then started to stride out of the circle as he walked he changed the shape of his body the sinew the bone in place of skin a pelt tawny as his hair in place of hair a mane now a stallion stood where the man had been well i suppose that would be quicker ignoring the knots in her belly moira mounted well ride the way that would be toward home i think that makes the most sense if any of this does best not gallop in case that way is different from what we know he set off in a trot while she scanned the trees and the moonstruck hills so much the same she thought but with subtle differences there was a great oak where none had been before and the murmur of a spring in the wrong direction nor was the road the same she nudged larkin off it in the direction where home would be if this were her world they moved into the trees picking their way now carefully following instinct and a rough path he stopped lifted his head as if scenting the air his body shifted under her as he turned she felt muscles bunch what is it what do you he flew risking low branches hidden rocks as he broke into a strong gallop knowing only hed sensed danger she lowered her body clung to his mane but it came like lightning flying out of the trees as if it had wings she had time to shout time to reach for her sword before larkin reared up striking the thing with both hooves it screamed tumbled off into the dark she would have urged him back into a gallop but he was already shaking her off already turning back into a man they stood backtoback now swords drawn the circle she whispered if we can get back to the circle he shook his head theyve cut us off he replied were surrounded they came slowly now slinking out of the shadows five no six moira saw as her blood chilled their fangs gleamed in the shivering moonlight stay close larkin told her dont let them draw you away from me one of the things laughed a sound that was horribly human youve come a long way to die it said and leaped chapter too restless to sleep glenna wandered the house it was big enough she supposed to accommodate an army certainly large enough to keep four relative strangers comfortable and afford some privacy there were high ceilings gorgeous with ornate plaster work and steps that spiraled or curved to more rooms some of those rooms were small as cells others spacious and airy chandeliers were iron the style intricate and artful and leaning toward the gothic they suited the house more than anything contemporary or even the elegance of crystal intrigued by the look she went back for a camera while she wandered she paused when the mood struck framed in a portion of ceiling or a light she spent thirty minutes alone on the dragons carved into the black marble of the fireplace in the main parlor wizards vampires warriors marble dragons and ancient houses secluded in deep woods plenty of fodder for her art she thought she could very well make up the hit to her income when she got back to new york might as well think positive cian must have spent a great deal of time and money refurbishing modernizing decorating she decided but then he had plenty of both rich colors rich fabrics gleaming antiques gave the house a sense of luxury and style and yes she thought the place just sat here year after year empty and echoing a pity really a waste of beauty and history she deplored waste still it was lucky he had it its location its size and she supposed its history made it the perfect base she found the library and nodded in approval it boasted three staggered tiers of books towering to the domed ceiling where another dragon stained glass this time breathed fire and light there were candlestands taller than a man and lamps with jeweled shades she didnt doubt the lakesized oriental rugs were the genuine articles and possibly hundreds of years old not only a good base she mused but an extremely comfortable one with its generous library table deep chairs and enormous fireplace she deemed this the perfect war room she indulged herself by lighting the fire and the lamps to dispel the gloom of the gray day from her own supply she gathered crystals books candles arranging them throughout the room though she wished for flowers it was a start but more was needed life didnt run on style on luck or on magic alone whatre you up to red she turned saw king filling the doorway i guess we could call it nesting hell of a nest i was thinking the same and im glad youre here youre just the man i need you and every other woman whatve you got in mind practicalities youve been here before right yeah a couple times where are the weapons when his eyebrows shot up she spread her arms those pesky items required for fighting wars or so ive heard since this would be my first war i know id feel better if i had a couple of howitzers handy dont think the boss runs to those what does he run to he considered what you got going in here she glanced toward the crystals just some things ive set around for protection courage creativity and so on this struck me as a good place to strategize a war room what she said when his lips curved in a wide grin guess youre on to something he walked over to a wall of books ran his big fingers along the carved trim youre not going to tell me theres a secret panel she finished with a delighted laugh when the wall swiveled out place is full of em king pushed the wall completely around before she could peek through the gap i dont know as hed want you poking around in the passages but you said weapons he gestured you got weapons swords axes maces daggers scythes every manner of blade hung gleaming on the exposed wall there were crossbows long bows even what she thought was a trident thats just a little bit scary she declared but stepped forward to take down a small dagger little advice king began you use something like that whatevers coming for you is going to have to get real close before it does you any good good point she replaced the dagger took down a sword wow heavy she replaced it took down what she thought would be termed a foil better you got any idea how to use that hack hack hack jab jab she gave it a testing swing found herself surprised she liked the feel of it okay no not a clue someone will have to teach me do you think you could slice through flesh with that cian spoke as he came in the room strike bone spill blood i dont know she lowered the sword im afraid im going to have to find out i saw what she was what she did what she has with her im not going into this with only potions and spells and im sure as hell not going to stand there and go eek if she tries to bite me you can wound them with that slow them down but you wont kill you wont stop them unless you use it to cut off the head with a grimace she studied the slender blade then resigned put it back took down the heavier sword swinging that around takes a great deal of strength then ill get strong strong enough muscles not the only kind of strength youll need she kept her gaze level ill get strong enough you know how to use this you and hoyt and you she said to king if you think im going to sit back stirring a cauldron when it comes time to fight think again i wasnt brought here so i could have men protect me i wasnt given this gift to be a coward me king said with that wide grin in place again i like a woman with grit gripping the hilt with both hands she sliced the air with the blade so whens my first lesson hoyt descended the stairs he tried not to mourn what was changed what was gone he would get back back to his true home back to his family and his life he would see the torches flaming on the walls again smell his mothers roses in the garden and he would walk the cliffs beyond his own cottage in chiarrai again and know the world was free of the vermin that sought to destroy it hed needed rest that was all rest and solitude in a place he knew and understood now he would work and he would plan he was done with this sensation of being swept away into what he couldnt understand darkness had fallen and those lights those strange harsh lights that came from electricity rather than fire illuminated the house it irritated him that he found no one about and could scent no supper cooking from the direction of the kitchen it was time to be busy and time the rest understood it was necessary to take the next steps a sound made him pause then hiss out a breath he followed the sound of clashing steel at a run then he swung toward where a doorway had been and cursed when he found sheer wall he sprinted around it and burst into the library where he saw his brother slashing a sword toward glenna he didnt think didnt hesitate he punched his power toward cian and sent his sword spinning away to clatter on the floor with her forward motion unblocked glenna sliced cians shoulder well shit cian flicked a hand at the sword even as glenna pulled it back in horror oh god oh my god is it bad how bad she dropped her sword to rush forward back with another sweep of power hoyt had glenna tumbling back and landing on her ass you want blood hoyt plucked up glennas discarded sword come then get mine king grabbed a sword from the wall slapped the blade against hoyts back off magic boy now dont interfere cian said to king step away slowly cian picked up his own sword met hoyts eyes you tempt me stop it stop it this minute what the hells wrong with you regardless of the blades glenna pushed between the brothers ive stabbed him for gods sake let me see he attacked you he did not he was giving me a lesson its nothing with his gaze still burning into hoyts cian nudged glenna aside shirts ruined and its the second ive trashed on your account if id wanted her blood i wouldnt take it with a sword waste it but for yours i could make an exception glennas breath wanted to heave the words wanted to babble but if she knew anything about men she knew it would take only a flick of a finger to have these two spilling each others blood instead she spoke sharply annoyed female to foolish boys it was a mistake an accident on all sides i appreciate you coming to the rescue she said to hoyt but i didnt and dont need the white horse and you she jabbed a finger at cian you know very well what it must have looked like to him so take it down a little and you she rounded on king you can just stop standing over there adding to it hey all i did was add more trouble she interrupted now go get some bandages i dont need them cian walked back to replace his sword i heal quickly which is something you need to bear in mind he held out a hand for kings sword the glance cian gave him might have been affectionate glenna thought or proud unlike our irritated witch i appreciate the gesture no big king handed cian the sword then sent glenna a kind of sheepish shrug unarmed now cian turned back to his brother you couldnt beat me with a sword when i was human you damn well couldnt take me now glenna put a hand on hoyts arm felt the muscles quiver put it down she said quietly this needs to stop she ran her hand down his arm to his wrist then took the sword the blade needs cleaning cian commented ill take care of it king stepped away from the wall ill toss something together for dinner while im at it got my appetite worked up even after he walked out glenna thought there was so much testosterone in the room she couldnt have hacked through it with one of cians battleaxes can we move on she said briskly i thought we could use the library for our war room and considering the weapons in here and the books on magic warfare vampires and demons it seems appropriate ive got some ideas i bet you do cian mumbled the first she moved to the table picked up her crystal ball did you learn nothing the first time hoyt demanded i dont want to look for her we know where she is or was she wanted to change the mood if there had to be tension she thought at least they could use it constructively others are coming thats what we keep being told there will be others i think its time we find some of them hed planned to do exactly that but could hardly say so now without looking foolish put that down its too soon to use it after the last time ive cleansed and recharged it regardless he turned to the fire well do this my way a familiar refrain cian stepped over to a cabinet took out a heavy decanter have at it then the pair of you im having a brandy elsewhere please stay glenna offered a smile and there was both apology and cajolery in it if we find someone you should be here to see we need to decide what to do all of us need to decide in fact i should go get king so the four of us can do this hoyt ignored them but found it wasnt quite as simple to ignore the little prick that might have been jealousy teaching her swordplay and her fretting over the slightest scratch he spread his hands and began to focus on the fire using his annoyance to mix the heat a nice thought cian nodded toward hoyt but it seems hes already started well for all right then all right but we should cast a circle i dont need one for this witches are forever casting circles spinning rhymes thats why true sorcery eludes them when glennas mouth dropped open cian grinned at her added a wink always been full of himself brandy no glenna set down her ball folded her arms thank you the fire snapped rose higher and began to eat greedily at the logs he used his own tongue the language of his birth and blood to draw the fire into a dance some part of him knew he was showing off drawing out the moment and the drama with a billow of smoke a hiss of flame the images began to form in the flames shadows and movement shapes and silhouettes now he forgot all but the magic and the purpose all but the need and the power he felt glenna move closer in body and in mind in magic in the flames the shapes and silhouettes became a woman on horseback her hair in a long braid down her back a quiver of arrows over her shoulder the horse was gold and sleek and moved at a powerful even reckless gallop through the dark forest there was fear on the womans face and a steely determination along with it as she rode low one hand clutched in the flying mane the man that wasnt a man leaped out of the forest and was struck away more took shape sliding out of the dark moving to surround the horse quivered and in a sudden shimmer of light was a man tall and lean and young he and the woman stood backtoback blades drawn and the vampires came for them its the road leading to the dance cian sprang toward the weapons grabbed a sword and a twoheaded ax go in with king he ordered glenna as he raced for the window stay here let no one in no one and nothing but he threw up the window and seemed seemed to fly out of it hoyt but he was already grabbing a sword a dagger do as he says he was out the window himself nearly as quickly as his brother glenna didnt hesitate she followed he made for the stables throwing his power ahead of him to open the doors when the stallion charged out hoyt held up his hands to stop him it was no time for niceties go back he shouted at glenna im going with you dont waste time arguing im in this too when he grabbed a handful of mane and sprang onto the horses back she tossed back her head ill follow on foot he cursed her but held down his hand for her to grip the horse reared as king charged the stables what the hells going on trouble glenna shouted back on the road to the dance when the horse reared again she wrapped her arms tight around hoyt go in the clearing moira fought but no longer for her life there were too many and they were too strong she believed she would die here she fought for time each precious moment of breath there was no room or time for her bow but she had her short sword she could hurt them did hurt them if her blade pierced flesh they shrieked and some fell back but they rose again and came again she couldnt count them no longer knew how many larkin battled but she knew if she fell they would have him so she fought to stand fought just to hold on two came at her and with her breath sobbing out she hacked at one his blood gushed out in a horrible scream as those red eyes rolled back to white to her horror one of his fellows fell on him and began to drink but still another got past her guard and sent her flying it pounced on her like a mad dog with greedy fangs and red eyes she heard larkin shout her name heard the terror in it as she struggled those fangs grazed her throat and the burn was beyond belief something came out of the night some dark warrior with sword and ax what was on her was hurled away her dazed eyes watched him cleave the ax down behead the thing it screamed and flashed and turned to dust take their head the warrior shouted to larkin then turned burning blue eyes on her use your arrows wood through the heart then his sword began to sing and slice she gained her feet yanked an arrow out of her quiver tried to steady her bloodslicked hand to notch it on the bow rider coming she thought dimly when she heard the thunder of hoofbeats another came for her a girl younger than herself moira shifted but there was no time to shoot the girl leaped and the arrow impaled her there was nothing left but dust the horseman jumped down sword already swinging they would not die moira thought as sweat dripped into her eyes they would not die tonight she notched an arrow let it fly the three men had formed a triangle and were beating the things back one slithered through crouched to charge the horse where a woman sat watching the battle moira scrambled forward trying to find a clear shot but could only call out a warning the second warrior spun around sword raised as he prepared to attack but the woman reared back the horse so its hooves flashed out to strike the thing down when the sword sliced through its neck there was nothing left but blood and dust in the silence moira sank to her knees fighting for breath and against a terrible sickness larkin dropped down beside her running his hands over her body her face youre hurt youre bleeding not bad not bad her first battle she thought and she was alive you nicks scratches can you get up ill carry you i can get up yes and no you wont carry me still kneeling she looked up at the man whod come out of the dark you saved my life thank you i think weve come to find you but im grateful you found us instead im moira and weve come through the dance from geall he simply looked at her for what seemed like the longest moment we need to get back and inside it isnt safe here larkin is my name he held out a hand you fight like a demon true enough cian clasped hands briefly lets get them back he said to hoyt and glanced toward glenna the two of you helped yourself to my horse good thinking as it turned out she can ride up with glenna i can walk moira began only to find herself lifted off her feet and onto the horse we need to move cian said briskly hoyt take point and you stay beside the women im behind you hoyt laid a hand on the stallions neck as he passed and glanced up at glenna youve a steady seat ive been riding since i was four dont think about trying to leave me behind again then she turned on the horse to look over her shoulder at moira im glenna nice to meet you its the pure truth i cant think of anyone in my life its been nicer to meet as the horse moved forward moira risked a look back she couldnt see the warrior he seemed to have melted into the dark what is his name the one who came on foot that would be cian hoyts up ahead theyre brothers and theres a great deal to explain on all sides but one things for damn sure we just survived our first battle and we kicked some vampire ass moira bided her time under normal circumstances she would have considered herself a guest and behaved accordingly but she knew that was far from the case she and larkin were soldiers now in what was a very small army it may have been foolish but she was relieved not to be the only woman inside the manor house she sat in a wondrous kitchen a huge man with skin dark as coal worked at a stove though she didnt think he was a servant he was called king but she understood this wasnt his rank he was a man like the others a soldier like her well patch you up glenna told her if you want to clean up first i can show you upstairs not until were all here glenna cocked her head all right then i dont know about the rest of you but i want a drink id kill for one larkin said with a quick smile actually it seems i have i didnt believe you not really he laid a hand on moiras im sorry its all right its no matter were alive and where were meant to be thats what matters she looked up as the door opened but it was hoyt who came in not the one called cian still she got to her feet we havent thanked you properly for coming to help us there were so many we were losing until you came weve been waiting for you i know morrigan showed you to me and you she said to glenna is this ireland it is yes but moira merely laid a hand on larkins shoulder my cousin believes ireland is a fairy tale even now we come from geall that which was made by the gods from a handful of ireland to grow in peace and to be ruled by the descendent of the great finn youre the scholar well she loves her books thats for certain now this is fine larkin said after a sip of wine and the one of many shapes hoyt added thatd be me all right when the door opened again moira felt relief rush through her like a tide cian flicked a glance at her then at glenna she needs tending to wouldnt budge until the gang was all here why dont you finish your wine larkin moira come on upstairs with me i have so many questions we all do lets talk over dinner glenna took moiras hand drew her out cian poured himself a drink dropped down at the table there was blood soaked through his shirt do you usually bring your woman into strange places larkin took another gulp of wine she wouldnt be my woman but my cousin and fact of it is she brought me had a vision or a dream or something mystical or other which isnt that unusual for her fanciful sort she is but she was bound and determined to do this thing and i couldnt have stopped her those things out there some came to geall they killed her mother he took another deep drink we buried her this morning if times the same here ripped her to pieces is what they did moira saw it how did she survive to tell it she doesnt know at least well she wont really speak of it not as yet upstairs moira washed in the shower as glenna had showed her the sheer pleasure of it helped ease her aches and hurts and she considered the heat of the water nothing short of miraculous when the blood and sweat had been washed away she put on the robe glenna left her then came out to find her new friend waiting in the bedchamber no wonder we speak of ireland like a fairy tale it seems like one you look better some color in your cheeks lets have a look at that wound on your neck it burns considerable moira touched her fingers to it its hardly more than a scratch its still a vampire bite examining it closely glenna pursed her lips not a puncture though or just barely so thats good ive got something that should help how did you know where to find us we saw you in the fire glenna poked into her case for the right balm youre the witch mmmhmm here we are and the one called hoyt is the sorcerer yes hes not from this world either or not from this time it looks like theyre getting us from all over hell and back how does that feel cool moira let out a sigh as the balm eased the burn she raised her eyes to glennas lovely thanks and cian what manner of man is he glenna hesitated full disclosure she decided honesty and trust had to be bywords of their little battalion hes a vampire going pale again moira pushed to her feet why would you say that he fought them he saved my life hes even now down in the kitchen inside the house why would you call him a monster a demon i didnt because i dont consider him either hes a vampire and has been one for over nine hundred years the one who made him is called lilith and shes the one we need to worry about hes hoyts brother moira and hes pledged to fight just like the rest of us if what you say he isnt human your cousin changes into a horse id say that makes him something more than human too its not the same maybe not i dont have the answers i do know cian didnt ask for what happened to him all those years ago i know hes helped us get here and he was the first one out of the house to fight for you when we saw you in the fire i know how youre feeling in her mind moira saw what had been done to her mother heard the screams smelled the blood you couldnt know well i know i didnt trust him initially either but i do now completely and i know we need him to win this here i brought you some clothes im taller than you but you can just roll up the pants until we get you something that fits better well go down have a meal talk some of this through and see what goes it seemed they would eat in the kitchen like family or like servants moira wondered if she could eat at all but found her appetite huge the chicken was fried juicy and crisp with heaps of potatoes and snap beans the vampyre ate little were gathered hoyt began and must gather more at some point yet to be known but it was to start with us and so it has tomorrow well begin to train to learn cian you know best how to fight them youll be in charge glenna and i will work on the magicks i need to train too then youll be busy well need to find our strengths and our weaknesses we need to be ready when the final battle takes place in the world of geall moira said in the valley of silence in the mountains of mist on the sabbot of samhain avoiding cians eyes she looked at hoyt morrigan showed me aye he nodded i saw you there when the time comes well go through the dance again and march to the battleground its five days walk so well need to leave in good time are there those in geall wholl fight with us any and all will fight any and all would die to save our home and the worlds the burden of it weighed down on her i have only to ask you have a lot of faith in your fellow man cian commented she looked at him now forced herself to meet his eyes blue she thought and beautiful would they go demonred when he fed so i do and in my countrymen and in humankind and if i did not i would order it so for when i return to geall i must go to the royal stone and if im worthy if im the one as there is no other i will pull the sword from that sheath and i will be queen of geall i wont see my people slaughtered by what made you what you are not like lambs if they die theyll die in battle you should know that the little skirmish you came through tonight was nothing it was nothing what were there eight ten of them therell be thousands he got to his feet shes had nearly two thousand years to make her army your farmers will have to do more than beat their plowshares into swords to survive then they will he inclined his head be ready to train hard and not tomorrow starting tonight you forget brother i sleep days he left them with that chapter glenna signalled to hoyt and left the others to king she glanced back toward the kitchen down toward the hall she had no idea where cian had gone we need to talk in private we need to work i wont argue with that but you and i need to go over some things alone he frowned at her but nodded if she wanted privacy there was one place he could be sure of it he lead the way up the stairs wound his way up to his tower glenna wandered the room studied his work areas his books and tools she went to each narrow window opened the glass that had been put there since his day closed it again nice very nice are you going to share the wealth what is your meaning i need a place to work more id say you and i need a place to work together dont give me that look she waved a hand at him as she walked over to shut the door what look would that be the im a solitary sorcerer and dont care for witches look were stuck with each other and with the rest somehow god knows we have to become a unit because cians right she walked back to one of the windows looked out into the moonstruck dark hes right shell have thousands i never looked that far never thought that big though jesus whats bigger than an apocalypse but of course shell have thousands we have a handful its as it was told to us he reminded her were the first the circle she turned back and though her eyes stayed level he saw the fear in them and the doubt were strangers and far from ready to join hands in a circle and chant some unity spell were uneasy and suspicious of each other even resentful when it comes to you and your brother i dont resent my brother of course you do she pushed at her hair and now he saw frustration as well you drew a sword on him a couple of hours ago i thought he yes yes and more gratitude for rushing to my rescue her dismissive tone insulted his chivalry and put his back up youre bloody welcome if you actually save my life at some point my gratitude will be sincere i promise you but defending the damsel was only part of it and answering that was only part of why he very nearly fought you you know it i know it and so does he that being the case theres no need for you to babble on about it she stepped forward he saw with some satisfaction his wasnt the only back up now youre angry with him for letting himself be killed and worse changed hes angry with you for dragging him into this and forcing him to remember what he was before lilith got her fangs into him all of thats a waste of time and energy so we either have to get past those emotions or we have to use them because as it stands as we stand shes going to slaughter us hoyt i dont want to die if youre afraid of course im afraid are you stupid after what weve seen and dealt with tonight wed be morons not to be afraid she pressed her hands to her face struggled to even her breathing again i know what has to be done but i dont know how to do it and neither do you none of us do she dropped her hands went to him lets you and i be honest here we have to depend on each other have to trust each other so lets be honest were a handful with power yes with skills but a handful against untold numbers how do we survive this much less win we gather more how she lifted her hands how in this time in this place hoyt people dont believe anyone who goes around talking openly about vampires sorcerers apocalyptic battles and missions from gods is either considered eccentric best case or put in a padded cell needing the contact she brushed a hand down his arm we have to face it theres no cavalry coming to the rescue here we are the cavalry you give me problems but no solutions maybe she sighed maybe but you cant find solutions until you outline the problems were ridiculously outnumbered were going up against creatures for lack of a better word that can only be killed in a limited number of ways they are controlled or led or driven by a vampire of enormous power and well thirst i dont know much about warfare but i know when the odds arent in my favor so we have to even the odds she spoke the kind of coldblooded sense he couldnt deny the fact that she would say it was in his mind another kind of courage how well we cant go out and cut off thousands of heads its just not practical so we find the way to cut off the head of the army hers if it were so simple it would already be done if it were impossible we wouldnt be here frustrated she rapped a fist on his arm work with me will you i havent a choice in that now there was hurt just the shadow of it in her eyes is it really so distasteful to you am i no and more than a shadow of shame in his im sorry no not distasteful difficult distracting youre distracting the way you look the way you smell the way you are oh her lips curved up slowly thats interesting i dont have time for you in that way what way be specific it wasnt fair she knew to tease and to tempt but it was a relief to simply be human lives are at stake whats the point of living without feeling i feel for you you stir something in me yes its difficult and its distracting but it tells me im here and that being afraid isnt all there is i need that hoyt i need to feel more than afraid he lifted a hand to brush his fingers over her cheek i cant promise to protect you but only to try im not asking you to protect me im not asking you for anything yet more than truth he kept his hand on her face bringing his other up to join it in framing her as he lowered his lips hers parted for him offering so he took needing as she did to feel and to know to be human it was a slow simmering in the blood a lazy tightening of muscle a flutter of pulse hers and his so easy he thought so easy to sink into the warm and the soft to be surrounded by her in the dark and let himself forget for a moment for an hour all that lay before them her arms slid around him linking his waist as she shifted up on her toes to meet his mouth more truly he tasted her lips and her tongue and the promise of them this could be his and he wanted to believe it more than hed ever believed anything her lips moved on his forming his name once then twice a sudden spark flared simmer to sizzle the heat of it rippled over his skin burned into his heart behind them the fire that had gone to embers flared up like a dozen torches he drew her back but his hands still lingered on her cheeks he could see the fire dance in her eyes theres truth in that he whispered but i dont know what it is neither do i but i feel better for it stronger she looked toward the fire were stronger together that means something she stepped back im going to bring my things up here and well work together and find out what it means you think lying together is the answer it may be or may be one of them but im not ready to lie with you yet my body is she admitted but my mind isnt when i give myself to someone its a commitment for me a big one both of us have committed quite a bit already well both have to be sure were ready to give more then what was this contact she said quietly comfort she reached a hand for his connection were going to make magic together hoyt serious magic thats as intimate to me as sex im going to get what i need bring it up women he thought were powerful and mystical creatures even without witchcraft add that dose of power and a man was at a serious sort of disadvantage wasnt her scent still wrapped around him and the taste of her still on his lips womens weapons he decided just as slipping away was a kind of weapon hed do well to arm himself against that sort of thing she intended to work here in his tower alongside him there was good strong sense in that but how was a man supposed to work when his thoughts kept drifting to a womans mouth or her skin her hair her voice perhaps hed be wise to make use of a barrier at least temporarily he moved to his worktable and prepared to do just that your potions and spells will have to wait cian said from the doorway and so will romance i dont follow your meaning hoyt continued to work i passed glenna on the stairs i know when a womans had a mans hands on her i could smell you on her not that i blame you cian added lazily as he strolled into and around the room thats a very sexy witch you have there desirable he added at his brothers stony look alluring bed her if you like but later who i bed and when is nothing to you who certainly not but whens another matter well use the great hall for combat training king and i have already begun to set up i dont intend to end up with a stake through my heart because you and the redhead are too busy to train it wont be a problem i dont intend to let it be the newcomers are unknown entities the man fights well enough with a sword but hes protective of his cousin if she cant stand up in battle we need to find another use for her its your job to see that she can and will stand up in battle ill work her cian promised and the rest of you but well need more than swords and stakes more than muscle well have it leave that to me cian he said before his brother could leave the room did you ever see them again do you know how they fared what became of them he didnt have to be told his brother spoke of their family they lived and they died as humans will is that all they are to you shadows are what they are you loved them once my heart beat once as well is that the measure of love a heartbeat we can love even we can love but to love a human cian shook his head only misery and tragedy could follow your parents sired what i was lilith made what i am and do you have love for her for lilith his smile was slow thoughtful and humorless in my fashion but dont worry it wont stop me from destroying her come down and well see what youre made of two hours handtohand every day cian announced when they were gathered two hours weapons training every day two hours endurance and two on martial arts ill work you here at night king will take over in the daylight when you can train outdoors we need time for study and strategy as well moira pointed out then make it theyre stronger than you and more vicious than you can imagine i know what they are cian merely looked at her you think you do had you ever killed one before tonight she demanded i have more than one in my world those that would kill their own kind are villains and outcasts if i hadnt youd be dead he moved so quickly no one had a chance to react he was behind moiras back an arm around her waist and a knife at her throat of course i wouldnt need the knife youre not to touch her larkin laid a hand on the hilt of his own knife youre not to put your hands on her stop me cian invited and tossed his knife aside ive just snapped her neck he laid his hands on either side of moiras head then gave her a little nudge that sent her careening into hoyt avenge her attack me i wont attack the man who fought at my back im not at your back now am i show some spine or dont the men of geall have any weve plenty larkin drew his knife crouched began to circle dont play at it cian taunted im unarmed you have the advantage use it quickly larkin lunged feinted then slashed and found himself flat on his back with his knife skittering over the floor you never have the advantage over a vampire first lesson larkin shook back his hair and grinned youre better than they were considerably amused cian held down a hand helped larkin to his feet well start with some basic maneuvers see what youre made of choose an opponent you have one minute to take that opponent down barehanded when i call switch choose another move fast and hard now he watched his brother hesitate and the witch turn into him using her body to shift him off balance then hooking her foot behind his to send him down selfdefense training glenna announced i live in new york while she was grinning hoyt swept her feet out from under her her ass hit the floorboards hard ouch first request we get pads for the floor switch they moved they maneuvered grappled and it was more game and competition than training even so glenna thought she was going to have her share of bruises she faced off with larkin sensed he would hold back so she sent him a flirtatious smile and when the laugh lit his eyes flipped him over her shoulder sorry i like to win switch the bulk of king filled her vision and she looked up up until she met his eyes me too he told her she went with instinct a movement of her hands a rapid chant when he smiled blankly she touched his arm why dont you sit down sure when he obeyed she glanced over saw cian watching her and flushed a little that was probably against the rules and its unlikely id be able to pull it off in the heat of battle but i think it should count there are no rules shes not the strongest he called out shes not the fastest but shes the most clever of the lot of you she uses wile and she uses wit as much as muscle and speed get stronger he said to glenna get faster for the first time he smiled and get a sword well start on weapons by the end of the next hour glenna was dripping sweat her sword arm ached like a bad tooth from shoulder to wrist the thrill of the work of actually doing something tangible had long since faded into a bitter exhaustion i thought i was in good shape she complained to moira all those hours of pilates of yoga of weights and i might as well be speaking to you in tongues youre doing well and moira herself felt weak and clumsy im barely standing i do regular exercise hard physical training and this is turning me into a wimp and you look beat its been a very long very hard day thats putting it mildly ladies if i could trouble you to join us or would you rather have a seat and discuss fashion glenna set down her water bottle its nearly three in the morning she said to cian a dangerous time for sarcasm and prime time for your enemy that may be but not all of us are on that same clock just yet and moira and larkin have traveled a hell of a long way today and dealt with a very nasty welcome we need to train youre absolutely right but if we dont rest were not going to get strong and were sure as hell not going to get fast look at her glenna demanded she can barely stay upright im fine moira said quickly cian gave her a long look then we can blame fatigue for your sloppy swordsmanship and poor form i do well enough with a sword when she reached for it blood in her eye larkin stepped up he slapped a hand on her shoulder and squeezed well enough she does so she proved earlier tonight but the blade wouldnt be my cousins weapon of choice oh a wealth of boredom was contained in the single syllable shes a decent hand with a bow she can give us a demonstration tomorrow but for now i can do it tonight open the doors the tone of command had cians brow winging up you dont rule here little queen nor do you she strode over picked up bow and quiver will you open the doors or will i youre not to go out hes right moira glenna began i wont have to larkin if you would larkin moved to the doors and threw them open to the wide terrace beyond moira notched an arrow as she moved to the threshold the oak i think cian moved to her side as the others crowded in not much of a distance she wouldnt be meaning the near one larkin said and gestured but that one there just to the right of the stables lowest branch i can barely see it glenna commented can you moira demanded of cian perfectly she lifted the bow steadied sighted and let the arrow fly glenna heard the whiz then a faint thunk as the arrow hit home wow got ourselves a robin hood nicely shot cian said in mild tones then turned to walk away he sensed the movement even before he heard his brothers sharp command when he turned moira had another arrow ready and aimed at him he sensed king prepare to rush forward and held up a hand to stop him be sure to hit the heart he advised moira otherwise youll just annoy me let it be he snapped to hoyt its her choice the bow trembled a moment then moira lowered it lowered her eyes as well i need sleep im sorry i need sleep of course you do glenna took the bow from her set it aside ill take you down get you settled glenna aimed a look at cian every bit as sharp as the arrow as she led moira from the room im sorry moira said again im ashamed dont be youre overtired overworked over everything we all are and its barely begun a few hours sleep is what we all need do they do they sleep glenna understood what she meant the vampires cian yes it seems they do i wish it was morning so i could see the sun they crawl back into their holes with the sun im too tired to think then dont here lets get you undressed i lost my pack in the woods i think i dont have a nightdress well figure that out tomorrow you can sleep naked do you want me to sit with you awhile no thank you no tears welled up and were willed back im being a child no just an exhausted woman youll be better in the morning good night glenna debated going back up then simply turned toward her own room she didnt give a damn if the men thought she was copping out she wanted sleep the dreams chased her through the tunnels of the vampires cave where the screams of the tortured were like slashing knives in her mind into her heart everywhere she turned in the labyrinth each time she raced into the dark opening like a mouth waiting to devour her the screams followed and worse than the screams even worse was the laughter the dreams hunted her along the rocky shore of a boiling sea where red lightning hacked black sky black sea there the wind tore at her there the rocks pierced up out of the ground to stab at her hands her feet until both were bloody into the dense woods that smelled of blood and death where the shadows were so thick she could feel them brushing over her skin like cold fingers she could hear what craved her coming with the papery snap of wings the slithery slide of snakes the sly scrape of claw on earth she heard the wolf howl and the sound was hunger they were everywhere she was and she had nothing but her empty hands and pounding heart still she ran blindly the scream trapped in her burning throat she burst out of the trees and onto a cliff above a raging sea below her waves lashed at rocks that rose up sharp as razors somehow in her terror shed run in a circle and was back above the cave that held something even death feared the wind whipped at her and power sang in it his power the hot clean power of the sorcerer she reached for it strained toward it but it slipped through her shaking fingers and left her nothing but herself when she turned lilith stood regal in red her beauty luminous against the velvet black at each side was a black wolf quivering for the kill lilith stroked her hands over their backs hands that glittered with rings and when she smiled glenna felt a terrible pull inside her own belly a deep and terrible yearning the devil or the deep blue with a laugh lilith snapped her fingers for the wolves to sit the gods never give their servants decent choices do they i have better youre death no no no im life thats where they lie theyre death flesh and bone moldering in the dirt what do they give you these days seventyfive eighty years how small how limiting ill take what im given then youd be a fool i think youre smarter than that more practical you know you cant win youre already tired already weary already questioning ill offer you a way out and more so much more to be like you to hunt and kill to drink blood like champagne oh the first taste of it i envy you that that first heady taste that moment when everything falls away but the dark i like the sun with that complexion lilith said with a gay laugh youd fry like bacon after an hour on the beach ill show you the coolness the cool cool dark its inside you already just waiting to be wakened can you feel it because she could glenna only shook her head liar if you come to me glenna youll stand by my side ill give you life eternal life eternal youth and beauty power so beyond what theyve given you youll rule your own world i would give you that a world of your own why would you why not ill have so many and id enjoy the company of a woman such as yourself what are men really but tools to us if you want them youll take them this is a great gift i offer you its damnation you offer me her laugh was lilting and seductive gods frighten children with talk of hell and damnation they use it to keep you bound ask cian if he would trade his existence his eternity his handsome youth and lithe body for the chains and traps of mortality never i promise you come come with me and ill give you pleasure beyond pleasure when she stepped closer glenna held up both hands drew what she could out of her chilled blood and struggled to cast a protective circle lilith simply struck out a hand the tender blue of her irises began to redden do you think such puny magic will hold me ive drunk the blood of sorcerers feasted on witches theyre in me as you will be come willing and take life fight and take death she moved closer and the wolves rose to stalk glenna felt the pull mesmerizing glorious and dark a drawing up in the belly that was elemental it seemed the beat of her blood answered that call eternity and power beauty youth all for one moment she had only to reach for it triumph lit liliths eyes burned them to red fangs flashed as she smiled tears slid down glennas cheeks as she turned as she leaped toward the sea and the rocks as she chose death there was a scream ripping through her head when she shot up in bed but it wasnt her own she knew it wasnt her own it was liliths a scream of fury with her breath sobbing glenna scrambled out of bed dragging the blanket with her she ran trembling from terror and cold her teeth chattering with them she fled down the hallway as if the demons were still after her instinct took her to the one place the only place she felt safe hoyt sprang out of a sound sleep to find his arms full of naked weeping woman he could barely see her in the dim predawn light but he knew her scent her shape what whats happened he started to shove her aside to reach for the sword beside his bed but she clung to him like ivy on an oak dont dont go hold on please please hold on youre like ice he dragged up the blanket trying to find warmth for her trying to find his wits have you been outside bloody hell have you done some spell no no no she burrowed into him she came she came into my head into my dream not a dream it was real it had to be real stop stop this he took a firm grip on her shoulders glenna her head jerked back her breath came shuddering out please im so cold then hush now hush his tone and his touch gentled while he brushed tears from her cheeks he wrapped her more fully in the blanket then pulled her close it was a dream a nightmare nothing more it wasnt look at me she tilted her head up so he could see her eyes it wasnt just a dream no he realized he could see it hadnt been only a dream then tell me she was inside my head or she pulled some part of me outside myself the way it was when you were in the woods hurt with wolves outside your circle just as real as that you know that was real aye it was real i was running she began and told him all of it she tried to lure you now think why would she do so unless she knew you were strong unless she knew you could hurt her i died you didnt no you didnt youre here cold he rubbed her arms her back would he ever be able to warm her again but alive and here safe she was beautiful alluring i dont go for women if you understand but i was drawn to her and part of it was sexual even in fear i wanted her the idea of her touching me taking me was compelling its a kind of trance nothing more and you didnt allow it you didnt listen you didnt believe but i did listen hoyt and some part of me did believe some part of me wanted what she offered so much wanted to live forever with all that power i thought inside me i thought yes oh yes why shouldnt i have it and turning away from it i nearly didnt because turning away from it was the hardest thing ive ever done yet you did this time every time they were your cliffs i felt you there i felt you there but i couldnt reach you i was alone more alone than ive ever been then i was falling and i was even more alone youre not alone here he pressed his lips to her forehead youre not alone are you im not a coward but im afraid and the dark she shuddered looked around the room im afraid of the dark he cast his mind toward the bedside candle toward the logs in the hearth set them all burning dawns coming here see he gathered her into his arms got out of bed with her to carry her to the window there now look east the suns rising she saw the light of it a gilding low in the sky the cold ball inside her began to ease morning she murmured its nearly morning you won the night and she lost it come you need more sleep i dont want to be alone you wont be he took her back to bed drew her against him because she still trembled because he could he passed his hand over her head and sent her gently into slumber chapter she woke with sunlight sliding over her face and she woke alone hed snuffed the candles out but left the fire burning low kind of him she thought as she sat up drawing the blanket over her shoulders hed been very kind and very gentle and had given her exactly the comfort and security shed needed still the wave of embarrassment came first shed run to him like a hysterical child fleeing from the monster in the closet sobbing shaking and incoherent she hadnt been able to handle it and had looked for someone for him to save her she prided herself on her courage and her wits and she hadnt been able to stand up to her first showdown with lilith no spine she thought in disgust and no real magic fear and temptation had smothered them no worse she thought fear and temptation had frozen them inside her deep where she hadnt been able to reach now in the light of day she could see how foolish shed been how stupid how easy shed done nothing to protect herself before during or after shed run through the caves through the woods on the cliffs because theyd wanted her to run and shed let terror block out everything but the desperate need to escape it wasnt a mistake shed make again she wasnt going to sit here wallowing either not over something that was done she got up wrapped herself in the blanket then peeked out into the corridor she saw no one heard nothing and was grateful she didnt want to talk to anyone until shed put herself back together she showered dressed then took a great deal of care with her makeup she hung amber drops at her ears for strength and when she made the bed she put amethyst and rosemary under her pillow after choosing a candle from her supplies she set it beside the bed when she prepared for sleep that night she would consecrate the candle with oil to repel lilith and those like her from her dreams she would also make a stake and get a sword from the weapons supply she wouldnt be defenseless and open again before she left the room she took a long look at herself in the mirror she looked alert she decided and capable she would be strong because she considered it the heart of any home she went to the kitchen first someone had made coffee and by process of elimination she figured it had been king there was evidence someone had eaten she could smell bacon but there was no one around and no dishes in the sink it was some small comfort to know whoever had eaten or at least whoever had cooked had also tidied up she didnt like to live in disorder but neither would she care to be in charge of all things domestic she poured herself a cup from the pot toyed with making some breakfast but there was enough of the dream left in her that the sensation of being alone in the house was uncomfortable her next choice was the library which she thought of as the main artery of the heart and there with some relief she found moira moira sat on the floor in front of the fire surrounded by books even now she was hunched over one like a student cramming for an exam she wore a tunic the color of oatmeal with brown pants and her riding boots she looked up as glenna entered offered a shy smile good morning to you good morning studying i am the shyness faded so those gray eyes shined this is the most marvelous room isnt it we have a great library in the castle at home but this rivals it glenna crouched tapped a finger on a book thick as a beam carved into its scrolled leather cover was a single word vampyre boning up she asked studying the enemy its wise to know all you can about whatever you can not all the books ive read so far agree on all things but there are some elements on which they do you could ask cian i imagine he could tell you whatever you wanted to know i like to read glenna only nodded where did you get the clothes oh i went out this morning early found my pack alone i was safe enough as i kept to the bright path they cant come out in the sunlight she looked toward the windows there was nothing left of the ones that attacked us last night even the ash was gone where is everyone else hoyt went up to his tower to work and king said he would go into the town for supplies now that there are more of us ive never seen a man so big he cooked food for us and there was juice from a fruit orange it was wonderful do you think i could take some of the seeds of the orange when we go back to geall i dont see why not and the others larkin i imagine is still sleeping he tends to avoid the mornings as if they were the plague the vampyre is in his room i would think moira rubbed her finger over the carved word on the book why does he stand with us i can find nothing in the books to explain it then i guess you cant find out everything from books is there anything else you need for now no thanks im going to grab something to eat then go up to work i imagine whenever king gets back well start whatever torture session he has in mind glenna i wanted to thank you for last night i was so tired and upset i feel so out of my place i know glenna put her hand over moiras i think in a way we all do maybe thats part of the plan taking us out of our place putting us together so we find ourselves what there is in us individually and together to fight this thing she rose until its time to move were going to have to make this our place she left moira to the books and returned to the kitchen there she found what was left of a loaf of brown bread and slathered butter on a slice damned if shed worry about calories at this point she nibbled on it as she climbed the stairs to the tower the door was closed she nearly knocked before she reminded herself it was her work area too and no longer hoyts solitary domain so she balanced the slice of bread on the mug of coffee unlatched the door he wore a shirt the color of faded denim with black jeans and scarred boots and still managed to look like a sorcerer it wasnt just the rich and flowing black hair she thought or those intense blue eyes it was the power that fit him more truly than the borrowed clothes irritation crossed his face first when he glanced at her she wondered if it was habitual that quick annoyance at being interrupted or disturbed then it cleared and she found herself being carefully studied so youre up then apparently he went back to work pouring some portcolored liquid from a kind of beaker into a vial king went for provisions so im told i found moira in the library reading from the looks of it every book in there so it was going to be awkward she realized as he continued to work in silence better to get past that i was going to apologize for disturbing you last night but thats just an indulgence on my part she waited one beat then two before he stopped to look over at her so you could tell me not to worry about it that of course it was all right i was frightened and upset that would be true enough it would and since we both know all that indulgent so i wont apologize but i will thank you its of no matter it is for me on several levels you were there when i needed you and you calmed me down made me feel safe you showed me the sun she set the mug down so her hands would be free as she crossed to him i jumped into your bed in the middle of the night naked i was vulnerable hysterical i was defenseless i dont think the last is true at that moment it was it wont be again you could have had me we both know that there was a long beat of silence that acknowledged the simple truth more truly than any words and what manner of man would i be to have taken you at such a time to have used your fear for my own needs a different one from what you are im grateful to the one you are she skirted the worktable rose to her toes to kiss both of his cheeks very you gave me comfort hoyt and you gave me sleep and you left the fire burning i wont forget it youre better now yes im better now i was caught off guard and i wont be the next time i wasnt prepared for her and i will be the next time i didnt take precautions even the simplest ones because i was tired she wandered to the fire he kept burning low sloppy of me aye it was she cocked her head smiled at him did you want me he got busy again thats not to the point ill take that as a yes and promise the next time i jump into your bed i wont be hysterical the next time you jump into my bed i wont give you sleep she choked out a laugh well just so we understand each other i dont know that i understand you at all but that doesnt stop the wanting of you its mutual on both counts but i think im beginning to understand you did you come here to work or just to distract me both i guess since ive accomplished the latter ill ask what youre working on there a shield intrigued she moved closer more science than sorcery theyre not exclusive but joined agreed she sniffed at the beaker some sage she decided and clove what have you used for binding agate dust good choice what sort of shield are you after against the sun for cian she flicked her gaze to his but he didnt meet it i see we risk attack if we go out at night he dies if he exposes himself to sunlight but if he had a shield we could work and train more efficiently if he had a shield we could hunt them by day she said nothing for a moment yes she was beginning to understand him this was a very good man one who held himself to high standards so he could be impatient irritable even autocratic and he loved his brother very much do you think he misses the sun hoyt sighed wouldnt you she touched a hand to his arm a good man she thought again a very good man who would think of his brother what can i do to help maybe i begin to understand you as well is that so you have an open heart now he looked at her an open heart and a willing mind theyre difficult to resist she took the vial from him set it down kiss me would you we both want that and it makes it hard to work kiss me hoyt so we settle down there might have been amusement just a sprinkle of it in his voice kissing will settle us down wont know unless we try she laid her hands on his shoulders let her fingers play with his hair but i know right this minute i cant think of anything else so do me a favor kiss me a favor then her lips were soft a yielding warmth under his so he was gentle holding her tasting her the way hed yearned to the night before he stroked a hand down her hair down the length of her back so the feel of her mingled in his senses with her flavor and her scent what was inside him opened and eased she skimmed her fingers over the strong edge of his cheekbone and gave herself completely to the moment to the comfort and the pleasure and the shimmer of heat flowing under both when their lips parted she pressed her cheek to his held there a moment i feel better she told him how about you i feel he stepped back then brought her hand to his lips and i suspect that ill be needing to be settled again for the good of the work she laughed delighted anything i can do for the cause they worked together for more than an hour but each time they exposed the potion to sunlight it boiled a different incantation glenna suggested no we need his blood he looked at her over the beaker for the potion itself and to test it glenna considered you ask him there was a thud at the door then king pushed it open he wore camo pants and an olive green tshirt hed tied his dreadlocks back into a thick fuzzy tail and looked glenna thought like an army all by himself magic hours over fall in outside time to get physical if king hadnt been a drill sergeant in another life karma was missing a step sweat dripped into glennas eyes as she attacked the dummy larkin had fashioned out of straw and wrapped in cloth she blocked with her forearm as shed been taught then plunged the stake into the straw but the dummy kept coming flying on the pulley system king had rigged and knocked her flat on her back and youre dead he announced oh bullshit i staked it missed the heart red he stood over her huge and pitiless how many chances you figure youre going to get you cant get the one in front of you how are you going to get the three coming at your back all right okay she got up brushed herself off do it again thats the spirit she did it again and again until she despised the straw dummy as much as she had her tenthgrade history teacher disgusted she swung around picked up a sword with both hands and hacked the thing to pieces when she was done there was no sound but her own labored breathing and larkins muffled laugh okay king rubbed his chin guess hes pretty damn dead larkin you want to put together another one let me ask you something red ask away how come you didnt just tear into the dummy with magic magic takes focus and concentration i think i could use some in a fight i think i could but most of me is channelled into handling the sword or the stake particularly since im not used to handling either if i wasnt centered i could just send my own weapon flying out of my hand missing the mark its something ill work on she glanced around to make sure hoyt wasnt anywhere within earshot generally i need tools chants certain rituals i can do this she opened her palm focused and brought out the ball of fire curious he poked at it and snatched back his singed finger sucked on it hell of a trick fire is elemental like air earth water but if i pulled this out during a battle tossed it at an enemy it might hit one of us instead or as well as he studied the shimmering ball with his odd eyes like pointing a gun if you dont know how to shoot cant be sure whos going to get the bullet or if youd just end up shooting yourself in your own damn foot something like that she vanished the fire but its nice to have it in reserve you go ahead take a break red before you hurt somebody no argument she sailed into the house intending to drink a gallon of water and put together some food she nearly walked straight into cian didnt know you were up and around he stood back from the sunlight that filtered through the windows but she saw he had a full view of the outdoor activities what do you think she asked him how are we doing if they came for you now theyd snack on you like chicken at a picnic i know were clumsy and theres no sense of unity but well get better youll need to well youre full of cheer and encouragement this afternoon weve been at it over two hours and none of us is used to this kind of thing larkins the closest kings got to a warrior and hes green yet cian merely glanced at her ripen or die fatigue was one thing she thought and she would deal with the sweat and the effort but now she was flatout insulted its hard enough to do what were doing without one of us being a complete asshole is that your term for realist screw it and you with it she stalked around the kitchen tossed some fruit some bread some bottled water into a basket she hauled it out ignoring cian as she passed by outside she dumped the basket on the table king had carried out to hold weapons food larkin pounced like a starving man bless you down to the soles of your feet glenna i was wasting away here since its been two hours for certain since you last stuffed your face moira put in the master of doom doesnt think were working hard enough and equates us to chicken at a picnic for the vampires glenna took an apple for herself bit in i say we show him different she took another bite then whipped around toward the newly stuffed dummy she focused in visualized then hurled the apple it flew toward the dummy and as it flew it became a stake and that stake pierced cloth and straw oh that was fine moira breathed that was brilliant sometimes temper gives the magic a boost the stake slid out again and splatted as an apple to the ground she sent hoyt a look something to work out we need something to unify us to hold us together she told hoyt later she sat in the tower rubbing balm into bruises while he pored through the pages of a spellbook teams wear uniforms or have fight songs songs now we should sing or maybe just find a bloody harper sarcasm she decided was something the brothers shared as well as their looks we need something look at us even now you and i up here moira and larkin off together king and cian in the training room devising new miseries for us all its fine and good to have the whole of the team split into smaller teams working on their own projects but we havent become a whole team yet so we drag out the harp and sing weve serious work to do glenna youre not following me patience she reminded herself hed worked as hard as she had today and was just as tired its about symbolism we have the same foe yes but not the same purpose she walked to the window and saw how long the shadows had grown and how low the sun hung in the sky itll be dark soon her fingers groped for her pendant it struck her then so simple so obvious you were looking for a shield for cian because he cant go out in the day but what about us we cant risk going out after sundown and even inside we know she can get to us get inside us what about our shield hoyt what shields us against the vampire the light yes yes but what symbol a cross we need to make crosses and we need to put magic into them not only shield but weapon hoyt he thought of the crosses morrigan had given him for his family but even his powers even combined with glennas fell short of the gods still silver he mumbled silver would be best with red jasper for night protection we need some garlic some sage she began going through her case of dried herbs and roots ill start on the potion she grabbed one of her books began flipping through any idea where we can get our hands on the silver aye he left her went down to the first level of the house and into what was now the dining room the furnishings were new to him at least tables of dark heavy wood chairs with high backs and ornate carving the drapes that were pulled over the windows were a deep green like forest shadows and made of a thick and weighty silk there was art all of them night scenes of forests and glades and cliffs even here he thought his brother shunned the light or did he prefer the dark even in paintings tall cupboards with doors of rippled glass held crystal and pottery in rich jewel tones possessions he thought of a man of wealth and position who had an eternity of time to collect them did any of the things mean anything to cian with so much could any single thing matter on the larger server were two tall candlestands of silver and hoyt wondered if they did or if they had at least they had been his mothers he lifted one and had the image of her clear as lake water sitting at her wheel and spinning singing one of the old songs she loved while her foot tapped the time she wore a blue gown and veil and there was ease and youth in her face a quiet contentment that covered her like soft silk her body was heavy with child he saw that now no he corrected heavy with children himself and cian and on the chest beneath her window stood the two candlestands they were a gift from my father on the day of my wedding and of all the gifts given i prized them most one will go to you one day and one to cian and so this gift will be passed down and the giver remembered whenever the candle is lit he comforted himself that he needed no candle to remember her but the stand weighed heavy in his hands as he took it up to the tower glenna looked up from the cauldron where she mixed her herbs oh its perfect and beautiful what a shame to melt it down she left her work to get a closer look its heavy and old i think aye its very old she understood then and felt a little pang in her heart your familys his face his voice were carefully blank it was to come to me and so it has she nearly told him to find something else something that didnt mean so much to him but she swallowed the words she thought she understood why he had chosen as he had it had to cost magic asked a price the sacrifice youre making will strengthen the spell wait she pulled a ring from the middle finger of her right hand it was my grandmothers theres no need personal sacrifice yours and mine were asking a great deal i need some time to write out the spell nothing in my books is quite right so well need to amend when larkin came to the door they were both deep in books he glanced around the room and kept to his side of the threshold im sent to fetch you the suns set and were going into evening training tell him well be there when were done glenna said were in the middle of something ill tell him but im thinking he wont like it he pulled the door shut and left them ive nearly got it im going to draw out what i think they should look like then well both visualize hoyt it must be pure he said to himself conjured with faith as much as magic she left him to it and began to sketch simple she thought and with tradition she glanced over saw he was sitting eyes closed gathering power she assumed and his thoughts such a serious face and one she realized shed come to trust completely it seemed shed known that face forever just as she knew the sound of his voice the cadence of it yet the time theyd had was short just as the time they would have was no more than a handful of grains in the sand of an hourglass if they won no when when they won hed go back to his time his life his world and she to hers but nothing would ever be the same and nothing would ever really fill the void hed leave behind hoyt his eyes were different when they met hers deeper and darker she pushed the sketch toward him will this do he lifted it studied yes but for this he took the pencil from her added lines on the long base of the celtic cross shed drawn what is it its ogham script old writing i know what ogham is what does it say it says light she smiled nodded then its perfect this is the spell it feels right to me he took that in turn then looked at her rhymes its how i work deal with it and i want a circle ill feel better with one because he agreed he rose to cast it with her she scribed fresh candles with her bolline watched him light them well make the fire together he held out his hand for hers power winged up her arm struck the heart of her and the fire pure and white shimmered an inch above the floor he hefted the cauldron set it on the flames silver old and silver bright he set the candlestand in the cauldron go to liquid in this light as we stand in the sorcerers tower glenna continued adding the jasper the herbs we charge this flame to free your power she dropped in her grandmothers ring magicks from the sky and sea from air and earth we call to thee we your servants beg this blessing shield us in this time of testing we answer your charge with head heart and hand to vanquish the darkness from the land so we call you three times three to shield those who serve you faithfully let this cross shine light to night as they chanted the last line three times three silver smoke rose from the cauldron and the white flames beneath it grew brighter it flooded her light and smoke and heat filled her as her voice rose with his through it she saw his eyes only his eyes locked on hers in her heart in her belly she felt it heat and grow stronger more potent than anything shed ever known it swirled in her as with his free hand he threw the last of the jasper dust into the cauldron and each cross of silver a shield will be as we will so mote it be the room exploded with light and the force of it shook the walls the floor the cauldron tumbled over spilling liquid silver into the flame the force nearly sent glenna to the ground but hoyts arms came around her he spun his body around to shield hers from the sudden spurting flames and roaring wind hoyt saw the door fly open for an instant cian was framed in the doorway drowned in that impossible light then he vanished no no dragging glenna with him hoyt broke the circle the light shrank in on itself swallowed itself and was gone with a crash like thunder through the ringing in his ears he thought he heard shouting cian lay on the floor bleeding his shirt half burned away and still smoking hoyt dropped to his knees his fingers reaching for a pulse before he remembered there would be none in any case my god my god what have i done hes badly burned get the shirt off of him glennas voice was cool as water and just as calm gently what happened what the hell did you do king shoved hoyt aside son of a bitch cian jesus christ we were finishing a spell he opened the door there was light it was no ones fault larkin glenna continued help king carry cian to his room ill be right there i have things that will help hes not dead hoyt said it quietly staring down at his brother its not death its not death glenna repeated i can help him im a good healer its one of my strengths ill help you moira stepped up then eased her body toward the wall as king and larkin lifted cian i have some skill good go with them ill get my things hoyt i can help him what did we do hoyt stared helplessly at his hands though they still vibrated from the spell they felt empty and useless it was beyond all ive done well talk about it later she gripped his hand pulled him into the tower room the circle was burned into the floor scorched in a pure white ring in its center glinted nine silver crosses with a circle of red jasper at the joining nine three times three well think about all this later i think we should let them stay there for now i dont know let them set ignoring her hoyt crossed the circle picked one up its cool great good her mind was already on cian and what would have to be done to help him she grabbed her case i have to get down do what i can for him it wasnt anyones fault hoyt twice now twice ive nearly killed him this is my doing as much as yours are you coming with me no she started to speak then shook her head and rushed out in the lavish bedchamber the vampyre lay still on the wide bed his face was that of an angel a wicked one moira thought she sent the men out for warm water for bandages and mostly to get them out from underfoot now she was alone with the vampyre who lay on the wide bed still as death she would feel no heartbeat should she lay her hand on his chest there would be no breath to fog a glass if she were to hold one to his lips and he would have no reflection shed read these things and more yet hed saved her life and she owed him for that she moved to the side of the bed and used what little magic she had to try to cool his burned flesh queasiness rose up and was fought down shed never seen flesh so scorched how could anyone anything survive such wounds his eyes flashed open searing blue his hand clamped on her wrist what are you doing youre hurt she hated to hear the tremor in her voice but her fear of him alone with him was so huge an accident im waiting for glenna well help you lie still she saw the instant the pain woke in him and some of her fear died lie quiet i can cool it a little wouldnt you rather i burn in hell i dont know but i know i dont want to be the one who sends you i wouldnt have shot you last night im ashamed i let you believe i would i owe you my life go away and well call it quits glennas coming is it cooling a little he simply closed his eyes and his body trembled i need blood well you wont be having mine im not that grateful she thought his lips curved just the slightest bit not yours though ill bet its tasty he had to catch the breath the pain stole in the case across the room the black case with the silver handle i need blood to i just need it she left him to open the case then swallowed revulsion when she saw the clear packs that held dark red liquid bring it over toss it and run whatever you want but i need it now she brought it quickly then watched him struggle to sit up to tear the pack open with his burned hands saying nothing she took the pack opened it herself spilling some sorry she gathered her strength then used an arm to brace him using her free hand to bring the pack to his lips he watched her as he drank and she made herself look back into his eyes without flinching when hed drained it dry she laid his head down again before going into the bath for a cloth with it she wiped his mouth his chin small but valiant are you she heard the edge in his tone and some return of its strength you havent a choice because of what you are i havent one because of what i am she stepped back when glenna hurried into the room chapter do you want something for the pain glenna coated a thin cloth with balm what have you got this and that she laid the cloth gently on his chest im so sorry cian we should have locked the door a locked door wouldnt have stopped me from coming in not in my own house you might try a sign next time something along the lines bugger it i know sorry i know itll be better in a minute a sign she continued her voice low and soothing as she worked something like flammable magicks keep out wouldnt hurt he felt the burn not just on the flesh but down into the bone as if the fire had burst inside him as well as out what the hell were you doing in there more than either of us were expecting moira coat more cloth would you cian what she simply looked at him deeply her hands hovering just above the worst of the burns she felt the heat but not the release it wont work unless you let it she told him unless you trust me and let go a high price for a bit of relief adding that youre part of what put me here why would she hurt you moira continued to coat the cloth she needs you we all do like it or not one minute glenna said give me one minute i want to help you you need to believe that believe me look at me into my eyes yes thats right now it came heat and release heat and release there thats better a little better yes shed taken it he realized some of the burn just for an instant into herself he wouldnt forget it some yes some thanks she applied more cloth turned back to her case ill just clean the cuts and treat the bruises then give you something to help you rest im not looking for rest she shifted back eased down on the bed intending to clean the cuts on his face puzzled she laid her fingers on his cheek turned his head i thought these were worse they were i heal quickly from most things good for you hows the vision he turned those hot blue eyes on her i see you well enough red could have a concussion can you get concussions i imagine so she said before he could answer are you burned anywhere else she started to lower the sheet then flicked him a wicked glance is it true what they say about vampires it made him laugh then hiss as the pain rippled back a myth were hung just as we were before the change youre welcome to look for yourself but im not hurt in that area it caught me full on the chest well preserve your modesty and my illusions when she took his hand the amusement faded from his face i thought wed killed you so did he now hes suffering oh hes suffering is he maybe hed like to switch places with me you know he would however you feel or dont about him he loves you he cant turn that off and he hasnt had all the time that youve had to step back from brotherhood we stopped being brothers the night i died no you didnt and youre deluding yourself if you believe that she pushed off the bed youre as comfortable as i can make you ill come back in an hour and work on you some more she gathered her things moira slipped out of the room ahead of her and waited what did that to him im not entirely sure you need to be its a powerful weapon against his kind we could use it we werent controlling it i dont know that we can if you could moira insisted glenna opened the door to her room carried her case inside she wasnt ready to go back to the tower it controlled us as far as i can tell it was huge and powerful too powerful for either of us to handle even together and we were linked as closely as ive been with anyone we couldnt harness it it was like being inside the sun the suns a weapon if you dont know how to use a sword youre just as likely to cut off your own hand as someone elses so you learn glenna lowered to the bed then held out a hand im shaky she said watching it tremble there are places inside my body i didnt know i had shaking like my hand is and im badgering you im sorry you seemed so steady so calm when you were treating the vampyre he has a name cian start using it moiras head snapped back as if shed been slapped and her eyes widened at the whip in glennas tone im sorry about your mother sick and sorry but he didnt kill her if shed been murdered by a blond man with blue eyes would you go around hating all men with blond hair and blue eyes its not the same not nearly the same close enough especially in our situation sheer stubbornness hardened moiras face i fed him blood and gave what little i could to ease him i helped you treat his burns it should be enough its not wait glenna ordered as moira spun around to leave just wait i am shaking and shorttempered with it just wait if i seemed calm before its because thats the way it works for me handle the crisis then fall apart this is the falling apart portion of our program but what i said goes moira just as what you said in there goes we need him youre going to have to start thinking of him and treating him like a person instead of a thing they tore her to pieces moiras eyes filled even as the defense of defiance crumbled no he wasnt there he had no part of it he lifted his sword for me i know it but i cant feel it she slapped a hand on her heart i cant feel it they didnt let me grieve they didnt give me time to mourn my own mother and now now that im here its all grief and all rage all blood and death i dont want this burden away from my people from everything i know why are we here why are we charged with this why are there no answers i dont know which is another nonanswer im sorry so horribly sorry about your mother moira but youre not the only one with grief and rage not the only one asking questions and wishing they were back in the life they knew one day you will go back i never can she yanked open the door and fled perfect just perfect glenna dropped her head into her hands in the tower room hoyt laid each cross on a cloth of white linen they were cool to the touch and though the metal had dimmed somewhat its light was bright enough to glare into his eyes he picked up glennas cauldron it was scorched black he doubted it could ever be used again wondered if it was meant to be the candles shed scribed and lit were no more than puddles of wax on the floor now it would need to be cleaned the entire room should be cleansed before any other magic was done here the circle was etched into the floor now a thin ring of pure white and his brothers blood stained the floor and walls outside the door sacrifice he thought there was always payment for power his gift of his mothers candlestand glennas of her grandmothers ring hadnt been enough the light had burned so fierce and bright so violently hot yet it hadnt scorched his skin he held his hand up examined it unmarked unsteady yet he could admit but unmarked the light had filled him all but consumed him it had twined him so truly with glenna it had been almost as if theyd been one person one power that power had been heady and fantastic and it had whirled out like the wrath of the gods at his brother struck down the other half of him while the sorcerer had ridden the lightning now he was empty hollowed out what power that remained in him was like lead heavy and cold and the lead was coated thick with guilt nothing to be done now nothing to do but put order back into the room he busied himself calmed himself with the basic tasks when king rushed into the room he stood still arms at his sides and took the blow he saw coming full in the face he had a moment to think it was like being hit by a battering ram as he was launched back against the wall then simply slid bonelessly to the floor get up get up you son of a bitch hoyt spat out blood his vision wavered so he saw several black giants standing over him with hamsized fists bunched he braced a hand on the wall dragged himself to his feet the battering ram struck again this time his vision went red black shimmered sickly to gray kings voice went tinny in his ears but he struggled to follow the command to get back up there was a flash of color through the gray a stream of heat through the iced pain glenna flew into the tower she didnt bother to shove at king but rammed her elbow viciously into his midsection then all but fell on hoyt to shield him stop it get away from him stupid bastard oh hoyt your face get away he could barely mumble the words and his stomach pitched violently as he pushed at her and tried to rise again go ahead and throw one come on king spread his arms then tapped his chin ill give you a free shot hell ill give you a couple of them you miserable son of a bitch its more than you gave cian hes gone then get away from me hoyt shoved at glenna go ahead he told king finish it though his fists remained bunched king lowered them a fraction the man was barely standing and blood ran from his nose his mouth one eye was already swelling shut and he just swayed there waiting to take another hit is he stupid or just crazy hes neither glenna snapped he thinks hes killed his brother so hell stand here and let you beat him to death because he blames himself as much as you blame him and youre both wrong cians not dead hoyt hes going to be fine hes resting thats all hes resting not gone you didnt pull it off and you wont get a second chance oh for gods sake glenna whirled to king nobody tried to kill anyone just step away red king jerked a thumb im not looking to hurt you why not if hes responsible so am i we were working together we were doing what we came here to do damn it cian came in at the wrong time its as simple and as tragic as that if hoyt could and would hurt cian like that purposely do you think youd be standing there hed cut you down with a thought and id help him kings bicolored eyes narrowed his mouth went grim but his fists stayed at his side why dont you its against everything we are you couldnt possibly understand but unless youre brick stupid you should understand that whatever affection and loyalty you feel for cian hoyt feels it too and hes felt it since the day he was born now get out of here just go king unbunched his fists rubbed them on his pants maybe i was wrong a lot of good that does im going to check on cian if im not satisfied im going to finish this ignoring him as he strode out glenna turned to try to take some of hoyts weight here now you need to sit down would you get away from me no i wont in response hoyt merely lowered to the floor resigned glenna went for more cloth poured water from a pitcher into a bowl it looks like im going to spend the evening mopping up blood she knelt beside him dampening cloth then gently cleaning blood from his face i lied you are stupid stupid to stand there and let him pound on you stupid to feel guilty and cowardly too his eyes bloodied and swollen shifted to hers have a care cowardly she repeated her voice sharp because there were tears welling at the base of her throat to stay up here wallowing instead of coming down to help instead of coming down to see what shape your brother was in which isnt that much worse than you at this point im not in the mood to have you jab at me with words or flutter about me he waved her hands away fine just fine she tossed the cloth back in the bowl so water spewed up and lapped over onto the floor tend to yourself then im tired of every single one of you brooding selfpitying useless if you ask me your morrigan screwed up royally picking this group brooding selfpitying useless you forgot your part of the whole shrew she inclined her head thats a weak and oldfashioned term today we just go with bitch your world your word thats right while youre up here wallowing you might take just a minute to consider this we did something amazing here tonight she gestured toward the silver crosses on the table something beyond anything ive ever experienced the fact that we did that we could should in some way bring this ridiculous group together but instead were all whining in our separate corners so i guess the magic and the moment was wasted she stormed out just as larkin jogged up the steps cians getting up he says weve wasted enough time and well be training an extra hour tonight you can tell him to kiss my ass larkin blinked then craned his head around the curve of the stairs to watch her stride down sure its a fine one he said but very quietly he peeked into the tower room saw hoyt sitting on the floor bleeding mother of christ did she do that hoyt scowled at him and decided his punishment for the night wasnt quite done no for gods sake do i look like i could be beaten by a woman she strikes me as formidable though he would have preferred keeping clear of magic areas he could hardly leave the man sprawled there so larkin walked over to hoyt crouched well thats a mess isnt it youre coming up a pair of black eyes bollocks give me a hand up will you agreeably larkin helped him up gave him a shoulder to lean on i dont know what the bleeding hells going on but glennas steaming and moiras locked in her room cian looks like the wrath of all the gods but hes out of bed and saying were training kings opened some whiskey and im thinking about joining him hoyt touched fingers gingerly to his cheekbone hissed as the pain radiated to his face not shattered theres some fine luck she mightve done a bit more to help instead of pounding a lecture on my head words are a womans sharpest weapon from the looks of you you could use some of that whiskey i could hoyt braced a hand on the table prayed hed regain his balance in a moment do what you can would you larkin to get the lot of them together in the training area ill be along taking my life in my hands im thinking but all right ill try sweetness and charm with the ladies theyll either fall for it or kick me in the balls they didnt kick him but they didnt come happily moira sat crosslegged on a table eyes swollen from weeping downcast glenna stood in a corner sulking into a glass of wine king stood in his own corner rattling ice in a short glass of whiskey cian sat drumming his fingers on the arm of his chair his face was white as bone and the burns the loose white shirt didnt cover livid music might be nice larkin said into the silence the sort you hear at funeral pyres and the like well work on form and agility cian cast his glance around the room i havent seen a great deal of that in any of you so far is there a point to you being insulting moira asked wearily a point to any of this slapping swords and trading punches you were burned worse than anyone ive ever seen and here you are an hour after up again if magic such as that cant take you down keep you down what will i take it youd be happier if id gone to ash im happy to disappoint you thats not what she meant glenna shoved irritably at her hair and you interpret for her now i dont need anyone to speak for me moira snapped right back and i dont need to be told what to do every bleeding hour of every bleeding day i know what kills them ive read the books oh well then youve read the books cian gestured toward the doors then be my guest go right on out and take out a few vamps itd be better than tumbling about on the floor in here like a circus she shot back im with moira on this larkin rested a hand on the hilt of his knife we should hunt them down take the offense we havent so much as posted a guard or sent out a scout this isnt that kind of war boy larkins eyes glittered im not a boy and from what i can see its no kind of war you dont know what youre up against glenna put in dont i i fought them killed three with my own hands weak ones young ones she didnt waste her best on you cian rose he moved stiffly and with obvious effort added to that you had help and were lucky but if you came across one with some seasoning with some skill youd be meat i can hold my own hold it with me come at me youre hurt it wouldnt be fair fair is for women if you take me down ill go out with you cian gestured toward the door well hunt tonight interest brightened larkins eyes your word on it my word take me down all right then larkin came in fast then spun out of reach he jabbed feinted spun again cian merely reached out gripped larkin around the throat and lifted him off his feet you dont want to dance with a vampire he said and tossed larkin halfway across the room bastard moira scrambled up raced to her cousins side youve half strangled him the half s what counts was that really necessary glenna got to her feet moved to larkin to lay her hands on his throat kid asked for it king commented and had her whipping her head around youre nothing but a bully the pair of you im all right im all right larkin coughed cleared his throat it was a good move he said to cian i never saw it coming until you can and do you dont hunt he eased back lowered carefully into the chair time to work id ask you to wait hoyt came into the room cian didnt bother to look at him weve waited long enough a bit more i have things to say first to you i was careless but so were you i should have barred the door but you shouldnt have opened it this is my house now it hasnt been yours for centuries that may be but courtesy and caution should approach a closed door particularly when magic is being done cian he waited until his brothers eyes shifted to him i would not have had you hurt thats for you to believe or not but i would not have had you hurt i dont know if i can say the same cian gestured with his chin toward hoyts face did your magic do that its another result of it looks painful so it is well then that balances the scales somewhat and this is what weve come to checks and balances hoyt turned to face the room and the others arguments and resentments you were right he said to glenna a great deal of what you said was right though i swear you talk too much oh really we arent united and until we are were hopeless we could be training and preparing every hour of every day of the time we have left and never win because this is what you said we have a common enemy but not a common purpose the purpose is to fight them larkin interrupted to fight them and kill them kill them all why because theyre demons so is he hoyt laid a hand on the back of cians chair but he fights with us he doesnt threaten geall geall you think of geall and you he said to moira of your mother kings here with us because he follows cian and in my way so do i cian why are you here because i dont follow you or her why are you here glenna im here because if i didnt fight if i didnt try everything we have and are and know every one of us could be lost because whats inside me demands that i be here and above all because good needs soldiers against evil oh aye this was a woman he thought she put shame to all of them the answer the single one there is and shes the only one who knew it were needed stronger than valor or vengeance loyalty or pride were needed can we stand with each other and do this thing not in a thousand years and with a thousand more of us to fight were the six the beginning of it we cant be strangers any longer he stepped away from cians chair as he reached in his pocket glenna said make a symbol and a shield a sign of common purpose that unity of purpose made the strongest magic ive ever known stronger than i could hold he said with a glance at cian i believe they can help protect us if we remember a shield needs a sword and we use both with one purpose he drew the crosses out so the silver glinted in the light he stepped to king offered one will you wear it king set his drink aside took the cross and chain he studied hoyts face as he looped it around his neck you could use some ice on that eye i could use a great deal and you he held a cross out to moira ill work to be worthy of it she sent glenna a look of apology ive done poorly tonight so have we all hoyt told her larkin not just of geall larkin said as he took the cross or no longer and you hoyt started to hand glenna a cross then stepped closer looked into her eyes as he put it around her neck himself i think tonight you put us all to shame ill try not to make a habit of it here she took the last cross put the chain over his head then gently very gently touched her lips to his battered cheek at last he turned and walked back to cian if youre about to ask if id wear one of those youre wasting your breath i know you cant i know youre not what we are and still im asking you to stand with us for this purpose he held out a pendant in the shape of a pentagram much like glennas the stone in the center is jasper like the ones in the crosses i cant give you a shield not yet so im offering you a symbol will you take it saying nothing cian held out a hand when hoyt poured pendant and chain into it cian shook it lightly as if checking the weight metal and stone dont make an army they make weapons true enough cian slipped the chain over his head now if the ceremonys finished could we bloody well get to work chapter seeking solitude and occupation glenna poured a glass of wine got out a pad of paper and a pencil and sat down at the kitchen table an hour she thought of quiet where she could settle down make some lists then maybe she would sleep when she heard someone approaching her back went up in a house this size couldnt everyone find some place else to be but king came in and stood shifting his weight digging his hands into his pockets well was all she said ah sorry about breaking hoyts face its his face you should apologize to him we know where we stand just wanted to clear it with you when she said nothing he scratched the top of his head through his thick hair and if a man of six six and two hundred and seventy pounds could squirm king squirmed listen i run up and that lights blasting and hes lying there bleeding and burning guys my first sorcerer king continued after another pause ive only known him like a week ive known cian since a really long time and i owe him pretty much everything so when you found him hurt naturally you assumed his brother tried to kill him yeah figured you had a part in it too but i couldnt beat the hell out of you i appreciate the chivalry the sting in her tone made him wince you sure got a way of cutting a man down to size it would take a chain saw to cut you down to size oh stop looking so pitiful and guilty with a sigh she scooped back her hair we screwed up you screwed up and were all goddamn sorry about it i suppose you want some wine now maybe a cookie he had to grin ill take a beer he opened the refrigerator got one out ill pass on the cookie youre a buttkicker red quality i admire in a woman even if its my butt getting the boot i never used to be i dont think she was also pretty and pale and had to be dog tired hed worked her all of them damned hard that afternoon and cian had put them through the wringer tonight sure shed bitched a little king thought now but not nearly as much as hed expected and when it came down to it hoyt was right shed been the only one whod known the answer to what the hell they were doing here that stuff hoyt was talking about what you said it makes a lot of sense we dont straighten up were easy pickings he popped the cap off the beer swallowed half the bottle in one long gulp so i will if you will she looked at the enormous hand he held out then placed hers in it i think cians lucky to have someone wholl fight for him whod care enough to hed do the same for me we go back that kind of friendship usually takes time to form to solidify were not going to have that kind of time guess wed better take some shortcuts then we cool now id say were cool now he polished off the beer then dumped the empty bottle in a can under the sink heading up you ought to do the same get some sleep i will but when he left her alone she was bruised and tired and restless so glenna sat alone in the kitchen with her glass of wine and the lights on full to beat back the dark she didnt know the time and wondered if it mattered any longer they were all becoming vampires sleeping through most of the day working through most of the night she fingered the cross around her neck as she continued to write her list and she felt the press of the night against her shoulder blades like cold hands she missed the city she decided no shame in admitting it she missed the sounds of it the colors the constant thrum of traffic that was a heartbeat she yearned for its complexity and simplicity life was just life there and if there was death if there was cruelty and violence it was all so utterly human the image of the vampire on the subway flashed into her mind or shed once had the comfort of believing it was human still she wanted to get up in the morning and wander down to the deli for fresh bagels she wanted to set her easel in the slash of morning light and paint and have her strongest concern be how she was going to pay her visa bill all of her life the magic had been in her and shed thought shed valued and respected it but it had been nothing to this to know that it was in her for this reason for this purpose that it could very well be the death of her she picked up her wine then jolted when she saw hoyt standing in the doorway not a good idea to go creeping around in the dark considering the situation i wasnt sure i should disturb you might as well just having my own private pity party itll pass she said with a shrug im a little homesick small potatoes compared to how you must feel i stand in the room i shared with cian when we were boys and feel too much and not enough she rose got a second glass poured wine have a seat she sat down again set the wine on the table i have a brother she told him hes a doctor just starting he has a whiff of magic and he uses it to heal hes a good doctor a good man he loves me i know but he doesnt understand me very well its hard not to be understood how could it be he wondered that there had never been a woman in his life other than family he could speak to about anything that truly mattered and now with glenna he knew he could and would talk with her of anything and everything it troubles me the loss of him of what we were to each other of course it does his memories of me cians are faded and old while mine are fresh and strong hoyt lifted his glass yes its difficult not to be understood what i am whats in me i used to feel smug about it like it was a shiny prize i held in my hands just for me oh i was careful with it grateful for it but still smug i dont think i ever will be again with what we touched tonight im doubting either of us could be smug again still my family my brother didnt understand not fully that smugness or that prize and they wont understand not fully the price im paying for it now they cant she reached out laid a hand over hoyts he cant so while our circumstances may be different i understand the loss youre talking about you look terrible she said more lightly i can help ease that bruising a little more youre tired it can wait you didnt deserve it i let it take control i let it fly out of me no it flew away from us who can say if it wasnt meant to shed bundled her hair up to train to work and now pulled out the pins so it fell messily just short of her shoulders look we learned didnt we were stronger together than either of us could have anticipated what were responsible for now is learning how to control it channel it and believe me the rest of them will have more respect now too he smiled a little that sounds a bit smug yeah i guess it does he drank some wine and realized he was comfortable for the first time in hours just sitting in the bright kitchen with night trapped outside the glass with glenna to talk with her scent was there just on the edges of his senses that earthy female scent her eyes so clear and green showed some light bruising of fatigue on the delicate skin beneath them he nodded toward the paper another spell no something more pedestrian lists i need more supplies herbs and so forth and moira and larkin need clothes then we need to work out some basic household rules so far its been up to me and king for the most part the cooking that is a household doesnt run itself and even when youre preparing for war you need food and clean towels there are so many machines to do the work he glanced around the kitchen it should be simple enough youd think there used to be an herb garden i havent walked the land not really put it off he admitted put off seeing the changes and what remained the same cian might have had one planted or i could bring it back the earth remembers well that can go on the list for tomorrow you know the woods around here you should be able to tell me where to find the other things i need i can go out in the morning and harvest i knew them he said half to himself we need more weapons hoyt and eventually more hands to wield them there will be an army in geall we hope i know a few like us and cian its likely he knows some like him we may want to start enlisting more vampyres trusting cians been difficult enough as for more witches were still learning each other as we learned tonight we were to start with those we have weve barely begun but weapons we can make them as we made the crosses she picked up her wine again drank breathed out slowly okay im game well take them with us when we go to geall speaking of when and how how through the dance when i cant know i have to believe well be told when its time that well know when its time do you think well ever be able to get back if we live do you think well be able to get back home he looked over at her she was sketching her eyes on her pad her hand steady her cheeks were pale he noted from fatigue and stress her hair was bright and bold swinging forward as she dipped her head which disturbs you most he wondered dying or not seeing your home again im not entirely sure death is inevitable none of us get out of that one and you hope or i have that when the time comes youll have courage and curiosity and so face it well absently she tucked her hair behind her ear with her left hand while her right continued to sketch but thats always been in the abstract until now its hard to think about dying harder to think about it knowing i might not see home again or my family they wont understand what happened to me she glanced up and im preaching to the choir i dont know how long they lived how they died how long they looked for me it would help to know aye it would he shook it off angled his head what do you draw there she pursed her lips at the sketch it seems to be you she turned it around nudged it toward him is this how you see me his voice sounded puzzled and not entirely pleased so stern not stern serious youre a serious man hoyt mckenna she printed the name on the sketch thats how it would be written and said today i looked it up she signed the sketch with a quick flourish and your serious nature is very attractive serious is for old men and politicians and for warriors for men of power knowing you being attracted to you makes me realize what i knew before you were boys apparently i like much older men these days he sat looking at her with the sketch and the wine between them with worlds between them he told himself and still hed never felt closer to anyone to sit here like this with you in the house thats mine but not in a world thats mine but not youre the single thing i want she rose moved to him put her arms around him he rested his head just under her breasts listened to her heart is it comfort she asked yes but not only that i have such a need for you i dont know how to hold it inside me she lowered her head closing her eyes as she rested her cheek on his hair lets be human for whats left of tonight lets be human because i dont want to be alone in the dark she framed his face lifted it to hers take me to bed he took her hands as he got to his feet such things havent changed in a millennium have they she laughed some things never change he kept her hand in his as they walked from the kitchen i havent bedded many women being a serious man i havent been bedded by many men being a sensible woman at the door to her room she turned to him with a quick wicked smile but i think well manage wait he brought her to him before she could open the door and laid his lips on hers she felt warmth and an underlying shimmer of power then he opened the door hed lighted the candles she saw every one of them so the room was full of gilded light and soft scent the fire burned as well a low red simmer it touched a place in her heart even as it rippled anticipation over her skin a very nice start thank you she heard the click of the key in the lock pressed a hand to her heart im nervous all of a sudden ive never been nervous about being with someone not even that first time that smugness again he didnt mind her nerves in fact they added an edge to his own arousal your mouth this fullness here he traced a fingertip over her bottom lip i can taste it in my sleep you distract me even when youre not with me that annoys you she reached up to link her arms around his neck im so glad she eased toward him watching his gaze drop to her mouth linger before it came back to hers felt his breath mix with her breath and his heart beat against her heart they held there one endless moment then their lips met and they sank into each other nerves fluttered in her belly again a dozen velvet wings that swept against desire and still that shimmer of power was like a hum in the air then his hands were in her hair sweeping it back from her face in a gesture of urgency that had her shuddering in anticipation of what was to come and his mouth left hers to roam her face to find that throbbing pulse in her throat she could drown him he knew it even as he took more this outrageous need for her could take him under somewhere hed never been he knew wherever that was he would take her with him he molded the shape of her with his hands steeped himself in it she found his mouth again avidly he heard the shudder of her breath as she stepped back the candlelight washed over her as she reached up began to unbutton her shirt she wore something white and lacy beneath it that seemed to hold her breasts like an offering there was more white lace when her pants slid down her hips an alluring triangle that rode low on her belly high on her legs women are the canniest creatures he mused out loud and reached out to skim a fingertip over the lace when she trembled he smiled i like these clothes are you always wearing these under the others no it depends on my mood i like this mood he took his thumbs brushed them up over the lace on her breasts her head fell back oh god that pleasures you what of this he did the same with the lace that sat snug below her belly and watched the arousal slide over her face soft skin delicate and smooth but there was muscle under it fascinating just let me touch your body is beautiful just let me touch she reached back gripped the bedpost help yourself his fingers skimmed over her made her skin quiver then pressed and made her moan she could feel her own bones going to liquid and her muscles to putty as he explored her she gave herself to it to the slow enervating pleasure that was both triumph and surrender is this the fastener then she opened heavy eyes as he fiddled with the front hook of her bra but when she started to undo it he brushed her hands aside ill figure it out on my own in a minute ah yes there it is as he unhooked it her breasts spilled out and into his hands clever beautiful he lowered his head to them tasted soft warm flesh he wanted to savor he wanted to rush and the other part where is the fastener he ran his hands down her they dont and over her her breath caught a half cry as her fingers dug into his shoulders aye look at me just like that he skimmed his hands over the lace under it glenna ward who is mine tonight and she came where she stood her body exploding and her eyes trapped by his her head went limp on his shoulder as she shuddered shuddered i want you on me i want you in me she dragged at the sweatshirt he wore drawing it up and away now she found muscle and flesh with her hands with her lips now the power seeped back into her as she pulled him with her onto the bed inside me inside me her mouth crushed hungrily to his hips arching and offering he fought with the rest of his clothes struggled to devour more of her as the heat pumped off them both when he plunged into her the fire roared and the candle flames shot up like arrows passion and power whipped through them spurring them on toward madness still she locked herself around him stared at him even as tears glazed her eyes a wind stirred her hair bright as fire against the bed he felt her gather beneath him tighten like a bow when the light burst through him he could only breathe her name she felt alight as if whatever they had ignited between them burned still she wondered she didnt see beams of its gilded light shooting out of her fingertips in the hearth the fire had settled down to a quiet simmer another afterglow but the heat that had bloomed from it and from them dewed her skin even now her heart moved at a gallop his head rested there on her heart and her hand on his head have you ever his lips brushed her breast lightly no she combed her fingers through his hair neither have i maybe it was because it was the first time or because some of what we made earlier was still stored up were stronger together her own words echoed in her mind where do we go from here when he lifted his head she shook hers an expression she explained and it doesnt matter now your bruises are gone i know thank you i dont know that i did it you did you touched my face when we joined he took her hand brought it to his lips theres magic in your hands and in your heart and still your eyes are troubled just tired do you want me to leave you no i dont and wasnt that the problem i want you to stay here then he shifted bringing her with him tucking up sheet and blanket i have a question mmm you have a brand here he traced his fingers over the small of her back a pentagram are witches marked so in this time no its a tattoo my choice i wanted to wear a symbol of what i am even when i was skyclad ah i mean no disrespect to your purpose or your symbol but i found it alluring she smiled to herself good then it performed its secondary purpose i feel whole again he said i feel myself again so do i but tired he thought he could hear it in her voice well sleep awhile she tilted her head up so their eyes met you said when you took me to bed you wouldnt give me any sleep this once she rested her head on his shoulder but didnt close her eyes even when he dimmed the candles hoyt whatever happens this was precious for me as well and for the first time glenna i believe not only that we must win but that we can i believe that because youre with me now she closed her eyes for just a moment on the pang just under her heart he spoke of war she thought and shed spoken of love she woke to rain and his warmth glenna lay listening to the patter absorbing the good natural feel of a mans body beside hers shed had to lecture herself during the night what she had with hoyt was a gift one that should be treasured and appreciated there was no point in cursing because it wasnt enough and what good did it do to question why it had happened to wonder if whatever was driving them to the battleground had brought them together had ignited that passion and need and yes love because they were stronger with it it was enough to feel shed always believed that and only doubted it now because she felt so much it was time to go back to being practical to enjoy what she had when she had it and to do the job at hand she eased away from him started to get out of bed his hand closed around her wrist its early and raining come stay in bed she looked over her shoulder how do you know its early theres no clock in here got a sundial in your head sure a lot of good it would do as its pouring rain your hairs like the sun come back to bed he didnt look so serious now she noted not with his eyes sleepy and his face shadowed by a nights growth of beard what he looked was edible you need a shave he rubbed a hand over his face felt the stubble rubbed his hand over again and the stubble was gone is that better for you a stór she reached over flicked a finger down his cheek very smooth you could use a decent haircut he frowned scooped a hand through his hair what would be wrong with my hair its gorgeous but it could use a little shaping i can take care of that for you i think not oh dont trust me not with my hair she laughed and rolled over to straddle him you trust me with other and more sensitive parts of you a different matter entirely his hands walked up and cupped her breasts whats the name of the garment you wore over your lovely breasts last night its called a bra and dont change the subject sure im happier discussing your breasts than my hair arent you cheerful this morning you put a light in me sweet talker she picked up a hank of his hair snip snip youll be a new man you seem to like the man i am well enough her lips curved as she lifted her hips and lowered them to take him into her the candles that had guttered out sparked just a trim she whispered leaning over him to rub her lips to his after he learned the considerable pleasure of showering with a woman then the fascinating pleasure of watching one dress she rubbed creams into her skin and different ones over her face the bra and what she called panties were blue today like a robins egg over these she pulled rough pants and the short baggy tunic she called a sweatshirt on it were words that spelled out walking in a wiccan wonderland he thought the outer clothes made what she wore beneath a kind of marvelous secret he felt relaxed and very pleased with himself and balked when she told him to sit on the lid of the toilet she picked up scissors snapped them together why would a man of sense allow a woman to come near him with a tool like that a big tough sorcerer like you shouldnt be afraid of a little haircut besides if you dont like it when im done you can change it back why are women always after fiddling with a man its our nature indulge me he sighed and sat and squirmed be still and itll be done before you know it how do you suppose cian deals with grooming he rolled his eyes up over to try to see what she was doing to him i wouldnt know no reflection must make it a chore and he always looks perfect now hoyt slid his eyes toward hers you like the way he looks do you youre almost mirror images so its obvious i do he has that slight cleft in his chin and you dont where the faeries pinched him my mother used to say your face is a little leaner and your eyebrows have more of an arch but your eyes those mouths and cheekbones the same he watched hair fall into his lap and inside the mighty sorcerer his belly trembled jesus woman are you shearing me bald lucky for you i like long hair on a man at least i do on you she dropped a kiss on the top of his head yours is like black silk with just a little wave you know in some cultures when a woman cuts a mans hair its a vow of marriage his head jerked but shed anticipated the reaction and moved the scissors her laugh full of fun and teasing echoed off the bathroom walls joking boy are you easy almost done she straddled his legs standing with hers apart and her breasts close to his face he began to think a haircut wasnt such a hardship after all i liked the feel of a woman yes i seem to recall that about you no what im meaning is i liked the feel of a woman when i had one im a man have needs like any other but it never occupied so much of my mind as it does with you she set the scissors aside then combed her fingers through his damp hair i like occupying your mind here have a look he stood studied himself in the mirror his hair was shorter but not unreasonably he supposed it fell in a more pleasing shape though it had seemed fine to him before shed gone after it still she hadnt sheared him like a sheep and it pleased her its well enough thank you youre welcome he finished dressing and when they went downstairs they found all but cian in the kitchen larkin was scooping up scrambled eggs good morning to you the man here has a magicians hands with eggs and my shift at the stoves over king announced so if you want breakfast youre on your own thats something i wanted to talk about glenna opened the refrigerator shifts cooking laundry basic housekeeping it needs to be spread out among all of us im happy to help moira put in if youll show me what to do and how to do it all right watch and learn well stick with the bacon and eggs for this morning she got to work on it with moira watching her every move i wouldnt mind more while youre about it moira glanced at larkin he eats like two horses hmm were going to need regular supplies she spoke to king now id say that falls to you or me as these three cant drive both larkin and moira are going to need clothes that fit if you draw me a map i can make the next run theres no sun today glenna nodded at hoyt i have protection and it may clear up the household needs to run as you said so you can draw up your plans well follow them but as to other matters you have to follow i think no one goes out alone out of doors into the village no one goes out unarmed are we to be under siege then held in by a shower of rain larkin stabbed the air with his fork isnt it time we showed them we wont let them set the terms he has a point glenna agreed cautious but not cowed and theres a horse in the stable moira added he needs to be tended the fact was hoyt had intended to do so himself while the others were busy elsewhere he wondered now if what hed told himself was responsibility and leadership was just another lack of trust larkin and i will tend to the horse he sat when glenna put plates on the table glenna needs herbs and so do i so well deal with that as well cautious he repeated and began to devise how it could be done while he ate he strapped on a sword the rain was a fine drizzle now the sort he knew could last for days he could change that he and glenna together could bring out sun bright enough to blast the sky but the earth needed rain he nodded to larkin opened the door they moved out together splitting right and left backtoback to gauge the ground be a miserable watch in this weather if they just sit and wait larkin pointed out well stay close together in any case they crossed the ground searching for shadows and movement but there was nothing but the rain the smell of wet flowers and grass when they reached the stables the work was routine for both of them mucking out fresh straw grain and grooming comforting hoyt thought to be around the horse larkin sang as he worked a cheery air ive a chestnut mare at home he told hoyt shes a beauty it seemed we couldnt bring the horses through the dance i was told to leave my own mare behind is it true about the legend the sword and the stone and the one who rules geall like the legend of arthur it is and some say it was fashioned from it as he spoke larkin poured fresh water in the trough after the death of the king or queen the sword is placed back in the stone by a magician on the day after the burial the heirs then come one by one and try to take it out again only one will succeed and rule all of geall the sword is kept in the great hall for all to see until that ruler dies and so it is repeated generation after generation he wiped his brow moira has no brothers no sisters she must rule intrigued hoyt stopped to glance over if she fails would it come to you spare me from that larkin said with feeling ive no wish to rule bloody nuisance if youre asking me well hes set isnt he he rubbed the stallions side youre a handsome devil thats the truth he needs exercise one of us should ride him out not today i think but youre right in that he needs a run still hes cians so its for him to say they moved to the door and as before stepped out together that way hoyt gestured there was an herb garden and may still be i havent walked that way as yet moira and i have i didnt see one well have a look it sprang off the roof of the stables so quickly hoyt had no chance to draw his sword and the arrow struck it dead in the heart while it was still in the air ash flew as a second leaped and a second arrow shot home would you let us have one for the sport of it larkin shouted to moira she stood in the kitchen doorway a third arrow already notched then take the one coming from the left for me larkin shouted at hoyt it was twice his size and hoyt started to protest but larkin was already charging steel struck steel it clashed and it rang twice he saw the thing step back when larkins cross glinted at him but he had a reach and a very long sword when hoyt saw larkin slip on the wet grass he lunged forward he swung the sword at the things neck and met air larkin leaped up flipped the wooden stake up caught it neatly i was just throwing him off balance nicely done there may be more there may be hoyt agreed but well do what we came to do ive got your back then if youve mine god knows moiras got them both this hurt it he added touching the cross gave it some trouble anyway they may be able to kill us but they wont be able to turn us while we wear them then id say thats a job well done chapter there was no herb garden with its creeping thyme and fragrant rosemary the pretty knot garden his mother had tended was now a gently rolling span of cropped green grass it would be a sunny spot when the sky cleared he knew his mother had chosen it though it hadnt been just outside the kitchen as was more convenient so her herbs could bask in the light as a child hed learned of them from her of their uses and their beauty while sitting by her as she weeded and clipped and harvested shed taught him their names and their needs hed learned to identify them by their scents and the shapes of the leaves by the flowers that bolted from them if she allowed it how many hours had he spent there with her working the earth talking or just sitting in silence to enjoy the butterflies the hum of bees it had been their place he thought more than any other hed grown to a man and had found his place on the cliff in what was now called kerry hed built his stone cabin and found the solitude hed needed for his own harvest for his magic but hed always come back home and had always found pleasure and solace with his mother here in her herb garden now he stood over where it had been as he might have a grave mourning and remembering a flare of anger lit in him that his brother would let this go this what youre looking for then larkin studied the grass then tracked his eyes through the rain toward the trees doesnt seem to be anything left of it hoyt heard a sound pivoted as larkin did glenna walked toward them a stake in one hand a knife in the other rain beaded her hair like tiny jewels youre to stay in the house there could be more of them if there are there are three of us now she jerked her head toward the house five as moira and king have us covered hoyt looked over moira was in the near window her arrow notched her bow pointed downward in the doorway to the left king stood with a broadsword that ought to do it larkin sent his cousin a cheeky grin mind you dont shoot one of us in the arse only if im aiming for it she called back beside hoyt glenna studied the ground was it here the garden it was will be something was wrong she thought very wrong to have put that hard look on his face i have a rejuvenation spell ive had good luck with it healing plants i wont need it for this he stabbed his sword in the ground to free his hands he could see it just as it had been and honed that image clear into his mind as he stretched out his arms spread his hands this he knew would come from his heart as much as from his art this was tribute to the one who had given him life and because of it would be painful seed to leaf leaf to flower soil and sun and rain remember his eyes changed and his face looked carved from stone larkin started to speak but glenna tapped a finger to her lips to stop him there should be no voice no words now she knew but hoyts power was already thickening the air she couldnt help with the visualization as hoyt hadnt described the garden to her but she could focus on scent rosemary lavender sage he repeated the incantation three times his eyes darkening further his voice rising with each repetition beneath their feet the ground shuddered lightly the wind began to lift then swirl then blow rise up return grow and bloom gift from the earth from the gods for the earth for the gods airmed oh ancient one release your bounty airmed of the tuatha de danaan feed this earth as once this was let it return his face was pale as marble his eyes dark as onyx and the power flowed out of him onto into the trembling ground it opened glenna heard larkin suck in his breath heard her own heartbeat rise up to drum in her ears the plants rose up leaves unfurling blooms bursting the thrill spun into her released itself of a laugh of pure delight silvery sage glossy needles of rosemary tumbling carpets of thyme and camomile bay and rue delicate spears of lavender and more spread out of the ground and into the misting rain the garden formed a celtic knot she saw with narrow loops and pathways to make harvesting easier as the wind died as the earth stilled larkin blew out a long breath well thats some damn fine farming she laid a hand on larkins shoulder its lovely hoyt some of the prettiest magic ive ever seen blessed be he pulled his sword out of the ground the heart that had opened to make the magic was sore as a bruise take what you need but be quick weve been out long enough she used her bolline and worked with efficiency though she wished she could linger just enjoy the work the scents surrounded her and what she harvested she knew would be only more powerful for the manner of their becoming the man whod touched her in the night whod held her in the morning had more power than any shed ever know any shed ever imagined this is something i miss in the city she commented i do a lot of windowsill pots but its just not the same as real gardening hoyt said nothing simply watched her bright hair sparkling with rain slim white hands brushing through the green it closed a fist over his heart just one quick squeeze and release when she stood her arms full her eyes laughing with the wonder of it that heart tipped in his breast and fell as if an arrow had pierced it bewitched he thought she had bewitched him a womans magic always aimed first for the heart i can get quite a bit done with these she tossed her head to swing back her damp hair and have enough left to season a nice soup for dinner best take them in then weve movement to the west larkin nodded toward the west edge of the woods just watching for now bewitched hoyt thought again as he turned hed forgotten his watch spellbound by her i count half a dozen larkin continued his voice cool and steady though there may be more hanging back hoping to lure us im thinking into going after them so theyll be more aye more hanging back to cut us down as we come weve done what we need for the morning hoyt began then thought better of it but no point letting them think theyve pushed us back inside moira he said lifting his voice enough to carry to her can you take one out at this distance which one would you like amused he lifted a shoulder your choice lets give them a bit of something to think about hed barely uttered the words when the arrow flew and a second so quickly after he thought he imagined it there were two screams one melding into the next and where there had been six there were four and those four rushed back into the cover of the woods two would give them more than a bit to think about with a grim smile moira readied another arrow i can wing a few back into the woods drive them back more if you like dont waste your wood cian stepped to the window behind her he looked rumpled and mildly irritated moira automatically stepped aside wouldnt be wasted if they struck home theyll move on for now if they were here for more than a nuisance theyd have charged while they had the numbers he walked past her to the side door and out past your bedtime isnt it glenna said id like to know who could sleep through all this felt like a bleeding earthquake he studied the garden your work i assume he said to hoyt no the bitterness from the wound inside him eked out my mothers well next time youve a bit of landscaping in mind let me know so i dont wonder if the house is coming down on my ears how many did you take out five moira took four larkin sheathed his sword the other was mine he glanced back toward the window the little queens racking up quite the score we wanted to test the waters larkin told him and see to your horse im grateful for that im thinking i could take him out for a run now and again if you wouldnt mind it i wouldnt and vlad could use it vlad glenna repeated just my little in joke if the excitements over ill be going back to bed i need a word with you hoyt waited until cian met his eyes privately and would this private word require standing about in the rain well walk suit yourself then he smiled at glenna you look rosy this morning and damp there are plenty of dry private places inside hoyt i want the air there was a moment of humming silence hes a slow one shes waiting to be kissed so shell worry less about you getting your throat ripped out because you want a walk in the rain go inside though he wasnt entirely comfortable with the public display hoyt took glennas chin in his hand kissed her lightly on the lips ill be fine enough larkin drew his sword again offered it to cian better armed than not words to live by then he leaned down gave glenna a quick cocky kiss himself ill be fine as well they walked in silence and with none of the camaraderie hoyt remembered theyd shared times he mused theyd been able to know the others mind without a word spoken now his brothers thoughts were barred to him as he imagined his were to cian you kept the roses but let the herb garden die it was one of her greatest pleasures the roses have been replaced i cant count the times since i acquired the place the herbs gone before i bought the property its not property as the place you have in new york its home it is to you hoyts anger rolled off cians back like the rain if you expect more than i can or will give youll be in a constant state of disappointment its my money that bought the land and the house that sits on it and mine that goes to maintaining both id think youd be in a better humor this morning after romping with the pretty witch last night careful where you step hoyt said softly ive good footing and he couldnt resist treading on tender ground shes a prime piece and no mistake but ive had a few centuries more experience with women than you theres more than lust in those striking green eyes of hers she sees a future with them and what i wonder will you do about that its not your concern not in the least no but its entertaining to speculate particularly when i havent a woman of my own to divert me at the moment shes no roundheeled village girl happy with a roll in the hay and a trinket shell want and expect more of you as women particularly clever women tend to instinctively he glanced up checking the cloud cover irish weather was tricky he knew and the sun could decide to spill out along with the rain do you think if you survive these three months satisfy your gods to ask them for the right to take her back with you why does it matter to you not everyone asks a question because the answer matters cant you see her tucked into your cottage on the cliffs in kerry no electricity no running water no saks around the corner cooking your dinner in a pot on the fire likely shorten her life expectancy by half given the lack of health care and nutrition but well then anything for love what do you know of it hoyt snapped youre not capable of love oh youd be wrong about that my kind can love deeply even desperately certainly unwisely which it appears we have in common so you wont take her back for that would be the selfish thing youre much too holy too pure for that and enjoy the role of martyr too much as well so youll leave her here to pine for you i might amuse myself by offering her some comfort and seeing as we share a resemblance i wager shell take it and me the blow knocked him back but not down he tasted blood the gorgeous burn of it then swiped a hand over his bleeding mouth it had taken longer than hed assumed it would to bait his brother well now thats been a long time coming for both of us he tossed his sword aside as hoyt had lets have a go then cians fist moved so fast it was only a blur a blur that had stars exploding in front of hoyts eyes and his nose fountaining blood then they charged each other like rams cian took one in the kidneys and a second strike had his ears ringing hed forgotten hoyt could fight like the devil when provoked he ducked a jab and sent hoyt down with a kick to the midsection and found himself on his ass as his brother slashed out his legs and took his feet out from under him he could have been up in a fingersnap ended it but his blood was hot and heated preferred a grapple they rolled over the ground punching cursing while the rain soaked them through to the skin elbows and fists rammed into flesh cracked against bone then cian reared back with a hiss and flash of fangs hoyt saw the burn sear into his brothers hand in the shape of his cross fuck me cian muttered and sucked on burned flesh and welling blood i guess you need a weapon to best me aye fuck you i dont need anything but my own fists hoyt reached up had nearly yanked off the chain then dropped his hand when he realized the utter stupidity of it this is fine isnt it he spat out the words and some blood with it this is just fine brawling like a couple of street rats and leaving ourselves open to anything that comes if anything had been nearby wed be dead already am and speak for yourself this isnt what i want trading blows with you though the fight was still on his face as he swiped blood from his mouth it serves nothing felt good though hoyts swollen lips twitched and the leading edge of his temper dulled it did thats the pure truth holy martyr my ass knew that would get under your skin sure you always knew how to get there if we cant be brothers cian what are we cian sat as he was absently rubbing at the grass and bloodstains on his shirt if you win youll be gone in a few months or ill see you die do you know how many ive seen die if times short it should be more important you know nothing of time he got to his feet you want to walk come on then and learn something of time he walked on through the drenching wet so that hoyt was forced to fall in beside him is it all still in your hands the land most of it some was sold off a few centuries ago and some was taken by the english during one of the wars and given to some crony of cromwell who is cromwell was a right bastard who spent considerable time and effort burning and raping ireland for the british royals politics and wars gods humans and demons cant seem to get by without them i convinced one of the mans sons after hed inherited to sell it back to me at quite a good price convinced him you killed him and what if i did cian said wearily it was long ago is that how you came by your wealth killing ive had nine hundred years and more to fill the coffers and have done so in a variety of ways i like money and ive always had a head for finance aye you have there were lean years in the beginning decades of them but i came around i traveled its a large and fascinating world and i like having chunks of it which is why i dont care for the notion of lilith pulling her own sort of cromwell protecting your investment hoyt said i am i will i earned what i have im fluent in fifteen languages a handy business asset fifteen it felt easier now the walking the talking you used to butcher even latin nothing but time to learn and more yet to enjoy the fruits i enjoy them quite a bit i dont understand you she took your life your humanity and gave me eternity while i may not be particularly grateful to her as it wasnt done for my benefit i dont see the point in spending that eternity sulking about it my existence is long and this is what you and your kind have he gestured toward a graveyard a handful of years then nothing but dirt and dust there was a stone ruin overcome by vines sharp with thorns and black with berries the end wall remained and rose in a peak figures had been carved into it like a frame and had been buffed nearly smooth again by time and weather flowers even small shrubs forced their way through the cracks with feathery purple heads drooping now heavy from the rain a chapel mother spoke of building one and one was built cian confirmed this is whats left of it and them and the ones who came after stones and moss and weeds hoyt only shook his head stones had been plunged into the ground or set upon it to mark the dead now he moved among them over uneven ground where that ground had heaved time and again and the tall grass was slick with wet like the carving on the ruin the words etched into some of the stones were worn nearly smooth and the stones bloomed with moss and lichen others he could read names he didnt know michael thomas mckenna beloved husband of alice departed this earth the sixth of may eighteen hundred and twentyfive and alice whod joined him some six years after their children one whod left the world only days after coming into it and three others theyd lived and died this thomas this alice centuries after hed been born and nearly two centuries before he stood here reading their names time was fluid he thought and those who passed through it so fragile crosses rose up and rounded stones tilted here and there weedy gardens grew over the graves as if they were tended by careless ghosts and he felt them those ghosts with every step he took a rose bush heavy with rich red blooms grew lushly behind a stone no taller than his knees its petals were sheened like velvet it was a quick strike to the heart with the dull echoing pain behind it he knew he stood at his mothers grave how did she die her heart stopped its the usual way at his sides hoyts fists bunched can you be so cold even here even now some said grief stopped it perhaps it did he went first cian gestured to a second stone a fever took him around the equinox the autumn after i left she followed three years after our sisters there all there he gestured at the grouping of stones and the generations that followed them who remained in clare in any case there was a famine and it rotted the land scores died like flies or fled to america to australia to england anywhere but here there was suffering pain plague pillage death nola for a moment cian said nothing then he continued in a tone of deliberate carelessness she lived into her sixties a good long life for that era for a woman a human she had five children or it mightve been six was she happy how could i say cian said impatiently i never spoke to her again i wasnt welcome in the house i now own why would i be she said i would come back well you have havent you hoyts blood was cool now and eking toward cold theres no grave for me here if i go back will there be will it change whats here the paradox whos to say in any case you vanished or so its told depending on the version youre a bit of a legend in these parts hoyt of clare though kerry likes to claim you as well your song and story doesnt reach as high as a god or even that of merlin but youve a notch in some guidebooks the stone circle just to the north the one you used its attributed to you now and called hoyts dance hoyt didnt know whether to be embarrassed or flattered its the dance of the gods and it was here long before me so goes truth particularly when fantasys shinier the caves beneath the cliffs where you tossed me into the sea its said you lie there deep beneath the rock guarded by faeries under the land where you would stand to call the lightning and the wind foolishness an amusing claim to fame for a time they said nothing just stood two men of striking physical similarity in a rainy world of the dead if id gone with you that night as you asked me ridden out with you to stop as you said at the pub in the village a drink and a tumble hoyts throat went hot as he remembered it but i had work on my mind and didnt want company not even yours i had only to go and none of this would be cian slicked back his dripping hair you take a lot on yourself dont you but then you always did if youd gone its likely shed have had us both so its true enough none of this would be what he saw on hoyts face brought the fury rushing back into him do i ask for your guilt you werent my keeper then or now i stand here as i did centuries ago and barring bad luck or my own idiocy in letting you drag me into this thing and the serious risk of a stake through the heart ill stand here again centuries after and you hoyt food for the worms so which of us has destiny smiled on what is my power if i cant change that one night that one moment id have gone with you id have died for you cians head whipped up and on his face was the same hot temper it had held in battle dont put your death or your regrets on me but there was no answering anger in hoyt and you would have died for me for any one of them he spread his arms to encompass the graves once you are half of me nothing you are nothing that was done changes that you know it as i know it even more than blood more than bone we are beneath all that what we ever were i cant exist in this world feeling this emotion swirled now into his face his voice i cant grieve for what i am or for you or for them and damn you goddamn you for bringing me back to it i love you its bound in me what you love is gone no hoyt thought he was looking at the heart of what hed loved he could see it in the roses his brother had planted over their mothers grave youre standing here with me and the spirits of our family youre not so changed cian or you would not have done this he touched the petals of a rose you could not have done it cians eyes were suddenly ageless filled with the torment of centuries ive seen death thousands upon thousands age and sickness murder and war i didnt see theirs and this was all i could do for them when hoyt moved his hand the petals of an overblown rose spilled down and scattered on his mothers grave it was enough cian looked down at the hand hoyt held out to him he sighed once deeply well damn to us both then he said and clasped hands with his brother weve been out long enough no point in tempting fate any longer and i want my bed they started back the way theyd come do you miss the sun hoyt wondered walking in it feeling it on your face theyve found it gives you cancer of the skin huh hoyt considered it still the warmth of it on a summer morning i dont think about it i like the night perhaps it wasnt the time to ask cian to allow him to do a little experimental bloodletting what do you do in these businesses of yours and with your leisure do you i do as i please i like to work its satisfying and makes play more appealing and its not possible to catch up on several centuries during a mornings walk in the rain even if i were inclined he rested the sword on his shoulder but likely youll catch your death from it and spare me the questions in any case im made of stronger stuff than that hoyt said cheerfully now as i proved when i bashed your face not long ago youve a fine bruise on your jaw itll be gone quicker than yours unless the witch intervenes again in any case i was holding back bollocks to that the shadows that always fell on him when he visited that graveyard began to lift if id come at you full wed be digging your grave back there lets go again then cian slanted hoyt a look memories the pleasure of them so long suppressed crept back on him another time and when im finished pounding you you wont be up to romping with the redhead hoyt grinned ive missed you cian stared ahead as the house peeked through the trees the bloody hell of it is ive missed you too chapter with a crossbow armed and ready by her side glenna kept watch from the tower window shed considered the fact that shed had very little practice with that particular weapon and that her aim could be called into serious question but she couldnt just sit up there unarmed and wringing her hands like some helpless female if the damn sun would come out she wouldnt have to worry more than that she thought with a little hiss if the mckenna boys hadnt wandered off obviously to snarl at each other in private she wouldnt have these images in her head of them being ripped to pieces by a pack of vampires pack herd gang what did it matter they still had fangs and a bad attitude where had they gone and why had they been out exposed and vulnerable so long maybe the pack herd gang had already ripped them to shreds and dragged their mutilated bodies off to and oh god she wished she could turn off the video in her head for five damn minutes most women just worried about their man getting mugged or run over by a bus but oh no she had to get herself tangled up with a guy at war with bloodsucking fiends why couldnt she have fallen for a nice accountant or stockbroker she had thought of using her skill and the crystal to look for them but it seemed intrusive she decided and rude but if they werent back in ten minutes she was going to say screw manners and find them she hadnt thought through not completely the emotional turmoil hoyt was experiencing what he missed and what he risked more than the rest of them she decided she was thousands of miles away from her family but not hundreds of years he was in the home where hed grown up but it was no longer his home and every day every hour was another reminder of that bringing back his mothers herb garden had hurt him she should have thought of that too kept her mouth shut about what shed needed and wanted just made a damn list and gone out to find or buy supplies she glanced back at some of the herbs shed already bundled and hung to dry small things everyday things could cause the most pain now he was out there somewhere in the rain with his brother the vampire she didnt believe cian would attack hoyt or didnt want to believe it but if cian were angry enough pushed hard enough could he control what must be natural urges she didnt know the answer added to that no one could be sure more of liliths forces were not out and about just waiting for another chance it was probably silly to worry they were two men of considerable power men who knew the land neither of them were solely dependent on swords and daggers hoyt was armed and he wore one of the crosses theyd conjured so he was hardly defenseless and it proved a point didnt it the two of them being out moving freely it proved they wouldnt be held under siege no one else was worried particularly moira was back in the library studying larkin and king were in the training area doing a weapon inventory she was undoubtedly worked up about nothing where the hell were they as she continued to scan she spotted movement just shadows in the gloom she grabbed the crossbow ordered her fingers to stop shaking as she positioned it and herself in the narrow window just breathe she told herself just breathe in and out in and out that breath came out on a whoosh of relief when she saw hoyt cian beside him trooping along she noted dripping wet as if they had all the time in the world and not a care in it her brows drew together as they came closer was that blood on hoyts shirt and a fresh bruise spreading under his right eye she leaned out bumped the stone sill and the arrow shot out of the bow with a deadly twang she actually squealed shed hate herself for it later but the purely female sound of shock and distress ripped out of her as the arrow sliced air and rain and landed just a few inches short of the toe of hoyts boot their swords were out a blur of steel as they pivoted backtoback under other circumstances she would have admired the move the sheer grace and rhythm of it like a dance step but at the moment she was caught between mortification and horror sorry sorry she leaned out farther waved her arm frantically as she shouted it was me it got away from me i was just oh hell with it im coming down she left the weapon where it was vowing to take a full hour of practice with it before she shot at anything but a target again before she set off in a run she heard the unmistakable sound of male laughter a quick glance showed her it was cian all but doubled over with it hoyt simply stood staring up at the window as she swung down the stairs larkin came out of the training room trouble no no nothing everythings fine its nothing at all she could actually feel the blood rise up to heat her cheeks as she dashed for the main floor they were coming in the front door shaking themselves like wet dogs as she sprinted down the last steps im sorry im so sorry remind me not to piss you off red cian said easily you might aim for my heart and shoot me in the balls i was just keeping watch for you and i mustve pulled the trigger by mistake which i wouldnt have done if the two of you hadnt been gone so damn long and had me so worried thats what i love about women cian slapped his brothers shoulder they damn near kill you but in the end its your own fault good luck with that im going to bed i need to check your burns nag nag nag and what happened were you attacked your mouths bleeding yours too she said to hoyt and your eyes damn near swollen shut no we werent attacked there was a world of exasperation in his voice until you nearly shot me in the foot your faces are all banged up and your clothes are filthy ripped if you werent it came to her when she saw the expressions on their faces she had a brother of her own after all you punched each other each other he hit me first she gave cian a look that would have withered stone well thats just fine isnt it didnt we go through all this yesterday didnt we talk about infighting how destructive and useless it is i guess were going to bed without our supper dont get smart with me she jabbed a finger into cians chest im here worried half sick and the two of you are out there wrestling around like a couple of idiot puppies you nearly put an arrow in my foot hoyt reminded her i think were quits on foolish behavior for one day she only hissed out a breath into the kitchen both of you ill do something about those cuts and bruises again im having my bed cian began both of you now you dont want to mess with me at the moment as she sailed off cian rubbed a finger gently on his split lip its been a long while but i dont recall you having a particular fondness for bossy women i didnt previously but i understand them well enough to know we might as well be after letting her have her way on this and the fact is my eyes paining me when they came in glenna was setting what she needed out on the table she had the kettle on the boil and her sleeves rolled up do you want blood she said to cian with enough frost in the words to have him clearing his throat it amazed him that he actually felt chagrined it was a sensation he hadnt felt in too long to remember obviously living so closely with humans was a bad influence the tea youre making will do thanks take off your shirt there was a smart comment on the tip of his tongue she could all but see it he proved himself a wise man by swallowing it he stripped it off sat id forgotten about the burns hoyt examined them now there was no longer any blistering and theyd gone down to a dull ugly red if id remembered he said as he sat across from cian id have put more blows into your chest typical glenna said under her breath and was ignored you dont fight altogether the way you used to you use your feet more and elbows and hoyt could still feel the aching result of them then theres that leaping off the ground martial arts i have black belts in several of them master status cian explained you need to put more time into training hoyt rubbed his sore ribs and so i will werent they chummy all of a sudden glenna thought what was it about men that made them decide to be pals after theyd smashed their fists into each others faces she poured hot water into the pot and while it steeped came to the table with her salve i wouldve said three weeks to heal with what i can do considering the extent of the burns she sat slicked salve on her fingers im amending that to three days we can be hurt and seriously but unless its a killing blow we heal and quickly lucky for you especially as youve got a mass of nice bruising to go with the burns but you dont regenerate she continued as she applied the salve if say we were to cut off one of their arms it wouldnt grow back theres a gruesome and interesting thought no ive never heard of anything like that happening then if we cant get to the heart or the head we can go for a limb she went to the sink to wash the salve from her hands and make cold packs for the bruising here she handed one to hoyt hold that on your eye he sniffed at it then complied you shouldnt have worried cian winced bad tact wiser to say ah my love were sorry we worried you we were selfish and inconsiderate should likely be flogged for it we hope youll forgive us thicken the brogue a bit as well women are fools for brogues then kiss her feet i suppose actually you aim for the ass ass kissing is a tradition that never goes out of style youll need patience with him glenna hoyts still working on the learning curve she brought the tea to the table then surprised them both when she laid a hand on cians cheek and youre going to teach him how to deal with the modern woman well hes a bit pitiful is all her lips curved as she lowered her head brushed them over cians youre forgiven drink your tea just that easy hoyt complained he gets a pat on the cheek and a kiss with it you didnt nearly put an arrow into him women are a constant mystery cian spoke quietly and one of the wonders of the world ill take this up with me he got to his feet im wanting some dry clothes drink all of it glenna spoke without turning as she took up another bottle itll help i will then let me know if he doesnt learn fast enough to suit you i wouldnt quibble with being second choice thats just his way hoyt told her when cian left the room a kind of teasing i know so you made friends again while you were bloodying each other its true enough i hit him first i spoke to him of our mother and the garden and he was cold even though i could see what was under that cold i well i lashed out and after he took me to where our familys buried and there you have it she turned now and all the pity in her heart swirled into her eyes it mustve been hard for both of you to be there it makes it real to me that as i sit here now theyre gone it didnt seem real before not solid and real she moved to him dabbed her tincture on his facial bruises and for him to have lived all this time with no family at all another cruelty of what was done to him to all of them we dont think of that do we when we talk about war and how to destroy them they were people once just like cian they mean to kill us glenna every one of us that has a heartbeat i know i know something drained them of humanity but they were human once hoyt with families lovers hopes we dont think of that maybe we cant she brushed the hair back from his face a nice accountant she thought again a stockbroker how ridiculous how ordinary she had right here the amazing i think fate put cian here this way so we understand theres a weight to what were doing so that we know at the end of the day weve done what we had to do but not without cost she stepped back thatll have to do try to keep your face from walking into any more fists she started to turn but he took her hand rising as he drew her back to him his lips took hers with utter tenderness i think fate put you here glenna to help me understand its not just death and blood and violence theres such beauty such kindness in the world and i have it he wrapped his arms around her i have it here she indulged herself letting her head rest on his shoulder she wanted to ask what theyd have when it was over but she knew it was important even essential to take each day as it came we should work she drew back ive got some ideas about creating a safe zone around the house a protected area where we can move around more freely and i think larkins right about sending out scouts if we can get to the caves during the day we might be able to find something out even set traps your minds been busy i need to keep it that way im not as afraid if im thinking if im doing then we work moira might be able to help once we have a start glenna added as they left the kitchen shes reading everything she can get her hands on so shed be our prime data source information she explained and she has some power its raw and untrained but its there while glenna and hoyt closed themselves in the tower and the house was quiet moira pored over a volume on demon lore in the library it was fascinating she thought so many different theories and legends she considered it her task to pick them apart for truth cian would know it or some of it she concluded centuries of existence was plenty of time to learn and anyone who filled such a room with books sought and respected knowledge but she wasnt ready to ask him wasnt sure she would ever be if he wasnt like the creatures she read of those that sought human blood night after night and thirsted not just for that blood but the kill what was he now he prepared to make war against what he was and she didnt understand it she needed to learn more about what they fought about cian about all the others how could you understand and then trust what you didnt know she made notes copious notes on the paper shed found in one of the drawers of the big desk she loved the paper and the writing instrument the pen she corrected that held the ink inside its tube she wondered if she could smuggle some of the paper and pens back to geall she closed her eyes she missed home and the missing was like a constant ache in her belly shed written down her wish sealed the paper and would leave it among her things for larkin to find if it came to pass if she died on this side she wanted her body taken back to geall for burial she continued to write with thoughts circling in her head there was one she kept coming back to nibbling at she would have to find a way to ask glenna if it could be done if the others would agree to it if it could was there a way to seal off the portal to close the door to geall with a sigh she looked toward the window was it raining in geall now too or was the sun shining on her mothers grave she heard footsteps approach and danced her fingers over the hilt of her dagger she let them fall away when king came in for reasons she couldnt name she felt easier with him than the others got something against chairs shorty her lips twitched she liked the way words rumbled out of him like rocks down a stony hill no but i like sitting on the floor is it time for more training taking a break he sat in a wide chair a huge mug of coffee in his hand larkin could go all damn day up there now practicing some katas i like the katas its like dancing just make sure youre doing the leading if youre dancing with a vampire idly she turned the page of a book hoyt and cian fought king took a drink oh yeah who won i think neither i saw them coming back and from their faces and limps it seemed to be a draw how do you know they were fighting with each other maybe they were attacked no she traced her fingers over words i hear things you got big ears shorty so my mother always said they made peace between them hoyt and his brother that eliminates a complication if it lasts given their personalities king figured a full truce between the brothers had the life expectancy of a fruit fly what do you expect to find out in all these books everything sooner or later do you know how the first vampyre came to be there are different versions in the books never thought about it i did do one is like a love story long ago when the world was young demons were dying out before long before that there were more scores of them walking the world but man grew stronger and smarter and the time of the demons was passing because he was a man who enjoyed stories he settled back kind of an evolution a change yes many demons went beneath the world to hide or to sleep there was more magic then because people didnt turn from it man and the faeries forged an alliance to wage war on the demons to drive them under for once and all there was one who was poisoned and slowly dying he loved a mortal woman and this was forbidden even in the demon world so man doesnt have a lock on bigotry keep going he said when she paused so the dying demon took the mortal woman from her home he was obsessed with her and his last wish was to mate with her before his end not so different from men in that area then i think perhaps all living creatures crave love and pleasure and this physical act that represents life and guys want to get off she lost her rhythm get off what he nearly spewed coffee choked instead he waved a hand at her as his laugh rumbled out dont mind me finish the story ah well he took her deep into the forest and had his way with her and she like a woman under a spell wanted his touch to try to save his life she offered her blood to him so she was bitten and drank his blood in turn as this was another kind of mating she died with him but she did not cease to exist she became the thing we call vampyre a demon for love aye i suppose in vengeance against men she hunted them fed from them changed them to make more of her kind and still she grieved for her demon lover and killed herself with sunlight doesnt quite hit romeo and juliet does it a play i saw the book of it here on the shelf i havent yet read it it would take years to read all the books in such a room she thought as she toyed with the end of her braid but i read another tale of the vampyre it tells of a demon mad and ill from a spell even more evil than it thirsting wildly for human blood he fed and the more he fed the more mad he became he died after mixing his blood with a mortal and the mortal became vampyre the first of its kind i guess you like the first version better no i like truth better and i think the second is the truth what mortal woman would love a demon led a sheltered life back in your world havent you where i come from people fall for monsters or what others consider monsters all the time aint no logic with love shorty it just is she tossed her braid behind her back in a kind of shrug well if i love i wont be stupid about it hope im around long enough to see you eat those words she closed the book drew up her legs do you love someone a woman been close a few times and thats how i know i didnt make it all the way to the bullseye how do you know when you hit the center shorty youre down for the count but its fun shooting for it gonna take a special woman to get past this he tapped a finger to his face i like your face its so big and dark he laughed so hard he nearly spilled his coffee you got that one right and youre strong you speak well and you cook you have loyalty to your friends that big dark face softened want to apply for the position of love of my life she smiled back at him at ease im thinking im not your bullseye if im to be queen i must marry one day have children i hope it wont be only duty but that i find what my mother found in my father what they found in each other id want him to be strong and loyal and handsome she moved her shoulders because she did hope that as well do women here only look for beauty couldnt say but it dont hurt guy looks like cian for instance hes got to beat them off with sticks then why is he lonely he studied her over the rim of his mug good question how did you come to meet him he saved my life moira wrapped her arms around her legs and settled in there was little she liked more than a story how i was in the wrong place at the wrong time bad neighborhood in east la he drank again lifted a shoulder in a half shrug see my old man took off before i was born and my old lady had what well call a little problem with illegal substances odd overdosed took too much of some bad shit she died everything in her mourned for him im sorry bad choices bad luck you gotta figure some people come into the world set on tossing their life into the shitter she was one of them so im on the street doing what i can to get by and keep out of the system im heading to this place i know its dark steaming hot i just wanted a place to sleep for the night you had no home i had the street a couple of guys were hanging out on the stoop probably waiting to make a score i got my bad attitude on need to get by them to get where i want to go car rolls up blasts at them driveby he said like an ambush im caught in it bullet grazes my head more coming and i know im going to be dead somebody grabs me pulls me back things got blurry but it felt like i was flying then i was someplace else where fancy hotel room id never seen anything like it outside of movies he crossed his big booted feet as he remembered bigass bed big enough for ten people and im lying on it head hurts like a mother which is why i dont figure im dead and this is heaven he comes out of the bathroom got his shirt off and a fresh bandage on his shoulder got himself shot dragging me out of the cross fire what did you do nothing much guess i was in shock he sits down studies me like im a frigging book youre lucky he said and stupid hes got that accent im figuring he must be some rock star or something the way he looks the fancy voice the fancy room truth is i thought he was a perv and he was going to want me to lets just say i was scared shitless i was eight you were a child her eyes widened you were just a child i was eight he repeated grow up like i did you arent a kid long he asks me what the hell i was doing out there and i give him some sass trying to get some of my own back he asks if im hungry and i shoot back something like i aint going to perform any sexual favors for a goddamn meal orders a steak dinner a bottle of wine some soda pop and he tells me he isnt interested in buggering young boys if ive got someplace id rather be i should go there otherwise i can wait for the steak you waited for the steak fucking a he gave her a wink that was the start of it he gave me food and a choice i could go back to where id been no skin off his or i could work for him i took the job didnt know the job meant school he gave me clothes an education selfrespect did he tell you what he was not then not long after though i figured he was whacked but i didnt much care by the time i realized he was telling the truth literal truth i wouldve done anything for him the man i was setting to be died on the street that night he didnt turn me king said quietly but he changed me why did you ever ask him why yeah thatd be for him to tell she nodded the story itself was enough to think about breaks about over he announced we can get an hours workout in toughen up that skinny ass of yours she grinned or we could work with the bow improve that poor aim of yours come on smartass he frowned glanced toward the doorway you hear something like a knocking she shrugged and because she tarried to straighten the books was several paces behind him out of the room glenna trotted down the steps what little progress they were making she could leave to hoyt for the time being someone had to see about the evening meal and since shed put her name on the list she was elected she could toss together a marinade for some chicken then go back up for another hour a good meal would set the tone for a team meeting shed just drop by the library yank moira away from the books for a cooking lesson while she was at it maybe it was sexist to put the only other woman next on the kp list but she had to start somewhere the knock on the door made her jolt then pass a nervous hand through her hair she nearly called up the stairs for larkin or king then shook her head talk about sexist how was she going to fare in serious battle if she couldnt even open the door herself on a rainy afternoon it could be a neighbor dropping by to pay a courtesy call or cians caretaker stopping by to make sure they had everything they needed and a vampire couldnt enter the house couldnt step over the threshold unless she asked it in a highly unlikely event still she looked out the window first she saw a young woman of about twenty a pretty blonde in jeans and a bright red sweater her hair was pulled back into a tail that swung out of the back of a red cap she was holding a map seemed to be puzzling over it as she chewed on a thumbnail someones lost glenna thought and the sooner she got her on her way and away from the house the better for everyone the knock sounded again as she turned from the window she opened the door careful to keep to her side of the threshold hello need some help hello thank you yes there was relief and a heavy dose of french in the womans voice i am ah lost excusezmoi my english is not so good thats okay my french is fairly nonexistent what can i do for you ennis sil vous plaît may you tell me how the road it goes to ennis im not sure im not from around here myself i can look at the map glenna watched the womans eyes as she held out a hand for it her fingertips on her side of the door im glenna je suis glenna ah oui je mapelle lora i am in holiday a student thats nice the rain lora held out a hand so rain drops splattered it i am lost in it i think could happen to anyone lets have a look at your map lora are you by yourself pardon alone are you alone oui mes amies my friends i have friends in ennis but i turn bad wrong oh no glenna thought i really dont think so im surprised you could see the house from the main road were so far back sorry glenna smiled brilliantly i bet youd like to come in have a nice cup of tea while we figure out your route she saw the light come into the blondes baby blue eyes but you cant can you just cant step through the door je ne comprendrez pas bet you do but in case my spidey sense is off today you need to go back to the main road turn left left she repeated and started to gesture kings shout behind her had her spinning around her hair swung the tips of it going beyond the doorway there was an explosion of pain as her hair was viciously yanked as her body flew out of the house and hit the ground with a bonewracking thud there were two more and they came out of nowhere instinct had glenna reaching for her cross with one hand kicking out blindly with her feet movement was a blur and she tasted blood in her mouth she saw king slicing at one with a knife holding it off while he shouted at her to get up to get into the house she stumbled to her feet in time to see them surround him closing in she heard herself screaming and thought hoped she heard answering shouts from the house but they would be too late the vampires were on king like dogs french bitch glenna spat out and charged the blonde her fist cracked bone and there was satisfaction in that and the sudden spurt of blood then she was once more hurdling back and this time when she hit her vision went gray she felt herself being dragged struggled it was moiras voice buzzing in her ear i have you i have you youre back inside lie still no king theyve got king moira was already dashing out dagger drawn as glenna pushed herself up larkin vaulted over her and through the door glenna gained her knees then swayed to her feet sickness burned its acrid taste at the base of her throat as she once more stumbled to the door so fast she thought dully how could anything move that fast as moira and larkin gave chase they bundled the still struggling king into a black van they were gone before she got out of the house larkins body shimmered shuddered and became a cougar the cat flashed after the van and out of sight glenna went to her knees on the wet grass and retched get inside hoyt grabbed her arm with his free hand in his other was a sword inside the house glenna moira get inside its too late glenna cried while tears of horror spilled out of her eyes they have king she looked up saw cian standing behind hoyt they took him they took king chapter in the house hoyt repeated as he started to drag glenna inside cian shoved past him and flew toward the stables go with him glenna struggled past the tears and pain oh god go with him hurry leaving her shaking and bleeding was the hardest thing hed ever done the door where the black machine sat was open his brother tossed weapons carelessly inside will this catch them hoyt demanded cian barely spared him a glance with eyes rimmed red stay with the women i dont need you need or not you have me how the bloody hell do i get inside this thing he fought with the door and when it opened folded himself inside it cian said nothing only got behind the wheel the machine let out a vicious roar seemed to quiver like a stallion poised to run and then they were flying stones and sod spewed into the air like missiles hoyt caught a glimpse of glenna in the doorway holding the arm he feared might be broken he prayed to all the gods hed see her again she watched him go and wondered if shed sent her lover to his death get all the weapons you can carry she told moira youre hurt let me see to you get the weapons moira she turned her face fierce and bloodied or do you intend for us to stay here like children while the men do the fighting moira nodded do you want blade or bow both glenna went quickly to the kitchen gathered bottles her arm was screaming so she quickly did what she could to block the pain this was ireland she thought grimly and that should mean plenty of churches in the churches would be holy water she carried the bottles along with a butcher knife and a bundle of garden stakes to the van glenna with a longbow and crossbow slung over her shoulders two swords in her hand moira crossed to the van she put the weapons inside then held up one of the silver crosses by its chain this was up in the training room i think it must be kings he has no protection glenna slammed the cargo door he has us hedgerows and hills were no more than a blur through the gray curtain of rain hoyt saw other machines cars he reminded himself traveling the wet road and the edges of a village he saw cattle in fields and sheep and the ramble of stone fences he saw nothing of larkin or the car that held king can you track them in this he asked cian no he spun the wheel sent up a flood of water theyll take him to lilith theyll keep him alive he had to believe it and take him to lilith the caves hoyt thought how long it had taken him to travel from his cliffs to clare but that had been on horseback and hed been wounded and feverish still the journey would take time too much time alive cian why will they take him alive hed be a prize to her thats what he is a prize hes alive shed want the kill for herself we cant be that far behind them cant be and the jags faster than the bloody van they have him in he wont be bitten the cross will stop that it wont stop a sword or an arrow a fucking bullet guns and bows arent the weapons of choice he said almost to himself too remote we like close kills and some tradition with it we like to look in the eyes shell want to torture him first wouldnt want it to be quick his hands tightened on the wheel enough to bruise the leather should buy us some time nights coming what hoyt didnt say and they both knew was there would be more of them at night cian swung around a sedan at a speed that had the jag fishtailing on the slick road then the tires bit in and he shot forward again a flash of headlights in his eyes blinded him but didnt slow him down he had a moment to think bloody tourists as the oncoming car edged him over branches of hedgerows scraped and rattled over the side and windows of the jag loose gravel spat out like stone bullets we shouldve caught up with them by now if they took another route or shes got another hole too many options cian thought and pushed for more speed can you do anything a locator spell i havent any he slapped a hand to the dash as cian shot around another curve wait he gripped the cross he wore pushed power into it and bearing down brought its light into his mind shield and symbol guide me give me sight he saw the cougar running through the rain the cross lashing like a silver whip around its throat larkin hes close fallen behind us keeping to the fields hes tiring he searched feeling with the light as if it were fingers glenna and moira with her they didnt stay in the house theyre moving shes in pain they cant help me wheres king i cant find him hes in the dark dead i dont know i cant reach him cian slammed on the brakes wrenched the wheel the jag went into a sickening spin revolving closer and closer to the black van that sat across the narrow road there was a scream of tires and a dull thud as metal slapped metal cian was out before the motion stopped sword in hand when he wrenched open the door of the van he found nothing and no one theres a woman here hoyt called out shes hurt cursing cian rounded the van yanked open the cargo doors there was blood he saw human blood by its scent but not enough for death cian shes been bitten but shes alive cian glanced over his shoulder he saw the woman lying on the road blood seeping from the punctures in her neck didnt drain her not enough time revive her bring her around cian ordered you can do it do it fast theyve taken her car switched cars find out what she was driving she needs help goddamn it shell live or she wont bring her around hoyt laid his fingertips on the wounds felt the burn madam hear me wake and hear me she stirred then her eyes flew open the pupils big as moons rory rory help me roughly cian shoved hoyt aside he had some power of his own look at me into me he bent close until her eyes were fixed on him what happened here a woman the van needed help we thought rory stopped he got out he got out and they oh god sweet god rory they took your car what kind of car was it blue bmw rory they took him they took him no room for you they said no room and threw me down they laughed cian straightened help me get this van off the road they were smart enough to take the keys we cant leave her like this then stay with her but help me move this bloody van fury had hoyt spinning around and the van jumped three feet across the road nice work she could die out here she did nothing she wont be the first or the last its war isnt it cian shot back shes what they call collateral damage good strategy this he mumbled and took stock slow us down and switch to a faster car i wont be catching them now before they reach the caves if thats where theyre going he turned toward his brother considered i may need you now after all i wont leave an injured woman on the side of the road like a sick dog cian stepped back to his car flipped open the center compartment and took out a mobile phone he spoke into it briefly its a communication device he told hoyt as he tossed the phone back into storage ive called for help medical and the garda all youll do now by staying is get yourself hauled in and asked questions you cant answer he popped the hood took out a blanket and some flares put that over her he instructed ill set these up hes bait now cian added as he set the flares to light bait as much as a prize she knows were coming she wants us to then we wont disappoint her with no hope of cutting off the raiding party before they reached the caves cian drove more cautiously she was smarter more aggressive and more willing to lose troops so she has the advantage well be outnumbered greatly we always would have been at this point she may be willing to negotiate to take a trade one of us for king youre all the same to her a humans a human so you have no particular value in this you perhaps because she respects and covets power but shed want me more youre willing to trade your life for his she wouldnt kill me at least not right away shed want to use her considerable talents first shed enjoy that torture and persuasion if she could bring me over to her side it would be a coup a man who trades his life for a friend doesnt turn and betray him why would she think otherwise because were fickle creatures and she made me that gives her quite a bit of pull no not you id believe youd trade yourself for king but i dont think shed believe it youll have to offer me hoyt said after a moment oh will i ive been nothing to you for hundreds of years hes more to you than me shed see that a human for a sorcerer a good exchange for her and why should she think youd give yourself for a man youve known for what a week because youd have a knife to my throat cian tapped his fingers on the steering wheel it could work the rain had passed into dreary moonlight by the time they reached the cliffs they rose high above the road jutted out to cast jagged shadows over the toiling sea there was only the sound of the water lashing rock and the hum of the air that was like the breath of gods there was no sign of another car of human or of creature along the seaside of the road was a rail below it was rocks water and the maze of caves we lure her up cian nodded toward the edge if we go down to her were trapped with the sea at our backs we go up make her come to us they started the climb over slippery rocks and soggy grass at the headland stood a lighthouse its beam lancing out into the dark they both sensed the attack before the movement the thing sprang out from behind the rocks fangs bared cian merely pivoted led with his shoulder and sent it tumbling down to the road for the second he used the stake hed hitched in his belt then he straightened turned to the third who appeared more cautious than his fellows tell your mistress cian mckenna wants to speak with her vicious teeth gleamed in the moonlight well drink your blood tonight or youll die hungry and by liliths hands because you failed to deliver a message the thing melted away and down there may be more waiting above hoyt commented unlikely shed be expecting us to charge the caves not head to high ground for a hostage negotiation shell be intrigued and shell come so they climbed then walked the slope to higher ground and the point where hoyt had once faced lilith and the thing shed made of his brother shell appreciate the irony of the spot it feels as it did hoyt tucked his cross out of sight under his shirt the air the night this was my place once where i could stand and call power with a thought youd best hope you still can cian drew his knife get on your knees he flicked the point at hoyts throat watched the dribble of blood from the thin slice now so it comes to choices it always comes to choices you would have killed me here if you could i would have saved you here if i could well you did neither did you he slid the knife from hoyts sheath made a v with the blades to hold at his brothers throat kneel with the cold edge of the blades on his flesh hoyt got to his knees well what a handsome sight lilith stepped into the moonlight she wore emerald green robes with her hair long and loose to spill over her shoulders like sunbeams lilith its been a very long time too long the silk rustled as she moved did you come all this way to bring me a gift a trade cian corrected call your dogs off he said quietly or i kill him then them and you have nothing so forceful she gestured with her hand toward the vampires creeping in at the sides youve seasoned you were hardly more than a pretty puppy when i gave you the gift now look at you a sleek wolf i like it and still your dog hoyt spat out ah the mighty sorcerer brought low i like that too you marked me she opened her robes to show hoyt the pentagram branded over her heart it gave me pain for more than a decade and the scar never fades i owe you for that tell me cian how did you manage to bring him here he thinks im his brother it makes it easy she took your life shes lies and death over hoyts head cian smiled thats what i love about her ill give you this one for the human you took hes useful to me and loyal i want him back but hes so much bigger than this one so much more to feast on he has no power hes an ordinary mortal i give you a sorcerer yet you covet the human as i said hes of use to me do you know how much time and trouble it takes to train a human servant i want him back no one steals from me not you not anyone well discuss it bring him down ive done quite a bit with the caves we can be comfortable have a little something to eat ive a very rubenesque exchange student on tap swiss we can share oh but wait she let out a musical laugh ive heard you dine on pigs blood these days you cant trust everything you hear deliberately cian lifted the knife hed used to cut hoyt flicked his tongue over the bloodied blade that first taste of human after so long a fast reddened his eyes churned his hunger but i havent lived so long to be stupid this is a onetime offer lilith bring the human to me and take the sorcerer how can i trust you my darling boy you kill our kind i kill what i like when i like as you do you aligned yourself with them with humans plotted against me as long as it amused me its become boring and costly give me the human take this one and as a bonus ill invite you into my home you can have a banquet on the others hoyts head jerked and the blade bit he cursed in gaelic now with low and steady violence smell the power in that blood lilith crooned it gorgeous another step and i cut the jugular waste it all would you she smiled beautifully i wonder is that what you want she gestured at the edge of the cliff where the lighthouse stood cian could see king slumped between two vampires hes alive she said lightly of course you only have my word for it as i have yours that youd hand that one to me like a pretty present all wrapped in shiny paper lets play a game she held her skirts out twirled kill him and i give you the human kill your brother but not with the knives kill him as youre meant to kill take his blood drink him and the human is yours bring me the human first she pouted brushed fussily at her skirts oh very well she lifted one arm high then the other cian eased the knives from hoyts throat as they began to drag king forward they dropped him and with a vicious kick sent him over the edge oops lilith eyess danced with merriment as she pressed a hand to her lips butterfingers i guess youll have to pay me back now and kill that one with a wild roar cian charged forward and she rose up spreading her robe like wings take them she shouted bring them to me and was gone cian switched grips on the knives as hoyt sprang up yanking free the stakes shoved into the back of his belt arrows flew slicing through air and hearts before cian could strike the first blow a half dozen vampires were dust blown out to sea by the wind more are coming moira shouted from the cover of trees we need to go we need to go now this way hurry retreat was bitter a vile taste burning the back of the throat but the choice was to swallow death so they turned from battle when they reached the car hoyt reached for his brothers hand cian dont he slammed in watched the others leap into the van just dont the long drive home was full of silence of grief and of fury glenna didnt weep it went too deep for tears she drove in a kind of trance her body throbbing with pain and shock her mind numb with it and knowing it was cowardice huddled there it wasnt your fault she heard moiras voice but couldnt respond to it she felt larkin touch her shoulder she supposed in comfort but was too numb to react and when moira climbed in the back with larkin to give her solitude she knew only vague relief she turned into the woods carefully maneuvered the narrow lane in front of the house where the lights burned she shut off the engine the lights reached for the door it flew open and she was wrenched out held inches above the ground even then she felt nothing not even fear as she saw the thirst in cians eyes tell me why i shouldnt break your neck and be done with it i cant hoyt reached them first and was flicked away with a careless backward swipe dont hes not to blame dont she said now to hoyt before he could charge again please dont and to larkin do you think that moves me she looked into cians eyes again no why should it he was yours i killed him it wasnt her doing moira shoved cians arm but didnt budge him an inch she isnt to blame for this let her speak for herself she cant cant you see how badly shes hurt she wouldnt let me tend her before we followed you we need to get inside if were attacked now we all die if you harm her hoyt said quietly ill kill you myself is that all there is glennas words were a weary whisper just death is that all therell ever be again give her to me hoyt cupped his arms drew her out of cians grasp he murmured to her in gaelic as he carried her into the house youll come and youll listen moira closed a hand around cians arm he deserves that dont tell me what he deserves he wrenched free of her with a force that knocked her back two steps you know nothing of it i know more than you think she left him to follow hoyt into the house i couldnt catch them larkin stared at the ground i wasnt fast enough and i couldnt catch them he yanked open the cargo doors unloaded weapons i cant turn into one of these he slammed the doors again it has to be alive what i become even the cougar couldnt catch them cian said nothing and went inside they had glenna on the sofa in the main parlor her eyes were closed her face pale her skin clammy against the pallor the bruising along her jaw and cheek was livid blood had dried at the corner of her mouth hoyt gently tested her arm not broken he thought with relief badly wrenched but not broken trying not to jar her he removed her shirt to discover more bruising over her shoulder her torso running down to her hip i know what to get moira said and dashed off not broken hoyts hands hovered over her ribs its good theres nothing broken shes fortunate her heads still on her shoulders cian went directly to a cabinet took out whiskey he drank straight from the bottle some of the injuries are inside her shes badly injured no less than she deserves for going out of the house she didnt moira hurried back in carrying glennas case not the way youre meaning you dont expect me to believe king went out and she leaped to his defense he came out for me glenna opened eyes glassy from the pain and they took him quiet hoyt ordered moira i need you here well use this she selected a bottle pour it on the bruising after handing him the bottle she knelt rested her hands lightly on glennas torso what power i can claim i call now to ease your pain warmth to heal and harm none to take away the damage done she looked entreatingly at glenna help me im not very good glenna laid her hand over moiras closed her eyes when hoyt laid his on top for a triad glenna sucked in a breath let it out on a moan but when moira would have yanked her hand away glenna gripped it tight sometimes healing hurts she managed sometimes it has to say the chant again three times as moira obeyed sweat sprang onto glennas skin but the bruising faded a little going the sickly tones of healing yes thats better thanks well have some of that whiskey here moira snapped no id better not trying for steady breaths glenna pushed up help me sit i need to see how bad it is now lets see about this hoyt skimmed his fingers over her face and she grabbed his hand the tears came now couldnt be stopped im so sorry you cant blame yourself glenna who else cian countered and moira shoved up to her feet he wasnt wearing the cross she dug in her pocket held it up he took it off upstairs and left it behind he was showing me some moves wrestling larkin explained and it got in his way he said he must have forgotten about it he never meant to go outside did he and wouldnt have but for her he was mistaken moira laid the cross on the table glenna he needs to know the truth the truth is less painful he thought he must have thought i was going to let her in or step out i wasnt but i was being cocky so whats the difference smug hes dead because of it cian took another drink tell me why hes dead she knocked on the door i shouldnt have answered but i saw it was a woman a young woman with a map i wasnt going out or asking her in i swear that to you she said she was lost she spoke with an accent french charming really but i knew i felt and i couldnt resist toying with her god oh god she said as more tears spilled how stupid how vain she took a deep breath she said her name was lora lora cian lowered the bottle young attractive french accent yes you know her i do he drank again i do yes i could see what she was i dont know how but i knew i should have just shut the door on her but on the chance i was wrong i thought i should give her directions and get her moving id just started to when king shouted and he came running down the hall i turned around i was startled i was careless she got some of my hair she pulled me outside by it it was so fast moira continued i was behind king i barely saw her move the vampyre he went out after them and there were more four five more it was like lightning strikes moira poured herself a shot of whiskey downed it to smooth the raw edge of her nerves they were on him all of them and he shouted for glenna to get inside but she got up instead she got up and ran to help him it knocked her back the female of them like she was a stone in a sling she tried to help him even though she was hurt maybe she was careless but so was he moira picked up the cross again and its a terrible price he paid for it a terrible price he paid for defending a friend with hoyts help glenna got to her feet im sorry isnt enough i know what he meant to you you couldnt possibly i think i do and i know what he meant to the rest of us i know hes dead because of me ill live with that all of my life so will i and its my bad luck that ill live a great deal longer than you he took the whiskey bottle when he walked out chapter in the moment between wake and sleep there was candlelight and the bliss of nothing easy warmth and sheets scented with lavender and floating on the comfort of nothing but the moment passed and glenna remembered king was dead hurled into the sea by monsters with the same carelessness of a boy tossing a pebble into a lake shed gone upstairs alone by her own request to seek the solitude and oblivion of sleep watching the candle flicker she wondered if she would ever be able to sleep in the dark again if she would ever be able to see night coming and not think their time was coming with it to walk in the moonlight without fear would she ever know that simplicity again or would even a rainy day forever send chills down her spine she turned her head on the pillow and she saw him silhouetted by the silver light that slid through the window that overlooked his herb garden keeping watch in the night she thought over her over them all whatever burdens they all bore his were heavier and still hed come to stand between her and the dark hoyt she sat up as he turned and she held out her hands to him i didnt want to wake you he crossed to her took her hands while studying her face in the dim light are you in pain no no its gone under at least for now i have you and moira to thank for that you helped yourself as much as we did and sleep will help as well dont go please cian i dont know he sent a troubled look toward the door closed in his rooms with the whiskey looking at her he brushed back her hair turning her face to take a closer study at the bruising were all using what we can tonight so the pain goes under she would never have let him go she would never have released king no matter what wed done no he eased down to sit on the side of the bed cian must have known that somewhere inside him but he had to try we had to try by pretending to be a bargaining chip she thought remembering hoyts explanation of what theyd seen on the cliffs now we all know there can be no bargaining in this he continued are you strong enough to hear what i have to say yes weve lost one of us one of the six we were told we needed to fight this battle to win this war i dont know what it means our warrior maybe it means we all have to become warriors better ones i killed tonight hoyt more from luck than skill but i destroyed what had once been human i can and will do it again but with more skill every day with more skill she took one of us and she thinks itll make us weak and frightened but shes wrong well show her shes wrong im to lead this battle you have great skill in magicks youll work in the tower on weapons shields spells a protective circle to whoa wait she held up a hand am i getting this im consigned to the tower what like rapunzel i dont know this person just another helpless female waiting to be rescued ill work on the magicks and ill work harder and longer just like ill train harder and longer but what i wont do is sit up in the tower day and night with my cauldron and crystals writing spells while the rest of you fight you had your first battle today and it nearly killed you and gave me a lot more respect for what were up against i was called to this just like the rest of us i wont hide from it using your strengths isnt hiding i was given the charge of this army well let me slap some bars on you and call you colonel why are you so angry i dont want you to protect me i want you to value me value you he shoved to his feet so the red shimmer from the fire washed over his face i value you almost more than i can bear ive lost too much already ive watched my brother the one who shared the womb with me taken ive stood over the graves of my family i wont see you cut down by these things you the single light for me in all of this i wont risk your life again i wont stand over your grave but i can risk your life i can stand over your grave im a man he said it so simply the way an adult might tell a child the sky is blue that she couldnt speak for ten full seconds then she plopped back against the pillows the only reason im not working on turning you into a braying jackass this very moment is im giving you some slack due to the fact you come from an unenlightened age un unenlightened let me clue you in to mine merlin women are equals we work we go into combat we vote and above all we make our own decisions regarding our own lives our own bodies our own minds men dont rule here ive never known a world where men rule he muttered in physical strength glenna youre not equal we make up for it with other advantages however keen your minds your wiles your bodies are more fragile theyre made to bear children you just gave me a contradiction in terms if men were responsible for childbearing the world wouldve ended a long time ago with no help from a bunch of gloryseeking vampires and let me point out one little fact the one causing this whole mess is a female somehow that should be my point well its just not so forget it and the one who brought us together is also female so youre way outnumbered and i have more ammo but this ridiculous conversation is giving me a headache you should rest well talk more of this tomorrow im not going to rest and were not going to talk about this tomorrow his single light he thought sometimes she was a beam searing straight into his eyes you are a contrary and exasperating woman yes now she smiled and once more held out her hands sit down here would you youre worried about me and for me i understand that appreciate that if you would do this thing for me he lifted her hands to his lips it would ease my mind make me a better leader oh thats good she drew her hands away to poke him gently in the chest very good women arent the only ones with wiles not wile but truth ask me for something else and ill try to give it to you but i cant give you this hoyt i worry for you too and about you for all of us and i question what we can do what were capable of and i wonder why in all the world the worlds were the ones who have to do this thing but none of that changes anything we are the ones and weve lost a very good man already if i lose you glenna theres a void in me at the very thought of it sometimes she knew the woman had to be stronger there are so many worlds and so many ways i dont think we could ever lose each other now what i have now is more than ive ever had before i think it makes us better than we were maybe thats part of why were here to find each other she leaned into him sighed when his arms encircled her stay with me come lie with me love me you need to heal yes she drew him down with her touched her lips to his i do he hoped he had the tenderness in him that she needed he wanted to give her that the magic of it slowly then he brushed kisses over her cheek quietly he used just his lips skimming kisses over her mouth her face her throat warm and soothing he brushed away the thin gown she wore to trace those easy kisses over her breasts over her bruises in comfort and with care soft as birds wings lips and fingertips to ease her mind and her body and to stir them and when their eyes met he knew more than hed ever known held more than hed ever owned he lifted her up onto a pillow of air and silver light making magic their bed around the room the candles came to life with a sound like a sigh and the light they shed was like melted gold its beautiful she took his hands as they floated closed her eyes on the sumptuous joy of it this is beautiful i would give you all i have and still it wouldnt be enough youre wrong its everything more than pleasure more than passion did he know what he made of her when he touched her like this nothing they faced no terror or pain no death or damnation could overcome this the light inside her was like a beacon and it would never be dark again here was life at its sweetest and most generous the taste of him was a balm to her soul even as his touch roused desires steeped in him she lifted her arms turned up her palms rose petals white as snow streamed down like rain she smiled when he slipped into her when they moved together silky and slow light and air scent and sensation surrounded the rise and fall of bodies and hearts once more their fingers meshed once more their lips met and as they drifted together love healed them both in the kitchen moira puzzled over a can of soup no one had eaten and she was determined to make some sort of meal should glenna awake shed managed the tea but shed been shown how to conquer that shed only watched king open one of the cylinders with the little machine that made the nasty noise shed tried and failed three times to make it work and was seriously considering getting her sword and hacking the cylinder open she had a little kitchen magic precious little she admitted glancing around to be sure she was alone she pulled what she had together and visualized the can open it shimmied a bit on the counter but remained stubbornly whole all right one more time then she bent down studied the opener that was attached to the underside of the cupboard with the proper tools she could take it apart find out how it worked she loved taking things apart but if she had the proper tools she could just open the bloody cylinder in the first place she straightened shook her hair back rolled her shoulders muttering to herself she tried once again to do the deed this time when the machine whirled the can revolved she clasped her hands together in delight then bent close again to watch it work it was so clever she thought so much here was clever she wondered if shed ever be allowed to drive the van king had said hed teach her how it was done her lips trembled at the thought of it of him and she pressed them hard together she prayed his death had been quick and his suffering brief in the morning she would put up a stone for him in the graveyard she and larkin had seen when theyd been walking and when she returned to geall she would erect another and ask the harper to write a song for him she emptied the contents into a pot and set it on the burner turning it on as glenna had showed her they needed to eat grief and hunger would make them weak and weakness would make them easier prey bread she decided they would have some bread it would be a simple meal but filling she turned toward the pantry then stumbled back when she saw cian in the doorway he leaned against the wall the nearly empty whiskey bottle dangling from his fingers midnight snack his teeth showed white with his smile ive a fondness for them myself no ones eaten i thought we should always thinking arent you little queen minds always going he was drunk she could see that too much whiskey had dulled his eyes and thickened his voice but she could also see the pain you should sit before you fall over thanks for the kind invitation in my own bloody house but i just came down for another bottle he shook the one he held someone appears to have made off with this one drink yourself sick if you want to be stupid about it but you might as well eat something i know you eat ive seen you ive gone to the trouble to make it he glanced at the counter smirked you opened a tin its sorry i am i didnt have time to kill the fatted calf so youll make do she turned around to busy herself then went very still when she felt him behind her his fingers skimmed the side of her throat light as a moths wings id have thought you tasty once upon a time drunk angry grieving she thought all of those made him dangerous if she showed him her fear hed only be more so youre in my way not yet i dont have time for drunkards maybe you dont want food but glenna needs it for healing strength id say shes feeling strong enough bitterness edged his tone as he glanced up didnt you see the lights brighten a bit ago i did i dont know what that has to do with glenna it means she and my brother are having a go at each other sex he said when she looked blank a bit of naked sweaty sex to top off the evening ah she blushes he laughed moved closer all that pretty blood just under the skin delicious stop i used to like when they trembled the way you are it makes the blood hotter and it adds to the thrill id nearly forgotten you smell of the whiskey this is hot enough now sit down and ill make a bowl for you i dont want the fucking soup wouldnt mind that hot sweaty sex but likely im too drunk to manage it well then ill just get that fresh bottle and finish the job cian cian people turn to each other for comfort when deaths come it isnt disrespect but need you dont want to lecture me on sex i know more of it than you could ever imagine of its pleasures and its pain and its purposes people turn to drink as well but its not as healthy i know what he was to you you dont he talked to me more than the others i think because i like to listen he told me how you found him all those years ago what you did for him i amused myself stop it the tone of command bred into her bones snapped into her voice now its disrespect youre showing for a man who was a friend to me and he was a son to you a friend and a brother all of that i want to put a stone up for him tomorrow it could wait until sunset until you could go out and what do i care for stones he said and left her glenna was so grateful for the sun she could have wept there were clouds but they were thin and the beams burst through them to toss light and shadows on the ground she hurt still heart and body but she would deal with it for now she took one of her cameras and she stepped outside to let the sun bathe her face charmed by the music of it she walked to the stream then just laid down on its bank and basked birds sang pouring joy into air that was fragrant with flowers she could see foxglove dancing lightly in the breeze for a moment she felt the earth beneath her sigh and whisper with the pleasure of a new day grief would come and go she knew but today there was light and work and there was still magic in the world when a shadow fell over her she turned her head smiled at moira how are you this morning better glenna told her im better sore and stiff maybe a little wobbly yet but better she turned a bit more to study moiras tunic and rough pants we need to get you some clothes these do well enough maybe well go into town see what we can find i have nothing to trade i cant pay thats what visas for itll be my treat she lay flat closed her eyes again i didnt think anyone else was up larkins taken the horse for a run it should do both of them good i dont think he slept at all i doubt any of us did really it doesnt seem real does it not in the light of day with the sun showering down and the birds singing it seems more real to me moira said as she sat it shows what we have to lose i have a stone she continued brushing her hand through the grass i thought when larkin comes back we could go to where the graves are make one for king glenna kept her eyes closed but reached out a hand for moiras you have a good heart she told her yes well make a grave for king her injuries prevented her from training but it didnt stop glenna from working she spent the next two days preparing food shopping for supplies researching magic she took photographs more than busy work she told herself it was practical and organizational and the photos were would be a kind of documentation a kind of tribute most of all it helped keep her from feeling useless while the others worked up a sweat with swords and handtohand she learned the roads committing various routes to memory her driving skills were rusty so she honed them maneuvering the van on snaking roads skimming the hedgerows on turns zooming through roundabouts as her confidence built she pored through spell books searching for offense and defense for solutions she couldnt bring king back but she would do everything in her power to safeguard those who were left then she got the bright idea that every member of the team should be able to handle the van she started with hoyt she sat beside him as he drove the van at a creeping pace up and down the lane there are better uses for my time that may be and at this rate she thought theyd be a millennium before he got over five miles an hour but every one of us should be able to take the wheel if necessary why because do you plan to take this machine into battle not with you at the wheel practicalities hoyt im the only one who can drive during the day if something happens to me dont dont tempt the gods his hand closed over hers we have to factor it were here and where we are is remote we need transportation and well driving gives all of us a kind of independence as well as another skill we should be prepared for anything we could get more horses the wistfulness in his voice had her giving him a bolstering pat on the shoulder youre doing fine maybe you could try going just a little bit faster he shot forward spitting gravel from the tires glenna sucked in a breath and shouted brake brake brake more gravel flew when the van came to an abrupt halt heres a new word for your vocabulary she said pleasantly whiplash you said to go faster this is go he gestured toward the gas pedal yeah well okay she drew in a fresh breath theres the snail and theres the rabbit lets try to find the animal in between a dog say a nice healthy golden retriever dogs chase rabbits he pointed out and made her laugh thats good youve been sad ive missed your smile ill give you a big toothy one if we come through this lesson in one piece were going to take a big leap go out on the road she reached up and closed her hand briefly over the crystal shed hung from the rearview lets hope this works he did better than shed expected which meant no one was maimed or otherwise injured her heart got a serious workout from leaping into her throat then dropping hard into her belly but they stayed on the road for the most part she liked watching him calculate the turns his brows knit his eyes intense his long fingers gripping the wheel as though it were a lifeline in a stormtossed sea hedgerows closed them in green tunnels dotted with bloodred drops of fuchsia then the world would open up into rolling fields and the dots were white sheep or lazy spotted cows the city girl in her was enchanted another time she thought another world and she could have found a great deal to love about this place the play of light and shadows on the green the patchwork of fields the sudden sparkle of water the rise and tumble of rocks that formed ancient ruins it was good she decided to look beyond the house in the forest to look and love the world they were fighting to save when he slowed she glanced over you have to keep up your speed it can be as dangerous to go too slow as too fast which applies now that i think about it to pretty much anything i want to stop you need to pull over to the shoulder the side of the road put the signal on like i showed you and ease over she checked the road herself the shoulder was narrow but there was no traffic put it in park thats all the way up good so what she said when he pushed his door open she pulled off her seat belt grabbed the keys and her camera as an afterthought then hurried after him but he was already halfway across a field moving quickly toward what was left of an old stone tower if you wanted to stretch your legs or empty your bladder you just had to say so she began huffing a bit as she caught up to him the wind danced through her hair blowing it back from her face as she touched his arm she felt the muscles there gone rigid what is it i know this place people lived here there were children the oldest of my sisters married their second son his name is fearghus they farmed this land they they walked this land lived he moved inside to what she saw now must have been a small keep the roof was gone as was one of the walls the floor was grass and starry white flowers the dung of sheep and the wind blew through like ghosts chanting they had a daughter a pretty thing our families hoped we would he laid his hand against a wall left it there just stone now he said quietly gone to ruin but still here hoyt still here a part of it and you remembering them what were doing what we have to do wont it mean they had the very best chance to live a long full life to farm the land and walk it to live they came to my brothers wake he dropped his hand i dont know how to feel i cant imagine how hard this is for you every day of it hoyt she laid her hands on his arms waiting for his eyes to meet hers part of it stands what was yours it stands in whats mine i think that matters i think we need to find the hope in that the strength in it do you want some time here i can go back wait for you in the van no every time i falter or think i cant bear whats been asked of me youre there he bent plucked one of the little white flowers these grew in my time he twirled it once then tucked it into her hair so well carry hope yes we will here she lifted her camera its a place that cries for pictures and the lights gorgeous she moved off to choose her angles shed make him a present of one she decided something of her to take with him and shed make a copy of the same shot for her loft imagine him studying the photo while she studied hers each of them remembering standing there on a summer afternoon with wildflowers waving in a carpet of grass but the idea of it hurt more than it warmed so she turned the camera on him just look at me she told him you dont have to smile in fact she clicked the shutter nice very nice inspired she lowered the camera im going to set it up on timer take one of us together she looked around for something to set the camera on wished shed thought to bring a tripod well ill have to mix a little something in she framed him in man and stone and field air be still and heed my will solid now beneath my hand steady as rock upon the land hold here what i ask of thee as i will so mote it be she set the camera on the platter of air engaged the timer then dashed to hoyt just look at the camera she slipped an arm around his waist pleased when he mirrored the gesture and if you can manage a little smile one two she watched the light blink there we are for posterity he walked with her when she retrieved the camera how do you know how it will look when you take it out of the box i dont not a hundred percent i guess you could say its another kind of hope she looked back at the ruin do you need more time no time he thought there would never be enough of it we should go back theres other work to do did you love her glenna asked as they started back across the field who the girl the daughter of the family who lived here i didnt no a great disappointment that was to my mother but not i think to the girl i didnt look for a woman in that way for marriage and family it seemed it seemed to me that my gift my work required solitude wives require time and attention they do theoretically they also give it i wanted to be alone all of my life it seemed i never had enough of it the solitude and the quiet and now now im afraid i may always have too much that would be up to you she stopped to look back at the ruins a last time what will you tell them when you go back even saying it tore little pieces from her heart i dont know he took her hand so they stood together looking at what was imagining what had been i dont know what will you tell your people when this is done i think i probably wont tell them anything let them think as i told them when i called before i left that i took an impulsive trip to europe why should they have to live with the fear of what we know she said when he turned to her we know what goes bump in the night is real we know that now and its a burden so ill tell them i love them and leave it at that isnt that another kind of alone its one i can handle this time she got behind the wheel when he got in beside her he took one last look at the ruin and he thought without glenna the alone might swallow him whole chapter it plagued him the idea of going back to his world of dying in this one of never seeing his home again of living in it the rest of his life without the woman whod given new meaning to it if there was a war to be fought with sword and lance there was another raging inside him battering the heart hed never known could yearn for so much he watched her from the tower window as she took pictures of larkin and moira sparring or posed them in less combative stances her injuries had healed enough that she no longer moved stiffly or tired as quickly but he would always remember how shed looked on the ground bleeding her manner of dress no longer seemed strange to him but proper and so right for who she was the way she moved in the dark pants and white shirt her fiery hair pinned messily atop her head seemed the essence of grace to him in her face hed found beauty and life in her mind intelligence and curiosity and in her heart both compassion and valor in her he realized hed found everything he could want without ever knowing hed been lacking he had no right to her of course they had no right to each other beyond the time of the task if they lived if the worlds survived he would go back to his while she remained in hers even love couldnt span a thousand years love his heart ached at the word so that he pressed his hand to it this was love then the gnawing the burning the light and the dark not just warm flesh and murmurs in the candlelight but pain and awareness in the light of day in the depths of the night to feel so much for one person it eclipsed all else and it was terrifying he was no coward hoyt reminded himself he was a sorcerer by birth a warrior by circumstance he had held lightning in the palm of his hand and called the wind to launch it hed killed demons and twice had faced their queen surely he could face love love couldnt maim him or kill him or strip him of power what level of cowardice was it then for a man to shrink back from it he strode out of the room down the stairs moving with the rush of impulse he heard music as he passed his brothers door something low and brooding he knew it as the music of grief and knew too if his brother was stirring so might others of cians kind be stirring sunset was close he moved quickly through the house into the kitchen where something simmered on the stove and out the back larkin was amusing himself shimmering into a gold wolf while glenna called out her delight and moved around him with the little machine that took the pictures the camera he reminded himself he shaped back into a man and hefting his sword assumed a haughty pose you look better as the wolf moira told him he raised his sword in mock attack and chased after her their shouts and laughter were so opposed to his brothers music hoyt could only stand in wonder there was still laughter in the world still time and need for play and fun there was still light even as the darkness crept closer glenna she turned the humor still dancing in her eyes oh perfect stand right there just there with the house behind you i want to ssh im going to lose the light soon yes yes just like that all aloof and annoyed its wonderful i wish there was time to go back in and get your cloak you were made to wear one she changed angles crouched down shot up at him no dont look at me look off over my head think deep thoughts look into the trees wherever it is i look i still see nothing but you she lowered her camera for a moment with pleasure blooming in her cheeks youre just trying to distract me give me that hoyt look just for a minute off into the trees the serious sorcerer i want to speak with you two minutes she changed angles kept shooting then straightened i want a prop she muttered and studied the weapons on the table glenna would you go back with me two minutes she repeated debating between long sword and dagger i need to go in and check the soup anyway i dont mean back into the bloody kitchen will you go with me she glanced over automatically lifting her camera framing his face and capturing the intensity of it a good meal she thought another solid nights sleep and shed be ready for full training by the next morning where home to my home what she lowered the camera felt her heart do a quick hard jump what when this is done he kept his eyes on hers as he closed the distance between them will you come with me will you be with me belong to me back with you to the twelfth century yes slowly carefully she set the camera down why do you want me because all i see is you all i want is you i think if i have to live five minutes in a world without you in it it would be eternity i cant face eternity without seeing your face he brushed his fingers over her cheek without hearing your voice without touching you i think if i was sent here to fight this war i was sent here to find you as well not just to fight with me to open me glenna he gathered her hands in his brought them to his lips in all this fear and grief and loss i see you she kept her eyes on his as he spoke searching when the words were done she touched a hand to his heart theres so much in there she said quietly so much and im so lucky to be part of it ill go with you ill go with you anywhere the joy of it spread inside him warmed as he touched his fingertips to her cheek again you would give up your world all you know why because ive thought of living five minutes without you and even that was eternity i love you she saw his eyes change those are the strongest words in any magic i love you with that incantation i already belong to you once i speak it its alive nothing can ever kill it now he framed her face would you have me if i stayed here with you but you said would you have me glenna yes of course yes then well see which world is ours when this is done wherever whenever it is i will love you in it you he touched his lips to hers and only you hoyt her arms came hard around him if we have this we can do anything i havent said it yet she laughed rained kisses over his cheeks close enough wait he drew her back just an inch those vivid blue eyes locked with hers i love you a single beam of light shot out of the sky washed over them centered them in a circle of white so its done he murmured through this life and all the ones to come im yours and youre mine all that i am glenna all that ill be i pledge that to you she held close again pressed her cheek to his whatever happens this is ours she tipped back her head so their lips could meet i knew it would be you she said softly from the moment i walked into your dream they held each other in the circle of light held close while it bathed them when it faded and twilight oozed over the day they gathered the rest of the weapons and took them into the house together cian watched them from his bedroom window love had flashed and shimmered around them in a light that had all but burned his skin seared his eyes and it had pressed against a heart that hadnt beat in nearly a thousand years so his brother had fallen he thought for the single blow against which there was no shield now they would live their short and painful lives within that light perhaps it would be worth it then he stepped back into the shadows of his room and the cool dark when he came down it was full dark and she was in the kitchen alone singing at the sink cian noted in an absent and happy voice the sort he decided that a fanciful person would say had little pink hearts spilling out from between her lips with the tune she was loading the dishwasher a homey chore and the kitchen smelled of herbs and flowers her hair was bundled up and now and then her hips moved with the rhythm of the song would he have had a woman like that if hed lived he wondered one whod sing in the kitchen or stand in the light looking at him with her face alive with love hed had women of course scores of them and some had loved him to their loss he supposed but if their faces had been alive with that love those faces were a blur to him now and love was a choice he had eliminated from his life or had told himself he had but the fact was he had loved king as a father does a son or a brother a brother the little queen had been right about that and damn her for it he had given his love and his trust to a human and as humans were wont to do it had died on him saving this one he thought now as glenna set dishes in the rack another thing humans had a habit of doing was sacrificing themselves for other humans it was or had been a trait that had intrigued him often enough easier to understand in his circumstances their habit on the other side of the coin of killing each other then she turned and jolted the dish she held slipped out of her hands and shattered on the tiles god im sorry you startled me she moved quickly and jerkily he noted for a woman of easy grace she took the broom and dustpan from the closet and began to sweep the shards he hadnt spoken to her nor to any of the others since the night of kings death hed left them to train themselves or do as they pleased i didnt hear you come in the others finished dinner they they went up to do some training i had hoyt out for an hour or so today um driving lesson i thought she dumped the shards turned again oh god say something even if you live youre from two different worlds how will you resolve it did hoyt speak to you he didnt have to i have eyes i dont know how well resolve it she put the broom away well find a way does it matter to you not in the least its of interest to me he got a bottle of wine from the counter rack studied the label ive lived among you for a considerable amount of time without interest id have died of boredom long ago she steadied herself loving each other makes us stronger i believe that we need to be stronger so far we havent done very well he opened the wine got down a glass no you havent done very well particularly cian she said as he turned to go i know you blame me for king you have every right to to blame me and to hate me for it but if we dont find a way to work together to mesh he wont just be the only one of us to die hell just be the first i beat him to that by a few hundred years he tipped the glass toward her in a kind of salute then walked out with the bottle well that was useless glenna muttered and turned back to finish the dishes he would hate her she thought and likely hate hoyt as well because hoyt loved her their team was fractured even before it had a genuine chance to become a unit if they had time nothing but time she would let it lie wait until cians resentment cooled began to fade but they didnt have that luxury of wasting any more of the precious little time theyd been given shed have to find a way to work around it or him she dried her hands flung the cloth down there was a thump outside the back door as if something heavy had fallen instinctively she stepped back reached for the sword braced against the counter and one of the stakes lying on it they cant get in she whispered and even the whisper shook if they want to spy on me while im cleaning up the kitchen so what but she wished she and hoyt had had better luck devising a spell to create a protected area around the house still she couldnt let it frighten her wouldnt let it she certainly wasnt going to open the door again to have a chat with something that wanted to rip her throat out but there came a kind of scratching low on the door and a moan and the hand gripping the sword went damp with sweat help me please the voice was weak barely audible through the wood but she thought let me in glenna glenna in the name of god let me in before they come king the sword clattered on the floor as she leaped toward the door still she held the stake in a firm grip fool me once she thought and kept well out of reach as she opened the door he lay on the stones just outside his clothes bloody and torn more blood had dried on the side of his face and his breathing was a thin wheeze alive was all she could think she started to crouch down pull him inside but cian was beside her he shoved her aside lowered down himself laid a hand on kings battered cheek we need to get him in hurry cian ive got things that can help theyre close tracking me he groped blindly for cians hand i didnt think id make it you have come inside now he gripped king under the arms dragged him into the kitchen how did you get away dont know king sprawled on the floor eyes closed missed the rocks thought id drown but i got out got out of the water hurt pretty bad passed out dont know how long walked walked all day hid at night they come at night let me see what i can do for him glenna began close the door cian told her did everybody make it did everybody thirsty aye i know cian gripped his hand looked into his eyes i know well start with this glenna mixed something briskly in a cup cian if youd go get the others i could use hoyt and moira well want to get king into bed make him comfortable she bent to him as she spoke and the cross around her neck dangled down swung toward kings face he hissed like a snake bared fangs and skuddled back then to glennas horror he got to his feet and grinned you never told me how it felt he said to cian words fall short it needs to be experienced no glenna could only shake her head oh god no you couldve taken me here a long time ago but im glad you didnt im glad it was now when im in my prime king circled around as he spoke blocking the door out of the kitchen they hurt me first lilith she knows amazing ways to give pain you know you dont stand a chance against her im sorry glenna whispered im sorry dont be she said i could have you eat you or change you my choice you dont want to hurt me king oh yes he does cian said easily he wants the pain in you nearly as much as he wants your blood in his throat its how hes made had she already given you the gift before they threw you off the cliff no i was hurt though hurt bad could hardly stand they had a rope around me when they tossed me off if i lived shed give me the gift i lived shell take you back he said to cian yes i know she will glenna looked from one to the other trapped she realized between them hed known she saw that now cian had known what king was before hed let him in the house dont do this how can you do this to your brother i cant have him king told cian neither can you she wants hoyt herself she wants to drink him the sorcerer with his blood shell ascend even higher every world there is will be ours the sword was too far away and she no longer had the stake she had nothing were to take hoyt and the other female to her alive this one and the boy theyre ours if we want them i havent drunk human blood for a very long time cian reached over trailed a fingertip down the nape of glennas neck this one id think would be heady king licked his lips we can share her yes why not he tightened his grip on glenna and when she fought when she sucked in her breath he laughed oh aye scream for help bring the others on down to save you itll save us the trip up rot in hell im sorry for what happened to you she said to king as he moved toward her sorry for any part i played in it but i wont make it easy for you she used cian as a brace swung up her legs and kicked out she knocked king back a few steps but he only laughed and moved toward her again they let them run in the caves so we can chase them i like when they run when they scream i wont scream she rammed back with her elbows kicked out again she heard the rush of footsteps and thought only no so screamed after all as she kicked and struggled the cross i cant get past the fucking cross knock her out king demanded get it off her im hungry ill fix it he tossed glenna aside as the others rushed into the room and looking into kings eyes drove the stake hed had at his back into his friends heart its all i could do for you he told him and tossed the stake aside king not king moira dropped to her knees beside the dust then she laid her hands on it spoke in a voice choked with tears let what he was the soul of him and the heart be welcomed in a world again the demon that took him is dead let him have light to find his way back you wont raise a man from a pile of ash she looked up at cian no but maybe free his soul so it can be reborn you didnt kill your friend cian no lilith did i thought glenna still shook as hoyt helped her to her feet i know what you thought why shouldnt you because i should have trusted you ive said we arent a unit but i didnt understand im as much to blame for that as any i didnt trust you i thought youd kill me but you chose to save me youre wrong i chose to save him cian she stepped toward him i caused this i cant you didnt no you didnt kill him you didnt change him lilith did and sent him here to die once more he was new and not yet used to his skin injured as well he couldnt have taken all of us and she knew it she knew what you would do hoyt moved to his brothers side laid a hand on his shoulder and what it would cost you in her way she couldnt lose so shed think i dont kill him he takes at least one of you maybe the lot if i turn if i go the other way destroy him it costs me oh quite a bit quite a lot indeed the death of a friend larkin began is a hard death we all feel it i believe you do he looked down to where moira still knelt on the floor but it comes to me first because he was mine first she did this to him not because of you he said to glenna but because of me i couldve blamed you and did if shed just killed him clean but for this its not yours its hers and its mine he walked over to pick up the stake he used studied the killing point and when it comes time when we face her shes mine if any of you step up to do the killing blow ill stop you so you see she miscalculated i owe her for this and ill give her death for it now he picked up the sword we train tonight she trained going oneonone with larkin sword to sword cian had paired moira with hoyt and stood back or moved around them as steel clashed he called out insults which glenna assumed was his style of motivation her arm ached and her still tender ribs throbbed while sweat dribbled down her back into her eyes she continued to push the pain the effort helped block out the image of king in the kitchen moving toward her with fangs ready keep your arm up cian shouted at her if you cant hold a shagging sword properly you wont last five minutes and stop dancing with her for christs sake larkin this isnt a bloody nightclub she isnt fully healed larkin snapped back and what the hells a nightclub i need to stop moira lowered her sword wiped her sweaty brow with the back of her free hand rest for a moment you dont cian spun toward her do you think youre doing her a favor asking to rest do you think theyll be agreeable to a bloody time out just because your pal here needs to catch her breath im fine theres no need to snap at her glenna struggled to catch her breath to will some strength back into her legs im fine stop holding back she told larkin i dont need to be coddled she needs to be looked at hoyt gestured larkin back its too soon for her to train like this that isnt for you to say cian pointed out i am saying it shes exhausted and shes in pain and thats enough i said im fine and can speak for myself which though he enjoys being a bastard is what your brother pointed out i dont need or want you to speak for me then youll have to grow accustomed to it because so i will when you need it i know what i need and when i need it maybe the two of you will just talk the enemy to death cian said dryly out of patience glenna thrust at cian with her sword come on come on then you and me you wont hold back no he tapped his blade to hers i wont i said enough hoyt slashed his sword between them and his fury sent a ripple of fire down the steel which one of us would you like to take on now cians tone was like silk and his eyes darkened with a dangerous pleasure when hoyt pivoted toward him should be interesting larkin said but his cousin stepped in wait she said just wait were upset all of us tired out and overheated like horses at too long a gallop on top of it it serves no purpose to hurt each other if we wont rest then at least lets have the doors open have some air you want the doors open everything about him suddenly genial cian cocked his head a bit of airs what youre wanting sure well have ourselves some fresh air he strode to the terrace doors threw them open then in a move fast as a fingersnap reached out into the dark come in wont you he said and yanked a pair of vampires through the doorway plenty to eat here he wandered to the table as both of them leaped up drew swords with the tip of his own he speared an apple from the bowl then leaned back against the wall plucking it off to have a bite lets see what you can do with them he suggested its two against one after all you may just have a shot at surviving hoyt pivoted instinctively putting glenna behind him larkin was already moving in flashing his sword his opponent blocked the slash easily punched out with its free hand and sent larkin flying halfway across the room it turned rushed moira the first strike hit her sword and the force knocked her down sent her skidding over the floor she groped desperately for her stake as it flew seemed to fly through the air toward her glenna buried her terror dug out her fury she shot her power out the first learned the last lost and brought the fire the vampire burst into flames midair nicely done red cian commented and watched his brother battle for his life help him help me why dont you theyre too close to risk the fire try this he tossed her a stake took another bite of apple she didnt think couldnt think as she ran forward as she plunged the stake into the back of the vampire whod beaten hoyt to his knees and missed the heart it howled but there seemed to be more pleasure than pain in it it turned lifted its sword high both moira and larkin charged but glenna saw her death they were too far away and she had nothing left then hoyt sliced his sword through its neck blood splattered her face before there was dust fairly pitiful but effective enough all in all cian wiped his hands now pair off playtimes over you knew they were out there moiras hand still holding the stake trembled you knew well of course i knew they were out there if youd use your brains or at least some of your senses youd have known it as well youd have let them kill us more to the point you nearly let them kill you you he gestured at moira stood there letting the fear soak you scent you you and now larkin you charged in without using your head and nearly lost it for the trouble as for you he said to hoyt protecting the womenfolk may be chivalrous but youll both die with your honor intact of course while red at least used her head initially and the power your bloody gods gave her she then fell apart and stood meekly waiting to be dead he stepped forward so well work on your weaknesses which are legion ive had enough glennas voice was hardly more than a whisper enough of blood and death enough for one night enough she dropped the stake and walked out leave her be cian waved a hand when hoyt turned to follow for christs sake an ounce of brain would tell you she wants only her own company and a strong dramatic exit like that deserves to stand let her have it hes right moira spoke quickly as much as it pains me to say it she needs the quiet she walked over to pick up the sword that had been knocked out of her hand weaknesses she nodded her head faced cian very well then show me chapter hoyt expected to find her in bed when he came in hed hoped shed be sleeping so that he could put her under more deeply and work on her injuries but she was standing by the window in the dark dont turn on the light she said with her back to him cian was right there are more outside still if you pay attention you can sense them they move like shadows but theres movement more a sense of movement theyll go soon i think to whatever hole they burrow in during the day you should rest i know you say that because youre concerned and im calm enough now not to take your head off for it i know i behaved poorly upstairs i dont really care youre tired as i am i want to wash and i want to sleep you have your own room and that was uncalled for she continued before he could speak now she turned her face seemed very pale in the dark pale against the dark robe she wore im not as calm as i thought you had no right no right to stand in front of me up there every right love gives me the right and even without that if a man doesnt shield a woman from harm stop right there she held up a hand palm out as if to block his words this isnt about men and women its about humans the seconds you took to think of me to worry for me could have cost you your life we cant spare it neither of us any of us if you dont trust that i can defend myself that all of us can were nowhere that her words made sense didnt matter a whit as far as he was concerned he could still see the way that monster had leaped on her and where would you be if i hadnt destroyed that thing different a different matter she moved closer now so that he could scent her the lotions she used on her skin so utterly female this is foolishness and a waste of time its not foolish to me so listen up fighting with and protecting fellow soldiers is one thing a vital thing we all have to be able to count on each other but to brush me back from battle is another you have to understand and accept the difference how can i when its you glenna if i lost you hoyt she gripped his arms a kind of impatient comfort any or all of us might die in this im fighting to understand and accept that but if you die i wont live with the responsibility of knowing it was for me i wont do it she sat on the side of the bed i killed tonight i know how it feels to end something to use my power to do that something i never thought id do need to do she held out her hands to study them i did it to save another human being and still it weighs on me i know that if id done it with stake or sword id accept it more easily but i used magic to destroy she lifted her face to his and the sorrow was deep in her eyes this gift was always so bright and now theres a darkness in it i have to understand and accept that too and you have to let me i accept your power glenna and what you can and will do with it i think all of us would be better served by it if you worked solely on the magicks and left the bloody work to you off the front line out of harms way stirring my cauldron twice this night i nearly lost you so youll do as i say it took a moment to find her voice well in a pigs eye twice this night i faced death and i survived well discuss this further tomorrow oh no oh no we wont she flicked out a hand slammed the door to the bathroom inches before he reached it he whirled back a man obviously at the end of his tether dont slap your power out at me dont slap your manhood out at me and that didnt come out the way i meant it because there was laughter tickling the back of her throat right along with the temper she took a breath i wont snap to hoyt when you order it any more than i expect you will for me you were frightened for me and oh boy do i understand that because i was frightened for me and for you for all of us but we have to get past it how he demanded how is that done this love is new for me this need and this terror that goes with it when we were called for this i thought it would be the hardest thing id ever done but i was wrong loving you is harder loving you and knowing i could lose you all of her life she thought shed waited to be loved like this what human didnt i never knew i could feel so completely for anyone this is new for me too hard and scary and new and i wish i could say you wont lose me i wish i could but i know the stronger i am the better chance i have of staying alive the stronger each one of us is the better chance we have of surviving this of winning she stood again i looked at king tonight a man id come to like quite a lot i looked at what theyd made of him what they made of him wanted my blood my death would have rejoiced in it seeing that knowing that hurt beyond the believing of it he was a friend he became a friend so quickly her voice trembled so that she had to turn away move back to the window and the dark there was a part of me even as i tried to save myself that saw what he had been the man whod cooked with me sat with me laughed with me i couldnt use my powers against him couldnt pull it out of me to do that if cian hadnt she turned back now straight and slim i wont be weak again i wont hesitate a second time you have to trust me for that you called out for me to run would you say that was putting yourself in front of me in battle she opened her mouth closed it again cleared her throat seemed like the thing to do at the time all right all right point made and taken well both work on it and ive some ideas on weaponry that might be helpful but before we put this and ourselves to bed i want to cover one more thing i dont find myself at all surprised fighting with your brother over me isnt something i appreciate or consider flattering it wasnt only about you i know that but i was the catalyst and im going to have a word with moira about it too of course her idea of distracting cian from us changed the entire scope of things it was madness for him to bring those things into the house his own temper and arrogance could have cost us lives no she spoke quietly now and with absolute certainty he was right to do it stunned he gaped at her how can you say so how can you defend him he made a very big and illuminating point one we wont be able to forget we wont always know when theyll come and we have to be ready to kill or be killed every minute every day we werent not really even after king we werent if thered been more of them the odds more even it mightve been a very different story he stood by did nothing yes he did another point hes the strongest of us and the smartest in these circumstances its up to us to work toward closing that gap i have some ideas at least for the two of us she came to him rising on her toes to brush her lips over his cheek go ahead wash up i want to sleep on it i want to sleep with you she dreamed of the goddess of walking through a world of gardens where birds were bright as the flowers and the flowers like jewels from a high black cliff water the color of liquid sapphire tumbled down to strike a pool clear as glass where gold and ruby fish darted the air was warm and heavy with fragrance beyond the gardens was a silver sickle of beach where the turquoise water lapped its edges gently as a lover there were children building sparkling castles of sand or splashing in the foamy surf their laughter carried on the air like the birdsong rising from the beach were steps of shimmering white with diamonds of ruby red along their edges high above them were houses painted in dreamy pastels skirted with yet more flowers with trees that dripped blossoms she could hear music drifting down from the tall hill the harps and flutes singing of joy where are we there are many worlds morrigan told her as they walked this is just another i thought you should see that you fight for more than yours or his or the world of your friends its beautiful it feels happy some are some are not some demand a hard life full of pain and effort but it is still life this world is old the goddess said her robes flowing as she opened her arms it earned this beauty this peace through that pain and that effort you could stop whats coming stop her her bright hair dancing in the wind she turned to glenna i have done what i can to stop it i have chosen you its not enough already weve lost one of us he was a good man many are is this how fate and destiny work the higher powers so coldly the higher powers bring laughter to those children they bring the flowers and the sun love and pleasures and yes death and pain it must be so why morrigan turned smiled or it would all mean so little you are a gifted child but the gift has weight i used that gift to destroy all of my life ive believed been taught i knew what i had what i was could never harm but i used it to harm morrigan touched glennas hair this is the weight and it must be carried you were charged to strike at evil with it i wont be the same again glenna stated looking out to sea no not the same and youre not ready none of you youre not yet whole we lost king he isnt lost hes only moved to a different world were not gods and we grieve for the death of a friend the cruelty of it there will be more death more grieving glenna closed her eyes it was harder even harder to speak of death when she looked at such beauty were just full of good news today i want to go back yes you should be there shell bring blood and another kind of power who will fear had glenna jerking back lilith is she coming look there morrigan pointed to the west when the lightning strikes the sky went black and the lightning arrowed out of the sky to strike the heart of the sea when she whimpered turned hoyts arms came around her its dark nearly dawn he touched his lips to her hair a storms coming shes coming with it did you dream morrigan took me she pressed closer he was warm he was real some place beautiful perfect and beautiful then the dark came and the lightning struck the water i heard them growling in the dark youre here now safe none of us are her mouth lifted met his desperately hoyt she rose above him slim and fragrant white skin against pearled shadows she took his hands pressed them to her breasts felt his fingers cup her real and warm as her heartbeat quickened the candles around the room began to flicker in the hearth the fire woke to simmer theres a power in us she lowered to him her lips racing over his face down his throat see it feel it what we make together life was all she could think here was life hot and human here was a power that could strike back the icy fingers of death she rose up again taking him into her strong and deep then bowing back as the thrill washed through her like wine he wrapped around her coming to her so his mouth could take her breast so he could taste the pounding of her heart life he thought as well here was life all that i am already breathless he feasted on her this is more from the first moment for the rest of time she took his face watched herself in his eyes in any world in all of them it poured through her so fast so hot she cried out dawn broke quietly while their passion raged its the fire glenna told him they were in the tower sitting over coffee and scones she had the door firmly locked and had added a charm to make certain no one and nothing entered until she was finished its exciting his eyes were still sleepy his body relaxed sex glenna thought could work wonders she was feeling pretty damn good herself wakeup sex agrees with you but im not talking about that kind of fire or not exclusively fires a weapon a big one against what were fighting you killed one with it last night he poured more coffee he was he realized developing quite a taste for it effective and quick but also a little unpredictable yes if the aims off or one of our own is too close or steps or is shoved in the line it would be extremely tragic but she tapped her fingers against her cup we learn to control it to channel it thats what we do after all practice practice and more we can use it to enhance the other weapons the way you did last night with the fire on the sword im sorry the fire on your sword when you clashed with cian she lifted her eyebrows at his blank expression you didnt call it it just came passion in that case anger passion when were making love a flame shot down your sword last night just for an instant a flaming sword she pushed up from the table to pace around the room we havent been able to do anything about creating a protected zone around the house we may yet find the way tricky since we have a vampire on the premises we cant set down a spell to repel vampires without repelling cian but yes in time if we have the time we may find a way around that in the meantime the fires not only effective its beautifully symbolic and you bet your gorgeous ass itll put the fear of the gods into the enemy fire takes focus and concentration a little difficult when youre fighting for your life well work on it until it isnt so difficult you wanted me to work more on magic and in this case im willing its time to make ourselves a serious arsenal she came back sat on the table when its time to take this war to geall were going loaded she spent the day at it with him and without him she buried herself in her own books and the ones she dragged up from cians library when the sun set she lit candles for work light and ignored cians banging on the door she closed her ears to his curses and his shouts that it was bloody well time for training she was training and shed come out when she was damn good and ready the woman was young and fresh and very very alone lora watched from the shadows gleefully pleased with her luck to think shed been annoyed when lilith had sent her out with a trio of foot soldiers on a simple scouting mission shed wanted to hit one of the outlying pubs have some fun have a feast how long did lilith expect them to keep to the caves lying low picking off the occasional tourist the most fun shed had in weeks had been smacking that witch around and stealing the black man right from under the noses of that tedious holy brigade she wished they could have based somewhere anywhere but in this dreary place somewhere like paris or prague somewhere so full of people she could pluck them like plums somewhere full of sound and heartbeats and the smell of flesh she would swear there were more cows and sheep than people in this stupid country it was boring but now there was this interesting possibility so pretty so unfortunate this one would be a good candidate for the change as well as a quick snack it would be fun to have a new companion a woman particularly one she could train and play with a new toy she decided to stave off this endless ennui at least until the real fun began where she wondered had the pretty thing been going after dark in her little car such bad luck to have a puncture on this quiet country road nice coat too lora thought as she watched the woman haul out the jack and spare they were close enough to the same size that she could have the coat as well as what was in it all that lovely warm blood bring her to me she gestured at the three who stood with her lilith said we werent to feed until she whirled fangs glinting eyes burning red and the vampire whod once been a man of two hundred and twenty pounds of muscle when alive backed off hurriedly you question me no she was here after all and he could smell her hunger lilith was not bring her to me lora repeated tapping him on the chest then wagging that finger playfully in front of his face and no tasting i want her alive its time i had a new playmate her lips moved over her fangs in a pretty pout and try not to damage the coat i like it they moved out of the shadows and onto the road three males whod been ordinary in life they scented human and female their hunger always waiting woke and only the fear of loras reprisal prevented them from charging like wolves she glanced over as they approached she smiled quick and friendly as she straightened from her crouch at the side of the car and raked a hand through short dark hair that left her throat and neck exposed in the gloomy light i was hoping someone would come along must be your lucky night the one lora had chastised grinned ill say dark deserted road like this middle of nowhere whew its a little scary it can get scarier they spread out in a triangle to close her in with the car at her back she took a step back eyes going wide and they growled low in the throat oh god are you going to hurt me i dont have much money but moneys not what were after but well take that too she still held the tire iron and when she lifted it the one closest to her laughed stay back just keep away from me metals not a big problem for us he charged toward her hands lifted toward her throat and exploded into dust no but the pointy end of this is she wagged the stake shed held behind her back she lunged kicking one aside with a flashing foot to the belly blocking a blow with her forearm then leading with the stake she let the last one come to her let the momentum of his rage and hunger rush him forward she swung the tire iron full at his face she was on him in an instant when he landed on the road metals a little problem after all she said but well finish up with this she staked him rose dusted off her coat damn vampires she started back to her car then stopped her head lifting like a dog scenting the air she spread her legs shifted her grip on the tire iron on the stake dont you want to come out and play she called out i can smell you out there these three didnt give me much action and im revved the scent began to fade in moments the air was clear again she watched and waited then with a shrug hooked the stake into the sheath on her belt when she finished changing the tire she glanced up at the sky clouds had rolled over the moon and in the west thunder grumbled storms coming she murmured in the training room hoyt landed hard on his back he felt every bone in his body rattle larkin pounced then brought the blunted stake down to tap hoyts heart ive killed you six times already tonight youre off your game he cursed lightly when he felt the blade at his throat moira eased it back then leaned over him to give him an upside down smile hed be dust thats certain but youd be bleeding all over whats left well if youre going to come at a man from behind they will cian reminded him giving moira one of his rare nods of approval and more than one you make your kill you move on quick fast and in a bloody hurry he vised his hands on moiras head feigned giving it a twist now the three of you are dead because you spend too much time talking you need to handle multiple opponents whether its sword stake or bare hands hoyt stood shook himself off why dont you demonstrate for us cian lifted his brows at the irritable challenge all right then all of you on me ill try not to hurt you more than is necessary bragging that would be talking wouldnt it larkin crouched into a fighting stance it would be in this case stating the obvious he picked up the blunted stake tossed it to moira what you want to do here is anticipate each others moves as well as mine then so you decided to join the party ive been working on something making progress glenna touched the hilt of the dagger shed strapped to her waist i needed to step away from it awhile whats the drill here were going to kick cians arse larkin told her oh ill play weapons your choice cian nodded toward the dagger you seem to have yours no not for this she moved over selected another blunted stake rules in answer cian shot over flipped larkin and sent him tumbling to a pad win thats the only rule when hoyt moved on him cian took the blow let the momentum of it carry him into the air he kicked off the wall revolved and used his body to knock hoyt into moira and took them both down anticipate he repeated and kicked back almost idly to send larkin into the air glenna grabbed a cross held it out as she stepped forward ah smart his eyes went red just at the rims outside the doors thunder began to grumble shield and weapon put the enemy in retreat except he lashed out forearm to forearm and knocked the cross away but when he spun to dispatch the stake glenna dived going under him now this ones clever cian nodded approval and for a moment his face was illuminated by a ripple of lightning against the glass she uses her head her instincts at least when the stakes haha are low they circled him now which he considered a small improvement in their strategy not quite a team not yet an oiled machine but an improvement as they closed in he could see the need to pounce in larkins eyes cian chose what he considered the weakest link pivoted and using one hand simply lifted moira off her feet when he tossed her larkin instinctively shifted to catch her all cian needed to do was sweep out a leg take larkin off his feet and both of them went down in a tangle of limbs he spun to block his brother gripped hoyts shirt the solid head butt had hoyt stumbling back giving cian the instant he needed to wrench the stake from glenna he had her back against him his arm hooked tight around her neck what now he asked the rest of them ive got your girl here do you back off leave her to me do you come in risk me snapping her in half its a problem or do they let me take care of myself glenna gripped the chain around her neck swung the cross back toward cians face he released her vaulted clear to the ceiling he clung there a moment a dangerous fly then dropped lightly to his feet not bad and still the four of you have yet to put me down and if i were to there was a burst of lightning as his hand shot out snatched the flying stake an inch from his own heart the end was honed to a killing point wed call that cheating he said mildly back away from him they turned to see the woman step through the terrace doors as another flash of lightning ripped the sky behind her she was slim in a black leather coat that hit her at the knees her dark hair was cut short showcasing a high forehead and enormous eyes of vivid blue she dumped the large sack she carried on the floor and with another stake in one hand a twoedged knife in the other she moved farther into the light who the hell are you larkin demanded murphy blair murphy and ill be saving your lives tonight how the helld you let one of them in the house it happens i own it cian told her this is my place nice your heirs should be celebrating really soon i said keep back from him she snapped as both larkin and hoyt moved in front of cian id be his heir as this is my brother hes one of us larkin said no hes really not but he is moira held up her hands to show they were empty and moved slowly toward the intruder we cant let you hurt him looked to me like you were doing a pisspoor job of trying to hurt him when i came in we were training hes chosen to help us a vampire helping humans those big eyes narrowed in interest and what might have been humor well theres always something new slowly blair lowered the stake cian pushed his shields aside what are you doing here how did you come here how aer lingus what killing as many of your kind as i can manage present company temporarily excluded how do you know about his kind larkin asked her long story she paused to scan the room eyebrows lifting thoughtfully at the stockpile of weapons nice stash theres something about a battleax that warms my heart morrigan morrigan said shed come with the lightning glenna touched a hand to hoyts arm then walked to blair morrigan sent you she said thered be five she didnt mention any undead in the crew after a moment she sheathed the knife tucked the stake into her belt but thats a god for you just gotta be cryptic look its been a long trip she picked up her bag slung the strap over her shoulder got anything to eat around here chapter we have a lot of questions blair nodded at glenna as she sampled stew bet you do and right back at you this is good she took another spoonful thanks and compliments to the chef and all that youre welcome im going to start if thats okay glenna scanned the faces of the rest of the group where did you come from lately chicago the chicago in the here and now a smile tugged at blairs wide mouth she reached for the hunk of bread glenna had set out ripped it in two with nails painted a deep candy pink thats the one in the heartland planet earth you new york this is moira and her cousin larkin theyre from geall get out blair studied them as she ate i always figured that for a myth you dont seem particularly surprised its not nothing much surprises me less now after the visit from the goddess heavy stuff this is hoyt hes a sorcerer from ireland twelfthcentury ireland blair watched as glenna reached behind her for hoyts hand the way their fingers smoothly intertwined you two paired up you could say that now she lifted her wine took a small sip thats taking going for older men to a new level but who could blame you your host is his brother cian who was made a vampire twelfth century blair leaned back took a good long look at him with all the interest but none of the amusement shed shown when studying hoyt youve got nearly a thousand years ive never met a vamp who lasted that long the oldest i ever came across was a couple decades shy of five hundred clean living cian said yeah thatll be the day he doesnt drink humans since it was there larkin got another bowl spooned up stew for himself he fights with us were an army an army talk about delusions of grandeur what are you she asked glenna witch so weve got a witch a sorcerer a couple of refugees from geall and a vampire some army a powerful witch hoyt spoke for the first time a scholar of remarkable skill and courage a shapeshifter and a centuriesold vampyre who was made by the reining queen lilith now blair set down her spoon she made you cian leaned back against the counter crossed his ankles i was young and foolish and had really bad luck what are you larkin demanded me demon hunter she picked up her spoon to resume eating ive spent most of my life tracking and dusting his kind glenna angled her head what like buffy with a laugh blair swallowed stew no first im not the only just the best there are more of you at that point larkin decided he could use some wine as well its a family thing has been for centuries not all of us but every generation one or two more of us my fathers one and my aunt his uncle was and like that i have two cousins on the job now we fight the fight and morrigan sent you here glenna put in only you id have to say yes since im the only one here okay so the last couple of weeks things have been weird more undead activity than usual like theyre getting some brass ones and im having these dreams portentous dreams go with the package but im having them every time i close my eyes and sometimes when im wide awake disturbing lilith glenna asked she made some appearances cameos well say up till then i figured she was another myth anyway in the dream i thought i was over here ireland it looked like here anyway ive been to ireland before another family tradition but im on this rise barren place rough ground deep chasms wicked rocks the valley of silence moira interrupted thats what she called it morrigan she said i was needed blair hesitated looked around i probably dont have to fill in all the details since youre all here big battle possible apocalypse vampire queen forming an army to eliminate humankind there would be five waiting for me gathered together wed have until samhain to prepare not a lot of time considering you know goddess eternity but thats how its laid out so you came glenna said just like that didnt you blair shrugged i was born for this ive dreamed of that place before as long as i can remember me standing on that rise watching it rage below the moon the fog the screams i always knew id end up there always assumed she would die there i just expected a little more backup in three weeks weve killed more than a dozen larkin said with some annoyance good for you i dont keep a tally of kills since i had my first thirteen years ago but i took out three tonight on the road on the way here three he held up his spoon alone there was another it stayed back chasing it down didnt seem like a good way to stay alive which is the first rule in the family handbook there might have been more of them but i only scented the one youve got more stationed around the perimeter of this place i had to slip through them to get inside she pushed her empty bowl away that was really good thanks again youre welcome again glenna took the bowl to the sink hoyt can i have a word with you excuse us just for a minute she drew him out of the kitchen toward the front of the house hoyt shes the warrior he finished yes shes the last of the six it was never king she pressed her fingers to her mouth as she turned away he was never one of the six and what happened to him happened hoyt took her shoulders turned her to face him cant be changed shes the warrior and completes the circle we have to trust her i dont know how we begin to do that she damned near killed your brother before she bothered to say hello and we have only her word shes who she says she is well shes not a vampire she walked right into the house added to that cian would know vampyres can have human servants so how do we know do we take what she says she is on faith if she is what she says shes the last of us we have to be sure its not like we can check her id he shook his head not bothering to ask her meaning she has to be tested upstairs i think in the tower well make the circle and well be sure when they were gathered upstairs blair looked around close quarters i like things roomier youre going to want to keep your distance she warned cian i might stake you just kneejerk you can try she tapped her fingers on the stake in her belt there was a ring a ridged band of silver on her right thumb so whats all this about we had no sign you were coming glenna began not you specifically so youre thinking trojan horse its a possibility we cant dismiss without proof no blair agreed youd be stupid just to take my word and i feel better actually knowing youre not stupid what do you want my demon hunters license you actually have no she planted her feet very like a warrior bracing for battle but if youre toying with doing some kind of witchcraft that involves my blood or other bodily fluid youre out of luck line drawn on that nothing like that well witchcraft but nothing that requires blood were linked the five of us by fate by necessity and some yes by blood we are the circle we are the chosen if youre the last link of that circle well know otherwise we cant harm you hoyt laid a hand on glennas shoulder its against all we are to use power against a human being blair glanced toward the broadsword leaning against the tower wall anything in the rule book about sharp pointy objects we wont harm you if youre liliths servant well make you our prisoner she smiled one corner of her mouth rising then the other good luck with that all right lets do it like i said if youd swallowed everything without a hmmm id be more worried about what id walked into here you guys around this white circle me in it you know witchcraft glenna asked her i know something about it she stepped into the circle one of us at each point glenna instructed to form a pentagram hoyt will do the search search of your mind he assured blair there are some private things in there too uncomfortable she moved her shoulders frowned at hoyt am i supposed to think of you as my witch doctor im not a witch it will go more quickly and without discomfort if you open to this he lifted his hands and lit the candles glenna this is the circle of light and knowledge formed by like minds like hearts within this circle of light and knowledge no harm will we impart we seek to link so we may know within this ring only truth bestow with mind to mind in destiny as we will so mote it be the air rippled and still the candle flames rose straight as arrows hoyt held out his hands toward blair no harm no pain only thoughts within thoughts your mind to my mind your mind to our minds her eyes looked deeply into his had something flickering in his head then they went black and he saw they all saw a young girl fighting a monster nearly twice her size there was blood on her face and her shirt was torn they could hear each drawing of her labored breath a man stood off to the side and watched the battle she was struck to the ground with a vicious backhanded blow and sprang up struck down again when the thing leaped she rolled and stabbed it through the back into the heart with a stake slow the man said sloppy even for a first kill youll need to do better she didnt speak but the mind inside her mind thought ill do better ill do better than anyone now she was older and fought beside the man ferociously savagely the odds were five to two but it was done quickly and when it was done the man shook his head more control less passion passion will kill you she was naked in bed with a young man moving with him in the low light of the lamp she smiled as she arched to him nipped his lip a diamond winked madly on her finger her mind was full of passion of love of joy and of despair and misery as she sat on the floor in the dark alone weeping out the shards of a broken heart her finger was bare she stood on the rise above the battleground with the goddess a white shadow beside her you were the first to be called and the last morrigan told her theyre waiting for you the worlds are in your hands take theirs and fight she thought ive been coming toward this all my life will it be the end of it hoyt lowered his hands brought her slowly back as he closed the circle her eyes cleared blinked so did i pass the audition glenna smiled at her then walked to the table lifted one of the crosses this is yours now blair took it let it dangle its nice beautiful craftsmanship and i appreciate the gesture but i have my own she tugged the chain from under her shirt family thing again like an heirloom its lovely but if youd wait hoyt snatched at the cross stared at it as it lay in his palm where did you get this where did it come from i told you family we have seven of them theyve been passed down youre going to want to let go of that when he looked up into her eyes again she narrowed hers whats the problem there were seven the goddess gave me on the night she charged me to come here i asked for protection for my family the family she ordered me to leave behind and these were what she gave me that was what nine hundred years back it doesnt mean its nolas he looked over her head to cian i can feel it this is nolas cross nola our sister the youngest his voice thickened as cian moved closer to see for himself and here on the back i inscribed it with her name she said id see her again and by the gods i am shes in this woman blood to blood our blood theres no question cian said quietly i put this around her neck myself look at her cian aye well he looked away again then moved to the window forged in the fire of the gods given by the hand of a sorcerer blair breathed deep family legend my middle name is nola blair nola bridgit murphy hoyt glenna touched his arm shes your family i guess youd be my uncle a thousand times removed or however it works she glanced over toward cian and isnt it a kick in the ass im related to a vampire in the morning under a weak and fitful sunlight glenna stood with hoyt in the family graveyard the storm had soaked the grass and rain still dripped from the petals of the roses that climbed over his mothers grave i dont know how to comfort you he took her hand youre here i never thought i would need anyone to be with me not the way i need you its all so fast all of this loss and gain discovery questions life and death tell me about your sister about nola she was bright and fair and gifted she had sight she loved animals had i think a special affinity for them before i left there were puppies born to my fathers wolfhound nola would spend hours in the stables playing with them and while the world turned she grew to a woman had children he turned rested his brow against glennas i see her in this woman this warrior whos with us now and inside of me is another war will you bring her here blair it would be right you do whats right she tipped up her head so her lips brushed his its why i love you if we were to marry she took one quick jerky step back marry sure that hasnt changed over the centuries a man and a woman love they take vows make promises marriage or handfasting a tie to bind them to each other i know what marriage is and it disturbs you not disturbs and dont smile at me that way as if im being endearingly stupid give me just a minute here she looked over the stones toward the sparkling hills beyond yes people still marry if they like some live together without the ritual you and i glenna ward were creatures of ritual she looked back at him felt her stomach jitter yes we are if we were to marry would you live here with me it was a second jolt here in this place in this world in this place in this world but dont you want to go back need to i dont think i can go back magically aye i think its possible he said before she could speak i dont think i can go back to what was to what was home not knowing when theyll die knowing that cian is here that other half of me i dont think i could go back knowing you would go with me and pine for what you left here i said i would go without hesitation he agreed yet you hesitate at the rite of marriage you caught me off guard and you didnt actually ask me she said with some annoyance you more posed a hypothesis if we were to marry he said a third time and the humor in his voice had her fighting her own would you live with me here in ireland aye here and in this place it would be a kind of melding of our worlds our needs i would ask cian to let us live in the house to tend it it needs people family the children wed make together leaps and bounds she murmured then took a moment to settle herself to search herself her time his place she thought yes it was a loving compromise could be would be a melding of spirits ive always been a confident sort even as a child know what you want work to get it then value it once you have it ive tried not to take anything in my life for granted or not too much my family my gift my lifestyle reaching out she brushed her fingers over one of his mothers roses simple beauty miraculous life but ive learned that i took the world for granted that it would always be and that it would roll along pretty much without my help i learned otherwise and thats given me something else to work for to value is that a way of saying this isnt the time to speak of marriage and children no its a way of saying i understand the little things and the big ones the normal things life become only more important when its all on the line so hoyt the sorcerer she touched her lips to his cheek then the other if we were to marry i would live here with you and tend this house with you and make children with you and id work very hard to value all of it watching her he held up a hand palm to her when hers met it their fingers linked firm and strong light spilled out of their clasped hands will you marry me glenna yes he cupped the back of her neck drawing her to him the kiss spun out full of promise and possibilities full of hope when her arms came around him she knew shed found the strongest part of her destiny we have more to fight for now he turned his face into her hair more to be now then we will be come with me ill show you what im working on she took him with her closer to the house where there were targets set up for archery training the sound of hoofbeats had her looking over just in time to see larkin ride the stallion into the trees i wish he wouldnt ride in the woods there are so many shadows i doubt they could catch him if they were lying in wait but if you asked him hoyt said running a hand down glennas hair hed keep to the fields her brows lifted in puzzlement if i asked if he knew you worried hed give that to you hes grateful for what you do for him you feed him hoyt said when she frowned oh well he certainly likes to eat glenna looked toward the house moira she imagined was having her morning session with the books and cian would be sleeping as for blair it would take a little time before glenna learned the newcomers routine i think well have lasagna for dinner dont worry she patted his hand youll like it and it occurs to me that im already tending the house and the family in it i never thought of myself as particularly domestic the things you learn and now she drew her dagger moving she realized with complete ease from cookery to weaponry the things you learn i worked on this yesterday on the dagger hoyt prompted on charming the dagger i thought i should start small eventually work up to a sword we talked about doing something about weapons but with one thing and the other we havent really gotten down to it then i thought of this he took it from her skimmed a finger up the edge charmed in what way think fire his gaze moved back to hers no literally she said as she stepped back a pace think fire visualize it skimming over the blade he turned the dagger in his hand then shifted to a fighting grip he imagined fire pictured it coating the steel but the blade remained cool are there words to be said he asked her no you just have to want it to see it try it again he focused and got nothing all right maybe it only works for me for now i can refine it she took it back from him drew out the image and pointed the dagger toward the target there wasnt so much as a spurt damn it it worked yesterday she took a closer look to make certain she hadnt grabbed the wrong weapon that morning this is the right one i inscribed a pentagram on the hilt see yes i see it perhaps the charm is limited it wore off i dont see how i should have to break the charm and i didnt i put a lot of time and energy into this so whats going on blair strolled out one hand tucked in the front pocket of her jeans the other holding a steaming cup of coffee there was a knife in a sheath at her hip and the glimmer of moonstones dangling from her ears knifethrowing practice no good morning she lifted an eyebrow at the irritation in glennas voice for some of us anyway nice dagger its not working lets see blair snatched it from glenna tested the weight and sipping coffee threw it toward the target it stabbed the bullseye works for me great so its got a pointy end and youve got excellent aim glenna stomped toward the target wrenched out the dagger what happened to the magic search me its a knife a nice one it stabs it hacks it slices does the job you start counting on magic you can get sloppy then somebody puts that pointy end into you you have magic in your blood hoyt pointed out to her you should have respect for it didnt say otherwise im just more comfortable with sharp implements than voodoo voodoo is a different matter entirely glenna snapped just because you can throw a knife doesnt mean you dont need what hoyt and i can give you no offense seriously but i count on myself first and if you cant fight with that you should leave the combat to the ones who can you think i cant hit that stupid target blair sipped more coffee i dont know can you riding on insult glenna turned and with curses running through her head flung the knife it hit the outer circle and burst into flame excellent blair lowered her coffee i mean your aims for shit but the fire show is very cool she gestured with the mug probably going to need a new target though i was pissed off glenna mumbled anger she turned her excited face to hoyts adrenaline we werent angry before i was happy she pissed me off always happy to help its a fine charm a good weapon he laid a hand on glennas shoulder as the target burned how long will the flame last oh wait she stepped away centered herself calmed she put out the fire in her mind the flame flickered out to smoke it needs work obviously but she went back to the target gingerly tested the daggers hilt it was warm but not too hot to touch it could give us a real edge damn straight blair agreed sorry about the voodoo crack accepted glenna sheathed the dagger im going to ask you for a favor blair ask away hoyt and i need to get to work on this now but later today could you teach me to throw a knife like you do maybe not like me blair grinned but i can teach you to throw it better than you do less like youre shooing pigeons theres more hoyt said cian takes charge of the training after sunset a vampire training humans to kill vampires blair shook her head theres some sort of strange logic in there okay so we train in the day as well a few hours outside if the sun holds from what i saw last night you can use all you can get and dont take insult blair added i work on it a couple hours a day myself the one in charge of our daylight training we lost him lilith rough im sorry its always rough i think youd be the best to lead that training now give you guys orders make you sweat sheer pleasure shone on her face sounds like fun just remember you asked when you start to hate me where are the others anyway daylight shouldnt be wasted i imagine moiras in the library glenna told her larkin took the horse out a little while ago cian i got that part okay im going to do a little scouting around get the lay a little better well get the party started when i get back the trees are thick glenna nodded toward the curve of the forest you shouldnt go too far in even during the day dont worry chapter blair liked the woods she liked the smell of them the look of the bigtrunked trees the play of light and shadow that for her made a kind of visual music the forest floor was carpeted with leaves that had fallen over countless years and the fairy green of moss the stream that ran glinting through it only added to that fairytale quality it was slender and curvy making more music with the water singing over rock shed been to clare before had wandered field and forest and hill and wondered how shed missed this place if it truly was her beginnings she supposed she hadnt been meant to find it before to walk here to know it was now with these people in this place the witch and the wizard she mused they were so full of love all shiny and new they all but glistened with it advantage or disadvantage shed have to wait and see but she knew one thing she wanted glenna to make her a fire dagger the witch was okay great hair too and an urban sense of style that showed through even with simple pants and shirts lot of smarts going on in there if blair was any judge and she was shed gone out of her way to be welcoming it seemed the night before fixing food fluffing up the room shed assigned to blair it was a lot more than she was used to and it was nice the wizard seemed to be on the intense side did a lot of watching didnt have a lot to say she could respect that just as she could and did respect the power he wore like skin as for the vampire she was in a holding pattern there he would be a formidable ally or foe and to date shed never considered a vamp any kind of ally still shed seen something in his face when his brother had spoken of nola it had been pain the other woman was quiet as a mouse watchful oh yeah and a little on the soft side yet she hadnt made up her mind about blair any more than blair had about her and the guy larkin some serious eyecandy he had a good athletic build that should make him an asset in a fight boiling with energy too she thought the shapeshifting deal could come in handy if he was any good at it shed have to ask for a demo it was a lot they were a lot to whip into shape in a very short time shed have to be up to it if any of them were going to make it out of this alive but for now it was nice to take a morning stroll through the trees listening to the water sing watching the light dance she skirted around a rock cocked her head at what was curled sleeping under its shadow this is your morning wakeup call she said and pulled the trigger on the crossbow she carried the vampire barely had time to open its eyes she retrieved the arrow set it again she took out three more disturbing another who sprinted off down the path dodging beams of thin sunlight without a clear shot and unwilling to waste an arrow she took off after him the horse leaped onto the path a gleaming black beast with the gilded god on its back larkin sliced down with his sword and beheaded the fleeing vampire nice job she called out through streams of sunlight larkin trotted the horse toward her what are you doing out here killing vampires you the horse needed a run you shouldnt be out here alone so far from the house you are they couldnt catch this one he patted vlad on the neck hes the wind so then how many have you seen the four i killed and yours makes five there are probably more four others you say arent you the busy one do you want to hunt them now he looked up to it but she couldnt be sure working with an unknown partner was a good way to die even if that partner showed a wicked skill with a sword that should do it for now one of them at least will run back to mommy and report were taking them out of their nests during the day should tick her off tick annoy her ah aye theres that anyway we need to do some training so i can see what youre made of you can see im your new sergeant she could see he wasnt thrilled with that news and who could blame him but she held up a hand how about a lift cowboy he reached down and with a clasp of hands to forearms she vaulted up behind him how fast will this guy move she asked youd best hold on and tight a tap of his heels sent the horse flying glenna rubbed her thumb and finger together over the cauldron to add another pinch of sulfur to the mix a little at a time she said absently to hoyt we dont want to overdo it and end up she jerked back as the liquid flashed mind your hair hoyt warned she grabbed some pins bundled it hastily on top of her head hows it coming there inside the metal trough the dagger continued to burn the fires still unstable we have to tame it or well burn ourselves as well as vampyres its going to work she took a sword slid it into the liquid stepping back she held her hands in the smoke and began her chant he stopped what he was doing to watch her to study the beauty that came into her with the magic what had his life been before shed come into it with no one with whom he could fully share what he was not even cian with no one to look into his eyes in a way that made his heart shine fire licked at the edges of the cauldron shimmied up the sword and still she stood in the smoke and the flame her voice like music her power like dance when the flames died she removed the sword with tongs set it aside to cure and cool each has to be done separately i know its going to take time days but in the end what she said when she caught him staring at her have i got magic soot all over my face no youre beautiful when will you marry me she blinked in surprise i thought after when its over no i dont want to wait every day is a day less and every day is precious i want us to be married here in this house before long well travel to geall and then it should be here glenna in the home well make of course it should i know your family cant be here except for cian and blair neither can mine but when its over hoyt when everyones safe again id like another ritual here id like my family here then a handfasting now a wedding ceremony after would that suit perfect id now as in now i cant be ready now i have to do things first i need a dress i thought you preferred your rituals skyclad very funny a few days say the coming full moon the end of the first month he nodded it seems right i want to what is all that shouting they walked to the window to see blair going toetotoe with larkin moira stood hands fisted on her hips speaking of rituals glenna commented looks like the headbutting portion of the daily trainings started without us wed better get down there shes slow and shes sloppy and slow and sloppy get you dead shes neither larkin shot back at blair but her strengths lie in her bow and in her mind great she can think a vamp to death let me know how that works out as for the bow yeah eye like an eagle but you cant always kill at a distance i can speak for myself well enough larkin and you moira jabbed a finger at blair i dont care to be spoken to as if i were addlebrained ive got no problem with your brain but ive got a big one with your sword arm you fight like a girl so i am not during training not during battle then youre a soldier and the enemy doesnt give a rats ass about your plumbing king had her working on her strengths kings dead there was a moment of utter silence that couldnt have been sliced through with cians battleax then blair sighed that she could admit had been unnecessarily harsh look what happened to your pal is terrible i sure as hell dont want it to happen to me if you dont want it to happen to you youll work on your weaknesses and youve got plenty you can play with your strengths on your own time she planted her feet as hoyt and glenna came to join them did you put me in charge of this blair demanded i did hoyt affirmed and weve nothing to say about it fury tightened larkins face nothing at all you dont no shes the best for it because shes your blood blair rounded on larkin because i can put you on your ass in five seconds flat sure of that are you he shimmered and changed and the wolf he became crouched and snarled excellent blair said under her breath with temper smothered by pure admiration oh larkin leave off would you obviously out of patience moira slapped a hand at him hes only angry because you were rude to me and youve no cause to be so insulting it happens i agree with you about working on the weaknesses and cian had said the same moira recalled im willing to practice but i wont be after standing and being berated while im about it more flies with honey than vinegar blair said i always wondered why the hell anyone would want to catch flies look you and i can paint our toenails and talk about boys when were off the clock while im training you im the bitch because i want you alive does it hurt when you do that blair asked larkin when he changed back shifting bones and organs and so on some actually he couldnt recall anyone ever asking him his temper cooled as quickly as it had flared but its fun so i dont mind so much he slung his arm around moiras shoulder gave her arm a little rub as he spoke to hoyt and glenna your girl here took out four of them in the forest i took a fifth myself this morning five glenna stared at blair how close to the house close enough blair glanced toward the woods lookouts i figure and not very good ones caught them napping liliths going to get word of it shes going to be unhappy it wasnt a matter of killing the messenger not in liliths longstanding opinion it was a matter of killing it as painfully as possible the young vampire whod foolishly gone back to the nest after blairs morning foray was now on a slow roast bellydown over a simmering fire the smell wasnt particularly pleasant but lilith understood command required certain sacrifices she circled him now careful to keep the hem of her red gown away from the lick of flames why dont we go over this again her voice was melodious somewhat like a devoted teacher speaking to a favored student the human female destroyed everyone id posted save you the man pain turned the words to guttural rasps the horse yes yes i keep forgetting the man and the horse she stopped to study the rings she wore the one who came along after shed already cut down what was it now four of you she crouched down a spider of stunning beauty to stare into his red wheeling eyes and she was able to do this because wait wait i remember because you were sleeping they were the others i was at post majesty i swear it at post and yet this single female human lives lives because do i have this detail correct because you ran came back to report its sweat dripped into the fire and sizzled the others they ran away they ran i came to you so you did she tapped him playfully on the nose with each word then rose i suppose i should reward your loyalty mercy majesty mercy she turned around with a silky rustle of skirts to smile at the boy who sat crosslegged on the floor of the cave systematically ripping the heads off a pile of star wars action figures davey if you break all your toys what will you have to play with his lips moved to pout as he beheaded anikin skywalker theyre boring yes i know she ran a loving hand over his sunny hair and youve been cooped up too long havent you can we go outside now he bounced and his eyes went round and wide at the prospect of a promised treat can we go outside and play please not quite yet now dont sulk she tipped his chin up to peck a kiss on his lips what if your face froze like that here now my sweet boy what if i gave you a brandnew toy round cheeks bright with temper he snapped han solo in two im tired of toys but this will be a new one something youve never had before she turned her head and with her finger still on his chin turned his until they both looked at the vampire over the fire pit and on the spit seeing their eyes it began to struggle and thrash and weep for me davey said brightly all for you my own dumpling but you must promise mama not to get too close to the fire i dont want you burned my precious one she kissed his little fingers before she rose majesty i beg you majesty i came back to you i dislike failure be a good boy davey oh and dont spoil your dinner she gestured to lora who stood quietly by the door the screams began before it was closed behind them and locked the hunter lora began it had to be none of the other women have the skill to a single look from lilith silenced her i havent given you leave to speak my fondness for you is all there is between you and the pit and my affections only go so far lora bowed her head in deference and followed lilith into the adjoining chamber you lost three of my good men what can you say to that i have no excuse with a nod lilith roamed the chamber idly picking a ruby necklace from the top of a chest the single thing she missed of life was mirrors she longed even after two millennia to see herself reflected to be wooed by her own beauty she had hired and fed on countless sorcerers witches and magicians over the centuries to make it so it was her greatest failure youre wise not to offer one im a patient woman lora ive waited more than a thousand years for whats coming but i wont be insulted i dislike having these people pick and pluck us off like flies she threw herself into a chair tapped her long red nails on its arms speak then tell me about this new one this hunter as the seers prophesied my lady the warrior of old blood one of the hunters who has plagued our kind for centuries and you know this because she was too fast to be a mere human too strong she knew what they were before they moved on her that night and she was ready she completes their number the first stage is set my scholars said the black man was their warrior they were wrong then what good are they lilith heaved the necklace she still toyed with across the room how can i rule when im surrounded by incompetence i want whats due me i want blood and death and beautiful chaos is it too much to ask that those who serve me be accurate on the details for nearly four hundred years lora had been by liliths side friend lover servant no one she was sure knew the queen better she poured a glass of wine carried it to the chair lilith she said it gently offering both it and a kiss weve lost nothing important face no not even that they only believe what theyve done in these past weeks matters its good they do because it makes them overconfident and we killed cians boy didnt we we did lilith pouted another moment then sipped there was satisfaction in that and sending him to them only demonstrated your brilliance and your strength let them take dozens of the meaningless foot soldiers we cut their heart youre a comfort to me lora drinking her wine lilith stroked loras hand and youre right of course youre right im disappointed i admit i so wanted to break their number to foil the prophecy but its better this way isnt it and itll be the sweeter when you take them all better yes better and yet i think we need to make a statement it would improve my mood and morale as well i have an idea ill think it through a bit she watched the wine swirl in her glass one day one day soon this will be the sorcerers blood ill drink it from a silver cup and nibble on sugar plums between sips all that he is will be in me and all that i am will make even the gods tremble leave me now i need to plan as lora rose to go to the door lilith tapped on her glass oh and this irritating business has made me hungry bring me someone to eat will you right away make sure its fresh alone she closed her eyes and began to plot while she plotted the screams and squeals from the next chamber battered the cave walls her lips curved who could be blue she thought with a childs laughter ringing in the air moira sat crosslegged on glennas bed and watched glenna work on the magic little machine she called a laptop moira was desperate to get her hands on it there were worlds of knowledge inside and so far shed only been allowed a few peeks shed been promised a lesson but just at the moment glenna seemed so absorbed and they only had an hour free so she cleared her throat what do you think of this one glenna asked and tapped the image of a woman wearing a long white dress angling her head for a better view moira studied the screen shes very lovely i was wondering no not the model the dress glenna scooted around on the chair i need a dress oh did something happen to yours no with a little laugh glenna twisted the pendant around her neck i need a very special dress a wedding dress moira hoyt and i are going to be married handfasted we decided on handfasting with a wedding ceremony later after youre betrothed to hoyt i didnt know it just happened i know it might seem rushed and the timing of it oh but this is wonderful moira sprang up and in a burst of enthusiasm threw her arms around glenna im so happy for you for all of us thanks for all of us weddings theyre bright arent they bright and happy and human oh i wish we were home so i could have a feast made you cant make your own wedding feast and im still not very good at the cooking we wont worry about that not yet weddings are bright and happy and human and im human enough to want the perfect dress well of course why would you want less glenna let out a long happy sigh thank god ive been feeling a little shallow i shouldve known all i needed was another girl help me will you i have a few picked out and i need to narrow it down id love to gently curiously she tapped the side of the screen but how do you get the dress out of the box well get to that too im going to have to take a few shortcuts but later ill show you how to shop online the conventional way i want something i think along these lines while they were huddled blair gave the doorjamb a knuckle rap sorry you got a minute glenna i wanted to talk to you about requisitions and supplies figured you were the goto hey nice toy one of my favorites cian and i are the only ones linked up so if you need to use brought my own but thanks shopping neimans she said as she moved close enough to see the screen pretty fancy duds for wartime hoyt and i are getting married no kidding thats great she gave glenna a friendly punch on the shoulder congratulations so whens the big day tomorrow night when blair only blinked glenna hurried on i know how it must seem but i think its terrific i think its excellent life cant stop we cant let it we cant let them make it stop thats the whole point plus its great seriously great that the two of you found what youve got when everythings so extreme its one of the things were fighting for right yes yes it is wedding dress a potential blair thank you blair put a hand on glennas shoulder in a gesture that might have been womantowoman or soldiertosoldier glenna supposed it was now one and the same ive been fighting for thirteen years i know better than anyone you need some real you need things that matter and that warm you up inside or you lose the mission ill let you get back to it want to help us shop really blair did a little shuffle dance are vampires bloodsucking fiends im so in one thing not to put the damper but how are you going to get the dress here by tomorrow ive got my ways and id better get started would you mind closing the door i dont want hoyt coming in while im trying them on trying sure blair obliged while glenna set several crystals on and around the laptop she lit candles then stood back held her arms out to the side mother goddess i ask your grace to bring this garment to this place through the air from there to here in the light unto my sight a symbol of my destiny as i will so mote it be with a shimmer and flash glennas jeans and tshirt were replaced by the white gown wow a whole new level of shoplifting im not stealing it glennas scowled at blair id never use my powers that way im trying it on and when i find the one ive got another spell to work the sale its just to save time which i dont have dont get bent i was just kidding sort of will that work for weapons if we need more i suppose it would good to know anyway great dress its lovely moira agreed just lovely glenna turned studied her reflection in the antique cheval glass thank god cian didnt strip all the mirrors out of this place its beautiful isnt it i love the lines but its not the one blair finished and settled down on the bed with moira to watch the show why do you say that it doesnt light you up that light in the gut in the heart that just spreads out right to your fingertips you put on your wedding dress take one look at yourself in it and you know the others are just practice so it had gotten that far glenna thought remembering the vision of blair and the engagement ring on her finger and the image of her weeping in the dark her hand bare she started to comment then said nothing a tender area like that required more than camaraderie it needed true friendship and they werent there yet youre right its not the one ive got four more picked out so well try number two she hit it on the third and felt that light glowing heard it in moiras long wistful sigh and we have a winner blair circled her finger do the turn oh yeah that ones yours it was romantic and simple glenna thought just as shed hoped there was a little float in the long skirt and the soft sweetheart neckline was framed by two thin straps that left her shoulders bare then ran down her shoulder blades to spotlight her back its so exactly right she glanced at the price again winced well maxing out my credit card doesnt seem that big a deal considering the possible apocalypse seize the day blair agreed you doing a veil a headpiece traditional celtic handfastings call for a veil but in this case just flowers i think even better soft earthy romantic and sexy all rolled into one do the deal moira glenna looked over saw moiras eyes were damp and dreamy i can see it has your vote too i think youll be the most beautiful of brides well this was serious fun blair got to her feet and i agree with the brain trust here you look outstanding but you need to wrap it up she tapped her watch the two of you are due in training you need some major handtohand practice why dont you come with me now she said to moira we can get started ill only be a few minutes glenna told them then turned back to study herself in the glass from wedding dresses to combat she thought her life had become a very strange ride because he heard the music playing inside hoyt knocked on cians door a little before sundown thered been a time he remembered he wouldnt have thought of knocking when asking permission to enter his brothers chambers wouldnt have been necessary a time he thought he wouldnt have needed to ask his brother if he could live with his wife in his own home locks clicked and snicked cian wore only loose pants and a sleepy expression when he opened the door a bit early for me for visiting i need a private word with you which of course cant wait on my convenience come in then hoyt stepped into a room that was pitch black must we speak in the dark i can see well enough but cian switched on a low light beside a wide bed the covers on the bed gleamed jewellike in that light and the sheets carried the sheen of silk cian moved to a cold box took out a packet of blood i havent had breakfast he tossed the packet into the microwave sitting on top of the box what do you want when this is done what do you intend to do as i choose as always to live here i think not cian said with a half laugh and took a crystal glass from a shelf tomorrow night glenna and i are to be handfasted there was a slight hesitation in his rhythm then cian set the glass down isnt that interesting i suppose congratulations are in order and you intend to take her back introduce her to the family ma da this is my bride a little witch i picked up a few centuries from now cian sorry the absurdity of it amuses me he took the package out broke it open and poured the warmed contents into the glass well anyway sláinte i cant go back after the first sip the first long stare over the rim cian lowered the glass more and more interesting its no longer my place knowing what i know waiting for the day to come when i know theyll die if you could go back would you cian frowned into his glass then sat no for thousands of reasons but that would be one of them but that aside you brought this war to me now you take time from it to handfast human needs dont stop theyre only keener it seems when the end of days threaten it happens thats true ive seen it countless times it also happens war brides dont always make reliable wives thats for me and for glenna it certainly is he raised his glass drank some more well then good luck to you we want to live here in this house in my house in the house that was ours setting aside my rights and our kinship youre a businessman you pay a caretaker when youre not in residence youd no longer have that expense glenna and i would tend this place and the land at no cost to you and how do you propose to make a living there isnt much demand for sorcerers these days wait i take it back cian laughed finished off the blood you could make a goddamn fortune on television on the internet get yourself an ninehundred number a web site and off you go not your style though ill find my way cian set the glass aside looked off into the shadows maybe i hope you do providing you live of course ive no problem with you staying in the house thanks for that cian shrugged its a complicated life youve chosen for yourself and i intend to live it ill let you get dressed a complicated life cian thought again when he was alone and it stunned and annoyed him that he could envy it chapter glenna figured most brides were a little stressed and very busy on their weddings days but most brides didnt have to fit in sword practice and spells between their facials and pedicures at least the pace cut down on the time for the nerves shed had no idea shed have she couldnt squeeze in much of an anxiety attack when she was worried about flower arrangements romantic lighting and the proper form for beheading a vampire try this blair started to toss the weapon then obviously changed her mind when glennas mouth dropped open she walked it over battleax more heft than a sword which would work better for you i think you got pretty decent upper body strength but youd cut through easier with this than a sword you need to get used to its weight and its balance here she walked back picked up her own sword block me with it im not used to it i could miss hurt you believe me you wont hurt me block she thrust out and more from instinct than obedience glenna clanged the ax to the sword now see id just stab you cheerfully in the back while youre fumbling to turn its top heavy glenna complained its not spread out your grip more for now okay stay forward after the first strike come down on the sword back up at me slow one she said and thrust two again keep it coming you want to counter my moves sure but what you want is to throw me off balance to make me counter yours force me to follow your moves think of it as a dance routine where you not only want to lead but you also really want to kill your partner blair held up a hand stepped back let me show you hey larkin come be the practice dummy she tossed him her sword hilt up then took the battleax take it slow she told him this is a demo she nodded attack as he moved on her she called out the steps strike strike turn thrust up across strike hes good see she said still calling out to glenna so hes pushing at me while i push at him so you ad lib as necessary turn kick strike strike pivot slice she flipped the dagger strapped to her wrist and swiped it an inch from larkins belly when his guts are spilling out you and dodged back from the swipe of what looked like a very large bear claw wow she rested the head of her ax on the floor leaned on the handle only his arm had changed shape you can do that just pieces of you if i like i bet the girls back home cant get enough of you it took him a moment shed already turned to go back to glenna then he burst into delighted laughter sure thats the truth but not due to what youre meaning i prefer my own shape for that kind of sport bet square off with larkin im going to work with shorty for a while dont call me that moira snapped lighten up i didnt mean anything by it moira opened her mouth then shook her head im sorry that was rude king called her that glenna said quietly oh got it moira resistance training were going to pump you up im sorry i spoke to you that way look were going to irritate each other a lot before this is done i dont bruise easily literally or figuratively youre going to have to toughen up yourself fivepound free weights youre going to be cut by the time im done with you moira narrowed her eyes i may be sorry i lashed at you but im not going to let you cut me no its an expression it means and every other term blair could think of would be just as confusing instead she curled her arm flexed her biceps ah a smile glimmered in moiras eyes sure id like that all right then you can cut me they worked a full morning when blair paused to gulp water from a bottle she nodded at glenna youre coming right along ballet lessons eight years never thought id pirouette with a battleax but lifes full of surprises can you do a triple not so far look still holding the bottle blair whipped her body around three times then shot her leg out to the side up at a fortyfivedegree angle that kind of momentum puts a good solid punch in a kick you need solid to knock one of these things back practice youve got it in you so she took another swig wheres the groom hoyt in the tower there are things that need to be done as important as what were doing here blair she added when she sensed disapproval maybe okay maybe if you come up with more stuff like the fire dagger weve fire charmed a number of the weapons she walked to another section of the room took down a sword to bring it back those that are charmed weve marked see on the blade near the hilt was a flame etched into steel nice really can i try it better take it outside good point okay we should break for an hour anyway grab something to eat cross and longbows boys and girls after lunch ill come with you glenna told her in case blair used the terrace doors jogged down to ground level she glanced at the straw dummy larkin had hung from a post you had to give it to the guy she mused he had a sense of humor hed drawn fangs on the stuffed face and a bright red heart on the chest it would be fun to test the fire sword out on it and a waste of good material no point burning up vampire dummy so she began in a fighting stance her arm arched behind her head the sword pointing out its important to control it glenna began to pull the fire when you need it if youre just slapping the burning sword around you could burn yourself or one of us dont worry glenna started to speak again then shrugged there was nothing and no one to hurt but the air then she watched as blair began to move slowly fluid as water the sword like an extension of her arm yes a kind of ballet she thought a lethal one but nonetheless compelling the blade shimmered when the sun struck its edge but remained cool just as glenna began to assume blair needed coaching on how to use it the woman thrust out and the blade erupted and youre toast god i love this thing will you make me one out of one of my personal weapons absolutely glenna lifted her brows as blair swished the sword through the air and the fire died you learn fast yeah i do she frowned scanning the sky clouds boiling up in the west guess were in for more rain good thing i planned an indoor wedding good thing lets go eat hoyt didnt come down until late afternoon and by that time glenna had given herself permission to take time for herself she didnt want to do a quick glamour to look her best she wanted to pamper herself just a bit and she needed flowers to make the circlet for her hair to make a bouquet shed made the facial cream herself from herbs so dabbed it on generously as she studied the sky from the bedroom window the clouds were moving in now if she was going to get flowers she had to get them before the sun was lost and the rain came but when she opened the door to dash out moira and larkin stood on the other side he made some sound as his eyes widened reminding her of the soft green goo on her face its a female thing just deal with it im running behind i havent got the flowers for my hair yet we well moira brought her hand from behind her back and offered the circlet of white rosebuds with red ribbon braided through it i hope its all right that its what you wanted i know something reds traditional for a handfasting larkin and i wanted to give you something and we dont have anything really so we did this but if youd rather oh its perfect its perfectly beautiful oh thank you she grabbed moira in a crushing hug then turned a beaming smile up to larkin ive thought it wouldnt be a hardship to have you kiss me he began but just at the moment dont worry ill catch you later theres this as well he handed her a nosegay of multicolored roses twined with more red ribbon to carry moira says oh god this is the sweetest thing tears dribbled through the cream i thought this would be hard without family here but i have family here after all thank you thank you both she bathed scented her hair creamed her skin white candles burned as she performed the female ritual of preparing herself for a man for her wedding and her wedding night she was in her robe brushing her fingers over the skirt of the dress that hung outside the wardrobe when someone knocked yes come in unless youre hoyt not hoyt blair came in carrying a bottle of champagne nestled in an ice bucket behind her moira brought in three flutes compliments of our host blair told her i gotta say hes got some class for a vampire this is prime bubbly we got here cian sent champagne yep and im going to get down to popping this cork before we suit you up i have a wedding party oh you should have dresses i shouldve thought of it were fine tonights all about you ive never had champagne blair says ill like it guaranteed blair gave moira a quick wink then popped the cork oh i got something for you its not much seeing as i dont have your style with online shopping but anyway she dug into her pocket i didnt have a box either she put the pin in glennas hand its a claddaugh traditional irish symbol friendship love loyalty idve gone for the toaster or salad bowl but time was limited and i didnt know where youd registered another circle glenna thought another symbol its beautiful thank you she turned pinned it to the ribbon trailing from her bouquet now ill carry both of your gifts with me i love sentiment especially with champagne blair poured three glasses passed them around to the bride and her happiness moira added and to the continuity represented by what we do tonight to the promise of the future it represents im going to get all the teary stuff out before i do my makeup good plan blair agreed i know what i found with hoyt is right is mine i know what were promising each other tonight is right is ours but having you here with me thats right too and its special i want you to know its very special to me having you share this they touched glasses drank and moira closed her eyes blair was right i do like it told ya okay moira lets you and me make ourselves a bride outside the rain splashed down and fog billowed but in the house was candlelight and the scent of flowers glenna stepped back from the mirror well you look like a dream moira stated like a goddess in a dream my knees are shaking i bet goddesses dont get shaky knees take a couple of deep breaths well go down make sure everythings set up including the lucky guy youre going to blow his socks off why would she you know sweetie blair said to moira as they started for the door youre too literal start studying contemporary slang while youre buried in books she pulled open the door stopped short when she saw cian this is girl territory id like a moment with my future sisterinlaw its all right blair cian please come in he stepped inside sent blair a mild look over his shoulder then shut the door in her face then he turned and took a long look at glenna well now youre a vision arent you truly my brothers fortune leaps and bounds you probably think this is foolish youd be wrong while it may be something i think of as particularly human its not one of the things i think of as foolish though there are many of those i love your brother yes a blind man could see that thank you for the champagne for thinking of it my pleasure hoyts ready for you oh boy she pressed a hand to her jumpy belly i hope so cian smiled at that stepped closer i have something for you a wedding gift i thought to put it in your hand as i assume at least for now youd be in charge of the paperwork paperwork he handed her a thin leather portfolio after opening it she sent him a puzzled look i dont understand it should be clear enough its the deed to this house the land its yours oh but we cant when he asked if we could stay he only meant glenna i only make grand gestures once every few decades if the whim happens to strike me take it when its offered its more to him than it could ever be to me her throat had filled so she had to wait to speak i know what it means to me it will mean a great deal more to him i wish youd give it to him yourself take it was all he said then turned to the door cian she set the folder aside picked up her bouquet would you walk me down would you take me to hoyt he hesitated then opened the door then held out a hand to her she heard music as they started down your handmaidens have been busy i expected it of the little queen a lot of sentiment there but the hunter surprised me am i shaking i feel like im shaking no he tucked her hand into his arm youre steady as a rock and when she stepped into the room filled with candles and flowers when she saw hoyt standing in front of the low gold flames of the fire she felt steady they crossed the room to each other ive waited for you hoyt whispered and i for you she took his hand scanned the room it was as was traditional madly decked with flowers the circle had been formed and the candles lighted but for the ones they would light during the ritual the willow wand lay on the table that served as altar i made this for you he showed her a thick ring of silver deeply etched one mind she said and drew the one shed made him from her thumb they joined hands walked to the altar touched fingers to the candles to light them after slipping their rings onto the willow wand they turned to face the others we ask you to be our witnesses at this sacred rite hoyt began to be our family as we become one may this place be consecrated for the gods we are gathered here in a ritual of love beings of the air be with us here and with your clever fingers tie closely the bonds between us glenna looked into his eyes as she spoke the words beings of the fire be with us here and they continued through water through earth the blessed goddess and laughing god her face was luminous as they spoke as they lit incense then a red candle they sipped wine scattered salt she and hoyt held the wand with the rings gleaming on it between them the light grew warmer brighter as they spoke to each other the rings under their hands sparkling wildly it is my wish to become one with this man she slipped the ring from the wand and onto his finger it is my wish to become one with this woman he mirrored her gesture they took the cord from the altar draped it over their joined hands and so the binding is made they said together then as the goddess and the god and the old ones a scream from outside shattered the moment like a rock through glass blair leaped to a window yanked back the drape even her nerves jolted at the vampires face only inches away behind the glass but it wasnt that which turned her blood cold it was what she saw beyond it she looked over her shoulders at the others and said oh shit there were at least fifty probably more still in the forest or hidden nearby three cages sat on the grass their occupants bloodied and shackled and screaming now as they were dragged out glenna shoved her way by to see then groped behind her for hoyts hand the blonde one thats the one who came to the door when king lora cian said one of liliths favorites i had an incident with her once he laughed when lora hoisted a white flag and if you believe that ive all manner of bridges you can buy they have people out there moira added injured people weapons blair began best wait and see how best to use them cian stepped away and walked to the front door wind and rain sliced in when he opened it lora he called out almost conversationally why youre good and soaked arent you now id ask you and your friends in but i still have my sanity and my standards cian its been too long did you like my present by the way i didnt have time to wrap him taking credit for liliths work thats just sad and you should tell her shell pay dearly for it tell her yourself you and your humans have ten minutes to surrender oh all of ten in ten minutes well kill the first of these she grabbed one of the prisoners by the hair pretty isnt she only sixteen old enough to know better than to go walking along dark roads please the girl wept and the blood on her neck showed that something had already tasted her please god theyre always calling for god with a laugh lora threw the girl facedown on the sodden grass he never comes ten minutes close the door blair said quietly from behind him close it okay give me a minute one minute to think theyll kill them regardless cian pointed out bait is all they are thats not the issue glenna snapped we have to do something we fight larkin drew one of the swords theyd stocked in an umbrella stand near the door hold your water blair ordered we dont surrender not to the likes of them we fight hoyt agreed but not on their terms glenna the shackles yes i can work that im sure i can we need more weapons from upstairs hoyt began i said hold it blair grabbed his arm youve been in a couple of skirmishes with vampires that doesnt prepare you were not just charging out there and getting cut down like meat you can work the shackles glenna drew a breath yes good moira youre upstairs bows cian theyve probably got guards around the house pick a door start taking them out quiet as you can manage hoyts with you wait i know how to do this she told glenna are you ready to use that ax i guess well find out get it youre up with moira theyll have archers too and they see a hell of lot better in the dark than we do larkin you and me were going to create a diversion moira you dont start picking them off until you get the signal what signal youll know it one more thing those three out there theyre already gone all we can do is make a statement you have to accept that chances are slim to none when it comes to saving any of them we have to try moira insisted yeah well thats what were here for lets go is that one of your trick swords cian asked hoyt as they approached the east door it is then keep it well away from me he touched his finger to his lips eased open the door for a moment there was no sound no movement but the rain then cian was out a blur of dark in the dark even as he stepped out to follow he saw cian snap two necks and behead a third on your left cian said quietly hoyt pivoted and met what came at him with steel and with fire upstairs glenna knelt within the circle shed cast and chanted the silver around her throat on her finger glowed brighter with every heartbeat moira crouched to the side of the open doorway a quiver at her back a bow in her hand moira glanced back at her the shackles no that was for something else ill start that now what was it oh moira looked back into the dark but now thanks to glenna with the vision of a cat oh aye thats a right good one theyve archers back in the trees i only see six i can take six dont go outside dont go out until im done here glenna fought to clear her mind calm her heart and call the magic out of the dark like vengeance came a gold horse and the rider on its back wielded death with larkin at a gallop blair swung the torch striking three that burst into flames and took two more into the blaze with them then she heaved it spinning destruction through the air and flashed a fiery sword its now glenna moira let the first arrow fly its now yes ive got it ive got it she grabbed the ax and a dagger at a run moiras arrows were winging as they both sprinted into the rain and the things that were waiting rushed them glenna didnt think only acted only felt she let her body move into that dance of life and death striking blocking thrusting fire rippled over the blades as she swung there were screams such horrible screams human vampire how could she tell she smelled blood tasted it knew some of it was her own her heart beat a war drum in her chest so she barely registered the arrow that whizzed by her head as she plunged fire into what leaped at her theyve hit larkin theyve hit him at moiras shout glenna saw the arrow in the foreleg of the horse but it ran still like a demon with blair raging destruction from its back then she saw hoyt fighting fang and sword to get to one of the prisoners i have to go help moira there are too many down there go ive got this ill lower the odds i promise you she charged down screaming to draw some away from hoyt and cian she thought it would be a blur just madness rushing over her and through her but it was clear in every detail the faces the sounds the scents the feel of warm blood and cold rain running over her the red eyes the terrible hunger in them and the horrible flash and screaming when fire took them she saw cian break off the end of an arrow that had found his thigh and plunge it into the heart of an enemy she saw the ring shed put on hoyts finger burn like another fire as he took two with one blow get them inside he shouted to her try to get them inside she rolled over the wet grass toward the girl lora had tormented she half expected to find her dead instead she found her showing fangs in a grin oh god didnt you hear her he doesnt come she pounced knocking glenna onto her back then threw back her head with the joy of the kill blairs sword cut it off youd be surprised glenna returned inside blair shouted back in thats enough of a goddamn statement she reached down to help glenna mount behind her they left the field flaming and covered with dust how many did we kill larkin demanded as he collapsed on the floor blood ran down his leg to puddle on the wood at least thirty damn good ratio youve got some speed golden boy blair looked straight into his eyes winged you a little its not altogether too bad it just he didnt scream when she yanked the arrow out he didnt have the breath to scream when he got it back all he could manage was a stream of shaky curses you next she said to cian nodding at the broken arrow protruding from his thigh he simply reached down yanked it out himself thanks all the same ill get supplies your legs bleeding glenna told blair were all banged up some but were not dead well she sent cian a cocky grin most of us that never gets tired does it cian speculated and went for the brandy they werent human in the cages moira held her shoulder where the tip of an arrow had grazed it no i couldnt tell from in here too many of them to separate the scents it was smart blair nodded a grim acknowledgment a good way to engage us and not waste any of their food supply bitch has a brain we didnt get lora with his breath still heaving out of his lungs hoyt eased down he had a gash on his side another on his arm i saw her when we were fighting our way back into the house we didnt get her shes going to be mine my very special friend blair pursed her lips when cian offered her a brandy thanks standing in the center of them on shaky knees glenna took stock blair get larkins tunic off i need to see the wound moira how bad is your wound more a scratch really then get some blankets from upstairs some towels hoyt glenna moved to him knelt then just took his hands and buried her face in them however much she wanted to fall apart it wasnt time not time yet i felt you with me i felt you with me every moment i know you were with me a ghrá he lifted her head pressed his lips to hers i wasnt scared not while it was happening i couldnt think to be scared then i reached that girl that young girl and saw what she was i couldnt even move its done for tonight its done and we proved a match for them he kissed her again long deep you were magnificent she laid a hand over the wound on his side id say we all were and we proved more than being able to hold our own were a unit now the circle is cast she let out a long sigh well it wasnt the handfasting celebration i was looking for she struggled to smile but at least we no no damn it we didnt we didnt finish just hold everything she shoved at her dripping hair i will not let those monsters ruin this for us she gripped his hand as moira rushed down with arms loaded with towels and blankets are you all listening youre still witnesses we got it blair said as she cleansed larkins wound your heads bleeding cian passed moira a damp cloth go right ahead he told glenna but glenna your dress she only smiled at moira it doesnt matter only this matters she clasped hands with hoyt locked her eyes with his as the goddess and the god and the old ones hoyts voice joined hers are witness to this rite we now proclaim were husband and wife he reached down took her face in his hands i will love you beyond the end of days now she thought now the circle was truly cast strong and bright and the light glowed warmer a wash of gold when their lips met when their lips clung in hope and promise and in love so the old man said with the handfasting complete they tended to their wounds and began the healing they drank a toast to the love the true magic that had come out of dark and out of death inside the house while the rain fell the brave rested and prepared for the next battle he sat back picking up the fresh tea a servant had set beside him that is all of the story for today the protests were immediate and passionate but the old man only chuckled and shook his head therell be more tomorrow i promise you for the storys not finished only this beginning but for now the sun is out and so should you be havent you learned from the beginning of the tale that light is to be treasured go when i finish my tea ill come out to watch you alone he drank his tea watched his fire and thought of the tale he would tell on the morrow glossary of irish words characters and places a chroi

gods the second book in the circle trilogy chapter clare the first day of september through the house still as a grave larkin limped the air was sweet fragrant with the flowers gathered lavishly for the handfasting rite of the night before the blood had been mopped up the weapons cleaned theyd toasted hoyt and glenna with the frothy wine had eaten cake but behind the smiles the horror of the nights battle lurked a poor guest today he supposed was for rest and more preparation it was a struggle for him not to be impatient with the training with the planning at least last night theyd fought he thought as he pressed a hand to his thigh that ached from an arrow strike a score of demons had fallen and there was glory in that in the kitchen he opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of coke hed developed a taste for it and had come to prefer it over his morning tea he turned the bottle in his hand marveling at the cleverness of the vessel so smooth so clear and hard but what was inside it this was something hed miss when they returned to geall he could admit he hadnt believed his cousin moira when shed spoken of gods and demons of a war for worlds hed only gone with her that day that sad day of her mothers burial to look after her she wasnt only blood but friend and would be queen of geall but every word shed spoken to him only steps away from her mothers grave had been pure truth theyd gone to the dance theyd stood in the heart of that circle and everything had changed not just the where and when they were he mused as he opened the bottle and took that first bracing sip but everything one moment theyd stood under the afternoon sun in geall then thered been light and wind and a roar of sound then it had been night and it had been ireland a place larkin had always believed a fairy tale he hadnt believed in fairy tales or monsters and despite his own gift had looked askance at magic but magic there was he admitted now just as there was an ireland and there were monsters those demons had attacked them springing out of the dark of the woods their eyes red their fangs sharp the form of a man he thought but not a man vampyre they existed to feed off man and now they banded together under their queen to destroy all he was here to stop them at all and any costs he was here at the charge of the gods to save the worlds of man he scratched idly at his healing thigh and decided he could hardly be expected to save mankind on an empty stomach he cut a slab of cake to go with his morning coke and licked icing from his finger so far through wile and guile hed avoided glennas cooking lessons he liked to eat that was true enough but the actual making of food was a different matter he was a tall lanky man with a thick waving mane of tawny hair his eyes nearly the same color were wide like his cousins and nearly as keen he had a long and mobile mouth that was quick to smile quick hands and an easy nature those who knew him would have said he was generous with his time and his coin and a good man to have at your back at the pub or in a brawl hed been blessed with strong even features a strong back a willing hand and the power to change his shape into any living thing he took a healthy bite of cake where he stood but there was too much quiet in the house to suit him he wanted needed activity sound motion since he couldnt sleep he decided hed take cians stallion out for a morning run cian could hardly do it himself being a vampyre he stepped out of the back door of the big stone house there was a chill in the air but he had the sweater and jeans glenna had purchased in the village he wore his own boots and the silver cross glenna and hoyt had forged with magic he saw where the earth was scorched where it was trampled he saw his own hoofprints left in the sodden earth when hed galloped through the battle in the form of a horse and he saw the woman whod ridden him slashing destruction with a flaming sword she moved through the mists slow and graceful in what he would have taken for a dance if he hadnt known the movements the complete control in them were another preparation for battle long arms and long legs swept through the air so smoothly they barely disturbed the mists he could see her muscles tremble when she held a pose endlessly held it for her arms were bared in a snug white garment no woman of geall would have worn outside the bedchamber she lifted a leg behind her into the air bent at the knee reaching an arm back to grasp her bare foot the shirt rose up her torso to reveal more flesh it would be a sorry man larkin decided who didnt enjoy the view her hair was short raven black and her eyes were bluer than the lakes of fonn she wouldnt have been deemed a beauty in his world as she lacked the roundness the plump sweet curves but he found the strength of her form appealing the angles of her face the sharp arch of brows interesting and unique she brought her leg down swept it out to the side then dropped into a long crouch with her arms parallel to the ground you always eat that much sugar in the morning her voice jolted him hed been still and silent and thought her unaware of him he shouldve known better he took a bite of the cake hed forgotten he held its good bet blair lowered her arms straightened earlier rising for you than usual isnt it i couldnt sleep know what you mean damn good fight good he looked over the burned ground and thought of the screams the blood the death it wasnt a night at the pub entertaining though she looked as he did but with a hard light in her eyes we kicked some vampire ass and what could be a better way to spend the evening i can think of a few hell of a rush though she rolled any lingering tension from her shoulders as she glanced at the house and it didnt suck to go from a handfasting to a fight and back again as winners especially when you consider the alternative theres that i suppose i hope glenna and hoyt are getting a little honeymoon time in because for the most part it was a pretty crappy reception with the long almost liquid gait hed come to admire she walked over to the table they used during daylight training to hold weapons and supplies she picked up the bottle of water shed left there and drank deep you have a mark of royalty say what he moved closer touched a fingertip lightly to her shoulder blade there was the mark of a cross like the one around his neck but in bold and bloody red its just a tattoo in geall only the ruler would bear a mark on the body when the new king or queen becomes when they lift the sword from the stone the mark appears here he tapped a hand on his right biceps not the symbol of the cross but the claddaugh put there its said by the finger of the gods cool excellent she explained when he frowned at her i myself have never seen this she cocked her head and seeings believing he shrugged my aunt moiras mother had such a mark but she rose to queen before i was born so i didnt see the mark become i never heard that part of the legend because it was there she swooped a fingertip through the icing of his cake sucked it off i guess everything doesnt trickle down how did you come by yours funny guy blair thought curious nature gorgeous eyes danger will robinson she thought that sort of combo just begged for complications she just wasnt built for complications and had learned it the hard way i paid for it a lot of people have tattoos its like a personal statement you could say glennas got one she took another drink watching him as she reached around to tap herself on the small of the back here a pentagram i saw it when we were helping her get dressed for the handfasting so theyre for women not only why you want one i think not he rubbed absently at his thigh blair remembered yanking the arrow out of him herself and that hed barely uttered a sound the guy had balls to go with the gorgeous eyes and curious nature he was no slouch in a fight and no whiner after the battle leg giving you trouble a little stiff a little sore glennas a good healer yours she bent her leg back heel to butt gave it a testing pull its okay i heal fast part of the family package not as fast as a vamp she added but demon hunters heal faster than your average human she picked up the jacket shed tossed on the table put it on against the morning cool i want coffee i dont like it i like the coke then he smiled easy charming will you be making yourself the breakfast in a little while ive got some things i want to do first maybe you wouldnt mind making enough for two maybe clever guy too she thought you had to respect his finagling you got something going now it took him a moment but he tried to spend a little time each day with the miraculous machine called the television he was proud to think he was learning new idioms im after taking the horse for a ride then feeding and grooming him plenty of light today but you shouldnt head into the woods unarmed ill be riding the fields ah glenna she asked if id not ride alone in the forest i dont like to worry her were you wanting a ride yourself i think i had enough of one last night thanks to you amused she gave him a light punch in the chest youve got some speed in you cowboy well youve a light and steady seat he looked back out at the trampled ground youre right it was a good fight damn right but the next one wont be so easy his eyebrows winged up and that one was easy compared to whats coming bet your ass well then the gods help us all and if youve a mind to cook eggs and bacon with it thatd be fine might as well eat our fill while we still have stomachs cheery thought blair decided as she went inside the hell of it was hed meant it that way shed never known anyone so offhand about life and death not resigned shed been raised to be resigned to it just a kind of confidence that hed live as he chose to live until he stopped living she admired the viewpoint shed been raised to know the monster under the bed was real and was just waiting until you relaxed before it ripped your throat out shed been trained to put that moment off as long as she could stand and fight to slash and to burn and take out as many as humanly possible because under the strength the wit and the endless training was the knowledge that some day some way she wouldnt be fast enough smart enough lucky enough and the monster would win still thered always been a balance to it demon and hunter with each the others prey now the stakes had been raised skyfrickinghigh she thought as she made coffee now it wasnt just the duty and tradition that had been passed down through her blood for damn near a millennium now it was a fight to save humankind she was here with this strange little band two of which vampire and sorcerer turned out to be her ancestors to fight the mother of all battles two months she thought until halloween till samhain and the final showdown the goddess had prophesied theyd have to be ready she decided as she poured the first cup because the alternative just wasnt an option she carried her coffee upstairs into her room as quarters went it had it all over her apartment in chicago where shed based herself over the last year and a half the bed boasted a tall headboard with carved dragons on either side a woman could feel like a spellbound princess in that bed if she was of a fanciful state of mind despite the fact the place was owned by a vampire there was a wide mirror framed in thick mahogany the wardrobe would have held three times the amount of clothes shed brought with her so she used it for secondary weapons and tucked her traveling wardrobe in the chest of drawers the walls were painted a dusky plum and the art on them woodland scenes of twilight or predawn so that the room seemed to be in perpetual shadow if the curtains were drawn but that was all right she had lived a great deal of her life in the shadows but she opened the curtains now so morning spilled in and then sat at the gorgeous little desk to check her email on her laptop she couldnt prevent the little flicker of hope or stop it from dying out as she saw there was still no return message from her father nothing new she reminded herself and tipped back in the chair he was traveling somewhere in south america to the best of her knowledge and she only knew that much because her brother had told her it had been six months since shed had any contact with him and there was nothing new about that either his duty to her had been in his opinion fulfilled years ago and maybe he was right hed taught her hed trained her though shed never been good enough to merit his approval she simply didnt have the right equipment she wasnt his son the disappointment hed felt when it had been his daughter instead of his son whod inherited the gift was something hed never bothered to hide softening blows of any sort just wasnt sean murphys style hed pretty much dusted her off his hands on her eighteenth birthday now shed embarrassed herself by sending him a second message when hed never answered the first shed sent that first email before shed left for ireland to tell him something was up something was twitching and she wanted his advice so much for that she thought now and so much for trying again after her arrival to tell him what was twitching was major he had his own life his own course and had never pretended otherwise it was her own problem her own lack that she still coveted his approval shed given up on earning his love a long time ago she turned off the computer pulled on a sweatshirt and shoes she decided to go up to the training room and work off frustration work up an appetite lifting weights the house shed been told had been the one hoyt and his brother cian had been born in in the dawn of the twelfth century it had been modernized of course and some additions had been made but she could see from the original structure the mac cionaoiths had been a family of considerable means of course cian had had nearly a millennium to make his own fortune to acquire the house again though from the bits and pieces shed picked up he didnt live in it she didnt make a habit out of conversing with vampires just killing them but she was making an exception with cian for reasons that werent entirely clear to her he was fighting with them even bankrolling their little war party to some extent added to that shed seen the way hed fought the night before with a ruthless ferocity his allegiance could be the element that tipped the scales in their favor she wound her way up the stone stairs toward what had once been the great hall then a ballroom in later years and was now their training room she stopped short when she saw larkins cousin moira doing chest extensions with fivepound free weights the geallian wore her brown hair back in a thick braid that reached her waist sweat dribbled down her temples and more darkened the back of the white tshirt she wore her eyes fog gray were staring straight ahead focused blair assumed on whatever got her through the reps she was by blairs gauge about fivethree maybe a hundred and ten pounds after youd dragged her out of a lake but she was game having game held a lot of weight on blairs scale what blair had initially judged as mousiness was in actuality a watchfulness the woman soaked up everything thought you were still in bed blair said as she stepped inside moira lowered the weights then used her forearm to swipe her brow ive been up for a bit youre wanting to use the room yeah plenty of room in here for both of us blair walked over selected tenpound weights not hunkered down with the books this morning i on a sigh moira stretched out her arms as shed been taught she might have wished her arms were as sleek and carved with muscle as blairs but no one would call them soft any longer ive been starting the day here before i use the library usually before anyones up and about okay curious blair studied moira as she worked her triceps and youre keeping this a secret because not a secret not exactly a secret moira picked up a bottle of water twisted off the cap twisted it back on im the weakest of us i dont need you or cian to tell me that though one or the other of you make a point to let me know it with some regularity something gave a little twist inside blairs belly and that sucks im going to tell you im sorry about that because i know how it feels to get slammed down when youre doing your best my best isnt altogether that good is it no im not looking for sorry she said before blair could speak its hard to be told youre lacking but thats what i am for now so i come up here in the mornings early and lift these bloody things the way you showed me i wont be the weak one the one the rest of you have to worry about you dont have much muscle yet but youve got some speed and youre a frigging genius with a bow if you werent so good with it things wouldnt have turned out the way they did last night work on my weaknesses and on my strengths on my own time thats what you said to me and it made me angry until i saw the wisdom of it im not angry youre good at training king was he was more easy on me i think because he was a man a big man at that moira added with sorrow in her eyes now who had affection for me i think because i was the smallest of us blair hadnt met king cians friend whod been captured then killed by lilith then turned and sent back as a vampire i wont be easy on you blair promised b y the time shed finished a session with the weights and grabbed a quick shower blair had worked up that appetite she decided to go for one of her favorites and dug up the makings for french toast she tossed some irish bacon into a skillet for protein selected green day on her mp player music to cook by she poured her second cup of coffee before breaking eggs in a bowl she was beating the batter when larkin strolled in the door he stopped stared at her player and what is it its a how to explain a way to whistle while you work no its not the machine im meaning there are so many of those i cant keep them all in my brain but whats the sound oh um popular music rock of the hard variety he was grinning now head cocked as he listened rock i like it who wouldnt not going for eggs this morning doing up french toast toast disappointment fell over his face erasing the easy pleasure of the music just cooked bread not just besides you get what you get when im manning the stove or you forage on your own its kind of you to cook of course his tone was so longsuffering she had to swallow a laugh relax and trust me on this ive seen you chow down cowboy youre going to like it as much as rock especially after you drown it in butter and syrup ill have it going in a minute why dont you flip that bacon over im needing to wash first been mucking out the stall and such and im not fit yet to touch anything she lifted a brow as he strolled right out shed seen him slip out of all manner of kitchen duties already and she had to admit he was slick about it resigned she turned the bacon herself then heated a second skillet she was about to dunk the first piece of bread when she heard voices the newlyweds were up she realized and added to the batter to accommodate them effortless style it was something glenna had in spades blair thought she wandered in wearing a sage green sweater and black jeans with her bold red hair swinging straight and loose the urban take on country casual blair supposed when you added the pretty flush of a woman whod obviously had her morning snuggles you had quite a package she didnt look like a woman who would rush a squad of vampires while she bellowed war cries and swung a battleax but shed done just that mmm french toast you must have read my mind as she moved to the coffeepot glenna gave blairs arm an absent stroke give you a hand no i got this youve been taking the lions share of kp and im better at breakfast than dinner didnt i hear hoyt right behind me hes talking to larkin about the horse i think hoyts a little put out he didnt get to vlad before larkin did coffees good howd you sleep like id been knocked unconscious for a couple hours blair dipped bread then laid it to sizzle then i dont know too restless wired up she slanted glenna a look and nowhere to put the excess energy like the bride i have to admit im feeling pretty loose and relaxed this morning except wincing a little glenna massaged her right biceps my arms feel like i spent half the night swinging a sledgehammer battleax has weight you did good work with it work isnt the word that comes to mind but im not going to think about it at least not until ive gorged myself turning glenna opened a cupboard for plates do you know how often i had a breakfast like this fried bread fried meat before all this started nope never absolutely never she added with a half laugh i watched my weight as if the well as if the fate of the world depended on it youre training hard blair flipped the bread you need the fuel the carbs if you put on a few pounds i can guarantee its going to be pure muscle blair glenna glanced toward the doorway to ensure hoyt hadnt started in yet youve got more experience with this than any of us just between you and me for now anyway how did we do last night we lived blair said flatly she continued to cook sliding fried bread onto a plate dunking more thats bottom line but glenna ill tell you straight blair turned leaning back on the counter for a moment while bread sizzled and scented the air ive never been in anything like that before but youve been doing this hunting them for years thats right and ive never seen so many of them in one place at one time never seen them organized that way glenna let out a quiet breath that cant be good news good or bad its fact its not never been in my experience the nature of the beast to live work fight in large groups i contacted my aunt and she says the same theyre killers and they might travel hunt even live together in packs small packs and there might be an alpha male or female but not like this not like an army glenna murmured no and what we saw last night was a squad a small slice of an army the thing is theyre willing to die for her for lilith and thats powerful stuff okay okay glenna said as she set the table thats what i get for saying i wanted it straight hey buck up we lived remember thats a victory good morning to you hoyt said to blair as he came in then his gaze went straight to glenna they shared coloring blair thought she and her howevermanytimes greatuncle she the sorcerer and his twin brother the vampire shared coloring and ancestry and now this mission she supposed fate was certainly a twisty bastard you two sure have the glow on she said when glenna lifted her face to meet hoyts lips practically need my shades they shield the eyes from the sun and are a sexy fashion statement hoyt returned and made her laugh have a seat she turned off the music then brought the heaping platter to the table i made enough for an army seeing as thats what we are it looks a fine feast thank you just doing my share unlike some of us whore a little more slippery she met larkins perfectly timed appearance with a shake of her head right on time his expression was both innocent and affable is it ready then it took me a bit longer to get back as i stopped to tell moira there was food being cooked and a welcome sight it is you look you eat blair slapped four slices of french toast on a plate for him and you and your cousin do the dishes
