miltons comus contents page introduction vii comus notes index to the notes introduction few poems have been more variously designated than comus milton himself describes it simply as a mask by others it has been criticised and estimated as a lyrical drama a drama in the epic style a lyric poem in the form of a play a phantasy an allegory a philosophical poem a suite of speeches or majestic soliloquies and even a didactic poem such variety in the description of the poem is explained partly by its complex charm and manysided interest and partly by the desire to describe it from that point of view which should best reconcile its literary form with what we know of the genius and powers of its author those who like dr johnson have blamed it as a drama have admired it as a series of lines or as a lyric one writer who has found that its characters are nothing its sentiments tedious its story uninteresting has nevertheless doubted whether there will ever be any similar poem which gives so true a conception of the capacity and the dignity of the mind by which it was produced bagehots literary studies some who have praised it as an allegory see in it a satire on the evils both of the church and of the state while others regard it as alluding to the vices of the court alone some have found its lyrical parts the best while others charmed with its divine philosophy have commended those deep conceits which place it alongside of the faerie queen as shadowing forth an episode in the education of a noble soul and as a poets lesson against intemperance and impurity but no one can refuse to admit that more than any other of miltons shorter poems it gives us an insight into the peculiar genius and character of its author it was in the opinion of hallam sufficient to convince any one of taste and feeling that a great poet had arisen in england and one partly formed in a different school from his contemporaries it is true that in the early poems we do not find the whole of milton for he had yet to pass through many years of trouble and controversy but comus in a special degree reveals or foreshadows much of the milton of paradise lost whether we regard its place in miltons life in the series of his works or in english literature as a whole the poem is full of significance it is worth while therefore to consider how its form was determined by the external circumstances and previous training of the poet by his favourite studies in poetry philosophy history and music and by his noble theory of life in general and of a poets life in particular the mask was represented at ludlow castle on september th it was probably composed early in that year it belongs therefore to that group of poems lallegro il penseroso arcades comus and lycidas written by milton while living in his fathers house at horton near windsor after having left the university of cambridge in july as he was born in he would be twentyfive years of age when this poem was composed during his stay at horton which was broken only by a journey to italy in he was chiefly occupied with the study of the greek roman italian and english literatures each of which has left its impress on comus he read widely and carefully and it has been said that his great and original imagination was almost entirely nourished or at least stimulated by books his residence at horton was accordingly preeminently what he intended it to be and what his father wisely and gladly permitted it to be a time of preparation and ripening for the work to which he had dedicated himself we are reminded of his own words in comus and wisdoms self oft seeks to sweet retired solitude where with her best nurse contemplation she plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings that in the various bustle of resort were all toruffled and sometimes impaired we find in comus abundant reminiscences of miltons study of the literature of antiquity it would not be too much to say that the literature of antiquity was to miltons genius what soil and light are to a plant it nourished it coloured it developed it it determined not merely his character as an artist but it exercised an influence on his intellect and temper scarcely less powerful than hereditary instincts and contemporary history it at once animated and chastened his imagination it modified his fancy it furnished him with his models on it his taste was formed on it his style was moulded from it his diction and his method derived their peculiarities it transformed what would in all probability have been the mere counterpart of caedmons paraphrase or langlands vision into paradise lost and what would have been the mere counterpart of corydons doleful knell and the satire of the three estates into lycidas and comus quarterly review no but milton has also told us that spenser was his master and the full charm of comus cannot be realised without reference to the artistic and philosophical spirit of the author of the faerie queene both poems deal with the war between the body and the soul between the lower and the higher nature in an essay on spenser as a philosophic poet de vere says the perils and degradations of an animalised life are shown under the allegory of sir guyons sea voyage with its successive storms and whirlpools its rock of reproach strewn with wrecks and dead mens bones its wandering islands its quicksands of unthriftihead its whirlepoole of decay its seamonsters and lastly its bower of bliss and the doom which overtakes it together with the deliverance of acrasias victims transformed by that witchs spells into beasts still more powerful is the allegory of worldly ambition illustrated under the name of the cave of mammon the legend of holiness delineates with not less insight those enemies which wage war upon the spiritual life all this milton had studied in the faerie queene and had understood it and like sir guyon he felt himself to be a knight enrolled under the banner of parity and selfcontrol so that in comus we find the sovereign value of temperance or selfregulation what the greeks called sphrosyn set forth no less clearly than in spensers poem in miltons mask it becomes almost identical with virtue itself the enchantments of acrasia in her bower of bliss become the spells of comus the armour of belphoebe becomes the complete steel of chastity while the supremacy of conscience the bounty of nature and mans ingratitude the unloveliness of mammon and of excess the blossom of courtesy oft found on lowly stalk and the final triumph of virtue through striving and temptation all are dwelt upon it is the mind that maketh good or ill that maketh wretch or happie rich or poore so speaks spenser and milton similarly he that has light within his own clear breast may sit i the centre and enjoy bright day but he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts benighted walks under the midday sun himself is his own dungeon in endeavouring still further to trace by means of verbal or structural resemblances the sources from which milton drew his materials for comus critics have referred to peeles old wives tale to fletchers pastoral the faithful shepherdess of which charles lamb has said that if all its parts had been in unison with its many innocent scenes and sweet lyric intermixtures it had been a poem fit to vie with comus or the arcadia to have been put into the hands of boys and virgins to have made matter for young dreams like the loves of hermia and lysander to ben jonsons mask of pleasure reconciled to virtue in which comus is the god of cheer or the belly and to the comus of erycius puteanus henri du puy professor of eloquence at louvain it is true that fletchers pastoral was being acted in london about the time milton was writing his comus that the poem by the dutch professor was republished at oxford in and that resemblances are evident between miltons poem and those named but professor masson does well in warning us that infinitely too much has been made of such coincidences after all of them even the most ideal and poetical the feeling in reading comus is that all here is different all peculiar whatever milton borrowed he borrowed as he says himself in order to better it it is interesting to consider the mutual relations of the poems written by milton at horton everything that milton wrote is miltonic he had what has been called the power of transforming everything into himself and these poems are accordingly evidences of the development of miltons opinions and of his secret purpose it has been said that lallegro and il penseroso are to be regarded as the pleadings the decision on which is in comus lallegro representing the cavalier and il penseroso the puritan element this is true only in a limited sense it is true that the puritan element in the horton series of poems becomes more patent as we pass from the two lyrics to the mask of comus and from comus to the elegy of lycidas just as in the corresponding periods of time the evils connected with the reign of charles i and with lauds crusade against puritanism were becoming more pronounced but we can hardly regard milton as having expressed any new decision in comus the decision is already made when vain deluding joys are banished in il penseroso and loathed melancholy in lallegro the mask is an expansion and exaltation of the delights of the contemplative man but there is still a place for the unreproved pleasures of the cheerful man unless it were so comus could not have been written there would have been no sunshine holiday for the rustics and no victorious dance for the gentle lady and her brothers but in comus we realise the mutual relation of lallegro and il penseroso we see their application to the joys and sorrows of the actual life of individuals we observe human nature in contact with the hard assays of life and subsequently in lycidas we are made to realise that this human nature is miltons own and to understand how it was that his puritanism which three years before had permitted him to write a cavalier mask should three years after lead him from the fresh fields of poetry into the barren plains of controversial prose the mask was a favourite form of entertainment in england in miltons youth and had been so from the time of henry viii in whose reign elaborate masked shows introduced from italy first became popular but they seem to have found their way into england in a crude form even earlier and we read of court disguisings in the reign of edward iii it is usually said that the mask derives its name from the fact that the actors wore masks and in halls chronicle we read that in on the day of epiphany at night the king with eleven others was disguised after the manner of italy called a mask a thing not seen before in england they were appareled in garments long and broad wrought all with gold with visors and caps of gold the truth however seems to be that the use of a visor was not essential in such entertainments which from the first were called masks the word masker being used sometimes of the players and sometimes of their disguises the word has come to us through the french form masque cognate with spanish mascarada a masquerade or assembly of maskers otherwise called a mummery up to the time of henry viii these entertainments were of the nature of dumbshow or tableaux vivants and delighted the spectators chiefly by the splendour of the costumes and machinery employed in their representation but afterwards the chief actors spoke their parts singing and dancing were introduced and the composition of masks for royal and other courtly patrons became an occupation worthy of a poet they were frequently combined with other forms of amusement all of which were in the case of the court placed under the management of a master of revels whose official title was magister jocorum revellorum et mascorum in the first printed english tragedy gorboduc each act opens with what is called a dumbshow or mask but the more elaborate form of the mask soon grew to be an entertainment complete in itself and the demand for such became so great in the time of james i and charles i that the history of these reigns might almost be traced in the succession of masks then written ben jonson who thoroughly established the mask in english literature wrote many court masks and made them a vehicle less for the display of painting and carpentry than for the expression of the intellectual and social life of his time his masks are excelled only by comus and possess in a high degree that doric delicacy in their songs and odes which sir henry wotton found so ravishing in miltons mask jonson in his lifetime declared that next himself only fletcher and chapman could write a mask and apart from the compositions of these writers and of william browne inner temple masque there are few specimens worthy to be named along with jonsons until we come to miltons arcades other maskwriters were middleton dekker shirley carew and davenant and it is interesting to note that in carews coelum brittanicum for which lawes composed the music the two boys who afterwards acted in comus had juvenile parts it has been pointed out that the popularity of the mask in miltons youth received a stimulus from the puritan hatred of the theatre which found expression at that time and drove nonpuritans to welcome the mask as a protest against that spirit which saw nothing but evil in every form of dramatic entertainment milton who enjoyed the theatre both jonsons learned sock and what ennobled hath the buskined stage was led through his friendship with the musician lawes to compose a mask to celebrate the entry of the earl of bridgewater upon his office of lord president of the council in the principality of wales and the marches of the same he had already written also at the request of lawes a mask or portion of a mask called arcades and the success of this may have stimulated him to higher effort the result was comus in which the mask reached its highest level and after which it practically faded out of our literature miltons two masks arcades and comus were written for members of the same noble family the former in honour of the countess dowager of derby and the latter in honour of john first earl of bridgewater who was both her stepson and soninlaw this twofold relation arose from the fact that the earl was the son of viscount brackley the countesss second husband and had himself married lady frances stanley a daughter of the countess by her first husband the fifth earl of derby amongst the children of the earl of bridgewater were three who took important parts in the representation of comus alice the youngest daughter then about fourteen years of age who appeared as the lady john viscount brackley who took the part of the elder brother and thomas egerton who appeared as the second brother we do not know who acted the parts of comus and sabrina but the part of the attendant spirit was taken by henry lawes gentleman of the chapel royal and one of his majestys private musicians the earls children were his pupils and the mask was naturally produced under his direction miltons friendship with lawes is shown by the sonnet which the poet addressed to the musician harry whose tuneful and well measurd song first taught our english music how to span words with just note and accent not to scan with midas ears committing short and long thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng with praise enough for envy to look wan to after age thou shalt be writ the man that with smooth air couldst humour best our tongue thou honourst verse and verse must lend her wing to honour thee the priest of phoebus quire that tunst their happiest lines in hymn or story dante shall give fame leave to set thee higher than his casella who he wood to sing met in the milder shades of purgatory we must remember also that it was to lawes that miltons comus owed its first publication and as we see from the dedication prefixed to the text that he was justly proud of his share in its first representation such were the persons who appeared in miltons mask they are few in number and the plan of the piece is correspondingly simple there are three scenes which may be briefly characterised thus i the tempter and the tempted lines scene a wild wood ii the temptation and the rescue lines scene the palace of comus iii the triumph lines scene the presidents castle in the first scene after a kind of prologue lines the interest rises as we are introduced first to comus and his rout then to the lady alone and nightfoundered and finally to comus and the lady in company at the same time the nature of the ladys trial and her subsequent victory are foreshadowed in a conversation between the brothers and the attendant spirit this is one of the more miltonic parts of the mask in the philosophical reasoning of the elder brother as opposed to the matteroffact arguments of the younger we trace the young poet fresh from the study of the divine volume of plato and filled with a noble trust in god in the second scene we breathe the unhallowed air of the abode of the wily tempter who endeavours under fair pretence of friendly ends to wind himself into the pure heart of the lady but his gay rhetoric is futile against the sunclad power of chastity and he is driven off the scene by the two brothers who are led and instructed by the spirit disguised as the shepherd thyrsis but the lady having been lured into the haunt of impurity is left spellbound and appeal is made to the pure nymph sabrina who is swift to aid a virgin such as was herself in hardbesetting need it is in the contention between comus and the lady in this scene that the interest of the mask may be said to culminate for here its purpose stands revealed it is a song to temperance as the ground of freedom to temperance as the guard of all the virtues to beauty as secured by temperance and its central point and climax is in the pleading of these motives by the lady against their opposites in the mouth of the lord of sensual revel milton classical writers in the third scene the lady alice and her brothers are presented by the spirit to their noble father and mother as triumphing in victorious dance oer sensual folly and intemperance the spirit then speaks the epilogue calling upon mortals who love true freedom to strive after virtue love virtue she alone is free she can teach ye how to climb higher than the sphery chime or if virtue feeble were heaven itself would stoop to her the last couplet milton afterwards on his italian journey entered in an album belonging to an italian named cerdogni and underneath it the words coelum non animum muto dum trans mare curro and his signature joannes miltonius anglus the juxtaposition of these verses is significant though he had left his own land milton had not become what fifty or sixty years before roger ascham had condemned as an italianated englishman he was one of those worthy gentlemen of england whom all the siren tongues of italy could never untwine from the mast of gods word nor no enchantment of vanity overturn them from the fear of god and love of honesty aschams scholemaster and one might almost infer that milton in his account of the sovereign plant haemony which was to foil the wiles of comus had remembered not only homers description of the root moly that hermes once to wise ulysses gavea but also aschams remarks thereupon the true medicine against the enchantments of circe the vanity of licentious pleasure the enticements of all sin is in homer the herb moly with the black root and white flower sour at first but sweet in the end which hesiod termeth the study of virtue hard and irksome in the beginning but in the end easy and pleasant and that which is most to be marvelled at the divine poet homer saith plainly that this medicine against sin and vanity is not found out by man but given and taught by god miltons comus like his last great poems is a poetical expression of the same belief his poetical works the outcome of his inner life his life of artistic contemplation are in the words of prof dowden various renderings of one dominant idea that the struggle for mastery between good and evil is the prime fact of life and that a final victory of the righteous cause is assured by the existence of a divine order of the universe which milton knew by the name of providence footnotes a it is noteworthy that lamb whose allusiveness is remarkable employs in his account of the plant moly almost the exact words of miltons description of haemony compare the following extract from the adventures of ulysses with lines of comus the flower of the herb moly which is sovereign against enchantments the moly is a small unsightly root its virtues but little known and in low estimation the dull shepherd treads on it every day with his clouted shoes but it bears a small white flower which is medicinal against charms blights mildews and damps comus a mask presented at ludlow castle before john earl of bridgewater then president of wales the copy of a letter written by sir henry wotton to the author upon the following poem from the college this of april sir it was a special favour when you lately bestowed upon me here the first taste of your acquaintance though no longer than to make me know that i wanted more time to value it and to enjoy it rightly and in truth if i could then have imagined your farther stay in these parts which i understood afterwards by mr h i would have been bold in our vulgar phrase to mend my draught for you left me with an extreme thirst and to have begged your conversation again jointly with your said learned friend at a poor meal or two that we might have banded together some good authors of the antient time among which i observed you to have been familiar since your going you have charged me with new obligations both for a very kind letter from you dated the sixth of this month and for a dainty piece of entertainment which came therewith wherein i should much commend the tragical part if the lyrical did not ravish me with a certain doric delicacy in your songs and odes whereunto i must plainly confess to have seen yet nothing parallel in our language ipsa mollitiesa but i must not omit to tell you that i now only owe you thanks for intimating unto me how modestly soever the true artificer for the work itself i had viewed some good while before with singular delight having

directions for shaping of your farther journey into italy where he did reside by my choice some time for the king after mine own recess from venice i should think that your best line will be through the whole length of france to marseilles and thence by sea to genoa whence the passage into tuscany is as diurnal as a gravesend barge i hasten as you do to florence or siena the rather to tell you a short story from the interest you have given me in your safety at siena i was tabled in the house of one alberto scipione an old roman courtier in dangerous times having been steward to the duca di pagliano who with all his family were strangled save this only man that escaped by foresight of the tempest with him i had often much chat of those affairs into which he took pleasure to look back from his native harbour and at my departure toward rome which had been the centre of his experience i had won confidence enough to beg his advice how i might carry myself securely there without offence of others or of mine own conscience signor arrigo mio says he i pensieri stretti ed il viso scioltoa will go safely over the whole world of which delphian oracle for so i have found it your judgment doth need no commentary and therefore sir i will commit you with it to the best of all securities gods dear love remaining your friend as much to command as any of longer date henry wotton

live insphered in regions mild of calm and serene air above the smoke and stir of this dim spot which men call earth and with lowthoughted care confined and pestered in this pinfold here strive to keep up a frail and feverish being unmindful of the crown that virtue gives after this mortal change to her true servants amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats yet some there be that by due steps aspire to lay their just hands on that golden key that opes the palace of eternity to such my errand is and but for such i would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds with the rank vapours of this sinworn mould but to my task neptune besides the sway of every salt flood and each ebbing stream took in by lot twixt high and nether jove imperial rule of all the seagirt isles that like to rich and

charge with tempered awe to guide an old and haughty nation proud in arms where his fair offspring nursed in princely lore are coming to attend their fathers state and newintrusted sceptre but their way lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood the nodding horror of whose shady brows threats the forlorn and wandering passenger and here their tender age might suffer peril but that by quick command from sovran jove i was despatched for their defence and guard and listen why for i will tell you now what never yet was heard in tale or song from old or modern bard in hall or bower bacchus that first from out the purple grape crushed the sweet poison of misusd wine after the tuscan mariners transformed coasting the tyrrhene shore as the winds listed on circes island fell who

berries wreathed and his blithe youth had by him ere he parted thence a son much like his father but his mother more whom therefore she brought up and comus named who ripe and frolic of his fullgrown age roving the celtic and iberian fields at last betakes him to this ominous wood and in thick shelter of black shades imbowered excels his mother at her mighty art offering to every weary traveller his orient liquor in a crystal glass to quench the drouth of phoebus which as they taste for most do taste through fond intemperate thirst soon as the potion works their human countnance the express resemblance of the gods is changed into some brutish form of wolf or bear or ounce or tiger hog or bearded goat all other parts remaining as they were and they so perfect is their misery not once perceive their foul disfigurement but boast themselves more comely than before and all their friends and native home forget to roll with pleasure in a sensual sty therefore when any favoured of high jove chances to pass through this adventurous glade swift as the sparkle of a glancing star i shoot from heaven to give him safe convoy as now i do but first i must put off these my skyrobes spun out of iris woof and take the weeds and likeness of a swain that to the service of this house belongs who with his soft pipe and smoothdittied song well knows to still the wild winds when they roar and hush the waving woods nor of less faith and in this office of his mountain watch likeliest and nearest to the present aid of this occasion but i hear the tread of hateful steps i must be viewless now

of riot and illmanaged merriment such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds when for their teeming flocks and granges full in wanton dance they praise the bounteous pan and thank the gods amiss i should be loth to meet the rudeness and swilled insolence of such late wassailers yet oh where else shall i inform my unacquainted feet in the blind mazes of this tangled wood my brothers when they saw me wearied out with this long way resolving here to lodge under the spreading favour of these pines stepped as they said to the next thicketside to bring me berries or such cooling fruit as the kind hospitable woods provide they left me then when the greyhooded even like a sad votarist in palmers weed rose from the hindmost wheels of phoebus wain but where they are and why they came not back is now the labour of my thoughts tis likeliest they had engaged their wandering steps too far and envious darkness ere they could return had stole them from me else o thievish night why shouldst thou but for some felonious end in thy dark lantern thus close up the stars that nature hung in heaven and filled their lamps with everlasting oil to give due light to the misled and lonely traveller this is the place as well as i may guess whence even now the tumult of loud mirth was rife and perfect in my listening ear yet nought but single darkness do i find what might this be a thousand fantasies begin to throng into my memory of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire and airy tongues that syllable mens names on sands and shores and desert wildernesses these thoughts may startle well but not astound the virtuous mind that ever walks attended by a strong siding champion conscience o welcome pureeyed faith whitehanded hope thou hovering angel girt with golden wings and thou unblemished form of chastity i see ye visibly and now believe that he the supreme good to whom all things ill are but as slavish officers of vengeance would send a glistering guardian if need were to keep my life and honour unassailed was i deceived or did a sable cloud turn forth her silver lining on the night i did not err there does a sable cloud turn forth her silver lining on the night and casts a gleam over this tufted grove i cannot hallo to my brothers but such noise as i can make to be heard farthest ill venture for my newenlivened spirits prompt me and they perhaps are not far off song sweet echo sweetest nymph that livst unseen within thy airy shell by slow meanders margent green and in the violetembroidered vale where the lovelorn nightingale nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair that likest thy narcissus are o if thou have hid them in some flowery cave tell me but where sweet queen of parley daughter of the sphere so mayst thou be translated to the skies and give resounding grace to all heavens harmonies comus can any mortal mixture of earths mould breathe such divine enchanting ravishment sure something holy lodges in that breast and with these raptures moves the vocal air to testify his hidden residence how sweetly did they float upon the wings of silence through the emptyvaulted night at every fall smoothing the raven down of darkness till it smiled i have oft heard my mother circe with the sirens three amidst the flowerykirtled naiades culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs who as they sung would take the prisoned soul and lap it in elysium scylla wept and chid her barking waves into attention and fell charybdis murmured soft applause yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense and in sweet madness robbed it of itself but such a sacred and homefelt delight such sober certainty of waking bliss i never heard till now ill speak to her and she shall be my queen hail foreign wonder whom certain these rough shades did never breed unless the goddess that in rural shrine dwellst here with pan or sylvan by blest song forbidding every bleak unkindly fog to touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood lady nay gentle shepherd ill is lost that praise that is addressed to unattending ears not any boast of skill but extreme shift how to regain my severed company compelled me to awake the courteous echo to give me answer from her mossy couch comus what chance good lady hath bereft you thus lady dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth comus could that divide you from nearushering guides lady they left me weary on a grassy turf comus by falsehood or discourtesy or why lady to seek i the valley some cool friendly spring comus and left your fair side all unguarded lady lady they were but twain and purposed quick return comus perhaps forestalling night prevented them lady how easy my misfortune is to hit comus imports their loss beside the present need lady no less than if i should my brothers lose comus were they of manly prime or youthful bloom lady as smooth as hebes their unrazored lips comus two such i saw what time the laboured ox in his loose traces from the furrow came and the swinked hedger at his supper sat i saw them under a green mantling vine that crawls along the side of yon small hill plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots their port was more than human as they stood i took it for a faery vision of some gay creatures of the element that in the colours of the rainbow live and play i the plighted clouds i was awestrook and as i passed i worshiped if those you seek it were a journey like the path to heaven to help you find them lady gentle villager what readiest way would bring me to that place comus due west it rises from this shrubby point lady to find out that good shepherd i suppose in such a scant allowance of starlight would overtask the best landpilots art without the sure guess of wellpractised feet comus i know each lane and every alley green dingle or bushy dell of this wild wood and every bosky bourn from side to side my daily walks and ancient neighbourhood and if your stray attendance be yet lodged or shroud within these limits i shall know ere morrow wake or the lowroosted lark from her thatched pallet rouse if otherwise i can conduct you lady to a low but loyal cottage where you may be safe till further quest lady shepherd i take thy word and trust thy honestoffered courtesy which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds with smoky rafters than in tapestry halls and courts of princes where it first was named and yet is most pretended in a place less warranted than this or less secure i cannot be that i should fear to change it eye me blest providence and square my trial to my proportioned strength shepherd lead on exeunt enter the two brothers elder brother unmuffle ye faint stars and thou fair moon that wontst to love the travellers benison stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud and disinherit chaos that reigns here in double night of darkness and of shades or if your influence be quite dammed up with black usurping mists some gentle taper though a rushcandle from the wicker hole of some clay habitation visit us with thy long levelled rule of streaming light and thou shalt be our star of arcady or tyrian cynosure second brother or if our eyes be barred that happiness might we but hear the folded flocks penned in their wattled cotes or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops or whistle from the lodge or village cock count the nightwatches to his feathery dames twould be some solace yet some little cheering in this close dungeon of innumerous boughs but oh that hapless virgin our lost sister where may she wander now whither betake her from the chill dew amongst rude burs and thistles perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now or gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm leans her unpillowed head fraught with sad fears what if in wild amazement and affright or while we speak within the direful grasp of savage hunger or of savage heat elder brother peace brother be not overexquisite to cast the fashion of uncertain evils for grant they be so while they rest unknown what need a man forestall his date of grief and run to meet what he would most avoid or if they be but false alarms of fear how bitter is such selfdelusion i do not think my sister so to seek or so unprincipled in virtues book and the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever as that the single want of light and noise not being in danger as i trust she is not could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts and put them into misbecoming plight virtue could see to do what virtue would by her own radiant light though sun and moon were in the flat sea sunk and wisdoms self oft seeks to sweet retired solitude where with her best nurse contemplation she plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings that in the various bustle of resort were all toruffled and sometimes impaired he that has light within his own clear breast may sit i the centre and enjoy bright day but he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts benighted walks under the midday sun himself is his own dungeon second brother tis most true that musing meditation most affects the pensive secrecy of desert cell far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds and sits as safe as in a senatehouse for who would rob a hermit of his weeds his few books or his beads or maple dish or do his grey hairs any violence but beauty like the fair hesperian tree laden with blooming gold had need the guard of dragonwatch with unenchanted eye to save her blossoms and defend her fruit from the rash hand of bold incontinence you may as well spread out the unsunned heaps of misers treasure by an outlaws den and tell me it is safe as bid me hope danger will wink on opportunity and let a single helpless maiden pass uninjured in this wild surrounding waste of night or loneliness it recks me not i fear the dread events that dog them both lest some illgreeting touch attempt the person of our unownd sister elder brother i do not brother infer as if i thought my sisters state secure without all doubt or controversy yet where an equal poise of hope and fear does arbitrate the event my nature is that i incline to hope rather than fear and gladly banish squint suspicion my sister is not so defenceless left as you imagine she has a hidden strength which you remember not second brother what hidden strength unless the strength of heaven if you mean that elder brother i mean that too but yet a hidden strength which if heaven gave it may be termed her own tis chastity my brother chastity she that has that is clad in cmplete steel and like a quivered nymph with arrows keen may trace huge forests and unharboured heaths infmous hills and sandy perilous wilds where through the sacred rays of chastity no savage fierce bandite or mountaineer will dare to soil her virgin purity yea there where very desolation dwells by grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades she may pass on with unblenched majesty be it not done in pride or in presumption some say no evil thing that walks by night in fog or fire by lake or moorish fen blue meagre hag or stubborn unlaid ghost that breaks his magic chains at curfew time no goblin or swart faery of the mine hath hurtful power oer true virginity do ye believe me yet or shall i call antiquity from the old schools of greece to testify the arms of chastity hence had the huntress dian her dread bow fair silvershafted queen for ever chaste wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness and spotted mountainpard but set at nought the frivolous bolt of cupid gods and men feared her stern frown and she was queen o the woods what was that snakyheaded gorgon shield that wise minerva wore unconquered virgin wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone but rigid looks of chaste austerity and noble grace that dashed brute violence with sudden adoration and blank awe so dear to heaven is saintly chastity that when a soul is found sincerely so a thousand liveried angels lackey her driving far off each thing of sin and guilt and in clear dream and solemn vision tell her of things that no gross ear can hear till oft converse with heavenly habitants begin to cast a beam on the outward shape the unpolluted temple of the mind and turns it by degrees to the souls essence till all be made immortal but when lust by unchaste looks loose gestures and foul talk but most by lewd and lavish act of sin lets in defilement to the inward parts the soul grows clotted by contagion imbodies and imbrutes till she quite loose the divine property of her first being such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp oft seen in charnelvaults and sepulchres lingering and sitting by a newmade grave as loth to leave the body that it loved and linked itself by carnal sensualty to a degenerate and degraded state second brother how charming is divine philosophy not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose but musical as is apollos lute and a perpetual feast of nectared sweets where no crude surfeit reigns elder brother list list i hear some faroff hallo break the silent air second brother methought so too what should it be elder brother for certain either some one like us nightfoundered here or else some neighbour woodman or at worst some roving robber calling to his fellows second brother heaven keep my sister again again and near best draw and stand upon our guard elder brother ill hallo if he be friendly he comes well if not defence is a good cause and heaven be for us enter the attendant spirit habited like a shepherd that hallo i should know what are you speak come not too near you fall on iron stakes

his madrigal and sweetened every muskrose of the dale how camest thou here good swain hath any ram slipped from the fold or young kid lost his dam or straggling wether the pent flock forsook how couldst thou find this dark sequestered nook spirit o my loved masters heir and his next joy i came not here on such a trivial toy as a strayed ewe or to pursue the stealth of pilfering wolf not all the fleecy wealth that doth enrich these downs is worth a thought to this my errand and the care it brought but oh my virgin lady where is she how chance she is not in your company elder brother to tell thee sadly shepherd without blame or our neglect we lost her as we came spirit ay me unhappy then my fears are true elder brother what fears good thyrsis prithee briefly shew spirit ill tell ye tis not vain or fabulous though so esteemed by shallow ignorance what the sage poets taught by the heavenly muse storied of old in high immortal verse of dire chimeras and enchanted isles and rifted rocks whose entrance leads to hell for such there be but unbelief is blind within the navel of this hideous wood immured in cypress shades a sorcerer dwells of bacchus and of circe born great comus deep skilled in all his mothers witcheries and here to every thirsty wanderer by sly enticement gives his baneful cup with many murmurs mixed whose pleasing poison the visage quite transforms of him that drinks and the inglorious likeness of a beast fixes instead unmoulding reasons mintage charctered in the face this have i learnt tending my flocks hard by i the hilly crofts that brow this bottom glade whence night by night he and his monstrous rout are heard to howl like stabled wolves or tigers at their prey doing abhorred rites to hecate in their obscurd haunts of inmost bowers yet have they many baits and guileful spells to inveigle and invite the unwary sense of them that pass unweeting by the way this evening late by then the chewing flocks had taen their supper on the savoury herb of knotgrass dewbesprent and were in fold i sat me down to watch upon a bank with ivy canopied and interwove with flaunting honeysuckle and began wrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy to meditate my rural minstrelsy till fancy had her fill but ere a close the wonted roar was up amidst the woods and filled the air with barbarous dissonance at which i ceased and listened them awhile till an unusual stop of sudden silence gave respite to the drowsy frighted steeds that draw the litter of closecurtained sleep at last a soft and solemnbreathing sound rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes and stole upon the air that even silence was took ere she was ware and wished she might deny her nature and be never more still to be so displaced i was all ear and took in strains that might create a soul under the ribs of death but oh ere long too well i did perceive it was the voice of my most honoured lady your dear sister amazed i stood harrowed with grief and fear and o poor hapless nightingale thought i how sweet thou singst how near the deadly snare then down the lawns i ran with headlong haste through paths and turnings often trod by day till guided by mine ear i found the place where that damned wizard hid in sly disguise for so by certain signs i knew had met already ere my best speed could prevent the aidless innocent lady his wished prey who gently asked if he had seen such two supposing him some neighbour villager longer i durst not stay but soon i guessed ye were the two she meant with that i sprung into swift flight till i had found you here but further know i not second brother o night and shades how are ye joined with hell in triple knot against the unarmed weakness of one virgin alone and helpless is this the confidence you gave me brother elder brother yes and keep it still lean on it safely not a period shall be unsaid for me against the threats of malice or of sorcery or that power which erring men call chance this i hold firm virtue may be assailed but never hurt surprised by unjust force but not enthralled yea even that which mischief meant most harm shall in the happy trial prove most glory but evil on itself shall back recoil and mix no more with goodness when at last gathered like scum and settled to itself it shall be in eternal restless change selffed and selfconsumed if this fail the pillared firmament is rottenness and earths base built on stubble but come lets on against the opposing will and arm of heaven may never this just sword be lifted up but for that damned magician let him be girt with all the grisly legions that troop under the sooty flag of acheron harpies and hydras or all the monstrous forms twixt africa and ind ill find him out and force him to return his purchase back or drag him by the curls to a foul death cursed as his life spirit alas good venturous youth i love thy courage yet and bold emprise but here thy sword can do thee little stead far other arms and other weapons must be those that quell the might of hellish charms he with his bare wand can unthread thy joints and crumble all thy sinews elder brother why prithee shepherd how durst thou then thyself approach so near as to make this relation spirit care and utmost shifts how to secure the lady from surprisal brought to my mind a certain shepherd lad of small regard to see to yet well skilled in every virtuous plant and healing herb that spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray he loved me well and oft would beg me sing which when i did he on the tender grass would sit and hearken even to ecstasy and in requital ope his leathern scrip and show me simples of a thousand names telling their strange and vigorous faculties amongst the rest a small unsightly root but of divine effect he culled me out the leaf was darkish and had prickles on it but in another country as he said bore a bright golden flower but not in this soil unknown and like esteemed and the dull swain treads on it daily with his clouted shoon and yet more medcinal is it than that moly that hermes once to wise ulysses gave he called it hmony and gave it me and bade me keep it as of sovran use gainst all enchantments mildew blast or damp or ghastly furies apparition i pursed it up but little reckoning made till now that this extremity compelled but now i find it true for by this means i knew the foul enchanter though disguised entered the very limetwigs of his spells and yet came off if you have this about you as i will give you when we go you may boldly assault the necromancers hall where if he be with dauntless hardihood and brandished blade rush on him break his glass and shed the luscious liquor on the ground but seize his wand though he and his curst crew fierce sign of battle make and menace high or like the sons of vulcan vomit smoke yet will they soon retire if he but shrink elder brother thyrsis lead on apace ill follow thee and some good angel bear a shield before us the scene changes to a stately

primrose season and first behold this cordial julep here that flames and dances in his crystal bounds with spirits of balm and fragrant syrups mixed not that nepenthes which the wife of thone in egypt gave to joveborn helena is of such power to stir up joy as this to life so friendly or so cool to thirst why should you be so cruel to yourself and to those dainty limbs which nature lent for gentle usage and soft delicacy but you invert the covenants of her trust and harshly deal like an ill borrower with that which you received on other terms scorning the unexempt condition by which all mortal frailty must subsist refreshment after toil ease after pain that have been tired all day without repast and timely rest have wanted but fair virgin this will restore all soon lady twill not false traitor twill not restore the truth and honesty that thou hast banished from thy tongue with lies was this the cottage and the safe abode thou toldst me of what grim aspects are these these oughlyheaded monsters mercy guard me hence with thy brewed enchantments foul deceiver hast thou betrayed my credulous innocence with vizored falsehood and base forgery and wouldst thou seek again to trap me here with liquorish baits fit to ensnare a brute were it a draught for juno when she banquets i would not taste thy treasonous offer none but such as are good men can give good things and that which is not good is not delicious to a wellgoverned and wise appetite comus o foolishness of men that lend their ears to those budge doctors of the stoic fur and fetch their precepts from the cynic tub praising the lean and sallow abstinence wherefore did nature pour her bounties forth with such a full and unwithdrawing hand covering the earth with odours fruits and flocks thronging the seas with spawn innumerable but all to please and sate the curious taste and set to work millions of spinning worms that in their green shops weave the smoothhaired silk to deck her sons and that no corner might be vacant of her plenty in her own loins she hutched the allworshipped ore and precious gems to store her children with if all the world should in a pet of temperance feed on pulse drink the clear stream and nothing wear but frieze the allgiver would be unthanked would be unpraised not half his riches known and yet despised and we should serve him as a grudging master as a penurious niggard of his wealth and live like natures bastards not her sons who would be quite surcharged with her own weight and strangled with her waste fertility the earth cumbered and the winged air darked with plumes the herds would overmultitude their lords the sea oerfraught would swell and the unsought diamonds would so emblaze the forehead of the deep and so bestud with stars that they below would grow inured to light and come at last to gaze upon the sun with shameless brows list lady be not coy and be not cozened with that same vaunted name virginity beauty is natures coin must not be hoarded but must be current and the good thereof consists in mutual and partaken bliss unsavoury in the enjoyment of itself if you let slip time like a neglected rose it withers on the stalk with languished head beauty is natures brag and must be shown in courts at feasts and high solemnities where most may wonder at the workmanship it is for homely features to keep home they had their name thence coarse complexions and cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply the sampler and to tease the huswifes wool what need of vermeiltinctured lip for that lovedarting eyes or tresses like the morn there was another meaning in these gifts think what and be advised you are but young yet lady i had not thought to have unlocked my lips in this unhallowed air but that this juggler would think to charm my judgment as mine eyes obtruding false rules pranked in reasons garb i hate when vice can bolt her arguments and virtue has no tongue to check her pride impostor do not charge most innocent nature as if she would her children should be riotous with her abundance she good cateress means her provision only to the good that live according to her sober laws and holy dictate of spare temperance if

dissemble and try her yet more strongly come no more this is mere moral babble and direct against the canon laws of our foundation i must not suffer this yet tis but the lees and settlings of a melancholy blood but this will cure all straight one sip of this will bathe the drooping spirits in delight beyond the bliss of dreams be wise and taste the brothers rush in with swords drawn wrest

mistook ye should have snatched his wand and bound him fast without his rod reversed and backward mutters of dissevering power we cannot free the lady that sits here in stony fetters fixed and

guiltless damsel flying the mad pursuit of her enragd stepdame guendolen commended her fair innocence to the flood that stayed her flight with his crossflowing course the waternymphs that in the bottom played held up their pearled wrists and took her in bearing her straight to aged nereus hall who piteous of her woes reared her lank head and gave her to his daughters to imbathe in nectared lavers strewed with asphodel and through the porch and inlet of each sense dropt in ambrosial oils till she revived and underwent a quick immortal change made goddess of the river still she retains her maiden gentleness and oft at eve visits the herds along the twilight meadows helping all urchin blasts and illluck signs that the shrewd meddling elf delights to make which she with precious vialed liquors heals for which the shepherds at their festivals carol her goodness loud in rustic lays and throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream of pansies pinks and gaudy daffodils and as the old swain said she can unlock the clasping charm and thaw the numbing spell if she be right invoked in warbled song for maidenhood she loves and will be swift to aid a virgin such as was herself in

of asia minor remarkable for the windings of its course hence the verb to meander and hence also in keightleys opinion the mention of the river as a haunt of echo it is more probable however that as the lady addresses echo as the sweet queen of parley and the unhappy lover of the lost narcissus the river is here mentioned because of its associations with music and misfortune the marsyas was a tributary of the maeander and the legend was that the flute upon which marsyas played in his rash contest with apollo was carried into the maeander and after being thrown on land dedicated to apollo the god of song comp lyc where the muses and misfortune are similarly associated by a reference to orpheus whose gory visage and lyre were carried down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore further the maeander is associated with the sorrows of the maiden byblis who seeks her lost brother caunus called by ovid maeandrius juvenis since the above was written prof j w hales has given the following explanation of miltons allusion the real reason is that the meander was a famous haunt of swans and the swan was a favourite bird with the greek and latin writers one to whose sweet singing they perpetually allude athenaeum april margent marge and margin are forms of the same word the violetembroidered vale the notion that flowers broider or ornament the ground is common in poetry comp par lost iv under foot the violet crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay broidered the ground in lyc the flowers themselves wear embroidery the nightingale is made to haunt a violetembroidered vale because these flowers are associated with love see jonsons masque of hymen and with innocence see hamlet iv i would give you some violets but they withered all when my father died prof hales however thinks that some particular vale is here alluded to and argues with much acumen that the poet referred to the woodlands close by athens to the northwest through which the cephissus flowed and where stood the birthplace of sophocles who sings of his native colonus as frequented by nightingales the same critic regards the epithet violetembroidered as a translation of the greek iostephanos crowned with violets frequently applied by aristophanes to athens of which colonus was a suburb macaulay also refers to athens as the violetcrowned city it is at least very probable that milton might here associate the nightingale with colonus as he does in par reg iv see the following note lovelorn nightingale the nightingale whose loved ones are lost comp virgil georg iv as the nightingale wailing in the poplar shade plains for her lost young while she weeps the night through and sitting on a bough reproduces her piteous melody and fills the country round with the plaints of her sorrow lorn and

and in par lost viii it is the amorous bird of night he calls it the attic bird in allusion to the story of philomela the daughter of pandion king of athens near the academy was colonus which sophocles has celebrated as the haunt of nightingales browne philomela was changed at her own prayer into a nightingale that she might escape the vengeance of her brotherinlaw tereus the epithet lovelorn however seems to point to the legend of aedon greek adn a nightingale who having killed her own son by mistake was changed into a nightingale whose mournful song was represented by the greek poets as the lament of the mother for her child her sad song mourneth ie sings her plaintive melody sad song forms a kind of cognate accusative likest thy narcissus narcissus who failed to return the love of echo was punished by being made to fall in love with his own image reflected in a fountain this he could never approach and he accordingly pined away and was changed into the flower which

and the bible john ii he spake of the temple of his body the souls essence as if by a life of purity the body gradually became spiritualised and therefore partook of the souls immortality most above all soul grows clotted this doctrine is expounded in platos phaedo in a conversation between socrates and cebes socrates speaking of the pure soul that soul i say herself invisible departs to the invisible world to the divine and immortal and rational thither arriving she is secure of bliss and is released from the error and folly of men their fears and wild passions and all other human ills and for ever dwells as they say of the initiated in company with the gods is not this true cebes cebes yes beyond a doubt soc but the soul which has been polluted and is impure at the time of her departure and is the companion and servant of the body always and is in love with and fascinated by the body and by the desires and pleasures of the body until she is led to believe that the truth only exists in a bodily form which a man may touch and see and taste and use for the purposes of his lusts the soul i mean accustomed to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual principle which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible and can be attained only by philosophy do you suppose that such a soul will depart pure and unalloyed ceb that is impossible soc she is held fast by the corporeal which the continual association and constant care of the body have wrought into her nature ceb very true soc and this corporeal element my friend is heavy and weighty and earthy and is that element by which such a soul is depressed and dragged down again into the visible world because she is afraid of the invisible and of the world below prowling about tombs and sepulchres in the neighbourhood of which as they tell us are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not departed pure but are cloyed with sight and therefore visible ceb that is very likely socrates soc yes that is very likely cebes and these must be the souls not of the good but of the evil who are compelled to wander about such places in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life and they continue to wander until through the craving after the corporeal which never leaves them they are imprisoned finally in another body and they may be supposed to find their prisons in the same natures which they have had in their former lives further on in the same dialogue socrates says each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the soul to the body until she becomes like the body and believes that to be true which the body affirms to be true and from agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is obliged to have the same habits and haunts and is not likely ever to be

scene after l furlong furrowlong it thus came to mean the length of a field and is now a measure of length many a friend many a is a peculiar idiom which has been explained in different ways one view is that many is a corruption of the french mesnie a train or company and a a corruption of the preposition of the singular noun being then substituted for the plural through confusion of the

thirteenth century the indefinite article began to be inserted thus mony enne thing many a thing just as we say what a thing such a thing this would seem to show that a is not a corruption of of and
