explanatory note of all the roles played by sir harry flashman vc in the course of his distinguished and deplorable career that of crusader must seem the least likely the nine volumes of his papers which have been presented to the public since their discovery in a midlands saleroom in make a scandalous catalogue in which there is little trace of decent feeling let alone altruism from the day of his expulsion from rugby school in the late s flashman the man fulfilled the disgraceful promise of flashman the boy the toadying bounder and bully matured into the cowardly profligate and scoundrel who by chance and shameless opportunism became one of the most renowned heroes of the victorian age unwilling leader of the light brigade fleeing survivor of afghanistan and little big horn tarnished paladin of crimea and the mutiny and cringing chronicler of many another conflict disaster and intrigue in which he bore an inglorious but seldom unprofitable part so it is with initial disbelief that one finds him in this tenth volume of his memoirs not only involved but taking a lead in an enterprise which if hopeless and misguided still shines with the lustre of heroic selfsacrifice and occupies an honoured niche in the pantheon of freedom john browns raid on harpers ferry was a dreadful folly which ended in bloody and inevitable failure and helped to bring on the most catastrophic of all civil wars yet its aim was a great and worthy one the road to hell was never paved with nobler intentions needless to say they were not flashmans he came to harpers ferry with the utmost reluctance through the malice of old enemies and the delusions of old friends and behaved with characteristic perfidy in every way but one his eye for events and people was as clear and scrupulous as ever and it may be that his narrative casts a new and unexpected light on a critical moment in american history and on notable figures of the antebellum years among them the president who never was a legendary detective and secret agent and the strange terrible simple visionary known to the world only by a name and a song who set out to destroy slavery with twenty men and forty rounds apiece it is an amazing story even for flashman but my confidence in that honesty which he brought to his writing seems to be justified by the exactness with which his account fits the known facts as with previous packets of the papers i have observed the wishes of their custodian mr paget morrison and confined myself to amending the authors spelling and providing footnotes and appendices gmf as i sat by the lake at gandamack tother day sipping my late afternoon brandy in the sun damning the greatgrandchildren for pestering the ducks and reflecting on the wigging id get from elspeth when i took them in to tea covered in dirt and toffee there was a brass band playing on a gramophone up at the house a distant drowsy thumping that drifted down the lawn and under the trees i guess i must have hummed along or waved my flask to the old familiar march for presently the villain augustus detached himself from the waterweed and came to stand snottering before me with his head on one side thoughtfullike i say greatgranpapa says he thats gory halooyah so it is young gallows says i and gory halooyah is what youll catch when greatgrandmama sees the state of you where the devils your other shoe sunk says he and gave tongue jombrowns body lies amoulderin inna grave jombrowns body lies oh gweatgwampapa said a wicked word squeals virtuous jemima a true flashman as beautiful as she is obnoxious i heard him he said dl she pronounced it di gweatgwanmama says people who say such fings go to the bad fire bad fire indeed my genteel elspeth has never forgotten the more nauseating euphemisms of her native paisley he shant so there cries my loyal little alice another twig off the old tree being both flirt and toady she jumped on the bench and clung to my arm cos i shant let him go to bad fires shall i greatgrampapa yearning at me with those great forgetmenot eyes four years old and innocent as cleopatra fraid you wont have a vote on the matter mdear devil aint a bad word anyway says john rising seven and leader of the pack the dean said it in his sermon last sunday devil he said it twice devil he repeated with satisfaction so bad scran to you jemima hear hear stout lad john that was in church retorts jemima who has the makings of a fine sealawyer bar her habit of sticking out her tongue its all wight in church but if you say it outside its vewwy dweadful an god will punish you little baptist whats moulderin mean greatgranpapa asks augustus all rotten an stinkin says john its what happens when you get buried you go all squelchy an the worms eat you eeesh words cannot describe the ecstasy of alices exclamation was jombrown like that greatgrampapa all rottish not as i recall no his toes stuck out of the ends of his boots sometimes though this produced hysterics of mirth as id known it would except in john whos a serious infant given to searching crossexamination i say did you know him greatgrandpapa john brown in the song why yes john i knew him long time ago though who told you about him miss prentice in sunday school says he idly striking his cousin who was trying to detach alice from me by biting her leg she says he was the angel of the lord who got hung for freeing all the niggers in america you oughtnt to say niggers jemima again absolutely removing her teeth from alice and climbing across to possess my other arm its not nice you should say negwoes shouldnt you gweatgwampapa i always say negwoes she added oozing piety what should you call them greatgrandpapa asks john call em what you like my son its nothing to what theyll call you i always say negwoes greatgranpapa says niggers observes confounded augustus lots an lots of times he pointed a filthy accusing finger you said that dam nigger jonkins the boxerman johnson child jack johnson you said he wanted takin down a peg or two did i though yes jemima dearest i know gus has said another wicked word but ladies shouldnt notice you know whats a peggatoo asks alice twining my whiskers a measure of diminution of selfesteem precious yes jemima ive no doubt youre going to peach to greatgrandmama about gus saying damn but if you do youll be saying it yourself mind what gus yes very well if i said that about the boxerman you may be sure i meant it but you know old fellow when you call people names it depends who youre talking about it does too flash coons like johnson and the riffraff of the levees and most of our aryan brethren are one thing but if youve seen ketshwayos nokenke regiment stamping up the dust and the assegais drumming on the oxhide shields suthu suthu sjee sjee as they sweep up the slope to little hand well thats black of a different colour and you find another word for those fellows and god forbid i should offend miss prentice so i think it best you should say negroes children thats the polite word you see what about nigger minstrels asks alice excavating my collar thats all right cos theyre white underneath says john impatiently shut your potatotrap alice i want to hear about john brown and how he freed all the the negro slaves in america didnt he greatgrandpapa well now john no not exactly and then i stopped and took a pull at my flask and thought about it after all who am ito say he didnt it was coming anyway but if it hadnt been for old jb and his crackbrained dreams who can tell how things might have panned out little nails hold the hinge of history as bismarck remarked the night we set out for tarlenheim and didnt lincoln himself say that mrs stowe was the little lady who started the great war with uncle toms cabin well ossawatomie brown mad and murderous old horsethief that he was played just as big a part in setting the darkies free as she did aye or lincoln or garrison or any of them i reckon i did my bit myself not willingly you may be sure and cursing seward and pinkerton every step of the way that ghastly night and as i pondered it staring across the lake to the big oak casting its first evening shadow the shrill voices of the grandlings seemed to fade away and in their place came the harsh yells and crash of gunshots in the dark and instead of the scent of roses there was the reek of black powder smoke filling the enginehouse the militias shots shattering timber and whining about our ears young oliver bleeding his life out on the straw the gaunt scarecrow with his grizzled beard and burning eyes thumbing back the hammer of his carbine stand firm men sell your lives dearly dont give in now and jeb stuarts eyes on mine willing me to pull the trigger wake up greatgrandpapa do tell us about jombrown yes wiv his toes stickin out all stinky tell us tell us i came back from the dark storm of harpers ferry to the peaceful sunshine of leicestershire and the four small faces regarding me with that affectionate impatience that is the crowning reward of greatgrandfatherhood john handsome and grave and listening jemima a year younger prim ivory perfection with her long raven hair and lashes designed for sweeping hearts little golden alice elspeth all over again and the babe augustus bursting with sin beneath the mud a border ruffian in a sodden sailor suit and the only pang is that at ninetyone you cant hope to see em grown john brown eh well its a long story you know and greatgrandmama will be calling us for tea presently no alice he didnt have wings although miss prentice is quite right they did call him the angel of the lord and the avenging angel too whats venging getting your own back no john he was quite an ordinary chap really rather thin and bony and shabby with a straggly beard and very bright grey eyes that lit up when he was angry ever so fierce and grim but he was quite a kindly old gentleman too was he as old as you heavens child no ones that old he was oldish but pretty spry and full of beans lets see what else he was a capital cook why he could make ham and eggs and brown fried potatoes to make your mouth water did he make kedgewee i hate howwid old kedgewee ugh what about the slaves and him killing lots of people and getting hung john shook my knee in his impatience well john i suppose he did kill quite a few people how gus why with his pistols he had two just like the cowboys and he could pull them in a twinkling ever so quickly and dam near blew your greatgrandpapas head off one second asleep and the next blasting lead all over the shop curse him and with his sword although that was before i knew him mind you he had another sword in our last fight and youll never guess who it had once belonged to frederick the great what dyou think of that whos frederick the great german king john bit of a tick i believe used scent and played the flute i think jombrown was howwid announced jemima killing people is wrong not always dearest sometimes you have to or theyll kill you greatgranpapa used to kill people lots of times protests sturdy augustus greatgranmama told me when he was a soldier werent you choppin em up heaps of thats quite diffewent says jemima with an approving smile which may well lead me to revise my will in her favour its pwoper for soldiers to kill people and pat on her words came an echo from half a century ago the deep level voice of jb himself recalling the slaughter of pottawatomie they had a right to be killed it was a warm afternoon but i found myself shivering greatgrandpapas tired whispers john lets go in for tea what tired not a bit of it you cant have grandlings taking pity on you even at ninetyone but tea what capital idea whos for a bellyful of gingerbread eh tell you what pups you make yourselves decent straighten your hair find guss other shoe put your socks on alice yes jemima you look positively queenly and well march up to tea shall we at least you lot will while i call the step and look after remounts wont that be jolly and well sing his song as we go jombrowns body gory halooyah the very same gus now then fall in tallest on the right shortest on the left heels together john eyes front jemima pull in your guts augustus stop giggling alice and ill teach you some capital verses you never heard before ready i dont suppose theres a soul speaks english in the world who couldnt sing the chorus today but of course it hadnt been written when we went down to harpers ferry jbs army of ragamuffins adventurers escaped slaves rustlers and lunatics gods crusaders some enthusiast called us but then again ive read that we were swaggering swearing bullies and infidels we were twentyone strong fifteen white six black and all set to conquer dixie if you please we didnt make it at the time quite but we did in the end by god didnt we just with shermans bugles blowing thirty miles in latitude three hundred to the main not that i gave a twocent dam for that you understand and still dont they could have kept their idiotic civil war for me for it was the foulest most useless conflict in history the mass suicide of the flower of the britishamerican race and for what black freedom which would have come in a few years anyway as sure as sunrise and all those boys could have been sitting in the twilight watching their johns and jemimas still ive got a soft spot for the old song and for jb for that matter aye that song which the historian says was sung by every union regiment because it dealt not with john browns feeble sword but with his soul his soul my eye as often as not the poor old maniac wasnt even mentioned and it would be wild bill shermans got a rope around his neck an well all catch hold an giveitonehellofapull glory glory hallelujah etc or it might be our sergeantmajor or jeff davis hanging from a sour apple tree or any of the unprintable choruses cohat inspired the pious mrs howe to write mine eyes have seen the glory but all thats another story for another day in the meantime i taught my small descendants some versions which were entirely to their liking and we trooped up to the house the infants in column of twos and the venerable patriarch hobbling painfully behind flask at the high port and all waking the echoes with john browns donkeys got an indiarubber tail an he rubbed it with camphorated oil followed by our greatgrandpa saved the viceroy in the good old khyber pass and concluding with flashy had an army of a hundred bashibazouks an the whole dam lot got shot glory glory hallelujah spirited stuff and it was just sheer bad luck that the bishop and other visiting pecksniffs should already be taking tea with elspeth and miss prentice when we rolled in through the french windows the damp and dirty grandlings in full voice and myself measuring my ancient length across the threshold flask and all very well the grandlings were raucous and dishevelled and i aint at my best sprawled supine on the carpet leaking brandy but to judge from his lordships disgusted aspect and miss prentices frozen pincenez youd have thought id been teaching them to smoke opium and sing oneeyed riley the upshot was that the infants were packed off in disgrace to a defaulters tea of dry bread and milk gus was sent to bed early oh aye jemima ratted on him and when the guests had departed in an odour of sanctity withdrawing the hems of their garments from me and making commiserating murmurs to elspeth she loosed her wrath on me for an evil influence corrupting young innocence with my barrackroom ribaldry letting them get their feet wet and did i know what shoes cost nowadays and she was black affronted and how was she ever going to look the bishop in the face again would i tell her contrition not being my style and useless anyway i let the storm blow itself out and later having ensured that la prentice was snug in her lair polishing her knout and supping gin on the sly i daresay i raided the pantry and smuggled gingerbread and lemonade to the grandlings bedroom where at their insistence i regaled them with the story of john brown they fell asleep in the middle of it and so did i among the broken meats on johns coverlet and woke at last to the touch of soft lips on my aged brow to find elspeth shaking her head in fond despair well the old girl knows im past reforming now and that jemimas right ill certainly go to the bad fire i know one who wont though and thats old ossawatomie john brown that new saint than whom nothing purer or more brave was ever led by love of men into conflict and death and who made the gallows glorious like the cross thats ralph waldo emerson on jb a saint noble brave trusting in god honest truthful conscientious comparable with william wallace washington and william tell those are the words of parker and garrison who knew him and they aint the half of his worshippers talk about a mixture of jesus apollo goliath and julius caesar on the other hand a faker shifty crafty vain selfish intolerant brutal an unscrupulous soldier of fortune a horsethief a hypocrite who didnt care about freeing slaves and would have been happy to use slave labour himself a liar a criminal and a murderer thats his most recent biographer talking interesting chap brown wouldnt you say a good deal of its true both sides and you may take my word for it scoundrel i may be but ive no axe to grind about jbs reputation i helped to make it though by not shooting him in the back when i had the chance didnt want to and wouldnt have had the nerve anyway you might even say that i all unwitting launched him on the path to immortal glory aye if theres a company of saints up yonder theyll be dressing by the right on jb for when the recording angel has racked up all his crimes and lies and thefts and follies and deceits and coldblooded killings hell still be saved when better men are damned why cos if he wasnt thered be such an almighty roar of indignation from the heavenly host it would bust the firmament god would never live it down thats the beauty of a martyrs crown you see it outshines everything and they dont come any brighter than old jbs im not saying he deserves it i only know perhaps better than anyone how he came by it you will wonder if youre familiar with my inglorious record how i came to take part with john brown at all old flashy the bully and poltroon cad and turncoat lecher and toady bearing freedoms banner aloft in the noblest cause of all the liberation of the enslaved and downtrodden striking off the shackles at the risk of death and dishonour gad i wish arnold could have seen me thats the irony of it if id bitten the dust at the ferry id have had a martyrs crown too on top of all the honours and glory id already won in her majestys service oh the ferry fiasco could have been my finest hour with the queen in mourning yankee politicos declaiming threehour tributes full of tendollar words and latin misquotations a memorial service in the rugby chapel the haymarket brothels closed in respect old comrades looking stern and noble cant believe hes gone dear old flash height of his fame glorious career before him goes off to free the niggers not for gold or guerdon aye so like him quixotic chivalrous helpin lame dogs ah one in ten thousand i say seen his widow have you gad look at em bounce rich as croesus too they tell me thered have been no talk of roasted fags or expulsion for sottish behaviour either die in a good cause and theyll forgive you anything but i didnt thank god and as any of you who have read my other memoirs will have guessed id not have been within three thousand miles of harpers ferry or blasted brown but for the ghastliest series of mischances three hellish coincidences three mark you that even dickens wouldnt have used for fear of being hooted at in the street but they happened with that damned nemesis logic that has haunted me all my life and landed me in more horrors than i can count mustnt complain though im still here cash in hand the grandlings upstairs asleep and elspeth in her boudoir reading the countess of cardigans recollections however thats a far cry from the shenandoah but before i tell you about jb i must make one thing clear for my own credit and good names sake and its this care not one tuppenny hoot about slavery and never did i cant say its none of my biznai because it was once in my time ive raided blacks from the dahomey coast shipped em across the middle passage driven them on a plantation and run them to freedom on the underground railroad and across the ohio icefloes with a bullet in my rump to say nothing of abetting jbs lunatic scheme of establishing a black republic in virginia of all places set up an orange lodge in the vatican why dont you the point is that i was forced into all these things against my will by gad you could say i was enslaved into them for that matter ive been a slave in earnest at least they put me up for sale in madagascar and twasnt my fault nobody bid queen ranavalona got me without paying a penny and piling into that lustmaddened monster was slavery if you like with the prospect of being flayed alive if i failed to give satisfaction ive been a fag at rugby too so when i say i dont mind about slavery i mean im easy about the institution so long as it dont affect me whenever it did i was agin it selfish callous and immoral says you and i agree unprincipled too unlike the holy joe abolitionist who used to beat his breast about his black brother while drawing his dividend from the mill that was killing his white sister aye and in such squalor as no dixie planter would have tolerated for his slaves anyway if life has taught me anything its that the wealth and comfort of the fortunate few will always depend on the sweat and poverty of the unfortunate many whether theyre toiling on plantations or licking labels in sweatshops at a penny a thousand its the way of the world and until utopia comes which it shows no sign of doing thank god ill just rub along with the few minding my own business so you understand i hope that they could have kept every nigger in dixie in bondage for all i cared or freed them i was indifferent spiritually and only wish i could have been so corporally and before you start thundering at me from your pulpit just remember the chap who said that if the union of the united states could only be preserved by maintaining slavery that was all right with him whats his name again ah yes abraham lincoln and now for old john brown and the path to glory not the worst of my many adventures but just about the unlikeliest it had no right to happen truly or so it strikes me when i look back god knows i havent led a tranquil life but in review there seems to have been some form and order to it afghanistan borneo madagascar punjab germany slave coast and mississippi russia and the back o beyond india in the mutiny china american war mexico and there you see ive missed out jb altogether because he dont fit the pattern somehow hes there though whiskers sixguns texts and all between india and china and nought to do with either right out n the mainstream as though some malevolent djinn had plucked me from my course dipped me into harpers ferry and then whisked me back to the army again it began with a wanton nymph in calcutta at the backend of but for her it would never have happened plunkett her name was the sporty young wife of an elderly pantaloon who was a high court judge or something of that order i was homeward bound from the mutiny into which id been thrust by the evil offices of my lord palmerston whod despatched me to india on secret work two years before thanks to dear old pam id been through the thick of that hellish rebellion from the meerut massacre to the battle of gwalior fleeing for my life from thugs and pandies spending months as a sowar of native cavalry blazing away at the cawnpore barricade sneaking disguised out of lucknow with a demented irishman in tow and coming within an ace of being eaten by crocodiles torn asunder on the rack and blown from a gun as a condemned mutineer oh aye the diplomatics the life for a lad of metal i can tell you true there had been compensations in the delectable shape of lakshmibai rani of jhansi and a victoria cross and knighthood at the end of the day and the only fly in the ointment as i rolled down to calcutta had been the discovery that during my absence from england some scribbling swine had published his reminiscences of rugby school with me as the villain of the piece a vile volume entitled tom browns schooldays on every page of which the disgusting flashy was to be found torturing fags shirking toadying lying whining for mercy and boozing himself to disgraceful expulsion every word of it true and all the worse for that it was with relief that i learned by eavesdropping in calcuttas messes and hotels that no one seemed to have heard of the damned book or werent letting on if they had its been the same ever since im happy to say not a word of reproach or a covert snigger even although the thing must have been read in every corner of the civilised world by now why when president grant discovered that i was the flashman of tom brown he just looked baffled and had another drink the fact is some truths dont matter ive been seventy years an admired hero the hector of afghanistan the chap who led the light brigade daredevil survivor of countless stricken fields honoured by queen and country vc and medal of honour folk simply dont want to know that such a paladin was a rotter and bully in childhood and if he was they dont care they put it from their minds never suspecting that boy and man are one and that all my fame and glory has been earned by accident false pretence cowardice doing the dirty and blind luck only i know that so my shining reputations safe which is how the public want it bless em its always been the same suppose some learned scholar were to discover a fifth gospel which proved beyond doubt that our lord survived the cross and became a bandit or a slavetrader or a politician even dyou think it would disturb the christian faith one little bit of course not twouldnt even be denied likely just ignored hang it ive seen the evidence in black and white in our secret files that benjamin franklin was a british spy right through the american revolution selling out the patriots for all he was worth but would any yankee believe that if twas published never because its not what they want to believe i reached calcutta then to find myself feted on all sides and there was no shortage of heroes to be worshipped after the mutiny you may be sure but no other had the vc and a knighthood or stood six feet two with black whiskers and handsome harrys style id had my fill of fame in the past of course and was all for it but i knew how to carry it off modest and manly not too bluff and with a pinch of salt id supposed it would be straight aboard and hey for merry england but i was wrong p and o hadnt a berth for months for the furloughs had started and every civilian in india seemed to be leaving for home to say nothing of ten thousand troops to be shipped out john company was hauling down his flag at last india was passing under the rule of the crown everything was topsyturvy and even heroes had to wait their turn for a passage to suez and the overland route at a pinch you could get a ship to the cape but that was a deuce of a long haul so i made myself pleasant around the p and o office squeezed the buttocks of a bengali charmer who wrote letters for the head clerk and had her dainty hands on his booking lists tempted her with costly trinkets and sealed the bargain by rattling her across his desk while he was out at tiffin and lo ben flashys name led all the rest on a vessel sailing two weeks hence i was dripping with blunt having disposed of my lucknow loot and banked the proceeds but there wasnt a bed to be had at the auckland outram pressed me to stay with him nothing too good for the man whod smuggled his message through the pandy lines to campbell but i shied only the fast set stayed up after ten in cal in those days and i guessed that chez outram it would be prayers at nine and gunfire and a cold tub at six and i didnt fancy above half scrambling out in the dark to seek vicious diversion i played it modest saying i knew his place would be full of army and wives and id rather keep out o the way dont you know sir and he looked noble and patted my shoulder saying he understood my boy but id dine at least i put up at spences a furnished apartment shop with a table dhфte but no bearers even to clean your room so bring your own servant or live like a pig it served though and i could haunt the auckland of an evening seeking what i might devour id been two years without elspeth you see and while cohey hadnt been celibate quite what with lakshmi and various dusky houris here and there and only the buxom mrs leslie at meerut by way of variety i was beginning to itch for something english again blonde and milky for preference and not reeking of musk and garlic so the moment i saw lady plunkett on the auckland veranda i knew id struck gold which was the colour of her hair with complexion to match beside elspeth youd not have noticed her but she was tall and plump enough with a pudding face and a big mouth drooping with boredom and once id caught her eye it was plain sailing believe it or not as you like she dropped her handkerchief by my chair as she sailed out of the diningroom that evening so i told a bearer to take it after the memsahib satisfied myself that her husband was improving his gout with port in company with other dodderers and sauntered up to her rooms on the first floor to cut a long story short we got along splendidly and i had slipped her gown to her hips and was warming her up so to speak when the door opened at my back her eager whimpers ended in a terrified squeak and i glanced round to see her lord and master who shouldnt have been up for hours tottering across the threshold apparently on the verge of apoplexy well id been there before but seldom in more fortunate circumstances for i was still fully clad we were both standing up and she was halfhidden from his gooseberry gaze i hastily surrendered her tits and glared at him what the devil dye mean by this intrusion sir cries i begone this instant and to my paralysed beauty i continued there is only the slightest congestion marm im happy to say nothing to occasion alarm you may resume your clothing now i shall have a prescription sent round directly sir did you not hear me how dare you interrupt my examination upon my word sir have you no delicacy out i say at once he could only gobble in purple outrage while i chivvied her behind a screen thats my wife he bawls then you should take better care of her says i whipping out a dhobilist and scribbling professionally fortunately my room is close at hand and when i was summoned your lady was suffering an acute palpitation not uncommon close city climate nothing serious but unpleasant enough hm three grains should do it i think has she had these fits before i i dont know cries he wattling what what maud what does this mean who why are you a doctor sir macnab surgeon nd says i mighty brisk ignoring the mewlings from behind the screen and his own choking noises complete rest for a day or two you understand no undue exertion i shall send this note to the apothecary i pocketed my paper and sniffed looking stern port sir well its no concern of mine if you choose to drink yourself under ground but id say one invalid in the family is enough hey i addressed the screen to bed at once marm two teaspoonfuls when the boy brings the medicine mind i shall call in the morning and look to find you much improved goodnight and to you sir never let em get a word in you see i was out and downstairs before he knew it reflecting virtuously that that was another marriage id saved by quick thinking if he believed her which id not have done myself but stay even if he did hed find out soon enough that there was no dr macnab of the nd and start baying for the blood of the strapping chap with black whiskers and calcutta society being as small as it was he was sure to run me down and then scandal which would certainly tarnish my newlywon laurels my god if plunkett roared loud enough it might even reach the queens ears and where would my promised knighthood be then but if i could slide out now undetected well you cant identify a man who aint there can you all of a sudden westward ho without delay seemed the ticket and scandal wasnt the only reason some of these ancients with young highstepping consorts can be vicious bastards as witness the old rouй whod sicked his bullies after me for romping letty lade in the cricket season of and he hadnt even been married to her so now you see flashy at the howrah docks in the misty morning with his dunnage on a handcart dickering for a passage to the cape with a downeast skinflint in a tile hat who should have been flying the jolly roger the price he demanded for putting into table bay but he was sailing that day and since tea for new york was his cargo it would be a fast run so i stumped up with a fair grace after all i hadnt put cash down for the passage arranged by the bengali bint and i didnt grudge her the trinkets my one regret was that i hadnt boarded the plunkett wench i hope he believed her it was about a month to the cape with the taffrail under most of the way but not too bad until we neared algoa bay when it began to blow fit to sicken magellan ive never seen so much green water even less cheering was the sight of a big steamer lying wrecked on a reef off port elizabeth and i was a happy man when wed rounded the cape and opened up that glorious prospect which is one of the wonders of the seas the great bay glittering in the sunlight with a score or more of windjammers and coasters and a few steamers at anchor and beyond them the tablecloth of cloud rolling down the flank of the mountain to signal hill and guns booming from the castle to salute a manofwar putting out with crowds fluttering hats and scarves from green point once ashore i engaged a berth on the union mail steamer sailing the following week put up at the masonic and took a slant at the town it was busy enough for the australian gold rush of a few years back and the mutiny had set the port booming but the town itself was a damned dutchlooking place with its stoeps and stolid stucco houses most of which are gone now i believe and the great church clock tower which looks as though it should have an oom paul beard round its face it had been a wild place in the earlies the tavern of the seas but now it was respectable and dull and the high jinks were to be had at grahamstown far away up the coast where the more sensible britons lived and the army was quartered what there was of them for the governor george grey had stripped the colony of men guns and stores for the mutiny and the old africa hands in the hotel were full of foreboding over their pipes and stingo with the country arsenaked as one of them put it and the usual trouble brewing to the north well have the kaffirs at our throats again ere long see if we dont says one pessimist know how many wars theyve given us colonel thanks to the damned missionaries eight or is it nine blessed if you dont lose count to say nothin o the dutch not that they havent got their hands full by all accounts an serve the miserable beggars right theyll be howlin for you redcoats presently mark my words you never saw a boer ask help from a briton yet scoffs another nor they neednt theyll give the basutos the same pepper they gave john zulu if moshesh dont mind his manners you never know laughs a third maybe the dear basutosll do the decent thing an starve themselves to death what not old moshesh thats a bantu whos too smart by half as well find out to our cost one o these days oh greyll see to him never fear an the boers if only london will let him alone any more word of his goin you may bet on it if the colonial office dont ship him home the doctor will i dont like his colour the mans played out well he can go for me we bade good riddance to brother boer years ago why should we want him back these are just scraps of talk that i remember and no doubt theyre as greek to you as they were to me but being a curious child i listened and learned a little for these fellows english civilians and merchants mostly a cape rifleman or two and a couple of traderhunters down from the frontiers knew their country which was a closed book to me then bar my brief visit to the slave coast and that was years ago and a world away from the cape truth to tell africas never been my patch much ive soldiered on veldt and desert and seen more of its jungle than i cared for but like our statesmen ive always thought it a dam nuisance perhaps dahomey inoculated me against the african bug which has bitten so many to their cost for it breeds grand dreams which often as not turn into nightmares it was biting hard at this time not least on grey the governor and since he was to play a small but crucial part in my present story i must tell you something of him but i cant do that without first telling you about south africa as briefly as may be it wont explain the place to you but it may lead you to wonder if two damned dirty and costly wars mightnt have been avoided if only those reform club buffoons hadnt thought they knew better than the man on the spot you have to understand that in africa was the last great prize and mystery an unmapped hinterland twice the size of europe where anything was possible lost civilisations hidden cities strange white tribes they were no joke then real exploration of the dark heart of the continent had just begun livingstone had blazed his trails up and down it and across farther north dick burton was making an ass of himself by not finding the source of the nile but the broad steady inroad was from the south where wed established ourselves the dutch settlers not caring for us much had trekked north to found their own boer republics in lands where they met hordes of persevering black gentlemen coming tother way they fought the zulus and basutos while we fought the kaffirs to the east and everything was dam confused chiefly because our rulers at home couldnt make up their minds annexing territories and then letting em go interfering with the boers one minute and recognising their independence the next trying to hold the ring between black and white and whining at the expense and then sending out grey who brought the first touch of common sense and if you ask me the last his great gift i was told was that he got on splendidly with savages even the boers hed been a soldier explored in australia governed there and in new zealand and saw at once that the only hope for southern africa was to reunite briton and boer and civilise the blacks within our borders which hed begun to do with schools and hospitals and teaching them trades in this hed been helped by one of those lunatic starts which happen among primitive folk in a troublesome warrior tribe the zozas had got the notion that if they destroyed all their crops and cattle the gods would send them bumper harvests and even fatter herds and all the white men in africa would obligingly drown themselves accordingly the demented blighters starved themselves to death which left more space for white settlement and the surviving zozas were in a fit state to be civilised meanwhile grey was using his persuasive arts to charm the boers back under the union jack and since our dutch friends were beginning to feel the pinch of independence isolated up yonder cut off from the sea worn out with their own internal feuding and fighting a running war against the basutos they were only too ready to return to britannias fold that was the stuff of greys dream as i gathered from my fellowguests at the hotel a united south africa of briton boer and black most of my informants were all for it but one or two were dead against the boers which put one grizzled old hunter out of all patience i dont like the hollanders any bettern you do says he but if whites wont stand together theyll fall separately besides if we dont have the boers under our wing theyll go on practisin their creed that the only good bantus a dead one or a slave an we know where that leads bloody strife till kingdom come and whats greys style asks a fat civilian teach em ploughing and the lords prayer and make em wear trowsers try that with the matabele why dont you or the zulu or the masai youve never seen the masai snaps the old chap anyway sufficient unto the day im talkin about settlin the bantu inside our own borders we should never ha given em the vote says a cape rifleman what happens when they outnumber us tell me that this was an eyeopener to me i can tell you but its true every manjack born on cape soil had the vote then whatever his colour more than could be said for old england oh by then all the zulu and mashona will be in tight collars talking political economy sneers the fat chap he jabbed his pipe at the hunter you know its humbug they aint like us they dont like us and theyll pay us out when they can hang it all you were at blood river werent you well then aye an i back grey cos i dont want blood river oer again cries the hunter an thats what youll get my boy if the boers aint reined up tight inside our laager as for the tribes look here i dont say you can civilise a masai elmoran now but theyre a long way off given time an peaceful persuasion when we come to em oh backed up by a few field pieces if you like things can be settled with good will so i reckon greys way is worth a try its that or fight em to the death an theres a hell of a lot o black men in africa there were murmurs of agreement but my sympathies were all with the fat chap i dont trust enlightened proconsuls id heard no good of the boers and fresh from india as i was the notion of voting niggers was too rich for me cant say my views have changed either still when i look back on the bloody turmoil of southern africa in my lifetime which has left boer and briton more at loggerheads than ever the blacks hating us both and their precious union fifty years too late i reckon the old hunter was right greys scheme was worth a try god knows it couldnt have made things worse but of course it never got a try because the home government had the conniptions at the thought of another vast territory being added to the empire which they figured was too big already odd aint it that the world should be onefifth british today when back in the s our statesmen were dead set against expansion palmerston derby carnarvon gladstone aye even disraeli who called south africa a millstone while i was at the cape though the ball was still in the air they hadnt yet scotched greys scheme of union and called him home and he was fighting tooth and nail to get his way which was why believe it or not i found myself bidden to dine with his excellency a few days later and that led to the first coincidence that set me on the road to harpers ferry when i got the summons aha thinks i he wants to trot the mutiny hero up and down before cape society to raise their spirits and remind em how well the armys been doing lately sure enough he had invited the local quality to meet me at a reception after dinner but that wasnt his reason just his excuse we dined at the castle which had been the governors residence in the days of the old dutch east india company and was still used occasionally for social assemblies since it had a fine hall overlooked at one end by a curious balcony called the kat from which i gather his dutch excellency had been wont to address the burghers i duly admired it before we went to dinner in an anteroom it was a small party at table flashy in full lancer fig with vc and assorted tinware two young aides popeyed with worship and grey himself he was a slim poeticlooking chap with saintly eyes not yet fifty and might have been a muff if you hadnt known that hed walked over half australia dying of thirst most of the time and his slight limp was a legacy of an aborigines spear in his leg the first thing that struck you was that he was far from well the skin of his handsome face was tight and pallid and you felt sometimes that he was straining to keep hold and be pleasant and easy the second thing which came out later was his cocksure confidence in g grey ive seldom known the likeand ive been in a room with wellington and macaulay together remember he was quiet enough at dinner though being content to watch me thoughtfullike while his aides pumped me about my mutiny exploits which i treated pretty offhand for if im to be bongered let it be by seniors or adoring females i found greys silent scrutiny unsettling too and tried to turn the talk to home topics but the lads didnt care for the great crusade against smoking or the state of the thames or the jews in parliament they wanted the blood of cawnpore and the thunder of lucknow and it was a relief when grey sent them packing and suggested we take our cigars on the veranda forgive my young men says he they see few heroes at the cape the sort of remark that is a sniff as often as not but his wasnt he went on to speak in complimentary terms of my indian service about which he seemed to know a great deal and then led the way down into the garden walking slowly along in the twilight breathing in the air with deep content saying even new zealand had nothing to touch it and had i ever known anything to compare well it was balmy enough with the scent of some blossom or other and just the spot to stroll with one of the crinolines i could see driving in under the belfry arch and descending at the castle doorway beyond the trees but it was evidently heady incense to grey for he suddenly launched into the most infernal prose about africa and how he was just the chap to set it in order you may guess the gist of it from what ive told you already and you know what these lyrical buggers are like when they get on their hobbyhorses on and on like the neverwearied rook he didnt so much talk as preach with the quiet intensity of your true fanatic and what with the wine at dinner and the languorous warmth of the garden its as well there wasnt a hammock handy but he was the governor and had just fed me so i nodded attentively and said i never knew that sir and ye dont say though i might as well have hollered whelks for sale for all he heard it was the most fearful missionary dross too about the brotherhood of the races and how a mighty empire must be built in harmony for there was no other way save to chaos and now the golden key was in his hand ready to be turned youve heard that the orange volksraad has voted for union with us says he taking me unawares for until then hed apparently been talking to the nearest tree not knowing what the orange volksraad was i cried yes and not before time and he said this was the moment and brooded a bit a la byron stern but gleaming before turning on me and demanding how well do you know lord palmerston too dam well was the answer to that but i said id met him twice in the line of duty no more he sent you to india on secret political work says he and now he was all business no visionary nonsense he must think highly of you and so he should afghanistan punjab central asia jhansi oh yes flashman news travels and we diplomatics take more note of work in the intelligence line than we do of he indicated my cross with a little smile i have no doubt that his lordship values your opinion more than that of many general officers much more he was looking keen and my innards froze for id heard this kind of talk before you aint getting me up yonder disguised as a zulu you bastard thinks i but his next words quieted my fears i am not persona grata at home colonel to be blunt they think me a dangerous dreamer and there is talk of my recall youve heard it bruited in the town i dont doubt well sir and he raised his chin eye to eye i hope i have convinced you that i must not be recalled for the sake of our countrys service and for the sake of africa now lord palmerston will not be out of office long i believe will you do me the signal favour when you reach home of seeking him out and impressing on him the necessity the imperative necessity of my remaining here to do the work that only i can do ive had some astonishing requests in my time from women mostly but this beat all if he thought the unsought opinion of a lowly cavalry colonel however supposedly heroic and versed in political ruffianing would weigh a jot with pam he was in the wrong street altogether why the thought of my buttonholing that paintwhiskered old fox with hold on my lord while i set you right about africa was stuff for punch i said so politely and he fixed me with that steely gazelle eye and sighed i am well aware that a word from you may carry little weight all i ask is that little his lordship has not inclined to accept my advice in the past and i must use every means to persuade him now do you not see he stared hard at me impatient there was a bead of sweat on his brow and suddenly it came to me that the man was desperate ready to snatch at anything even me he was furious at having to plead with a muttonheaded soldier but he was in that state where hed have tried to come round palmerstons cook he tried to smile but it was a wry grimace on the pale strained face decisions you know are not always swayed by senators a word from the slave in the conquerors chariot may turn the scale gad he could pay a compliment though well colonel flashman may i count on you believe me you will be doing a service to your country quite as great as any you may have done in the past i should have spat in his eye and told him i didnt run errands for civil servants but its not every day youre toadied by a lofty proconsul patronising jackanapes though he may be so i accepted his handclasp which was hard marvelling at the spectacle of a proud man humbling himself for the sake of his pride and ambition all wasted too for they did recall him and then pam reinstated him not at my prompting you may be sure but his great african dream came to nothing thats by the way and if ive told you of grey and africa at some length well im bound to record these things and it was a queer start altogether and he was an odd bird but the point is that if he hadnt thought he could use me hed never have dined me that night or shown me off to cape society and id never have heard of harpers ferry the last carriages had arrived while we talked so now it was flashy on parade in the hall before society assembled grey made me known from the kat balcony to polite applause and led me down the little staircase to be admired and gushed over there must have been thirty or forty under the chandeliers and grey steered me among them i gave my bluff manly smile with a click of the heels or an elegant inclination depending on their sex but when we came to a group by the piano i thought hollo this is far enough she was seated at the keyboard playing the last bars of a waltz tralaing gaily and swaying her shoulders to the music they were the colour of old ivory flaunting themselves from a silverywhite dress which clung to her top hamper in desperation she laughed as she struck the final flourish and as those nearest patted their palms she bowed and turned swiftly on the stool smiling boldly up at me and extending a slim gloved hand as though she had timed the action precisely to greys introduction i didnt hear the name being intent on taking stock bright black eyes alight with mischief that dark cream complexion glossy black hair that swung behind her in a great fan a shade too wide in the mouth for true beauty and with heavy brows that almost met above a slim aquiline nose but she was young and gay and full of sauce and in that pale staid assembly she was as exotic as an orchid in a bed of lettuce with a shape to rival montez as she sat erect sweeping her skirt clear of the piano stool oah i should have played a march in your honour sir harree nott a waltz cries she chichi beyond doubt with that shrill lilt to her voice and mighty pert for a colonial miss i said gallantly twas all one since in her presence i was bound to look not listen and i knew from the way she fluttered her lids smiling and then raised them wide and insolent that we were two of a mind her hand tightened too when i pressed it nor did she withdraw it as grey made another introduction and i saw she was glancing with amusement at the chap whod been turning her music whom i hadnt noticed my father says she and as i faced him i realised with an icy shock where id seen her dark brows and arched nose before for i was staring into the pale terrible eyes of john charity spring its a shame those books on etiquette dont have a chapter to cover encounters with murderous lunatics whom youd hoped never to meet again i could have used one then and if youve met j c spring ma in my memoirs youll know why this was the mad villain whod kidnapped me to the slave coast on his hellship in and perforce id run black ivory with him and fled from shedevil amazons and been hunted the length of the mississippi and lied truth out of louisiana to keep both our necks out of a noose the last time id seen him hed been face down in a bowl of trifle in a new orleans brothel drugged senseless so that he could be hauled away and shanghaied to cape town bigod had he been here ever since how long was it ten years almost and here he was brooding malevolently at me from those soulless eyes while i gaped dumbstruck the trim beard and hair were white now but he was as burly as ever the same homicidal pirate whom id loathed and dreaded the weal on his forehead which darkened whenever he was preparing to spill blood or talk about oriel college was glowing pink and he spoke in the old familiar growl colonel and sir now eh youve risen in rank since i saw you last and in distinction too it seems he glowered at my medals bravely earned i dare say ha grey wasnt a diplomat for nothing you are acquainted says he and spring bared his fangs in his notion of a smile old shipmates sir barks he glaring as though i were a focsle rat reunited after many years eh flashman aye gratis superveniet quae non sperabitur hora he wheeled on his daughter spring with a daughter my god and i dropped her hand like a hot rivet my dear will you not play your new scarlatti piece for his excellency while the colonel and i renew old acquaintance charming sir i assure you such delicacy of touch and in an aside to me outside you he had my arm in a grip like a steel trap and i knew better than to argue maniacs like spring dont stand on ceremony for mere governors four quick strides and he had me on the veranda and as he almost threw me down the steps to the shadowy garden my one thought was that he was going to set about me in one of his berserk rages i could guess why too so i wrenched clear babbling id nothing to do with your being shanghaied it was susie willinck i didnt even know she was going to shut your gob oriel manners still i could see he shoved me against a tree and planted himself foursquare hands thrust into pockets quarterdeck style you neednt protest innocence to me youd never have the spine to slip me a queer draught aye but youd sit by and see it done you mangy tyke well nulla pallescere culpat my decorated hero for it doesnt matter a dam dye see fuit iliumt if you know your virgil which you never did blast you so he was still larding his conversation with latin tags hed been a mighty scholar you see before they rode him out of oxford on a rail for garrotting the vicechancellor or running guns into wadham likely tho he always claimed it was academic jealousy well what the devil are you blackguarding a chap for then the horror of meeting him and being rushed out headlong had quite unmanned me but this was civilisation dammit and even he darent offer violence much by god spring cries i courage returning youd best mind your manners this aint dahomey or your bloodylavedeck and im not your supercargo either hold your infernal tongue he thrust his face into mine pale eyes glittering and his scar pulsing like a snake take that tone with me and by god youll wish you hadnt bah think youre safe dont you because mortuo leoni et lepores insultant is that it how the hell do i know cant you speak english well the lion may be old mister but he aint dead and he can still take you by your dirty neck and scrag you like the rat you are he gripped my collar leaning closer and speaking soft i dont know what ill wind blew you here nor i dont care and ive no quarrel with you yet because youre not worth it dye see he began to shake me gritting his teeth but im telling you for the good o your health that while you continue to foul the cape with your scabrous presence youll steer clear of my daughter dye hear me oh i saw you leering yonder like the rutting hog you are i know you damn your eyes i only said howdedo and im saying howdedont i know it means nothing to vermin like you that shes seventeen and conventreared and pure that was what he thought id seen the look in her eye so you can spare me your indignant vapourings ye hear aye fronti nulla fides might ha been coined for you you lecherous offal didnt i see you tup your way from whydah to the gulf his scar was warming up again and his voice rising to its customary bawl and that fat slut in orleans did you have the gall to marry her hush cant you certainly not in fact i had my second bigamy but hed opposed the match being a biblethumper like so many blackguards and i knew if i admitted it id have his teeth in my throat ill wager bah whos to believe you lie by nature dont you he stepped back snarling so youre warned steer clear of my girl because if you dont by the holy ill kill you i believed him i remembered omohundro with two feet of steel through his innards and spring had only just met him now my carnal thoughts had vanished like the morning dew before the warmth of the fond fathers admonition and it was with relief and true sincerity that i drew myself up straightened my tunic and spoke with quiet dignity captain spring i assure you that my regard for your daughter is merely that of a gentleman for a charming lady hearing his jaws grate at what he took for sarcasm i added hastily by the way how is mrs spring in excellent health i trust mrs spring is dead snaps he and dye know i was quite put out for shed been a harmless old biddy played the harmonium at seaburials used to chivvy her diabolic spouse to wear his muffler when he went aslaving mad as a hatter and that is not her daughter mirandas mother was a coast arab his glare dared me to so much as blink id been right though halfcaste miranda eh delightful name from a play aint it jesus wept says he softly arnoldmust ha been proud of you he considered me cocking his white head aye perhaps he wouldve been at that youve done well by appearances anyway his voice was almost mild but he was like that raging storm and then flat calm and both terrifying id seen him lash a man almost to death and then go down to afternoon tea and a prose about ovid with the victims blood on his sleeve the hairy heel was never absent long though aye says he sourly looking me up and down i wish id a guinea for every poor bastard whose bones must ha gone to the making of your glorious pedestal gaudetque viam fecisse ruina ill lay seeing he was out to charm i said that he seemed to have done pretty well himself for he was looking mighty prosperous suitings of the finest and diamonds on his daughter and i was curious he scratched his beard sneering well enough that fat strumpet of yours did me a good t urn trepanning me to profit and position though she didnt know it yes my bucko im warm and i draw enough water in this colony as youll find if you cross me felicitas habet multos amicos you know i didnt but couldnt resist a gibe of my own not in black ivory these days though ill bet for a second the wild spark flickered in the empty eyes and i prepared to dodge youll open that trap o yours once too often growls he youre sailing on the next mail i take it youd better and until then keep your distance dye hear goodnight and be damned to you shipmate o mine thinks i as he stamped back to the house i was wet with sweat and it was with profound relief that i saw his carriage leave a few moments later my halfcaste charmer trilling with laughter and the scourge of the seas with his hat jammed down and snarling at the coachee i ventured in again but it was a halfhearted hero who acknowledged the compliments of the assembly i can tell you the coming of spring is something you dont get over quickly and grey eyed me curiously when i took my leave interesting man i had no notion you knew him in his trading days oh he farms now owns great acres about grahamstown and is quite the nabob must be one of the wealthiest men in the colony i daresay has his own yacht to bring him down from port elizabeth his daughter is charming is she not an instants hesitation then captain spring is a considerable classic too his lectures on the latifundia were widely attended last year he is on the board of public examiners you know and is forever pressing us to found a university here i decided to do jc a bit of good in return for the scare hed given me ah he misses the cloisters i suppose you know they unfrocked him or whatever they do at oxford never got over it poor old chap named his ship the balliol college slaver she was and a pirate they say hes wanted for murder in louisiana too he didnt even stir a patrician brow indeed ah well a very goodnight to you colonel and my warmest regards to lord palmerston that was how much i shocked him the fact was you see that so many chaps whod been little better than brigands in the earlies fellows like brooke and the taipans and the south sea crowd had become upstanding pillars of society in their mellow years that no one would care a fig if spring had founded his fortune shipping niggers not if he w as going to apply it to good works like a new university and went to morning service regular as old peacock says respectable means rich look at that slippery diamondslinger rhodes what price the spring chair of practical philosophy id give the inaugural lecture myself on how he tried to drop blacks overboard before the patrollers boarded him that he was filthy rich was confirmed by gossip in the town he could write a draft for a million i was told and id hate to be the man that bilked him of a fiver though says another from which i gathered that my beloved old commanders belayingpin reputation still stuck to hi m however loud he hollered in church so it was a relief when i heard hed gone back to grahamstown out of harms way leaving the lovely miranda to queen it at his fine house by the sea where she was wont to entertain the younger set of whom i was not going to be one i may tell you delectable she might be but even helen of troy would lose her allure if the price of her favours was liable to be a dip in the bay with a bag of coal on your feet no i was not tempted until the day before i was due to sail when a note was delivered at the hotel it read my dear sir harry altho i believe i should not style you so just yet still everyone knows and i have not so many gallant knights of my acquaintance that i can forego the pleasure of addressing you again as dear sir harry our meeting was cut so short by papa that i shall feel myself altogether neglected if you do not call before you leave for home which i believe you do on tomorrows mail we intend a seapicnic today and twill not be complete without the handsomest colonel in the army there i have no shame at all memory of those glaring eyes and murderous fury well wed see the carriage was there sharp on twelve malay coachman and all and i was in prime fettle as we bowled through the suburbs which were a great contrast to the shabby port being very grand even in those days with shady avenues of oak and clumps of silvertrees and fine houses among the green it was cape summer and the whole countryside was ablaze with garden blossoms and the famous wild flowers chateau spring which stood by the sea was even more splendid than id imagined a lofty white colonial mansion in wide grounds fit to rival kew with a marble bathing pool secluded among rhododendrons and as i waited in the airy hall admiring the circular sweep of the double staircase and inhaling the blissful aroma of money i reflected that theres no gain like the illgotten it beats honest accumulation hands down id expected the place to be alive with company but there wasnt a soul except the ancient black butler whod gone to announce me and i found myself wondering about that capital h shed put on home in her note she was halfcaste you see and they put far more stock in being english than we who take it for granted so shed spelled it home where shed never been and likely never would he not that being coloured as they call it down yonder mattered much in those days not with a white father who could have bought natal and would have kicked the life out of anyone who didnt treat his daughter like a duchess still i wondered how many mamas with eligible sons regretted previous engagements and i was just concluding hornily that i was probably the only guest when sir harree here she was sailing down the staircase and i took in breath at the sight of her she was wearing a dress of pale muslin saristyle that clung like a gauzy skin but flounced out below the knee above thonged sandals one ivory shoulder and both arms were bare and as she swept towards me with a swift graceful stride the flimsy material outlined her figure gad it was all there she carried a long scarf of black silk over one arm and then to my astonishment i saw it was her hair gathered in from behind sir harree again with a glowing smile and her free hand extended and since we were alone and i was bursting with buck i pressed my lips to her fingers and nuzzled swiftly up her naked arm in flashys flank attack across shoulder and neck to her cheek and fastened on her full red lips she didnt even gasp after a second her mouth opened wide and when i drew her in with a hand on her rump she clung like a good un while i kneaded avidly and breathed in her heavy perfume and then the blasted butlers step sounded at the stairhead and she broke away flushed and laughing and quickly drew herself up mock demure howdedo sir harree says she bobbing a curtsey so kind of you to coil may i offer you some refreshment another o the same marm if you please says i and she burst out laughing and drew me out onto a shady veranda commanding a splendid view of the sunlit bay there was a low table with liquor and tidbits and cushioned rattan swingchairs and when the butler had poured us iced slings and tottered away she made pretty work of seating herself shrugging this way and that to display her shape and sweeping that wondrously long hair over the back of her seat id known at first sight that she was a great showoff and now she raised her glass with a flourish in smiling salute thatt is iced brandy and orange sir harree your favourite in new orleans so papa told me among other things oah yess did he now observant chap papa how the blazes had he come to tell her that but you mustnt believe all he tells you you know oah but i want to cries she quite the rogue such a shocking character he gave you you can nott imagine she sat erect counting on slim fingers lett me see oll your naughtee ways drinking and smoking and that you are a verree shameless rakebut he would give no particulars was that nott mean of him oah and that you were a scoundrel and told stretchers and he said you were most cowardice which i did nott believe you are so famous but you believed the rest eh butt of carse sir harree her voice had the native singsong that can be delightful in a woman but in her excitement the chichi vowels slipped out hot and strong and for an instant the ivory skin seemed a shade darker and the sharp nose and heavy brows more pronounced as she gestured and prattled and i admired the stirring curves of breast and hip under the flimsy muslin never mind the pasture it comes from its the meat that matters papa said of oll the bad men he had known you were quite the worst she shook her head wideeyed so of carse i must see for myself you knoaw are you so verree wicked harree here ill show you says i and lunged at her but she drew back with a pretty little comical flutter towards the hall where i supposed the butler was lurking and pressed me to try the tidbits especially a great sticky bowl of creamed chocolate in summer which she spooned into herself with gluttonous delicacy between sips at her sling teasing me with sidelong smiles and assuring me that the mixture was quite heavenlee well women flirt all ways to bed there are the kittens who like to be tickled and the cats who must be coaxed while they pretend to claw and the tigresses who have only one end in mind so to speak id marked miranda spring as a novice tigress at our first meeting and our grapple in the hall had shown her a willing one if it amused her to play the wanton puss well she was seventeen and a chichi and theyre a theatrical breed so i didnt mind so long as she didnt prove a mouse as some of these brazen chits do at the first pop of a button she seemed nervous and randy together yet was there a gleam of triumph in the eager smile aye probably couldnt believe her luck so papa warned you off did he and did he tell you hed sworn to kill me if i came near you oah yess jollee exciting he is so jealous you know it is a great bore for he has kept away oll saris of boys men i mean ollways thee ones i like best too nott saying he would kill them you understand she giggled but you know how he can be mmh just an inkling cramps your style does he she tossed her head and dabbed cream from her lips with a fold of her dress nott when he is in grahamstown when the cats away eh finished your pudding have you very good lets play i made another lunge and got home this time seizing her bosom and stopping her mouth and the lustful slut lay there revelling in it thrusting her tongue between my teeth with never a thought for the butler and i was wondering how we were going to perform the capital act on a cane swing only four feet long when she purred in my ear once upon a time the cat came home fortunately the swing was anchored or wed have been over what dyou mean oah not from grahamstown sillee papa was here in town but not expected it was two years ago when i was onlee fifteen and quite stupid you knoaw and there was a french gentleman from mauritius much older but whom i liked ever so and papa flew into a great rage and forbade him to see me but then papa was absent and michel came to the house to my room quite late and papa came home from the club quite early jesus what then nothing then papa looked at him in that way he has and said youre receipted and filed mister and michel laughed at him and went away youre a better man than i am michel thinks i and a little time after they found poor michel on robben island he had been flogged to death with a sjambok just what a fellow needs to hear when hes coming to the boil youll agree but im the lad who bulled a malay charmer in the midst of a battle on the batang lupar regardless of shot and steel and now the wicked bitch was halfway down my throat and rummaging belowstairs with an expert hand and while i didnt doubt her story knowing her fiend of a father i knew shed told it only to plague me and spring was in grahamstown id inquired ill give you sjambok my lady growls i and lifted her bodily out of the swing but even as i cast about for galloping room she left off gnawing at me and panted wait let me show you i set her down and she seized my hand hurrying me down to the garden and through a screen of shrubs to a small stone jetty beyond and there was the smartest little steam yacht moored all brass and varnish shining in the sun and not a soul aboard that i could see for our picnic says she and her voice was shrill with excitement she led the way up the swaying plank and i followed slavering at the plump stern bobbing under the muslin and down into the cool shadows of a spacious cabin i seized her fore and aft but she slipped from my lustful grasp whispering a moment and slammed a door in my face while i tore off my clobber i had time to look about me and note that j c spring ma did himself as well afloat as he did ashore there was polished walnut and brocade velvet curtains on the ports fine carpet and leather furniture and even a fireplace with a painting of some greek idiots in beards it was a bigger craft than id realised and rivalled cohe one in which suleiman usman had carried us to singapore through an open door i could see a lavatory in marble and glass with a patent showerbath which for some reason made me randier than ever and i pounded on her door roaring endearments it swung open under my fist and there she was on tother side of the bed posed with her back to the bulkhead for a moment i stood staring and spring and old arnold would have been proud of me for my first thought was andromeda on her rock awaiting the monster haha which proves the benefit of a grounding in the classics she was stark naked and yet entirely clad for she had cinched in her long hair with a white ribbon round her neck so that it framed her face like a cowl while beneath the ribbon it hung in a shimmering black curtain that covered her almost to her ankles her arms were spread out desperatelike on the panelling and as i goggled she pushed one knee through the silky tresses and pouted at me we never went near the bed for it would have been a shame to disturb her tableau vivant much i just heaved her up and piled in against the panels grunting for joy and ill swear the boat rocked at its moorings for she teased no longer when it came to serious work and i wasnt for lingering myself it was splendid fun while it lasted which was until she began to shudder and scream and tried to throttle me with her hair so i romped her up and down all the way to the lavatory where we finished the business under the patent showerbath once id got the knack of the dam thing which aint easy with a mad nymph clinging to your manly chest most refreshing it was though and brought back memories of sonseearray my apache princess who was partial to coupling under waterfalls which is deuced cold by the way and the pebbles dont help miranda spring knew a trick worth two of that for when wed come to our senses and towelled each other dry with much coy snickering on her part she showed me to a little alcove off the main cabin where an excellent collation was laid out under covers with bubbly in a bucket we recruited our energies with lobster and chicken but when i proposed that we finish off the wine on deck she came all over languid and said we would be ever so comfee on the bed and if youd seen that exquisite young body artfully swathed in her hair with those fine ivory poonts thrusting impudently through it youd have agreed but she must finish her dessert too like all chichis she had a passion for sugary confections so she brought it to bed if you please and gorged herself on eclairs and cream slices while i fondled her well content to play restfully for a change not so madam being a greedy little animal she must satisfy both her appetites at once and call me conservative if you will i hold that a woman who gallops you while consuming a bowl of blancmange is wanting in respect i left off nibbling her tits to rebuke her bad form but the saucy little gannet stuck out her tongue and went on eating and cantering in a most leisurely fashion right my lass thinks i and waited until shed downed the last cherry and licked the spoon settled herself for a rousing finish and was beginning to moan and squeal in ecstatic frenzy at which point i gave an elaborate yawn hoisted her gently from the saddle and announced that i was going on deck for a swim she squawked like a staggered hen eyes still rolling sweem wha now but but oah no no nott yett why not better than all this boring frowsting in bed what come along a dipil do you no end of good i gave them a playful flip keep you in trim you know boreeng if you can imagine andersens mermaid moved from dazed bewilderment to screaming passion in an instant you have miranda boreeng me aieee you you but even as i prepared to parry a clawing attack to my amazement her rage gave way to sudden consternation and then her arms were round my neck and she was pleading frantically with me to stay kissing and fondling and exerting her small strength to pull me down oah no no please harree please dont go please i am ever so sorree oah i was wicked to tease you mustnt go up nott yett please stay love me harree oah please dont go changeable chit aint you no no miss im going topsides for a swim and some sunshine no no it was a squeal of real alarm please please you must stay here she fairly writhed on to me gasping well ive known em eager but this was flattery of the most persuasive kind please please harree love me now oah do wet no later if youre a good little girl after my swim no now oah i shall be a badd big girl she gave a whimper of entreaty stay with me and i will be verree badd don go and i will she put her lips to my ear giggling and whispered i was so taken aback i may well have blushed good god i never heard the like why you abandoned brat where on earth did you hear of such at school i dont believe it she nodded gleefully eyes shining and i was speechless depraved women ive known thank heaven but this one was barely out of dancing class and here she was proposing debauchery that would have scandalised a cairo pimp heavens it was new to me even and i told her so she smiled and bared her teeth oah then you will certainlee nott go on deck just yett whispers she you will stay with wicked miranda yess well a gentleman should always indulge the whims of the frail sex even if it does mean foregoing a refreshing swim but i confess that if i hadnt been a degenerate swine myself her behaviour thereafter would have shocked me id have thought at thirtysix and having enjoyed the attentions of lola montez susie willinck my darling elspeth and other inventive amorists too numerous to mention that id nothing to learn about dalliance but by the time young miranda had had her girlish will of me and i was lying more dead than alive in the showerbath i could barely gasp one of springs latin tags ex africa semper aliquid novi by gum i must have managed to crawl back to the bed for when i woke it was growing dusk and miranda was dressed and wearing an apron humming merrily as she cooked omelettes in the galley for our supper while i lay reflecting on the lack of supervision in colonial finishing schools and wondering if id be fit for more jollity before the mail tender left in the morning i ate my omelette with a trembling hand but when she teased me into sharing asparagus with her nibbling towards each other along the spear until our mouths met i began to revive and was all for it when she said we should spend the night aboard and her butler would see my traps taken down to the wharf in good time but i shall be quite desolate at parting for i have never knoawn anyone as jollee as you harmer cries she stroking my whiskers you are ever so excessivelee wicked far worse than papa said then were a pair tell you what lets take a turn on deck and then well play picquet and if you cheat ill tie you up in that raphunzel hair of yours and show you what wickedness is but i am thee greatest cheat laughs she so we went on deck and i had to tell her the story of raphunzel which shed never heard while she nestled against me by the rail in the warm darkness with the water chuckling against the hull and the last amber glow dying above the western rim it was the place to linger with a girl but presently it grew chilly so we went down to our hand of picquet she was no cheat at all though so i had to teach her but once or twice i wondered if her mind was on the game at all for she kept glancing at the clock and when it struck she started and fumbled her cards and apologised laughing like a schoolgirl clumsee clara the nursery exclamation reminded me what a child she was lord love us id been married before she was born aye and a damned odd child behind the vivacious chatter and mischievous smile with her babylonian bedroom manners peculiar lusts are supposed to be a male prerogative but the truth is we aint in it with the likes of the empress tzuhsi or lola of the hairbrush or that russian aunt i knew who went in for flogging in steambaths or miranda spring not yet of age smiling brightly to cover a little yawn jaded from her mattress exertions no doubt well brisk you up presently thinks i with a few of those hindu gymnastics that mrs leslie of meerut was so partial to there was a vague sound from somewhere outside and then a heavy footfall on the deck over our heads the butler from the house was my first thought and miranda dropped a eard in shuffling retrieved it and offered me the pack to cut who is it says i and she glanced at the clock suddenly i realised she was trembling but it was excitement not fear and the smile in the black eyes was one of pure triumph that will be papa at last says she there is as that sound chap ecclesiastes says a time to get and if ive reached the age of ninetyone its because ive always been able to recognise it i was afoot on the word papa and streaking for the bedcabin where i knew there was a window i wrenched the door open and raced through into the bloody lavatory and by the time i was out again it was too late the biggest malay ive ever seen a huge yellow villain clad only in duck trowsers and with arms like hawsers was at the foot of the companion making way for john charity spring in full warpaint reefer jacket pilot cap and a face like an old testament prophet he took in the scene hands thrust into pockets and growled to the malay on deck jumbo and if he sticks his neck out break it he turned his glare on miranda who was still seated the pack in her hands and barked at her did this thing molest you she riffled the cards cool as you like while my bowels dissolved no papa he did nott he tried though ill lay i know the villain his voice rose to its accustomed roar did he lay his vile hands on you answer me oh christ i thought its the finish but she simply glanced at me with infinite scorn shrugged her slim shoulders and made an inelegant spitting noise spring stood breathing like a bellows his wild eyes moving from one to other of us i knew better than to utter a denial and i didnt laugh either like rash michel aye ill swear he did though didnt you you lousy lecher he strode to confront me jerking his fists from his pockets his jaw working in fury didnt you by god oh papa of course he tried to kiss mee do you think he is the first i am nearly eighteen you knoaw if ever a voice stamped its foot hers did she sounded like an impatient governess i am nott a child what were you expecting after oll she tossed her head but he is just a great bullee and a great coward as you said his breath was rasping on my face and his eyes were like a mad dogs but suddenly he wheeled about stared at her and then strode to a cupboard on the bulkhead and dragged out a large volume which i recognised in amazement as a bible he slammed it down on the table beside her miranda says he and his voice was hoarse either with rage or fatherly concern my child it grieves me to do this but i must swear to me on this book that no no unworthiness no impropriety passed between you and this creature oh papa what a fuss about notheeng this is so sillee silly be damned bawls paterfamilias put your hand on the blasted book girl he seized her wrist and slapped her palm on the bible now make your oath and take care aye quid de quoque viro et cui dicas saepe caveto mind even with a rat like him swear i braced myself to leap for the ladder resolved to kick the appalling jumbo in the crotch god willing for while the dear child had lied splendidly thus far i knew she was conventreared on all that hellfire and mortal sin bilge and wouldnt dare perjure and i stopped in the nick of time for she was giving an angry little shrug looking papa sulkily in the eye and swearing by almightee godd that she had repelled my clumsy advances with ease and it would take a better man than flashy to drag her into the long grass or words to that effect spring ground his teeth in relief and then spoke two words ill wager hed never uttered in his life before forgive me my child i never doubted you but i know this scoundrel dye see he turned his dreadful face to me and if hair and claws had sprouted from his hands id not have wondered it would break my heart snarls he if i thought but there god bless you child he bussed her resoundingly on the forehead and the little trollop gave him a smile of radiant purity you are the bravest of girls and the dearest of daughters quem te deus esse jussit now go along to bed and give thanks to him who has guarded you this day goodnight dear papa says she and kissed the brute she walked to the companion and god help us as she passed me she pursed her lips in a silent kiss and winked then she was gone and spring hurled the bible into its cupboard and glared at me and you if you ever pray which im damned sure you dont can give thanks for the innocence of a good woman a novelty in your filthy experience is she not well novelty was the word for miranda no error if not innocence aye shes as pure as you are vile as straight as you are warped as brave as you are bah and she dont lie either he gave his barking laugh so you neednt stand quaking my hero sit down now id stood mum and paralysed through the astonishing scene ive just described because thats what you do when j c spring is on the rampage why the devil he wasnt in grahamstown hadnt crossed my mind id been too busy thanking god that his daughter was a complete hand and that the old monster had swallowed her tale whole but since he had why all was well surely and i could depart without a stain on my character i recalled my wits and met his eye two damned difficult things to do i can tell you thankee but i think ill take my leave if youll do no such thing bawls he now that youre here youll stay awhile and give me the pleasure of your blasted company sit damn you i sat believe me and he gave a great whitewhiskered grin chuckling and poured two stiff tots from the decanter on the buffet no orange this time i think sneers he yell want it straight if im a judge cigar or cheroot you far easters like em black i believe go on man utrum horum mavis accipe and take your ease your health while youve got it i downed the brandy as if it was water for id seen spring jovial before and knew what could come of it he seated himself opposite me at the table sipped and wiped his whiskers and eyed me with genial malevolence id as soon be smiled at by a cobra so ye didnt heed me says he well yeve more bottom than ever i gave you credit for and if you were half the man you look instead of the toad i know you to be id not blame you miranda is a maid to bewitch any man im proud o that girl flashman with good cause and if i thought yed laid a finger on her suddenly the hellish glare was back in his eyes and his scar was pulsing id serve you as i served another reptile that tried to defile her by god i would he smashed his fist on the table i found her fighting for her chastity aye in her own chamber by heaven with a foul seducing frogeating sonofabitch who sought to have his vile way with her when my back was turned my daughter the bastard there was spittle on his beard what dye say to that hey when a maniac inquires answer damnable french was he well there you are dye know what i did to him his voice was soft now but the empty eyes werent i stripped him stark and cut the life out of him sixtyone strokes and you wouldnt have known he was human murder youll say no no not at all quite the but the fact is flashman i was beside myself cries this raving ogre aye homo extra est corpus suum cum irascitur you remember absolutely may i trouble you for the brandy captain there were those suspected me dye think i gave a dam it was just i tell you condign punishment as the articles say and that lass of mine that young heroine ill never forget it never fighting like a tigress against that beasts base passion but not a tear or a tremor thank god i came in time you should have seen her base passion a few hours ago thinks i and quailed at the memory god if ever he found out he sipped brandy growling came out of his reverie of mirandaworship and realised hed been confiding in the scum of the earth but you were no threat to her he curled his lip no not you ye see flashman i could trust her virtue to be stronger even than your depravity else id never ha let you within a mile of her let alone permit her to beguile you here aye that jars you oh youve been had my son for an instant the pale eyes were alight with triumph then he was scowling again but ive been through hell this day knowing she was within your reach my skin crawls yet at the thought of it but shes my daughter steel true blade straight and too much for you or a dozen like you it hit me like a blow id known there was something horribly amiss when hed arrived unexpected but then miranda had quieted him and hed been civil and only now was it plain that id been trapped most artfully and damnably by this murderous pirate and his slut of a daughter but why it made no sense he had no quarrel with me hed said so in those very words what dye mean what dye want of me ive done nothing you heard her nothing you say oh youve done nothing today i know that or youd not be alive this moment but think back ten years flashman to the night when you and your conniving whore willinck crimped me out of orleans id no hand in that i swear and you told me that i bore no grudge his laugh was a jeering snarl more fool you for believing me but your wits all in your loins and belly isnt it you cant conceive what it meant for a man of my breeding my eminence damn your eyes a scholar a philosopher honoured and respected a man of refinement a master and commander even in the degraded depths of a slaveship a man born to have rule aye better to reign in hell than serve in heaven roars he spraying me with his incoherent rage so consumed by it that for once latin quotation failed him to be hounded before the mast by scum who wouldnt have pulleyhaulied on my ship herded with filthy packet rats fed on slop and glad to get ii threatened with the cat by jesus aye stare rot you i john charity spring fellow of oriel damn them all to hell thieves trimmers and academic vermin his voice sank to a hoarse whisper for he was back on the oxford coack again contemplating his ruined career his berserk fit over thank god for id never seen him worse he took a huge breath filled his glass and brooded at me i cleaned the heads on that ship flashman all the way to the cape his tone was almost normal now thanks to you and dye think a day has passed in ten years when i havent remembered what i owe you and now here you are at last we may agree with horace i think raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede poena claudo i see from your vacant gape that youre no better acquainted with his works than you were on the college damn your ignorance so ill tell you it means that justice though moving slowly seldom fails to overhaul the fleeing villain he shoved the bottle at me have some more brandy why dont you your flights over bucko this was desperate but terrified as i was i could see something that he had overlooked and it spurred me now to unwonted defiance though i came to my feet and backed away before i voiced it keep your bloody brandy and your threats cos they dont scare me spring i dont know what your game is but youd best take care because youve forgotten something im not a friendless nobody nowadays and i aint some poor french pimp neither you think you draw water well you aint the only one a heavensent thought struck me your governor grey has charged me sir harry flashman vc kb and be damned to you with a personal message to lord palmerston dye hear so you can come off your blasted quarterdeck because you darent touch me i cast a quick glance at the companion ready to run like hell the pale hypnotic eyes never blinked but his mouth twisted in a grin my what a dunghill rooster weve grown to be sure vox et praeterea nihil but youve forgotten something too no one saw you come aboard here it was a hired rig that brought you to my house and my servants are safe folk so if the distinguished flashman with all his trumpery titles were to disappear why he sailed on the mail for home and if by chance word came months from now that you never boarded the mail a mystery and who more baffled than your old shipmate john charity spring what silent are we stricken speechless he pushed back his chair and reached a flask from the buffet youd better try some schnapps i think there dont bite the glass you fool drink it christ what a craven thing you are sit down man before you fall vitiant artus aegrae contagia mentis as ovid would say if he could see you and rest easy im not going to harm a hair of your precious head that was no comfort at all from him i knew that diseased mind too well he meant me some hideous mischief but i could only wait shuddering until he told me what it was which he was preparing to do with sadistic relish brimming my glass and resuming his seat before he spoke when i heard youd landed it was a prayer answered but i couldnt see how to come at you until miranda showed the way oh she has all my confidence the only creature on earth in whom i put trust let me beckon him says she and didnt she just on that first night at government house it was gall to my soul to see it my girl and you you dirty satyr a dozen times i would ha cried it off for fear of what harm might come to her but she laughed away my doubts trust me papa my girl dye wonder i worship the earth she treads on would you believe he leaned forward gloating twas she advised i should warn you off hell come all the faster to spite you if he thinks it safe says she she knew you dye hear oh yes flashman she knows all my story from oxford to the middle passage and shes as bent on settling her fathers scores as he is himself we have no secrets you see my girl and i i could think of one oh shed tricked me into his clutches right enough but shed humbugged him too whoring away like a demented succubus while he was biting his nails over her supposed virtue and the doting old lunatic believed her god knew how many shed been in the bushes with his stainless virgin if only id dared to tell him suddenly i felt sick and not only with fear something was wrong with my innards and you came to the bait like the lustful swine you are says spring and its time to cast our accounts and pay eh flashman you know me with any other of the monsters id known id have pleaded and whined and tried to buy off but he was mad and my mind seemed to be growing numb another wave of nausea came over me my head swam and i took a stiff gulp of schnapps to steady myself belay that growls spring and snatched the glass from me i dont want you dead to the world before ive done he seized my wrist sit still damn you ha pulse sluggish very good he dropped my hand and sat back and as the sick fit shook me again i saw that he was smiling now you know what a crimped sailorman feels like says he yes the schnapps is loaded just like the mixture that fat tart slipped to me in orleans i believe in eye for eye you see no more no less you shipped me out drugged and helpless and now youre going the same way you can live on skilly and hardtack you can try your vc and kb on a bucko mate you can have your arse kicked from here to baltimore and see how you like it damn your blood his voice was rising again but he checked himself and leaned forward to thumb up my eyelid and i couldnt raise a hand to stop him thats right says he baltimore with a skipper of my acquaintance if i were a vindictive man it would ha been orleans but im giving you an even chance dye see baltimores about right i reckon youve been there before so you know whats waiting for you eh he stood up and i tried to follow but my legs wouldnt answer i heaved and couldnt move a muscle but the horror of it was that i could see and hear and feel the sweat pouring over my skin god knows what poison hed fed me but it had gripped me all in an instant i tried to speak but only a croak came out spring laughed aloud and stooped to me the demonic pale eyes gleaming and began to shout at me hear this damn you youll go ashore derelict and penniless as i did and word will go ahead of you to the police and the federal people not only in baltimore but in washington and orleans youll find they have fine long memories flashman theyll remember beauchamp millward comber the us navy have their file on him i daresay perjury impersonation and slavetrading but thats nothing is it youre wanted for slavestealing too as i recall which is a capital offence and theyre a dam sight hotter on it now than they were ten years ago even and then theres the small matter of complicity in the murder of one peter omohundro oh its quite a score and i dont doubt theres more that i dont know about he stood straight and now he seemed to have swollen into a ghastly giant whitebearded and hideous who struck at me but i couldnt feel the slaps although they were jarring my head right and left see how much good your medals and honours and the brave name of sir harry flashman does you when the yankee law has you by the neck aye olim meminisse juvahit rot you his bellowings were growing fainter crawl or run or worm your way out of that if you can good luck to you bon voyage you sonofabitch the pounding in my ears blotted out all other sounds and my sight was going for i could no longer make out his form and the cabin lights were dwindling to pinpoints the nausea had passed my senses were going but i remember clear as day my last thought before i went under and twasnt about spring or miranda or the hellish pickle awaiting me no for once id recognised his quotation it had been framed on the wall of the hospital at rugby where id sobered up on that distant day when arnold kicked me out olim meminisse juvabit and dooced appropriate too seneca if memory serves three times in my life ive been shanghaied and each time there was a woman in the case miranda spring phoebe carpenter and fanny duberly although i acquit pretty little fan of any ill intent and the occasion in which she was concerned saw me trepanned with my eyes open on the two others it was flashy outward bound with a bellyful of puggle from which i didnt awake until we were well out to sea and theres no worse place to come to than below deck on a windjammer when the skippers in a hurry this one was an american with a broken nose and a beard like a scarf beneath his rock of a chin my heart sank at the sight of him for he had downeaster written all over him id hoped when i crawled out of the stuffy hole in which i found myself and puked my heart out on a deck that seemed to be near perpendicular that id find a good corruptible frog or dago on the poop but spring had chosen his man well damn him this one had eyes like flint and whined through his nose spew over the side caint ye was his greeting as i staggered up out of the scuppers and held on for my life he stood braced without support in a gale that was bringing green sea over the rail in icy showers soaking me in an instant but at least it washed my tiffin and supper away do that in a calm an yell swab it up yourself mister now git back below till ye can stand straight an keep out o the way dye hear its not easy to conduct negotiations on a spraylashed deck during a howling tempest but i was wasting no time a hundred pounds if youll take me to port nolloth or walfish bay id no notion where we were in the south atlantic but i doubted if we were far out as yet and any port would do so long as it wasnt baltimore or the cape with spring infesting the place five hundred if youll carry me to england got it on ye shouts he i hadnt id been stripped clean of cash papers even my cherootcase youll have it the moment we drop anchor look a thousand if you set me down anywhere between brest and london it dont have to be english waters even that was when he knocked me down grabbed me by the belt and heaved me aft im over thirteen stone but i might have been his gunnysack he threw me into his cabin kicked the door to and watched me crawl to my feet thats the short way of tellin you i aint for sale says he least of all to a lousy limey slavestealer even in my distempered state that sounded damned odd you aint a southerner youre a yankee dammit that i am says he an i make my livin tween benin an brazil mostly that satisfy ye a slaver in other words if not this voyage trust spring so i tried another tack youll hang for this dye know that youre a kidnapper and im sir harry flashman colonel in the british army and spring told me thats what yed say but youre a liar an he aint your names comber an in the states theyve got warrants out for you for everythin cept pissin in the street spring told me that too so any hangin there is youll do it youre wrong you fool im telling the truth you yankee idiot dont hit me he stood over me rubbing his knuckles now you listen mister cos im runnin out o patience john c spring is my friend an when he pays an trusts me for a job i do it an youre goin to baltimore an well lay off sparrows point a couple o days while the letters he give me goes ashore to let the taps know youre comin an then you go an till then youll work your passage an i dont give two cents worth of a port mahon seahorses droppings if youre comber or lord harry flasher or president buchanan savvy now you git up and walk along easy to the focsle its that way an give your callin card to mr fitzgibbon whos the mate an hell show you to your stateroom now skat having felt his fist twice i skatted and so began several weeks of vile hard work and viler food but if youve been a slave to the malagassies or lain in a bottledungeon in india or been toasted on a gridiron or fagged for bully dawson well you know things could be worse id been a deckhand before but i didnt let on so i was never sent aloft fitzgibbon and the skipper whose name was lynch were firstrate seamen so far as im a judge and the last thing they wanted was some handless farmer hindering work so i was tailing on and hauling and holystoning and greasing and painting and tarring and doing any of the countless unskilled menial tasks of shipboard oh i cleaned the heads too and because i knew better than to shirk i rubbed along well enough bar seasickness which wore off after a week and inedible tack and being played out with fatigue and driven halfcrazy by that hellish creaking and groaning din that never ceases on a sailing packet you get used to that too though the focsle gang were a hardbitten crowd scowegians and germans mostly but i was big and strong enough to be let alone and i didnt encourage conversation you may think i make light of it being kidnapped and pressed into seaslavery but if ive learned anything its that when you have no choice you must just buckle down to misfortune and wait it was all sufficiently beastly to be sure but dye know i reckon spring was cheated of that part of his vengeance as ive said id been through hell and back before in my chequered life far worse than spring had and being a packetrat was that much less of an ordeal to me than it must have been to him he thought he was godalmighty you see lording it over riffraff by virtue of his eminence as hed called it by which i guess he meant his masters ticket and his ma and simply being the great john charity spring classical don and fellow of oriel damn your ryes now i am riffraff when i have to be and so long as i can see a glimmer at the end of the passage well dum spiro spero as we scholars say having his hightable arse kicked must have had spring gnawing the rigging i took care not to be kicked his haughty spirit rebelled i aint got one another thing that cheered me up was my belief that spring being mad as a weaver to start with had let his harboured spite get the better of his few remaining wits if he thought he was dooming me to death or the chaingang by packing me off to the states he was well out of reckoning what he had said about my american embarrassments was true enough but that had been a long time ago its a painful story but in case you havent read it in my earlier memoirs ill give you the heads of it here ten years back when springs slaver the balliol college with flashy aboard as reluctant supercargo had been captured off cuba by an american patrol id deemed it prudent to assume the identity of beauchamp millward comber our late third mate whod told me on his deathbed that he was an admiralty agent who was only sailing with spring to spy on his slaving activities if you think im stretching the us navy didnt combers papers saw me through but it was touch and go so id slipped my cable and looked for a way home i thought id found one when the underground railroad a clandestine troupe of lunatics who ran escaped slaves to canada got their hands on me they had ears everywhere even in the us navy department and offered to help me north if id take an important runaway nigger with me to freedom that enterprise had ended with me going over one rail of a mississippi steamboat while the darkie with a slavecatchers bullet in him had gone over tother subsequently id been overseer on a plantation lost my situation for rogering the lady of the house escaped north with a female octoroon slave whod killed two men en route been shot in the backside by pursuers while crossing the ohio river found refuge with congressman abraham lincoln whod dragooned me into testifying at the adjudication on springs slaveship in new orleans been unwillingly reunited with my dear old commander who had then murdered one omohundro in a pub fled with him to seek shelter with a whore of my acquaintance whod obligingly had old jc shanghaied and had at last won back to england home and beauty via the great plains an apache village and san francisco slightly out of breath honestly id have been better going into the church or banking or politics even in any event thats how the sparks flew upward on my first visit to america and you can see springs point in my brief sojourn id been an impostor and perjurer stolen slaves and was wanted for murders i hadnt committed in mississippi or it may have been tennessee for all i know as well as for aiding and abetting springs stabbing of omohundro an impressive tally i concede and none the better for being all entirely against my will however i doubted if the us navy was much concerned with the fugitive comber at this late date and id no intention of going near the mississippi i wasnt wanted in maryland where baltimore is let me present myself to a british consul there or in washington which was only forty miles away and i was on easy street the great thing you see was that i wasnt comber but i was sir harry flashman not unknown by name and fame and once i was under our embassys wing warrants from farflung states for the arrest of nonexistent combers etc would matter not at all not in washington or the north at least if i were fool enoughto venture south where there might be witnesses to identify me that would be a different and damned unpleasant kettle of fish as spring had pointed out my rank and heroic stature at home wouldnt weigh much with a louisiana jury so you can see why i wasnt overtroubled about what lay ahead indeed my preoccupation was how to pay spring out when i was safe home in england the evileyed bastard had terrified drugged and kidnapped me subjected me to the gruelling misery of packetratting and done his damnedest to deliver me to an american gallows well he was going to rue the day straight prosecution was out of the question it would take too long likely uncover past history which id i at her keep dark and almost certainly fail in the end the whole business was too wild and the thought of returning to testify at the cape with spring frothing at me across the court no id prefer not especially since the most artistic revenge had already occurred to me a detailed account to the address of j c spring ma of the contortions which his saintly miranda and i had performed aboard dear papas yacht that would bring a blush to his cheek it would destroy him wound him to the depths of his rotten soul probably drive him crazy altogether he might even murder her and swing for it well the bitch deserved it no shed swear blind that i was lying out of spite and hed believe her or pretend to but in his heart hed always know it was the truth aye that would teach him that flashys a critter best left alone because as thomas hughes pointed out he can find ways of striking home that you aint even thought of now ill not weary you with any further relation of life at sea when uncle harry was a lad but hasten on to chesapeake bay which i reckon we reached in about eight weeks but it may have been more i made two further attempts to suborn captain lynch promising him golconda if he would put me down at new york or boston but i might as well have talked to the mast i believe my speech and bearing and my conduct aboard had sown some doubt in his mind for he didnt hit me on either occasion but perhaps because he was a man of his word as some of these halfwit shellbacks are or more likely because spring had a hold on him he wasnt to be budged youre goin to baltimore even if the chesapeakes afire so ye can save your wind says he and that was that we lay two days in the bay and i didnt doubt that springs letters had gone ashore with the pilot now that the grip had come all my assurance had melted like snow off a dyke and i was in a fine funk again dreaming hideous nightmares in which i was swimming slowly towards a misty jetty on which stood yankee peelers brandishing warrants made out for the handsomest man in the army and jangling their handcuffs and all my american illwillers were there singing jubilee omohundro and the squirt mandeville whod caught me galloping his wife and buck the slavecatcher and his gang and the pokerfaced navy man whose name id forgotten and blasted george randolph the runaway nigger id abandoned and vague figures i couldnt make out but i knew they were the cumanches of bents fort and iron eyes whod chased me clear across the jornada and then somehow i was in the adjudication court at orleans but instead of the wizened little adjudicator it was spring on the bench in gown and mortar board waving a birch and shouting aye there he is the great toad who ravishes daughters and cant construe horace to save his soul flashmanum monstrum informe ingens et horrendum mark him well ladies and harlots for juvenal never spoke a truer word omne in praecipiti vitium stetit by thunder and when i looked at the jury they were all the american women id betrayed or discarded fat susie weeping sonseearray sulking the french nigger cleonie whom id sold to the priest at santa fe willowy cassy looking down her fine nose coalblack aphrodite and the slavewomen at greystones but their faces were all turned to the bench and now it wasnt spring who sat there but arnold in a pilot cap glowering at me and then miranda was tripping up beside him swirling her hair about her like a cloak giggling as she stooped to whisper in his ear but it wasnt his ear it was congressman lincolns and i saw his ugly face scowl as he listened nodding and heard his drawl as he said that reminded him of a story hed heard once from an english naval officer who didnt know what clubhauling meant i came back to waking very slowly with sense stealing over me like a sunrise almost imperceptibly growing gradually conscious of a throbbing ache in my temples and a dryness in my mouth and throat that was truly painful there was someone beside me for i could feel the warmth of a body and i thought elspeth until i remembered that i was in a ship at sea bound for baltimore and that awful nightmare which thank god was only a dream after all conjured up out of my fears but there was no motion about the place on which lay no gentle rocking as there should have been as we lay at anchor in the chesapeake i opened eyelids that seemed to have been glued together expecting to see the knothole in the floor of the bunk above me as id seen it with every awakening for the past many weeks it wasnt there and no bunk either instead there was a dingy white ceiling and when i turned my head there was a bare wall with a grimy window i was ashore then but how and for how long i tried to conjure up my last memory of shipboard but couldnt with the ache in my head and to this day i dont know how i left the ship drunk drugged or sandbagged at the time it didnt signify anyway and even as i reached that conclusion a womans voice said hollo dearie awake are ye say didnt you have a skinful though an american cackle piercing my ear and i shuddered away by instinct which was sound judgment for if i felt dreadful she looked worse a raddled slattern grinning her stinking breath into my face reaching out a fat hand across my chest i almost catted on the spot one thought uppermost did i have we it came out in a faint croak and she leered and heaved herself half across me the paint on her face looked about a week old and her awful bulk was clothed on y in a grubby shift ye mean did you and me she loosed another braying laugh displaying bad teeth no dearie we didnt yet youve bin snorin your big head off all night but youre awake now so how bout my present get away from me you poxridden slut another hoarse whisper but i had strength enough to thrust her away and tumbled over her to the floor i scrambled up dizzy and almost fell again staring about me at a big unbelievably foul whitewashed room in which there were about a dozen beds containing various beings male and female in squalid undress the stench of stale tobacco and unwashed humanity took me by the throat and i blundered for the door falling over a frantically courting couple on the floor and followed by shrill obscenities from my bedmate i found myself on a bare landing confronting a goggling darkie with a bucket in his hand where the hell am i i inquired and had to repeat myself and take him by the collar before he stammered rolling his eyes why boss you in de knittin swedes only later did i know what hed said at the time it sounded like gibberish what town is this why why dis baltimo boss yassuh dis baltimo honnist i let him go and stumbled down two flights of stairs with no notion but to get out of this beastly place without delay there were other doors some of them open on to sties like the one id left and various creatures on the landings but i didnt pause until i bore up unsteadily by a big wooden counter on the ground floor and i think there was a taproom too but what mattered was that there was a street door ahead of me and open air there were a number of seamen lounging at the counter and behind it sitting on a high stool was a figure so unlikely that i thought im still drunk or dreaming he was big and ugly with a nose that had been spread half across his face probably by a club there wasnt a hair on his phiz or gleaming skull the huge arms protruding from his vest were covered with tattoos but what took the eye was that he was clieking away with knitting needles at a piece of woollen work not a common sight in a waterfront dosshouse he purled or cast off or whatever it is that knitters do when they want to take a breather and nodded to a fellow in a striped shirt who was laying some coins on the counter then he looked at me and i realised that the loungers were doing the same in a most disconcerting way i had got some sense back now and saw that this was plainly the receipt of custom where guests settled their accounts and ordered up their carriages equally plainly id spent the night on the premises but when i put a hand to my pocket the bald head shook emphatically you paid for yonny says the knitting swede you wan some grub yust now i declined with thanks and he nodded again you got a ship maybe i was about to say no but one look at the loungers stopped me too many ferret eyes and ugly mugs for my liking and id no wish to be crimped a second time i said i had a ship and a greasy disease in a billycock hat and brass watchchain asked what ship would that be sailor the sea witch and im bully waterman so get the hell out of my way says i being over six feet and heavy set has its uses and i was out in the street and round the corner before hed had time to offer me a drink and a billy behind the ear you didnt linger in establishments like the knitting swedes not unless you fancied a free holiday in a whaler for the next couple of years i walked on quickly reflecting that it had been considerate of lynch to pay my lodging but then it may have been a club rule that insensible members had to be settled for in advance i walked for two minutes and felt so groggy that i had to sit down on a barrel at the mouth of an alley where i took stock i knew i was in sailortown baltimore but that was all the growth on my chin told me i hadnt been ashore above twentyfour hours whatever information spring had sent to the authorities must have been in their hands for two days by now and no doubt it would contain an excellent description even down to my clothes these consisted of a shirt and trousers boots and a canvas jacket the crease not improved by a night in that verminous hole id just escaped from now i doubted if the authorities would be scouring the streets for beauchamp millward comber but the sooner i was under the protection of my countrys flag the better a port the size of baltimore must surely have a british consul or some kind of commercial representative at least who shouldnt be too difficult to find he might look askance at my appearance but it would have to do since captain lynchs generosity hadnt run the length of leaving a single damned penny or anything else in my pockets it wouldnt make my bona fides any easier to establish but id meet that trouble when i came to it although id been in baltimore before with the us navy folk id no notion of how the town lay so i took a slant along the street which was bustling with business round the chandlers shops and warehouses and approached a prosperouslooking old gent to inquire the way to the centre of town id barely got a word out when he rounded on me you goddam leeches cant you work for a change cries he i declare youre stout enough he slapped ten cents into my hand and strode on leaving me wondering if it would buy me a shave and now that my head was clearing i found i was almighty hungry dyou know within an hour i was richer by four dollars and a splendid new vocabulary the first time i ever heard the word bum mean anything but backside was on that morning the beauty of it was i didnt have to beg even my dishevelled clothing unshaven chin and most charming smile with a courteous finger raised to the brow marked me as a mendicant apparently and for every nine who brushed past a tenth would drop a few coppers in my palm damned interesting i found it women were altogether more generous than men especially as i moved uptown when i approached two fashionable young misses with pardon me marm and a bow one of them exclaimed oh my and gave me fifty cents and a fluttery look before they hurried away tittering i left off though when i became aware that i was being watched by a belted constable with a damned disinheriting moustache but ive calculated since that i could have cleared ten thousand dollars a year on the streets of baltimore easy which is two thousand quid sufficient to buy you a lieutenancy in the guards in those days and from the look of some of them id not be surprised i was still no nearer finding the consul and the constable had given me a scare so after a shave and brushup and a hearty steak and eggs at a chophouse i looked for a fellowcountryman and the sure way to do that in america in those days was to find a catholic church i spotted one noted that the name of its priest displayed on the gilt board was rafferty made my way through the musty waxandimage interior and found the man himself delving like a navigator in the garden behind the church whistling the young may moon in his shirtsleeves he greeted me with a cry of hollo me son and what can i be doin for ye on this parky day a jaunty little leprechaun with a merry eye i asked my question and he pulled a face faith now an i dont know theres any such crater in baltimore says he jist off the boat are ye the shrewd blue eyes took me in well if tis diplomatic assistance yere seekin washingtonll be the place for you where our minister is hes new come an all they tell me lyons his name is an english feller hell be your man right enough and what would ye say yes or no to a cup o tea seeing him so affable and with only two dollars in my pocket it struck me that if i played smooth i might touch him for the fare to washington so i affected the faintest of brogues and introduced myself as grattan nugenthare of the rathfarnham and trinity college lately arrived to join my brother frank who held a minor position in a washington bank unfortunately i had been set upon soon after landing the previous night and was without cash or effects he opened eyes and mouth wide dye tell me dear god whats the world comin to an you wi your foot barely on the ground and from dublin too have ye been to the police man dear ye have an got little good o them aye well theyve a hard row to hoe wi some queer ones in this town ill tell ye they wouldnt know of a british

have that dish o tea while we think whats best to be done an hows the liffey lookin eh i sat in his kitchen while he prattled irishly and made tea since id never been in dublin in my life i found it safest to let him run on with a cheery agreement from time to time waiting an opportunity to state my needs but he didnt give me one being content to prose sentimentally about the ould country until an yere in the banking line yourself are ye says he at last ah well yere in the right furrow in ameriky fine grand opportunities for a gentleman like yourself so there are its a commercial world so it is a commercial world but none the worse for bein that if the trades honest an the words good an yere a trinity man too he chuckled wistfully ah this is a country of grand prospects but i wonder could a man do better than sit in the ould college court contemplatin the trees on st stephens green on a summers evenin youd be there about am i right i made a hasty calculation and said rather earlier then ye would know ould professor faylen cries he a fine man that an a grand hebrew scholar so they said not that im a judge he would still be about in your day was he not i can smell a false lead as fast as anyone but he was such a happy simpleton that i decided it was safe to say i hadnt studied under faylen myself but knew of him he nodded amiably and sighed ah well here am i blatherin on an you itchin to take your way to washington aye but with your pockets all to let well man dear i was after thinkin yonder that id be makin ye a small loan for your train ticket but dye know id he party to an awful sin if i did that so i would ye see says he shaking his pawky old head the day ye find a priest sittin in the court at trinity is a day yell be able to skate over dublin bay from bray to balbriggan an as for seein st stephens green from the court well i doubt if even ould faylen could see that far from heaven where hes been this fiveandthirty years god rest his soul an tellin me ye were a banker he added sorrowfully an you wid spurs an brass buttons stickin out all over ye now will ye take another drop o tea soldier an tell me all about it you wouldnt believe it if i did says i rising thankee for the tea padre and ill bid you a very good day stop stop cries he sit down man dear an dont be takin offence at an ould man jist because he knows phoenix park shoulders when he sees them come now be easy an drink your tea can ye not see im burstin to know the coruth of it his smile was so eager and friendly that i found myself smiling in turn what makes you think ill tell truth this time why shouldnt ye yell come to no harm from me if ye do an if ye dont well am i to have no diversion at all now then whuts this i wouldnt believe jist you try me very well im a british army officer i was on my way home from india i was waylaid at cape town and crimped aboard a packet which arrived here yesterday im destitute but thanks to you i know where to find british authorities wholl help me back to england and if you believe that and why would i not it fits ye better than all that moonshine about bankin an trinity ill say that for it whats your name my son there was no earthly reason why i shouldnt tell him so i shook my head least said an why didnt ye ask direction from the first policeman ye saw i still said nothing and he nodded no longer smiling i rose again to go for the sooner i was out of this the better but he stayed me with a hand on my sleeve yell tell me no more well now just bide a minute while i think about no dont go ye want the fare to washington dont ye i waited while he cogitated chin in hand eyes bright as a birds tell ye whut i think yere an officer an a bit of a gentleman i know the look an yere a runner now now dont be addin to your sins by denyin it for i had a parish in leix in the great trouble an i know that look too aye twice as long in the leg as ye would be if i put a futrule on ye an man dear yere a desperate liar but whos not will ye tell me but yere civil at least an yere army an didnt me own father an two uncles an that other good irishman arthur wellesley follow the flag across spain togither they did he paused and sighed now yere a protestant so i cant penance ye for tellin lies but since im dreadful afflicted wid the rheumatics and cant abide diggin at all at all well if ye can sink your gentlemanly pride an finish them two rows for me why twill be for the good o your soul an my body an therell be ten dollars to take ye to washington nine an a half in loan to be repaid at your convenience an fifty cents for your labour well what say ye my son well i needed that ten dollars but whod have thought when campbell pinned my cross on me that seven months later id be digging a bogtrotters garden in maryland father rafferty watched me as i turned the last sods observing dryly that it was plain to see i was english from the way i handled a spade then he gave me a mug of beer and counted ten dollars carefully into my palm ill walk ye to the station says he no onell look twice at ye when yere keepin step wid the church an i can see ye dont get on the wrong train or lose your money or go astray anyways ye know he put me on the right train sure enough but the rest of his statement proved as wrong as could be someone did look at us but i didnt notice at the time possibly because i was busy parrying raffertys artful questions about the army and india at least i could satisfy him i was telling the truth about those ask at the washington station where the british ministers to be found he advised me an if they dont know make your way to willards hotel on fourteenth street an theyll set ye right its the great place an if they turn up their noses at your togs jist give em your hyde park swagger eh but mind how ye go now cries he as i mounted the step to the coach twill be dark by the time ye get in an tis a desperate place for garotters an scallywags an the like we wouldnt want ye waylaid a second time would we gratitude aint my long suit as you know but hed seen me right and he was a cheery wee soul looking down at the smiling pixie face under the round hat i couldnt help liking the little murphy and wondering why hed been at such pains on my behalf its a priests business of course to succour the distressed sinner but i knew there was more in it than that he was a lonely old man far from home and he was irish and had guessed i was on the run and i was army like his father and uncles and he had taken to me as folk do even when they know im not straight i wish yed tell me your name though says he when i thanked him i said id send him my card when i repaid the ten dollars that ye will cries he heartily in the meantime hough your christian name eh harry i believe ye ye look like a harry god knows ye didnt look like what wast grattan grattan the banker from the rathfarnham the impidence of it he laughed and looked wistful aye me sometimes i could wish id been a rascal meself its never too late says i and he spluttered in delight git away wid ye spalpeen cries he and stood waving as the train pulled out a little black figure vanishing into the hissing steam i reckon father rafferty was one of those good fools who are put into the world to grease the axles for people like me they charm so easy if you play em right and the bigger a scoundrel you are the more theyll put themselves out for you no doubt in the hope that if you do reform theyll get that much more treasure in heaven for it you may be astonished to know that i did repay the loan later on but in no spirit of gratitude or obligation or because id quite liked the little ass no i paid because i could easily afford it and theres one rule as a practising pagan that i dont break if i can help it never offend the local tribal gods it aint lucky it was dark when we pulled into washington and the conductor had never heard of the british ministry oh sure he knew willards hotel but plainly wondered what business this rumpled traveller without a hat could have at such a select establishment he was starting to give me reluctant directions when a chap whod alighted from the train directly behind me said if it was willards i wanted why he was going that way himself he was a soberlooking young fellow neatly dressed so i thanked him and we went out of the crowded station into a dark and dirty washington evening its close enough to walk if you dont mind the rain says my companion and since it seemed only prudent to save my cash i agreed and we set off it wasnt too damp but washington didnt seem to have improved much in ten years they were still building the place and making heavy weather of it for the street we followed was ankledeep in mud and so poor was the lighting that you couldnt see where you were putting your feet we jostled along the sidewalk blundering into people and presently my guide pulled up with a mild oath glanced about him and said wed be quicker taking a sidestreet it didnt look much better than an alley but he led the way confidently so i ploughed on behind thinking no evil and suddenly he lengthened his stride wheeled round to face me and whistled sharply im too old a hand to stand with my mouth open i turned to flee for the main street cursing myself for having been so easily duped and after raffertys warning about footpads too and stopped dead in my tracks two dark figures were blocking my way and before i had time to turn again to rush on my single ambusher the larger one stepped forward but when he raised his hands it wasnt to strike he held them palms towards me in a restraining gesture and his voice when he spoke was quiet even friendly good evening mr comber welcome back sir why you maynt believe it but this is just like old times for a split second i was paralysed in mind and body and then came the icy stab of terror as i thought police springs letters my description the alarm going out for comber but then why had the young man not clapped his hand on my shoulder at the station guess you dont remember me says the big shadow its been a whiles nawlins ten years ago in back of willincks place you thought i was navy then i took you to crixus remember it was so incredible that it took me a moment to recall who crixus was the underground railroad boss whose identity i never knew because he hid it under the name of some roman slave whod been a famous rebel crixus was the little steelyeyed bugger whod dragooned me into running that uppity nigger randolph up the river and dam near got me shot but it wasnt possible that he could know of my presence now within a day of my landing hes waitin to see you says the big fellow an the sooner we get you off the streets the better weve got a closed cab i dont understand youre quite mistaken sir i know of nobody called cricket did you say i was babbling with shock and he absolutely laughed say i wish i could think as quick as you do ten years ago billy says he to his companion when we jumped this fellow he started talkin dutch now come along mr comber cos id know you anywhere an were wastin time and safety his voice hardened and he took my arm we mean you no harm like i once told you youre the last man id want to hurt sometimes you feel youre living your life over again it was so now and for an uncanny moment i was back in the alley behind susies brothel with the three figures materialising out of the darkness hold it right there mister youre covered front and rear i knew now it was no use bluffing or running for good or ill they had me it wasnt dutch it was german says i very well im the man you call comber and ill be happy to take your cab but not to mr crixus not until ive been to the british ministry no sir snaps he we got our orders an believe me youll be a sight safer with us than in the british ministry not if your whole queens navy was guarding it so come on mister god knew what that meant but it settled it whatever crixus wanted and i still couldnt take in that hed got word of me or that these fellows were real hed been a friend after his fashion and was evidently still well disposed and with the three pressing about me and my arm in a strong hand i had no choice very good says i but you dont put a sack over my head this time he laughed and said i was a card and then they were hustling me out of the alley and into a closed growler mighty practised with one in front one gripping me the third behind the big man shouted to the driver and we were lurching along back towards the station as near as i could judge and then we swung right across a broad quagmire of a street and through the lefthand window i caughta glimpse in the distance of what i recognised as the capitol without its dome they still hadnt got its bloody lid on would you believe it in and knew we must be crossing the avenue going south the big man saw me looking and whipped down the blinds and we bowled along in the stuffy darkness in silence while i strove to calm my quivering nerves and think out what it all meant how theyd found me i couldnt fathom and it mattered less than what lay ahead what the devil could crixus want with me a horrid thought did he know id left randolph to his fate on that steamboat well id thought the bastard was dead and hed turned up later in canada anyway so id heard so it wasnt likely to be that he couldnt want me to run niggers again surely no it defied all explanation so i sat fretting in the cab with the big man at my side and his two mates opposite for what must have been a good halfhour and then the cab stopped and we descended on what looked like a suburban street with big detached houses in gloomy gardens either side and underfoot nothing but washington macadam two feet of gumbo they led me through a gate and up a path to a great front door the big fellow knocked a signal and we were in a dim hall with a couple of hardlooking citizens one of em a black with shoulders like a prizefighter here he is says my big escort and a moment later i was blinking in the brightness of a wellfurnished drawingroom only halfbelieving the sight of the birdlike figure crying welcome from a great chair by the fireplace he was thinner than i remembered and terribly frail but there was no mistaking the bald dome of head and the glinting spectacles beneath brows like white hedgerows he had a rug over his knees and from his wasted look i guessed he was crippled now but he was fairly whimpering in rapture stretching out his arms towards me it is he my prayers are answered god has sent you back to us oh my boy my brave boy come to my arms let me embrace you he was absolutely weeping for joy which aint usually how im greeted but i deemed it best to submit it was like being clutched by a weak skeleton smelling of camphor oh my boy sobs he ave spartacus oh stand there a moment that i may look on you oh moody do you remember that night that blessed night when we set george randolph on the golden road to freedom and here he is again that mr standfast who led him through the valley of the shadow to the enchanted ground with one or two stops at vanity fair if hed only known but now he broke down altogether blubbering while my big guardian moody sucked his teeth and the black whod come into the room with him glowered at me as though it were my fault that the old fool was having hysterics he calmed down in a moment mopping himself and repeating over and over that god had sent me which i didnt like the sound of i mean to say what had he sent me for it might he that crixus having heard of my arrival god knew how was merely intent on a glad reunion and prose over good old slavestealing times but i doubted it knowing him he might have one foot in the grave and tother hopping on the brink but the grey eyes behind his glasses were as fierce as ever and if his frame was feeble his spirit plainly wasnt god has sent you cries he again in the very hour lor see his hand in this he turned to moody how did you find him cormack telegraphed when he boarded the train at the baltimore depot wilkerson and i were waiting when the train came in he didnt give any trouble why should he cries crixus and beamed at me he knows he has no truer more devoted friends on earth than we who owe him so much but sit down sit down mr comber joe a glass of wine for our friend no stay it was brandy was it not i remember you see he chuckled brandy for heroes as the good doctor said and for ourselves joe gentlemen i give you a toast george randolph on free soil and his deliverer it was plain he didnt know the truth of how dear george hind i had parted company and i was not about to enlighten him i looked manly as he and moody and black joe raised their glasses wondering what the deuce was coming next and decided to get my oar in first i didnt need to pitch him a tale much less the truth you see to him comber was the british admiraltys beau sabreur in the war against the slave trade that was how hed thought of me ten years ago as a man of intrigue and mystery and hed not expect explanation from me now so once id responded with a toady toast of my own i put it to him plain with that earnest courtesy which i knew comber himself would have used if he hadnt been feeding the fish off guinea since my dear sir says i i can find no words to express the joy it gives me to see you again why as mr moody said just now it is like old times though how you knew i was in baltimore i cannot think come come mr comber cries he surely you havent forgotten an ear to every wall and an eye at every window you know not a word passes not a line is written from the congress to the taproom that the railroad does not hear and see he looked solemn it needs not me to tell you that you have enemies but they may be closer than you think two days ago the police here and in baltimore had word of your presence aye and of those brave deeds which our vicious and unjust laws call crimes his voice rose in shrill anger while i thought well thankee spring we have watched every road and depot since and thank god here you are and youre right sir cries i heartily he has sent me to you indeed for i need your help i must reach the british ministry tonight at all costs he jerked up a hand to check me and even then i couldnt help noticing how thin and wasted it was ill swear i could see the lamplight through it not a word say no more sir whatever message you wish to send shall reach your minister never fear but what it is i have no wish to know nor what brings you to our country again for i know your lips must be sealed i can be sure says he looking holy that you are engaged on that noble work dear to your heart and mine the great crusade against slavery to which we have dedicated our lives in this our countries are at one for make no mistake sir we in america are purging the poison from our nations veins at last the battle is fully joined against those traitors within our gates those traffickers in human flesh those betrayers of our glorious constitution those gentlemen of dixie he spat out the word as if it had been vinegar who build their bloodsmeared fortunes with the shackle and the lash at this point he ran short of air and sank back in his chair panting while moody helped him to brandy and joe gave me another glower as though id set the senile idiot oil hed always been liable to cut loose like a kilkenny electioneer whenever slavery was mentioned and here he was doddering towards the knackers yard still at it i waited until hed recovered thanked him warmly and said id be obliged if moody could convoy me to the ministry without delay at this crixus blinked looking uncertain must you go in person can he not take a note papers he gave a feeble little wave forcing a smile can you not stay there is so much to say so much that f would tell you and i long to hear it sir cries i but i must see the minister tonight he didnt like it and hesitated glancing at moody and joe and in that moment i felt the first cold touch of dread the old bastard was up to something but didnt know how to spring it while all sense and logic told me that he could have no business with me at such short notice my cowards nose was scenting mischief breasthigh well by god hed flung me into the soup once and he wasnt doing it again i rose ready to go and he gave a whimper mr comber sir a moment half an hour will make no difference surely spare me that time sir nay i insist you must you shall not regret it i assure you indeed if i know you and he gave me a smile whose radiance chilled my blood you will bless the chance that brought you here i doubted that but i couldnt well refuse he had that implacable light in his eye smile or no and moody and joe seemed to be standing just an inch taller than a moment since i gave in with good grace and sat down again and joe filled my glass crixus studied a moment as though unsure how to begin and then said he supposed i knew how things stood in america at present i said i didnt since my work had taken me east not west and id lost sight of colonial affairs so to speak he frowned as though d no business to be messing with foreign parts and i thought to impress him by adding that id been in russia and india russia wonders he as though it were the isle of wight ah to be sure that unhappy country which forges its own chains i tried to look as though id been freeing serfs right and left but india there is no slavery question there surely i said no but there had been a recent disturbance of which he might have heard and i must go where my chiefs sent me he didnt seem to think much of india or my irresponsible chiefs and returned to matters of importance then you may not know that the storm is gathering over our beloved country and soon must break yes sir cries he getting into his stride the night is almost past but the dawn will come in a tempest that will scour the land to its roots cleansing it of the foulness that disfigures it so that it may emerge into the golden sunlight of universal freedom it will be a time of sore trial of blood and lamentation but when the crisis is past mr comber victory will be ours for slavery will be dead now he was at full gallop eyes bright with zeal yes sir the sands of pleading and persuasion are running out the time has come to unsheath the sword what has patience earned us our enemies harden their hearts and mock our entreaties they stamp their foot with even grosser cruelty upon the helpless bodies of our black brethren i stole a look at our black brother joe to see how he was taking this he was listening rapt and id not have stamped on him for a pension but the nation is waking at last oh its leaders shuffle and compromise and placate the butchers but among the people sir the belief is growing that it is time to arm that the cancer can be cut out only by the sword america is a powderkeg sir and it needs but a spark to fire the train he paused for breath and since the real comber would have raised a cheer i resisted the temptation to cry hear hear and ventured a fervent amen crixus nodded dabbing his lips with a handkerchief and sat forward laying his skinny hand on mine yet still the people hesitate for it is a fearful prospect mr comber not for four score years have we faced such peril it would destroy us cry the fainthearts let it be cry the thoughtless still they hope that conflict may be avoided but given a lead they will cast away their doubts it needs a man to give that lead sir to fire that train he was staring at me his talons tightening and god in his infinite wisdom has sent us such a man for one horrible instant i thought he meant me ive heard worse you know and i knew what this little fanatic was capable of when he had the bit between his teeth i stared hack stricken and he asked what do you know of john brown that hes a hairy impertinent lout who can hold more hard liquor than a distillery was my immediate thought for the only john brown i knew was a young ghillie whod had to be carried home on a hurdle the day id gone on that ghastly deerstalk with prince albert at balmoral when ignatieff had come within an ace of filling me with buckshot but crixus could never have heard of him for this you see was years before balmoral brown had become famous as our gracious queens attendant i confessed d never heard of an american called john brown and crixus said ah with the satisfied gleam of one who is bursting with great news to tell which he did and that was the first i ever heard of old ossawatomie the angel of the lord or the murderous rustler whichever you like to crixus he was gods own prophet a kind of christ with sixguns but if i give you his version unvarnished youll start off with a lopsided view so ill interpolate what i learned later from brown himself and from friends and foes alike all of it true so far as i know which aint to say that crixus wasnt truthful too picture a connecticut yankee a child of the mayflower pilgrims as american as the soil from which he sprang says he born of poor and humble folk raised in honest poverty with little schooling save from the bible accustomed as a lad to go barefoot alone a hundred miles driving his fathers herd see him growing to vigorous manhood strong independent and devout imbued with the love of liberty not only for himself but for all men hating slavery with a deep burning detestation yet in his nature kind benevolent and wise though less shrewd in business in which he had but indifferent success then sir about twenty years ago he conceived a plan nay a wondrous vision whereby slavery in the united states might be destroyed at a stroke it was revolutionary it was inspired but his genius told him it was premature and wisely he kept it in his heart shared only with a few whom he trusted these comprehended his sons on whom he laid by sacred oaths the duty to fight against slavery until it was slain utterly that duty says crixus they began to fulfil when grown to manhood they sought their fortunes in kansas on whose blooddrenched soil was fought the first great battle between abolitionist and slaver between freedom and tyranny between mansoul and diabolus and there mr comber in the scorching heat of that furnace of conflict was tempered the soul and resolution of him whom we are proud to call captain john brown nor was it long says crixus before captain browns fame as a champion of freedom was heard throughout the land too late to prevent the wanton destruction of the town of lawrence by border ruffians he was moved to wrath by the news that the conflict had spread to the halls of congress where the brave senator sumner raised his voice against the despoilers of lawrence and was clubbed almost to death in his very seat by a coward from south carolina in the very senate mr comber conceive if you can sir the emotions stirred in the honest bosom of john brown and ask yourself is it matter for wonder that when a few hours later he came on southern bullies threatening violence to a free slate man he should smite them with the sword yet there are those who would call this just chastisement murder and clamour for the law to be invoked against him flashy well crixus was only saying what he and most of the north believed but the truth of the matter was that brown and his boys had gone to the homes of five proslave men who werent threatening anybody ordered them outside and sliced em up like so much beef with sabres the men were unarmed and it was done in cold blood jb himself never denied the deed though he claimed not to have killed anyone himself that was the pottawatomie massacre the first real reprisal by the free staters and the most notorious act of jbs life bar harpers ferry three years later and even his worshippers have never been able to explain it away most of em just ignore it so now says crixus he was a hunted outlaw he and his brave band they must live like beasts in the wild while the full fury of the border ruffians was turned on the unhappy land men were slaughtered homes and farms burned two hundred men mr comber died in the fighting of that terrible summer of property valued at thousands of dollars destroyed but john brown held the banner of freedom aloft and his name was a terror to the tyrants at last the border ruffians descended in overwhelming force on his home at ossawatomie put it to the torch slew his son frederick and drove the heroic father from the territory too late john browns work in kansas was done it is free soil today and shall so remain but more far more than this he had lighted libertys beacon for all america to see and shown that there can be but one end to this struggle war to the bitter end against slavery crixus had paused for breath and another sip of brandy but now he leaned forward and gripped my hands in his excitement do you know what he said mr comber this good and great old man as he gazed back at his burning home his evolvers smoking in his hands his eyes brimmed with tears for his murdered child can you guess sir what were those words that have rung like a trumpet blast in the ears of his countrymen i said i couldnt imagine and he gulped and raised his eyes to the ceiling he said god sees it i have only one death to die and i will die fighting in this cause there will be no peace in the land until slavery is done for i will carry the war into africa i say why africa i mean its the dooce of a long way and what about transport and no no cries he impatiently by africa he meant the south the land of darkness and savage oppression for now he knew that the time was come to realise his dream that vision of which i spoke he was spraying slightly and i could see that the great news was coming at last the invasion of virginia that sir was his plan and the hour is nigh for its fulfilment after years of maturing and preparation he purposes an armed raid to seize a federal arsenal and with the captured munitions and supplies to equip the slaves who will cast off their bonds and rush to on his standard they will withdraw into the mountain fastnesses and there wage guerrilla war against their former masters oh he has studied the ancient wars sir and lord wellingtons campaign in spain formerly it was his design too found an independent black republic but now his vision has soared beyond for can it be doubted that once his army is in the hills every slave in the south will rise up in arms there will be such a rebellion as was never seen and whatever its outcome the greater battle will be joined free men everywhere will rally to the standard that john brown has raised and slavery will be whelmed forever in the irresistible tide of liberty he was almost falling out of his chair with enthusiasm and moody had to settle him while joe refilled his glass and helped him take a refreshing swig neither of them said anything but crixus was staring at me with the eager expectancy of a drawingroom tenor who has just finished butchering the flowers on mothers grave and awaits applause plainly this fellow brown was a raving loose screw and i knew crixus was no better but it behoved me to respond as comber would have responded and then take my leave for the british ministry so hallelujah says i what a splendid stroke why it will give these these slavers the rightabout altogether a capital notion and will be well received er everywhere ill be bound i suppose its a wellkept secret at the moment what just so thats prudent ill not breathe a word of course well its getting late so it is no secret mr comber says he solemnly the where and when john brown has yet to determine but the intent is known if not to the public at large certainly to all who labour secretly for liberty aye even in congress it is known thanks to the treachery of captain browns most trusted lieutenant you stare mr comber well you may for the traitor was a countryman of your own a rascal named forbes enlisted for his military experience gained in italy with garibaldi he it was who babbled the secret abusing browns name because he claimed his pay was in arrears fortunately those senators in whom he confided were no friends to slavery so no great harm was done and brown at least became aware what a viper he had nourished in his bosom nor has he himself sought to conceal his design since leaving kansas he has been about the north preaching exhorting raising the funds necessary for his great enterprise purchasing arms rifles and revolvers and pikes pikes did you say indeed to arm the slaves when the hour strikes wherever he has gone men have fallen under his spell seeing in him another cromwell another washington destined to bring his country liberty everywhere he rallies support alas he shook his head glooming more have promised than performed his treasury is low his army stout of heart but few in number and even those devoted leaders of opinion who wholeheartedly approve his end shrink timidly at the mention of his means oh blind do they think pious words can prevail against the shackle and the lash and the guns of the border ruffians the dam fools cries he in unwonted passion oh they are sincereparker and gerrit smith sanborn and higginson members of the secret six who are heart and soul in the cause yet fearful of the storm that john browns scheme would unloose the north is with him in sympathy mr comber aye many even in the halls of congress but when his hand goes to his pistol butt they quake like women dreading lest he destroys the union as if that mattered so it is made whole again when slavery is dead but hold on a moment sir if you please i tried to calm him before he did himself a mischief you say they know in congress in the government and he goes about er preaching and so forth well how does he escape arrest i mean to say arrest john brown he gave a bitter cackle why then sir we should have a storm indeed the north would not abide it mr comber he is our hero and he goes silently without fanfare appearing only in those public places where his enemies would not dare raise their voices let alone their hands oh missouri has set a bounty of on his head and that pusillanimous wretch who calls himself our president and whose cowardice has rent the democratic party in twain has sunk so low as to offer why not thirty in silver false buchanan for his apprehension but who in the north would try to claim such rewards thats america for you a maniac at large threatening to stir up war and slave rebellion and nothing done about it not that i gave a dam what with brandy and sitting down i was feeling easier than id done all day and was becoming most infernally bored with captain brown and his madcap plans for setting the darkies against their owners and anxious to be gone so i shook my head in wonder expressed admiration for brown and his splendid activities didnt doubt that hed win a brilliant triumph and hinted that id like to get to the british ministry this year if possible dye know crixus didnt seem even to hear me he was sitting back in his chair brooding on me with an intense stare which i found rather unnerving suddenly he asked me if id had food lately and it came as a shock to realise that my last meal had been in baltimore that morning my god it had been turmoil since then with no time to think of eating i was famished but said i could wait until i reached the ministry he wouldnt hear of it reproaching himself for his thoughtlessness bidding joe rustle up sandwiches and drumsticks waving me back to my chair while moody filled my glass and set a restraining hand on my shoulder with a warning nod to me to humour the old buffoon so i sat fretting but wolfed the grub down when it came while crixus resumed his tale it seemed that brown having squeezed as much cash as he could out of wellwishers liberal philanthropists and rich free blacks had lately returned to kansas under the name of shubel morgan f and had set the border in uproar by raiding into missouri stealing eleven niggers and bringing them to free soil dodging posses all the way the gallantry the audacity of the deed has won all northern hearts and spread terror through the south says he from the very heart of the enemy camp he plucked them forth shepherded them north through the bitter depths of winter the pursuers baying at his heels and brought them at last to safety and only last month mr comber he saw them across the line to british soil oh my boy does not your heart swell with patriotic pride at the thought that those poor fugitives lately bound in the hell of slavery dwell now in freedom beneath the benevolent folds of your countrys flag i assured him between sandwiches that i was gratified beyond all measure and was mentally rehearsing a tactful farewell when he startled me by pushing aside his rug rising unsteadily and confronting me with a pointing finger and bristling brows he spoke slow and solemn but that raid mr comber was only grace before meat for now his little army tried and tested he is ready for the great attempt in his last letter to me for we are in weekly correspondence he tells me that the hour is nigh only one thing he flourished the finger is lacking and in this one thing he seeks my help the defection of the traitor forbes has left him without a lieutenant without a trusty deputy practised in arms to train and marshal his band of adventurers for though their hearts are high they are not soldiers sir and soldiers they must be if they are to foray into virginia storm a federal arsenal overwhelm its garrison troops and form the praetorian guard of the greatest slave army since spartacus challenged the power of rome he stooped towards me brighteyed and panting and seized my wrist as i was in the act of raising a drumstick to my mouth a lieutenant he must have a clear military mind aye or a naval one to plan and to order to chart the course and lead the charge a strong right arm on which to lean in time of trial find me a joshua is his cry to me it has rung in my ears these nights past and until yesterday i knew not where to turn oh i have prayed and now my prayers have been answered beyond my dearest hope he was gazing at me like a dervish on hashish clutching my wrist his eyes burning with the flame of pure barminess as i sat openmouthed the chicken leg poised at my ashen lips i say it yet again god has sent you to us a joshua for john brown looking back on life i guess i cant complain on the whole but if i have a grievance against fate its that i seem to have encountered more than my fair share of madmen with a mission perhaps ive been unlucky or possibly most of mankind is deranged maybe it was my stalwart bearing or my derringdo reputation but whatever it was they came at me like wasps to a saucer of jam at this time in i was already an experienced loonyfancier having been exposed to the brainstorms of bismarck georgie broadfoot the white raja of sarawak yakub beg the khirgiz and sundry smaller fry to say nothing of crixus himself ten years earlier and id learned that when they unfold their idiocies to you and flight is impossible you must take time decide what mask to assume and rely on your native wit and acting ability to talk your way out oddly enough this wasnt a difficult one for a split second his appalling proposal had frozen my blood until i remembered who i was meant to be and that i had a castiron excuse for refusal comber wouldnt have laughed in his face or told him what to do with his disgusting suggestion or dived for the window all i must do was play comber to the hilt and i was safe so i stared at him bewildered for a second and then with great deliberation i set down my drumstick wiped my lips rose and with a smile of infinite compassion gently pressed the old bedlamite back into his chair i adjusted his rug knelt down took one of his claws in both hands and gazed on him like a wistful sheepdog oh my dear old friend says i fairly dripping emotion you do me honour far beyond my deserts that you should think me worthy to play a part in this this great enterprise i bit my lip trying like hell to start a tear i shall never forget it never but alas it cannot be i have my own countrys service my own mission which i must fulfil before all others i sighed shaking my head while his wrinkled features sagged in dismay it grieves me to say you nay but but you dont understand cries he whatever your mission it cannot compare to this that it is worthy and honourable i am sure but dont you see this is the crux the vital moment at one stroke the whole rotten edifice of slavery will be cast down in ruin america is its last vile stronghold how can you hesitate oh dear mr comber all your work all your valiant service in the cause can be as nothing beside this crowning im sorry sir believe me it breaks my heart to deny you but im bound by my duty you see thats what you said last time cries he petulantly i know that sir and it was true but you prevailed on me then to turn from it for george randolphs sake blackmailing old swine but this time i cannot in honour turn aside why not he bleated what could be more honourable than john browns cause he twitched fretfully like a baby denied its rattle his dismay turning to anger you cant fail him i i shant let you he tried another tack stretching out a hand to me whimpering oh my boy i entreat you our need is desperate once before you served us nobly and well again i implore you for the sake of the great crusade which we both ah dont make it harder for me sir groans i in noble anguish i stood up and im not sure i didnt beat my fist against my brow i cannot do it i must go to the british minister if i could postpone or delay i would but i dare not you wont stay me i know you cant was what i meant again history was repeating itself but with a difference this time ten years ago hed threatened to throw me to the us navy traps and id had no hole to hide in now i had the ministry wherever the hell it was and both crixus and i were ten years older i wasnt as easy to bully now and his cold steel had lost its edge with age he sat now plucking at his rug fit to burst with vexation looking in distress to moody and joe both of whom were regarding me hardeyed no he struck his bony hand on the chair no it cant be ill not have it you have come to us by a miracle i cant let you go unpersuaded i cant it sounded like a tantrum and then he gave a sudden squeal for a moment i thought he was having a seizure but it was just inspiration from on high i have it he turned to me bright with passion you must see john brown himself thats it where i have failed he shall prevail oh my boy once you have looked on his countenance and heard him and felt the power of his spirit believe me you will hesitate no longer no one can resist him let me see hes in upper new york at present but i know he means to visit sanborn at boston yes in a few days you could see him and i cant go to boston sir i must report to my chief at once i said it as firmly as i dared and he shot me such a glare that i thought it best to have an inspiration of my own of course i added thoughtfully if the minister could be prevailed on to give me leave to release me from duty why then i left it there looking keen thinking once let me inside that ministry and you wont get me out with a train of artillery you selfish little bastard for a moment his face lit up and then his lip came out and i knew he was calculating that there wasnt a hope in hell of the british minister giving me leave to join a foreign rebellion and was wondering what card to play next yes says he at last yes that would be best i think yes i could see lord lyons myself yes i shall in the meantime you should remain here he gave a convulsive grimace that was meant to be a reassuring smile yes indeed mr comber you will be safer from prying eyes here you may trust the railroad sir and you lose nothing you see for i shall wait upon his lordship in the morning first thing sir i assure you he forced a broader smile halfpleading halfcunning thats settled then eh youll stay my boy wont you he was lying in his teeth and i wondered why did he think that by detaining me he could somehow dragoon me into john browns harebrained war possibly for when youre as besotted a fanatic as crixus you can believe anything but more probably he was playing for time one thing he was sure of if he let me go hed have to find his hero another lieutenant so hed hold me by force if necessary and hope for the best for a moment i toyed with the idea of telling him who i truly was and threatening diplomatic reprisals but it wouldnt have served for a moment sir harry flashman would mean nothing to him and god knew how hed react when he learned that i wasnt comber after all and since i couldnt hope to tackle joe and moody together i must pretend to submit gracefully and take the first opportunity to slide if they thought they could hold flashy for long they were in for a surprise i sighed spreading my hands and gave him my rueful affectionate smile oh mr crixus youre too much for me i believe you could wheedle a duck from a pond well i guess the minister wouldnt thank me for waking him at this hour anyway and truth to tell im too tired to think but youll see him yourself sir first thing yes yes cries the old liar eagerly and after that it was good fellowship all round and he must embrace me again with more of his babble about god having sent me and from that he passed to praying while we stood with bowed heads and then joe sang hark the song of jubilee in a rolling bass that billowed the curtains after which moody conducted me aloft to bed not before time i kept my eyes open noting that the stairs were uncarpeted and the upper floors so far as i could make out by candlelight were bare as a crypt evidently this was a station the underground railroad used only on occasion my room under the eaves held only a bed a chair and a washing bowl and jug there were bars on the window and the door bolted on both sides at my request moody brought me a clean shirt and shaving tackle waiting while i scraped my chin and then carefully pocketing the razor he hesitated before handing me the shirt clearing his throat uneasily this here shirt youre a pretty big feller an well the only one to fit you is this un of joes dye mind i asked him what he meant why should i mind and he avoided my eye well joe i mean he aint white ill be damned thinks i and on the underground railroad too he neednt worry says i you can tell him im not lousy what he stared bewildered no no you dont get it joe didnt say what i mean he stammered is him bein well some folks wouldnt i mean i just thought id mention it but if you dont mind i gave him my most innocent smile while he fumbled the shirt and then handed it to me looking confused he said if i needed anything i should stamp on the floor and holler bade me a rather puzzled goodnight and left shooting the outer bolt i do love to twist tails especially liberal ones i wondered if his delicacy extended to black women i was so tuckered that i supposed id fall fast asleep as soon as i lay down but my mind was in such a whirl that i lay waking trying to make sense of it all it seemed an age since id woken beside that awful whore in baltimore and so much had happened that it was difficult to order my thoughts one thing though was paramount thanks to springs informations combers presence was known it didnt surprise me on reflection that the railroad had sniffed me out for they were sharp men but i wondered what other eyes might be on the lookout for me i couldnt begin to imagine that and once id escaped from my present hosts and reached the ministry it wouldnt matter anyway from that my thoughts turned to what crixus had told me not only about the lunatic brown but about the state of play in the states generally which had been absolute news to me to hear him the place seemed to be on the brink of civil war and that was hard to take i can tell you such wars and revolutions were for foreigners heaven knew wed seen that in but not for us or our american cousins i didnt understand then that america was two countries but then most americans didnt either as you know it was slavery that drew the line and led to the war but not quite in the way that you might think it wasnt only a fine moral crusade although fanatics like crixus and john brown viewed it as such and no more the fact is that america rubbed along with slavery comfortably enough while the country was still young and growing it was only when the free north and the slave south discovered that they had quite different views about what kind of country the usa ought to be on that distant day when all the blank spaces on the map had been filled in that the trouble started each saw the future in its own image the north wanted a free society of farms and factories devoted to money and yankee knowhow and all the hot air in their ghastly constitution while the south dreamed foolishly of a massa paradise where they could make comfortable profits from inefficient cultivation drinking juleps and lashing sambo while the yankees did what they dam well pleased north of the line they couldnt both happen not with northern money and morality racing forward in tandem while the south stood still sniffing the magnolias slavery was plainly going to go sooner or later unless the south cut adrift and set up shop on their own there had been talk of this for years and some southerners had the amazing notion that left to themselves they could expand south and west embracing mexico and the dago countries in a vast slave empire where the white boss would lord it forever but their wiser heads saw no need for this so long as the south controlled the congress which they did because their states were united while the northerners were forever bickering amongst themselves the situation was confused by a thousand and one political and social factors its worth noting though that there were folk in the south who wanted an end to slavery and many in the north who didnt mind its continuing so long as peace was kept and the union preserved congressman lincoln for example loathed slavery and believed it would wither away but said that in the meantime if the south wanted it let em have it if slavery was the price of american unity he was ready to pay it being a politician of course he had a fine forked tongue on the one hand he spouted a lot of fustian about all men being equal while on tother he was against blacks having the vote or holding office or marrying whites and said that if the two were to live together whites must have the upper hand but over all the antislavery feeling grew ever stronger in the north which naturally made the south dig its heels in harder than ever the fugitive slave law for recovering runaways was passed in to the rage of the abolitionists uncle toms cabin added fuel to the fire and crixus wasnt far out when he said that it only needed a spark to the powdertrain to set off the explosion i didnt pay him too much heed though what ive just been telling you was unknown to me then and i figured crixuss talk of gathering storms and trials by combat was just the kind of stuff that he being a crazed abolitionist wanted to believe well he was right and i in my excusable ignorance was wrong the storm was gathering in but what astonishes me today is that all the wiseacres who discuss its origins and inevitability never give a thought to where it really began back in with their idiotic declaration of independence if theyd had the wit to stay in the empire then instead of getting drunk on humbug about freedom and letting a pack of firebrands drag em into pointless rebellion there would never have been an american civil war and thats as sure as any if can be how so well britain abolished the slave trade in and slavery in and the south would have been bound to go along with that grumbling to be sure but helpless against the will of britain and her northern american colonies it would all have happened quietly no doubt with compensation and thered have been nothing for north and south to fight about qed but try telling that to a smart new yorker or an arkansas ehawbacon or a potbellied virginia senator point out that canada and australia managed their way to peaceful independence without any tomfool declarations or bunker hills or shilohs or gettysburgs and are every bit as much the land of the free as kentucky or oregon and all youll get is a great harangue about liberty and the pursuit of happiness damn your limey impudence from the first a derisive hawhaw and a stream of tobacco juice across your hoots from the second and a deal of pious fustian about a new nation forged in blood emerging into the sunlight under freedoms flag from the third you might as well be listening to an intoxicated frog its understandable to be sure they have to live with their ancestors folly and pretend that it was all for the best and that the monstrous collection of platitudes which they call a constitution which is worse than useless because it can be twisted to mean anything you please by crooked lawyers and grafting politicos is the ultimate human wisdom well it aint and it wasnt worth one life american or british in the war of independence let alone the vile slaughter of the anglosaxonnormanceltic race in the civil war but perhaps you had to stand on cemetery ridge after picketts charge to understand that i put these thoughts to lincoln you know after the war and he sat back cracking his knuckles and eyeing me slantendicular flashman the nonfounding father is a wondrous thought says he come now do i detect a mite of imperial resentment you know paternal jealousy because the mutinous son didnt turn out prodigal after all you cant get much more prodigal than gettysburg mr president says i and i aint jealous one little bit i just wish our ancestors had been wiser id be happy to see the queen reigning in washington with yourself as prime minister of the britishamerican empire toady if you like but true lord lincoln of kaintuck laughs he doesnt sound half bad dyou suppose theyd make me a duke no better not the boys would never let me in the store at new salem again he was the only american by the way who ever gave me a straight answer to a question ive asked occasionally out of pure mischief why was it right for the thirteen colonies to secede from the british empire but wrong for the southern states to secede from the union setting aside the constitution of which you think so poorly and which id abandon gladly in order to preserve the union if youll pardon the paradox im astonished that a man of your worldly experience can even ask such a question says he what has right got to do with it the revolution of succeeded the recent rebellion did not and there as the darkie said when hed et the melon is an end of it and a few hours after that he was dead the last but not the least casualty of that rotten war its fitting that my digression has brought me back to dear devious old abraham because he was in my thoughts as i lay waking in crixuss attic i was remembering how hed got me out of another tight spot when the slavehunters came to judge paynes house and if now my door had swung suddenly open to reveal his ugly lanky figure id not have minded a bit hed been a junior congressman when id last seen him but id heard nothing of him since the faint click of the bolt being slipped broke in on my thoughts and as i sat up the door opened noiselessly and someone slipped quickly in it wasnt congressman lincoln though it was joe the negro the whites of his eyes glinting in the candleshine as he set his back to the door and raised a finger to his lips to my astonishment he was in stockinged feet he listened for a moment and then sped silently to the window raising it slowly to make no sound before beckoning me to join him wondering and suddenly alive with hope i watched as he stooped to examine the bars he gave a little chuckle motioned me to stand clear and bracing his sole against one bar he laid hold on its neighbour and pulled he was a huge fellow as tall as i and a foot broader and i heard his muscles crack as he heaved to wake the dead twice and then again and the bar suddenly bent like a bow snapping free with a sharp report at its lower end we waited ears pricked but there wasnt a sound and joe swiftly unwound a slender rope from his waist and passed one end to me ketch holt an ili set tight while you slide down the roof whispers he when you hit the gutter it aint but a little tenfut drop to the groun go out the sidegate turn lef up the alley an yous on the street turn lef again an keep goin till you meets a carriage comin by theys allus one aroun this time o night his teeth glittered in a huge grin in the black face then tell em where you wants to go git slidin brother you dont wait to ask questions i shook his hand whipped the cord round my wrist and squeezed out on to the sill scuffing his fine borrowed shirt in the process and tearing my jacket the roof sloped sharply down for about fifteen feet from the window but with joe paying out the cord i slithered gently across the tiles and eased myself over the gutter it was black as sin beneath but i lowered my feet into the void tugged on the gutter to test its weight hung for an instant by both hands and let go landing on grass and measuring my length in what felt like a flowerbed in a second i was afoot listening but there was no sound save that of the window being closed overhead i waited until my eyes became accustomed to the gloom saw the gate and a moment later was striding up the alley and then left on the street to which the growler had brought me hours earlier what it meant i couldnt fathom at all why the devil should joe turn me loose was it some wild ploy of crixuss no that made no sense but then nothing did any longer what mattered was that i was free and once id found a hack to convey me to the ministry or willards hotel i was home and dry i had no notion what time it was somewhere in the small hours probably but i hadnt even had time to start doubting joes assurance that cabs were to be found in washington suburbs at this oclock when i heard the squeak of wheels ahead and round the corner comes a onehorse buggy its lamps shining dimly through the gloom i took a quick glance back at crixuss house no more than forty yards away but it looked dead to the world so i called softly and waved as i hurried towards the carriage the driver reined in as i came up and i was preparing to give him direction when i saw that he already had a fare a vague figure barely visible in the faint glow of the sidelamps i was about to wave him on when it struck me that the whole neighbourhood was about as lively as herne bay in november with not a light in a house or a soul on the street and no prospect of another conveyance there was a warm drizzle improving the mud no end so i approached the window in my best hyde park style your pardon but im looking for a cab and there seems to be none about would it inconvenience you if i shared yours until we meet one why honey says a soft feminine voice from the interior twill be mah pleasure to take yuh wheahevah yuh wanna go and a slender hand gloved in lace was extended through the window whynt yuhall jump right in now its real cosy in heah a cruiser bigod of all the luck though what custom she expected in this deserted backwater i couldnt imagine i was inside in a bound expressing my thanks to the neatest little cracker you ever saw who rustled her skirts aside with a flurry of petticoats and slim fishnetted ankles to make room for me and made no effort to disengage her hand from mine it was too dim to see much but i could make out blonde curls and a small rather childlike face behind the veil of her saucy bonnet she was decidedly on the petite side in a fashionably lowcut gown that felt like silk and her scent was subtle enough to be expensive but then she was one who could afford to ply her trade on wheels an what is yore destination suh cries she pertly showing neat little teeth and bright eyes behind the veil or would yuhall prefeh to leave that to me she transferred her hand to my thigh ah know the most elegant lil place d been about to say the british ministry but paused shed probably never heard of it anyway besides i was in no mood to decline her invitation id been two months at sea remember and celibacys a double trial when your last rattle has been someone as delectable as miranda her perfume was reviving all sorts of jolly memories the touch of her fingers was distracting and the ministry would be fast asleep i hadnt a dollar to my name but wed fret about that later im in your hands my dear says i take me where you will ah won jes take yuh honey purrs she ahll transpot yuh home andy the cab lurched off and i lurched on so to speak encircling her tiny waist with an arm and undoing her veil from the velvet neckribbon which secured it it wouldnt come loose and in my impatience i kissed her through it which was a novel sensation while she squeaked and giggled and said i was so vigrous she feared i would do her an injury jes you rest quiet a lil bit she protested an quit chewin up mah veil you naughty boy theah now its out the way yuh kin chew me instaid yuh greedy ole thing my ah nevah did know sech whiskers you must be about the whiskeredest man in town ah reckon gently now honey gently ahs fragile i had lifted her bodily on to my knee for she was the daintiest little bundle imaginable and if the cab had been roomier id have done the deed then and there for she kissed most artistically and what with abstinence and encountering a little goer so unexpected i was randier than the town bull when i became more familiar she wriggled and squealed so i pinned her tiny wrists in one hand scooped out her boobies and began nibbling at which she became unmanageable swearing that shed scream an scream it was so awful ticklish an ifn id jes wait now shed show me the highest ole time when we got to her place we were on busier streets by now with some traffic and passersby so i desisted and she popped her bouncers away and patted my hand ah don believe yore fm washinton at all says she yuh sure don taste like washinton all of seegars yuh know an ah think ah detect an english accent aint that so smart too i said i was canadian and she said uhhuh which is the most expressive word in the american language surveying me through her veil as she adjusted it she asked where i was staying and i said willards naming the only hotel id heard of she said well ians sakes and i guessed she was weighing my dishevelled appearance creased pants torn jacket no hat or tie or choker even and a finger of doubt began to stir in my mind this was a twentydollar whore if ever there was one yet shed picked me up in my shabby condition played up like a good un when id assailed her and never a word about cash or her present to a client who looked as though hed just crawled out of a hawsehole dooced rum unless her maiden heart had been smitten by my manly address and flashy charms but even i aint that vain something was amiss and my cowards instinct was just considering whether to leap out and run for it when the cab stopped and she was smiling invitingly through the veil heah we are honey home sweet home to my astonishment we had drawn up on a street broad enough to be the avenue outside a palatial building which was plainly a hotel for a moment i wondered if it might be willards and she expected to be entertained in my room there was a fine marble frontage carriages were coming and going with black portersholding doors gasflares sparkled on the jewellery and glossy evening tiles of the fashionably dressed folk crowding the steps even at this ungodly hour some grand function must be dispersing well cmon honey han me down why dont yuh cries my companion so there was nothing for it but to jump out into the usual two feet of mud and the appalling stink of sewer gas she hesitated on the step drawing up her skirt with plaintive squeaks so i swung her up in my arms and ploughed to the sidewalk grateful to have my scarecrow duds shielded from the gaze of the throng don set me down she whispered and giggled ah guess we caint go in the front do thisaway kin we theah down the alleyway an well go in the sidedo say aint this some fun though some fun what the deuce was i harry flashman vc and soon to be knighted by her majesty en route from india to england doing toting a tittering whore down a reeking lane in americas capital city well the wind bloweth where it listeth you see and if it carries you up several flights of back stairs along corridors where the air has been replaced by cigar smoke and the carpet fairly squelches with tobacco juice and at last into a dimly lit salon whose ornate giltandplush decor would do credit to a damascus brothel why you must make the best of it and get her stripped and on to the bed before your luck changes which mine was about to do with the most incredible coincidence that i can remember in a long career which has had more than its ration of freaks of chance it had been staring me in the face but lust is blind alas and i hadnt seen it i was undressing her with one practised hand and myself with the other even as i kicked the door to and such is my skill in these matters that i had my pants round my ankles and her bare to her stockings by the time we reached the bed where she tried to break free breathless and giggling lemme take off mah hat for mercys sake cries she no honey jes you hold on ah gotta see mah maid calm yoself do ah won be but a second she slipped from my ardent grasp and scampered to an inner door popping her head through and calling ahm back dora and then something in a lowered voice that i didnt catch a maid forsooth and not just a bedroom but a suit of apartments my blonde charmer was evidently at the top of her tree i could believe it too gloating at the white perfection of that little body as she closed the door turning towards me and making a fine coquettish show of slipping off her garters and rolling down her stockings she sauntered forward stretching up to the chandelier chain to turn the gas up to its full brightness and began to untie the bow securing her veil all coy and playful well now big boy drawls she lets have a real good look at yuh my ah do declare ah never and then she stopped with something between a gasp and a cry her knuckles flying to her veiled lips starting back as i went for her with a lustful tallyho no no she faltered and for an instant i checked in astonishment the sight of flashy stark and slavering might well strike maidenly terror in amateurs and virgins but this was a seasoned strumpet and then i twigged this must be her special ploy to rouse the rouйs playing the helpless fawn shrinking before the roaring ravisher wasted on me absolutely cowering or brazen its all one to your correspondent as she turned to flee whimpering i seized her amidships tossed her into the air planted her on hands and knees and was installed before she could budge roaring feigned endearments to soothe her pretended alarm and bulling away like fury with two lost months to make up for id no time to waste on further refinements nor i fear did i treat her with that solicitude which a considerate rider should show to his mount especially when shes barely five feet tall and half his weight having slaked what the lady novelists would call my base passion i staggered up and collapsed on the bed most capitally exhausted leaving her prone and gasping on the carpet with her little bottom aquiver very fetching and her hat and veil still in place what with weariness and contentment i must have dozed off for i didnt hear her leave the room it may have been five minutes or twenty before i became drowsily aware of voices not far away i stirred and sat up but there was no sign of her gone to make do and mend thinks i and since h didnt have a red cent to requite her it struck me as a capital time to resume my scattered togs and make tracks for the ministry in a trice i had my shirt and pants on and was slipping on a boot well pleased at having had a most refreshing gallop for nothing when a mans voice spoke loud and close at hand starting round i saw that the door to the adjoining room was slightly ajar and other voices were being raised in exclamation the blonde whores among them for perhaps five seconds i sat stricken with wonder and then the mans voice was raised again sharp with impatience and my blood turned to ice what dye mean he aint comber course hes comber dammit joe heard that skunk crixus call him so didnt ye joe my hair stood upright at the deep bass reply for it was the voice of the nigger whod broken me out of crixuss house sure he did massa charles overn over aint no doubt about it dont dare tell me you black fool that was the whore shrill with fury but where was the dixie drawl gone and in its place the voice of a creole lady sharp and imperious hes the wrong man i say i know him his names tom arnold he ran off a slave wench from my husbands plantation ten years ago and killed two men hes wanted for murder and false bills and slavestealing i tell you damn you colonel do you think i dont know a man whos been my lover i was over the bed like a startled hare boots in hand and was racing for the outer door when a huge black shape came storming in from the adjoining room and old brooke would have picked him first of the schoolhouse chargers for he came at me in a flying lunge that would have had every cap in the air on big side his shoulder took me flush on the thigh and it was like being hit by the penzance express i went headlong smashing into the furniture and fetching up against the wall with a jar that shook every bone in my body joe was up like a cat fists clenched as he stood over me shouting its him sho nuff you bet its him comber aint no doubt miz annette and there she stood in the connecting doorway the tiny body wrapped in a silk robe and as i saw her face in full light for the first time i could only lie and stare in utter disbelief the slim childlike shape had filled out in ten years shed put on an inch or two in height the sharp elfin features were fuller and her hair that had been fair was dyed bright gold but there was no mistaking the icy little vixen with whom id rogered away the clammy afternoons at greystones in her abominable husbands absence annette mandeville fragile blossom of the old south halfwoman halfalligator who wore spurred riding boots to bed and whose diminutive charms i must have explored a dozen times and now id just spent an hour in her company conversing kissing caressing carrying her bodily up five flights of stairs rattling her six ways from sunday and never for a moment suspecting who she was impossible says you even the coarsest voluptuary couldnt have failed to recognise her surely well consider this in your lifetime you probably wear as many as three hundred pairs of boots and shoes perhaps more i ask you if when you were forty your orderly laid out a pair of pumps which youd worn for a week when you were thirty would you remember em no you admit likely not unless there was something singular about them you see my point by id known in the scriptural sense women so was it wonderful that i shouldnt recognise annette mandeville after ten years i think not oh you may point out that of all my prancingpartners she was by far the smallest and that when i saw her in the buff even with her face veiled i should have recollected the tiny nymph of mississippi but against that i argue that the vulgar crackervoiced hoyden of washington was as unlike the highbred frigid midget of greystones as could be they were two different women so i cant blame myself for being taken in its not the only case of female double jeopardy that ive experienced by the way elsewhere in my memoirs youll find mention of a frenchmulatto trollop with whom i dallied in my salad days and who came to my carnal attention again twentyseven years later and im damned if i recognised her either thats all by the way what mattered as i wallowed amidst the shattered furniture was not that id failed to identify la mandevilles dainty buttocks in ecstatio but that she was here at all and in company with yet another branch of the b m comber admiration society to judge by the snatch of talk id heard from the adjoining room a moment since to add to my confusion black joe whod been a friend an hour ago had just tried to hurl me through the wall and was now standing over me sporting his fives in a threatening manner i didnt know what to make of him or her or any damned thing and now men were surging into the room and mandeville was pointing and shrilling comber or not that man is tom arnold he was our slavedriver let him deny it if he can black joe took his eyes off me for an instant possibly to contradict her and i seized the opportunity to lash him across the knee with a broken chairleg he staggered cursing and i was up and past him tripping in my blind flight but recovering and snatching for the handle of the outer door i wrenched it open and found myself face to face with a goggling darkie in a white jacket bearing a tray and beaming inquiry podden me suh but wuz you de gennelman whut sent for bourbn an seltzer it checked me for a split second which was long enough for joe to seize my collar from behind pluck me backwards growl wrong room boy and slam the door shut i lost my balance and sprawled in the wreckage once more and before i could stir they were on me two burly ruffians with bullet heads and no necks one at either arm i heaved one aside and was wrestling with the other when i realised that three other men had emerged from the adjoining room and were advancing past annette and at the sight of them i vasted heaving and subsided paralysed with horror to judge by their dress they were thoroughly worthy citizens bearing every mark of wealth and respectability one wore us army uniform with the epaulettes and double buttons of an infantry colonel another might have been a prosperous professional man with his immaculate broadcloth coat and heavy watchchain across his bulky middle and the third was an absolute paris fashion plate in silk tailcoat embroidered weskit ruffles and a goldtopped cane on which he limped slightly as he advanced hed have been the altogether dandy if he hadnt had the misfortune to be as fat as butter they might have been three of mandevilles richer clients but for the mutual eccentricity in their appearance which froze me where i lay all three were wearing hoods over their heads ghastly white conical things like gigantic candlesnuffers with eyeholes and blank gaping mouths barring an illustrated edition of bunyans holy war with its fanged devils sporting their horns and tails in the infernal regions the great terror of my infancy was a lurid coloured print entitled all hope abandon purporting to show what happened when the spanish inquisition got hold of you which they undoubtedly would my nurse assured me if i didnt eat my crusts or farted in church it showed a dreadful gloomy vault in which a gibbering wretch guarded by hairy dagoes in morions was cowering before three inquisitors one of whom was pointing to a fiery archway through which could be seen hideous shadows of stunted figures operating pulleys and wheels and brandishing whips you couldnt really tell what they were doing even if you squinted sidelong but you could imagine it you see while your infant soul quaked at the visible terror of those three awful hooded inquisitors one of whom i was convinced was the pope nurses were sounder theologians then than they are now i daresay in any event pointed cowls with empty eyes haunted my young nightmares and the sight of them now real and palpable for the first time in my life damned near carried me off to make matters worse i saw that the two thugs who had laid hold of me and were now on their feet had masks on their ugly phizzes and joe had a cocked revolver in his hand cover him joe barks the hooded soldier an you suh lay right still theah ye heah an speak up snaps the broadcloth figure deep and harsh whats yo name suh out with it comber or arnold the broad southern accents were the last thing youd have expected to hear out of those grotesque hoods but my amazement redoubled when the fat dandy limped up and stooped his great bulk to inspect me through blank eyeholes ill lay seven to two he answers to both drawls he another southerner but where the others were broad dixie he was your refined magnolia elaborately soft and courteous good mornin suh pray pardon this intrusion an our outlandish attire no cause for alarm i assure you it didnt assure me for a moment with those three horrid masks looming over me but the politely mocking voice stirred me to fury in spite of my terror damn your impudence who who are you and what dyou mean by it you and your infernal nigger hes broke my bloody leg hold yo tongue snarled the colonels hood and he snatched joes pistol and levelled it stir a finger an ahll burn yo brains stow it clotho says the fat hood quietly and set the weapon aside with his cane pistols pon my soul were in a washinton hotel suh not a memphis boadin house sides firearms aint necessary he lowered his cane and a glittering blade shot out from its ferrule stopping an inch above my palpitating breast are they have no fear suh just a precaution gainst any sudden outcry on your part like hollerin for help or showin fight he gave a fleshy chuckle but you wouldnt be so foolish would you now before that wicked point and softspoken menace i shrank back gasping in gods name what dye want with me im a british officer under the protection of my ministry damn you now that you aint says he gently chiding oh right dearly youd like to be but folks keep gettin in the way dont they first the wothy crixus then ourselves the blade clicked out of sight and he leaned comfortably on his cane all patient amiability and ive never seen anything more sinister than that holloweyed white visor with the smooth voice issuing from its shapeless mouth now see heah if youre reasonable no least harm will come to you on my honour all we seek is to talk with you civil an quiet but we have to know who weall are talkin to you see joe heah on good authority says your name is comber miz mandeville on tother hand why waste time annette broke in shrill and impatient if you want the truth from this snake youll have to twist it out of him she was at his elbow eyeing me spitefully coupling apart wed detested each other heartily in the old days and my innards shrank as i remembered those spurred boots and the cruel pleasure shed taken in the whipping of her plantation wenches thats not what we want him for annette deah sighs the fat horror youre lettin outraged delicacy cloud your judgment he chuckled again caint think why ill wager you relished evey lovin moment of him jus now you always do he shifted his game leg wincing audibly and tapped his cane sharply on my chest now suh im gettin right weary standin heah when we could be settin at our ease so are you arnold or comber or both in my terror it didnt even cross my mind to tell him i was neither but flashy when youre surrounded by inquisition hoods with a swordstick at your throat you tell em what they want to hear believe me and whoever this ghastly genteel apparition was i know a killing gentleman when i meet one everything about this oily fat flawn his dandy elobber his polite irony the leer in his voice when he spoke to annette suggested a graduate of the starnbergignatieff school and probably all the more vicious for being a flabby cripple both blast you yes i called myself arnold on her husbands plantation whatever the hell it is to you whoever you are in louisiana you called yoself prescott cries the hood with the colonels uniform and damned if he didnt sound indignant fan me ye winds the fellers got mo namesn lucifer yore a damned rascal suh what else you bin callin yoself hey it dont signify clotho says the beau he turned to the other hood hes our man lachesis then lets get to business snaps the broadcloth one you see any profit in it grumbles the colonel how we goin to put trust in sech a scoundrel prescott arnold comber lordy whut next an ah tell ye atropos he don look to me like the kind you kin bend to our pupose hell bend never fear sneers annette i know him he would sell his own mother for railroad fare the dandy atropos heaved a gusty sigh and turned his hooded head to survey them i would remind youall miz mandeville an genlemen that we are lookin to mistuh comber as an ally not as an enemy i trust that is cleah there was an edge to the silky voice and they stood silent he gestured to the two masked ruffians who had been hovering hopefully above my prostrate form you two boys be off an repot to hermes mistuh comber will be discreet im sure wont you suh joe assist the genlemen to rise theah thats fine my pologies for the rough handlin mere necessity suh an much regretted bright eyes studied me through the holes of the hood yeah now then since we have established your identities and as we have a proposal to make to you i think that as a token of confidence an courtesy i should remove my disguise then we can convese at greater ease he raised a hand to the white monstrosity on his head and there were shocked exclamations from the two other hoods which he silenced with a flutter of pudgy fingers unlike you genlemen i have no public position to protect says he im sure mistuh comber will have no objection to your remainin covered he pulled off his hood and im bound to say hed looked better with it on for his face was as gross as his body and all the worse because under the jelly jowls swollen cheeks and bulbous nose were features that might once have been handsome he was about forty and his fine head of blond hair which hed taken care not to disturb in removing the hood was artfully dressed in the style they used to call windswept that and the elegance of his duds were in obscene contrast to the bloated face but it was the eyes that told me my first impression had been right in the bull they were bold blue smiling and amiable as fishhooks your servant mistuh comber says he and gave me his arm his hand was soft and manicured but when i perforce laid mine on his sleeve it was like touching a hawser in velvet he didnt use scent or pomade either now i blieve well be more comftable in the drawin room ill wake up presently pray god thinks i for im certainly dreaming this whatever it is i was past wondering who or what they were or what proposal they could have for me or the meaning of those nightmare hoods and mythical names one thing only i was sure of they werent lunatics or practical jokers but damned serious gentry who knew what they were about and wouldnt hesitate to silence me if i didnt behave id developed a wholesome terror of the obese shark conducting me to the adjoining room ushering me to an armchair bidding joe pour me a glass of the poison they misspell whiskey and begging me in that honeyed voice to be at my ease with joe looming behind me with his pistol in his waistband if you please i didnt undervalue the choleric colonel clotho or the grimvoiced lachesis either there was authority and purpose in the way they sat themselves down at either end of a table the hooded heads facing me from what the fat monster had said the hidden faces must be wellknown to americans at least annette lounged on a chaise longue at one side watching me sullenly and the elegant tub of lard rested his ponderous rump on the table before me his game leg thrust out stiffly lighted a long french cigarette and blew thoughtful smoke while i waited in scared bewilderment to learn what they wanted of me or of comber rather now then says beau blubber you wonderin who we are an what we want of you well you jus take breath while i tell you but first does the word kuklos have any meanin for you i racked my memory its greek means circle i think you think right suh an i daresay you are familiar with the classical names we three have adopted bein those of the parcae lachesis clotho an myself atropos tho i hope to convince you that those of the eumenides would have been more fittin his liver lips parted in a hideous grin at his learned joke he and spring would have made a pair they are our secret names as officers of the kuklos which is a clandestine society of our southen united states devoted to guardin an upholdin those liberties an institutions which our nothen fellowcountrymen are bent on destroyin i refer to slavery mistuh comber which they affect to abominate but which we of the south hold to be a natral condition which for better or worse is inevitable a strangled oath came from within clothos hood better or wuss my ass its awdained by the will o god goddammit why you sound like a dam doughface atropos yo pardon miz mandeville but ah caint abide that kind o feeble talk if i wasnt drunk or dreaming i must be drugged again i couldnt be sitting in an american hotel listening to a well set up military man in an inquisitors hood calling himself after one of the fates and apologising for coarse language to an aristocratturnedwhore who used to be my mistress i doubt if mistuh comber is impressed by the rhetoric of the campmeetin clotho says atropos to resume suh the kuklos is strong widespread an capable for evey friend the abolitionists underground railroad an socalled freedom societies have in high places we have two they have many adherents mong the lowly the nigras so have we joe theah was born a slave on my family estate he was my childish playfeller then my bodysevant an is my best friend in all the world is it so joe you bet mass charles it sounded like a volcano rumbling atropos joe atropos remember neer mind well suh the kuklos arranged for joe to run five yeahs ago he became a passenger on the underground railroad an in time one of its most trusted conductors for two yeahs now he has been at crixuss right hand his loyal aide who observes listens an repots to the kuklos he gave a plump satisfied simper now you know suh how you come to be heah we learned of your arrival at baltimo as soon as crixus did like him we have agents within the police an govment who noted the anonymous infomation which reached the authoities two days ago that one beauchamp comber an officer of the british admiralty had reappeared in this country it was a name already known to us continues the fat smug from the access we enjoy to the recods of crixus an the us navy as that of the englishman who under the alias of james k prescott ran the nigra george randolph north in it was howevah nooz to us that this same prescott had been party to a murder in nawlins in the followin yeah thats a damned lie i didnt kill omohundro he raised a plump hand party i said mistuh comber howsomevah the nooz of your arrival an of your activities as an antyeslavery agent yeahs ago were of no more than passin interest to us until we learned yesteday thanks to joe theah that crixus was all on fire to secure your person an enlist your services on behalf of john brown of ossawatomie then mistuh comber he pointed with his cane in emphasis then suh our interest in you became profound an urgent he paused and i could hear my heart thumping id listened in mingled confusion and alarm understanding his words without finding the least explanation in them but now i could sense hellish bad news coming the blank eyes in the hoods of clotho and lachesis stared at me unnervingly and i stole a glance at annette mandeville coiled in the corner of her seat like a little white serpent watching me through narrowed lids with that wellremembered sulky curl on her thin lips at any other time id have guessed she was fancying me above half but it seemed unlikely just now so we made haste to secure you ouselves atropos went on joe released you an chere annette met beguiled an conveyed you all mighty smooth youll allow we three should ha been heah when you arrived but we were delayed which i believe his great belly heaved with amusement gave her the oppotunity to indulge her taste for mixin business with pleasure damn you charles she came upright flushed with anger you bridle your filthy fat tongue but whatevah for dahlin weall know your lovin weakness an mistuh comber was an old friend which came as a right surprise to both of you i collect he took another cigarette smirking still that acquaintance may prove useful to our pupose eh annie deah she answered nothing but a glare and lachesis drummed his fingers on the table git to the pupose then time presses atropos struck a fuzee and applied it to his cigarette without haste watching me carefully as he shook it out crixus told you that john brown plans to invade vginia an raise a rebellion of the nigras theah an he wants you mistuh comber to take the place of colonel hugh forbes he pronounced it fawbus who was lately browns lootenant now suh he drew deeply on his cigarette wed kindly like to heah what youall think of that interestin proposal at first the question made no more sense than all the bewildering drivel and wild events of the past twentyfour hours was it only a day and a night since id come to in that stinking dosshouse and here i was with a pistol at my back in the grip of dixie fanatics and still no wiser but at least i could answer though what the deuce it could mean to this foppish monster was far beyond me id not touch it with a tenfoot pole i told him and clotho gave a muffled grunt while atropos let smoke trickle slowly out of his nostrils and nodded over my head to joe good boy joe you read him aright even if crixus didnt so mistuh comber care to tell us why you wouldnt touch it being in a fair bottledup taking i exploded and like an ass let my tongue run away with me great god man dye think im as crazy as crixus what the dooce have i to do with his harebrained schemes look here for heavens sake i dont know what you want with me and let me tell you i dont care i aint american i dont give a rap for your politics or your slavery or crixus and his damned railroad or you and your infernal kuklos and i wouldnt go near this madman brown for a bloody pension lachesiss hand slapped the table like a pistol shot cutting me short whats that ye say heahs strange talk from a liberationist on my word he was sitting forward and i could see his eyes shining within the hood you dont care about slavery ah find that passin strange from a man engaged by the queens navy gainst the afriky traders who spied on them in the middle passage an worked for the underground railroad runnin jawge randolph to canada an dodged the patterrollers to take a slave wench cross the ohio clotho was on his feet an got shot doin it an killed a couple men along the way cording to what miz mandeville say you claim now yore not an abolitionist lachesis rose in turn accusing me like the lawyer he probably was thats not what the us navy recods say weve seen em an its all theah under the name comber d forgotten in my fright and confusion that i was meant to be comber bigod was this the time to announce myself as flashy no i darent for theyd never credit it and if they did god alone knew what theyd do id been a political long enough to know that these secret bastards cant abide loose ends or innocent parties who stray into their beastly plots it rattles em and youre liable to find yourself head foremost in a storm drain with a knife in your ribs atropos wasnt the sort to think twice about slitting a throat i was sure the others were probably no better and mandeville was a callous little bitch no for my skins sake i must cleave to what they believed to be true i struggled for words and noisy voices were passing the door fading down the corridor jesus four floors below careless diners would be wolfing steak and fried oysters in the breakfastroom and those hideous white deathsheads were before me joes pistol was behind and atropos was restraining my questioners with a languid gesture of his cane easy theah genlemen no call for heat he sounded almost amused and the gargoyle face was smiling inquiry at me well suh i tried to brush it aside why thats all past and done with im not with the admiralty havent been for years retired ages ago on halfpay lachesis pounced thats not what ye told crixus you said you wuz on a mission fo the british cries clotho ah wuz theah member joes voice spoke behind me like the knell of doom and i could only bluster what i told crixus is my business damnation whats it to you who the hell dyou think you are to bullyrag me rot you ive no doubt theyd have told me but atropos intervened again more firmly this time genlemen youre wastin breath all this makes no nevahminds whether mistuh comber is workin for the british or not dont signify a bit you see suh we need you an we got you all that matters is that crixus wants you to go along with john brown he dropped ash from his cigarette the ugly face regarding me blandly an so do we god knows what i looked like as i digested those unbelievable words for a second i didnt take them in and when i did i was too dumfounded to speak or laugh hysterically or make a bolt for it but i started to come to my feet and atropos raised his cane and gently pushed me back into my seat if you had said aye to crixus we could ha left you with him to get on with it but joe figured you wanted no part of his plan that you were tellin him maybe but thinkin no so we had to lay hold on you to persuade you i heard myself croak you must be as daft as crixus why the hell should i do what you want because says he patiently it aint far to kentucky what the devil dye mean theres a warrant maybe a rope waitin there for beauchamp comber on a charge of stealing a nigra wench contrary to the fugitive slave act if that aint enough we could send you down the river to answer for the killin in nawlins that you didnt do he glanced at annette you say he killed two men in ole miss i remember their names hiscoe and little there was a reward poster billing tom arnold as the murderer she was absolutely smiling enjoying herself the malicious slut better still theres a plantation in alabama where he can be lost for the rest of his life i never murdered anyone i swear it was the wench cassy id no part you nevah killed no one did ye came the growl from clothos hood haw you sho have the damnedest luck atropos gestured him to silence so you see there appear to be compellin reasons why you should do as we ask mistuh comber if you came to trial i doubt if lord lyons would stir himself to save you govments dont relish that kind of embassment youre a long way from home suh says the flabby sonofabitch with a mockrueful grin on his repulsive face i reckon you got no choice he was dead right and the tirade of protest and appeal and raving refusal died on my lips i could submit or be shipped south to the gallows or worse still the lonely alabama plantation where mandevilles swine of a husband had planned to have me worked to death in the cottonfields i didnt doubt their ability to do it or to snuff me out here and now and save themselves the trouble i could feel myself going crimson with terror which i do god knows why and makes folk think im about to go berserk clotho saw it for he called to joe to look out and the pistol was jammed into my back and all the while i could hear the morning traffic rumbling in the street far below the curtained windows and the distant knocks of porters rousing guests and that merciless fleshy face and the vile white hoods were waiting so i must pretend to agree play for time say any damned thing at all but youre southerners for heavens sake and you want me to help this halfwit brown start a slave rebellion it was the right note for to them it suggested i was weakening clotho grunted joe took his piece from my back and atropos eased his bulk on the table edge and leaned forward theahs an lection next yeah says he but since you dont value our politics it wont mean molasses to you if i tell you seward an his republicans are like to win it hey whut bout breckenridge protests clotho breckenridge couldnt win with jefferson on the ticket retorts atropos but it dont matter whos presdent seward breckenridge douglas or jake the hired hand after the lection comes the crisis mistuh comber he nodded impressively this country will then disunite into north an south with or without war we of the south must break free or see our way of life destroyed foevah twill be a mighty step an when we take it we must be united as nevah before or we perish well nothin suh can do more to ensure southen unity than an act of war committed by northen abolitionists gainst a southern state an act of brigandage mutters clotho dam yankee villains atropos ignored him if john brown raids into virginny the southll come togetheh as one man cos theyll see it as sure proof that the nawthll stop at nothin to crush us an all we stand for an at the same time such a raidll split the nawth wide open with the doughfaces an moderates an savetheunionatallcosts ninnies feelin shocked an shamed an the wild spirits hurrahin good ole john brown an quotin scripture his affected calm had dropped from his fat carcase like a shed cloak and his genteel accent was fraying at the edges he was rasping nawth like a cottonbroker and dropping rs right and left the nawthll be tore all ways an well who knows maybe we of the south will be able to cast off without a fight an thats why john browns raid must go ahead you see mistuh comber i wasnt concerned about the sense of it then though i can see it now i had my skin to think of and there were questions comber was bound to ask but if he raises a slave rebellion and all the niggers go on the rampage he couldnt raise dust in a mill it came unexpected from lachesiss hood hell stick on the first step which is the takin of a federal arsenal probly harpers ferry jus over the virginny line hes been braggin it for yeahs tellin that loudmouth forbes who tol half washinton why evyone knows hes set on the ferry so he kin arm the nigras clothos hood shook with his guffaw he spects they all come arunnin to fawm up in battalions behin napoleon brown an go acrusadin through dixie settin all tother nigras free well suh that they aint virginny nigras too dam well off an knows it no denmark veseys or nat turners in that section pleny of uncle toms though he ended on a snarl they oughta burned that bitch stowe at the stake i turned in disbelief to atropos but if the government know where hes going to raid dammit theyll guard the place wont they and collar brown before he can go near it he shook his head govment dont take brown that serious not officially anyways an they wont start a ruckus in the north by arrestin him that was what crixus had said and the lunatic thought crossed my mind were there southerners in the government who like these kuklos fanatics would be happy to see brown stirring up merry hell well it mattered not one dam to me and i realised that atropos was watching me closely as he lighted another of his regie gaspers theah you have it says he browns raidll fail but not before its served our turn dividin the north unitin the south but god help us why should he need me come now crixus told you that brown needs a trained officer if hes to take that arsenal why the mans but a peasant halfcrazy halfiggerant leadin a crew of jayhawkers an farmers scrimmagin in backyards an robbin widder women forbes was his brain to plan an advise an whip browns gang into shape but forbes is gone an browns at a loss for a captain so he appeals to crixus an lo crixus has the very man a foreign free lance well skilled in this kind o work the bloated features creased in a triumphant smile an im bliged to agree with him the man who ran george randolph can surely run old ossawatomie its being six foot two and desperatelooking that does it you know if id been shortarsed with no chin and knockknees no one in search of a hero would have looked at me twice i cudgelled my wits for some other objection and hit on one that seemed unanswerable but it wont do dont you see youve stolen me from crixus so how the hell can he send me to brown now am i to roll up on his doorstep and say im ever so sorry for escaping but ive changed my mind dont ye know and to hell with my duty and the british ministry ah the whole things folly youre off the rails all of you atropos shook his head being patient the kuklos dont leap before its looked real close mistuh comber see now heahs how it is crixus knew of your escape ten minutes after you made it sure joe discovered it an crixus has a passel o men scourin town for you right now mosly aroun the british ministry he gave another of his greasy chuckles joe hisself is one o those searchers an presenly hell sen word to crixus that hes hot on your trail an then crixus wont heah no more for a day or two until he gets a telegraph from joe in noo yawk sayin as hes run you down an reasoned you into enlistin with john brown christ in the rear rank you expect crixus to swallow that see here i know hes barmy but hell believe it says atropos cos hell want to believe it its what hes been strivin after an prayin for god sent you member an he trusts joe like his own son when he gets that telegraph hell be too ovejoyed to ask questions an hell telegraph joe to take you to brown without delay thats why noo yawk is right convenient puts in lachesis browns upstate now an due in boston soon where you an joe kin join him and then says atropos youll be on browns coattails all the way to harpers ferry i could say id never heard the like but i had all too often when youve been pressed into service as sergeantgeneral of the malagassy army or forced to convoy a bogtrotting idiot figged up as sinbad the sailor through an enemy army or dragooned into impersonating a poxedup danish prince why whats a slave rebellion more or less you develop a tolerance if thats the word and learn that whatever folly is proposed and this beat anything id struck you must just seem to agree and bend your mind to the only thing that matters survival so they would send me north under guard and i must submit to that but if i couldnt slip my cable between washington and new york then my nimble foot had lost its cunning even if they kept a gun in my back until i was under browns wing well he could try to hold on to me and good luck to him atroposs smooth voice broke in on my thoughts now it is surely occurrin to you suh to pretend to give consent an make off when oppotunity serves dismiss that thought mistuh comber you will go north in company with miz mandeville an joe an other sevants of the kuklos whom you wont see but wholl be theah evey step o the way an when you list with brown why joell be listed too an again he wont be the only one around the kuklos will be your guardian angel evey minute an if you was to step aside or make any commotion why he gave me his fattest smuggest smile youd be dead or boun for kentucky in a packin case theres a moment in any trial between two persons whether its a game or an argument or a battle of wits or a duel to the death when party a thinks hes got party b cold and that believe it or not is the moment when a is most vulnerable if only b has the sense to see it atropos thought he had me to rights he was a damned shrewd secret political and his task had been to coerce me into joining john brown for the reasons hed given no easy task given the kind of fellow he knew comber to be but hed set about it like a true professional using approved methods viz scare unsettle and bewilder your man impress him with the power and genius of your bandobast and convince him that he has no choice but to obey very well hed done that handsomely but it was all based on the assumption that comber would have to be forced into compliance it hadnt occurred to him that comber might decide on reflection to be a willing party put that thought into atroposs selfsatisfied head and hed be took aback he might even be so dam subtle that hed believe it in any event hed be less cocksure than he was and it never hurts to do that to an opponent so i said nothing for several minutes but sat there mum and blank while they waited in silence then i raised my head and looked the fat brute straight in his ghastly face its a rum trick says i but i dont doubt youre serious well sir im a serious man too you know youve put your proposal on what you account fair terms now you can hear mine you could have heard a pin drop ten thousand dollars or two thousand sterling thats my price he didnt even blink the others let out gasps and excla mations annette gave a shrill didntitellyouso laugh but atropos just drew on his cigarette and asked why should we pay you when we can compel you because a man well paid is a dam sight more reliable dont trust him cries annette hes a liar ten thousan dollahs ye gods clothos hood was in danger of being blown off of all the confounded gall but lachesis said not a word only sat stockstill sharpeyed in his hood atropos considered me through his cigarette smoke i waited then rose from my chair and i thought americans were smart please yourselves but remember you were the one who spoke of a free lance thats what i am and you may believe it im a sight better than that ass forbes who sold out garibaldi id never heard of forbes before that night but i reckoned it was a neat touch and now ive heard you out im dog tired and theres a bed next door servant marm gentlemen i inclined my head and started for the bedroom speaking over my shoulder joe can guard my slumbers if youre nervous and you can decide among yourselves whether ten thousand dollars is too much to pay for uniting your precious dixie id not ha given you one red cent says annette mandeville youd be doing it for your miserable life and been thankful for that ah but we know your generous nature dont we and suppose id refused you refuse with your worthless skin at stake you forget i know the kind of cur you are i heard you that day at greystones when my husband and his white trash caught you and you whimpered and grovelled like a whipped nigra wench my how you must miss the gracious life of the old plantation whining for your life and id thought you were a man man enough for one eager little creole lady though wasnt i but then i was probably a welcome change after your nigger fieldhands gently annette dear that fork is for dessert not for stabbing anyway were not at greystones now and let me tell you if your fat friend hadnt agreed to pay me id be on my way to the british ministry this minute why id not even have to go that far theres a party of englishmen at the corner table yonder by the sound of them whos to stop me joining em eh or sending for a constable not your ridiculous kuklos ill be bound or would they come rushing in with their guy fawkes hoods you fool dont you know the kind of men youre dealing with the danger youre in if you were to move two steps from this table theyd be the last youd ever take oh fudge what in a hotel diningroom crowded with guests hardly the place for an assassination what would the maitre say listen to me there are two men in this room now arrmed and watching you try to escape or call for help and youll he shot down without mercy i mean it this is not england such things happen here ive known the kuklos kilj a man on the steps of the capitol before scores of people in broad day if you dont believe me run for the door but if you value your life youll keep faith with hem my dear annette can this be alarm on my behalf is that wifely concern i see in those bonny grey eyes im concerned that the kukloss work is done and that i play my part in it and you play yours then youd better stop whispering like some dago conspirator and finish your pudding like a good little wife mrs beauchamp comber and smile ever so sweetly at mr h well coffee waiter i was testing the wicket and finding it confoundedly sticky as id known it would be the moment id awoken from my exhausted sleep and remembered where i was and what had happened any hopes that id dreamed the whole ghastly thing were dashed by the sight of joe sitting by the bedroom door like a black nemesis sporting his pistol i was caught for the moment and could only hope that my little charade before retiring had taken some effect it was late afternoon when i came to and someone had been busy while i slept for beside the bed there was a new out lit of clothing and damned if it didnt fit perfectly even to the collar but what sent a chill down my spine was the name on the tailors tab b m comber it was even stamped in the lining of the hat id formed a respect for the kuklos from the ease with which theyd spirited me away from crixus but these little touches told me they were formidable indeed while i dressed joe brewed me some coffee on a spirit stove and directed me to the drawingroom there was no sign of lachesis and clotho but atropos was writing at the table and annette was on hand stonyeyed but mighty jimp in a gown that seemed to consist of flowers and gauze he complimented himself on my appearance and hoped i approved of the sober cravat hed chosen for me our colonial taste runs to more extravgant colours but since your accent marks you as english why you best look it says he chuckling fatly as though hed never put a point to my throat in his life the suits well enough i guess an will serve for day an evenin i fear we still lag behind london in our deploable failure to change after six oclock now suh sit down an tend to what i say first of all says he five thousand dollars would be placed to the credit of b m comber in a bank of the new york safety fund and might be drawn at either of two addresses in washington and new york but only after the day on which the country is ringin with the nooz that old ossawatomie has made an armed incursion into vginia the gross cheeks creased in a sardonic grin then all you have to do is present the draft which youll find in the breast pocket o that noo coat youre wearin now i see it on you i dont know as i can bring myself to like that collah he squinted critically while i examined the draft on the citizens bank of louisiana and my spirits soared it was all windowdressing to be sure and theyd never put a cent to combers account but at least they were pretending to treat my offer of mercenary service seriously maybe they even believed it not that theyd trust me an inch but they might be just a little less watchful i pocketed the draft and told him the coat collar suited me to admiration well if youre content now suh you an miz mandeville will travel to noo yawk by the night flyer as mistuh an miz beauchamp comber youre bound to keep that name cos its the one john brown will be expectin joe will accompany you as your slave an when he has tclegraphed crixus tomorrow that youve been found in noo yawk he will take you on to boston or concod where you will meet brown probly at the home of franklin b sanbon a promnent abolitionist there you an joe will list in browns service tis all planned out you see neat as a quakers bonnet says he with satisfaction by the by til you leave noo yawk you are in the care of miz mandeville miz comber i should say he shot her a greasy smirk an will obey any instructions she may give you what these may be i can only guess keep to the business you fat swine snaps she why surely dahlin an see that you mind yours an the kukloss jus remember you aint takin this trip for pleasure alone there was an edge to the soft voice and i thought hollo is someones piggy carcase aglow with jealous passion for our tiny poppet it conjured up a tableau too hideous to contemplate so theah it is mistuh comber all you need do is go long quietly do whatevah brown requiahs of you go with him right down the line to harpers ferry or wherevah it may he put your trust in the good lawd an go home to england with five thousan dollahs in your moneypuss an again an for the last time he gave me his blandest lat smile dont evah think you can jump off the wagon long the way the kuklos will be theah always an if you play false by wod or deed then suh you are crow pick he rose smoothing his coat and shooting his cuffs and stowed his writings in his pocket i blieve that is all so i confide you to deah annette an joe of course an your unseen guardians your sevant maam honoured to have made your acquaintance suh i bid you adieu an good lort une an you take care now ye heah dye know when i look back on those bizarre few hours when the kuklos took me by the neck and twisted me to their crazy ends the rummest thing of all wasnt the amazing coincidence of annette or those grotesque hoods or that obese monster so pathetically bang up to the nines or even their incredible plot but those last six words from atropos after all the threats and blackmail the gentle ritual of the dixie farewell god help me i believe he meant it when hed gone it occurred to me to twit annette that she had an admirer in our dandy hippo i asked innocently if he was her lover expecting a fine explosion and was taken flat aback by her reply he is my husband good god he cant be what that great bag of jelly what happened to mandeville he died and you married that well i never gad what a wedding night that must have been i let out a yelp of horror but my god he knew well he suspected im sure what wed been up to i mean before he arrived you know when we were he was already here in this room watching us says she cool as bedamned before the mirror tittivating her lowcut bodice you will see there is a spyhole in the door to the bedroom you dont mean it but but i had a terrifying memory of lying helpless beneath his swordstick and hed just watched me rattling his wife godalmighty but you mean he dont mind on the contrary she patted her hair he insists well strike me dead i say he must be a damned rum chap phew but you i mean why the devil do i do it you would ask she took a last sneer at the mirror and faced me he is the richest man in louisiana he is also the brain though not the head of the kuklos youve been singularly honoured by his personal attention a measure of your importance she gave me a withering look up and down you probably think him mad he is not whatever he plans succeeds and whatever he promises he performs remember that for your own sake now it is past five oclock and i wish to dine before we leave she drew herself up like a tiny guardsman give me your arm and take me down so i did ruminating on the manners and morals of the old south and now that wed broken the ice so splendidly we were soon chatting away in the diningroom like an old married couple as ive described at the beginning of this chapter i affected a carelessness i was far from feeling because i wanted to test just how real were the threats that atropos had made her alarm told me all i wanted to know and gave me some useful information apart from joe who was lurking in the lobby while we ate there were two kuklos shadows watching me and no doubt they or others would he on hand all the way to new york id have to look damned slippy when the time came to run it was a mad pickle you may think held prisoner amidst all the bustle and confusion of civilised society but if your captors know their business and are ruthless enough why you might as well be chained in a dungeon rudi von starnberg took me halfway across germany against my will simply by having a gun and a knife and being ready to use em if i so much as sneezed out of turn and id no doubt the kuklos would be equally unscrupulous so i could only wait and seem to play up both of which im good at and take comfort in the knowledge that theyd not harm me unless forced to since i was no use to them dead or bound for kentucky being resigned i felt easier and even a touch lightheaded as we cowards will when we feel safe for the moment the upshot was that with bottle and bellytimber before him flashy became if not beastly at least mischievously drunk enjoying himself in contemplating the charms of the choice little icicle across the table id already noted that shed put some elegant flesh on her elfin form over the years and was altogether a juicier morsel than shed been at greystones she might still wear the expression of an illtempered ferret but that kind of viciousness on a handsome face has its own attraction and i knew perfectly well that her artistic paintwork and stylishly coiled blonde hair had been designed for my benefit shed always loathed and lusted after me together which only added spice to her allurement and i looked forward as much as she did to the enjoyment of mr combers marital rights on this happy thought i was content to idle my way through the dinner which like all american meals was gargantuan and overrich how the devil they can put away a massive breakfast of steak ham eggs terrapin or giant oysters two dinners at noon and five and still be fit to beat their bellies at supper is beyond me even annette who wasnt two pisspots and a handle high worked her way through five courses without breaking sweat on her pale immaculate brow unlike most of her compatriots she didnt shout through her food so i had leisure to listen to the deafening chatter around us from the trumpetings of two portly curryfaced gentry at the next table i gathered that president buchanan was a weakkneed nincompoop for not going ahead and teachin them dam impident greasers a lesson by annexing half their country war with mexico would in the speakers opinion rally the public behind old buck ensure a democratic victory in next years election and be one in the eye for that slippery bastard seward an his dam black republicans ah heah sewards goin to england says his companion bes place fo the nigralovin sunnavabitch ah hope his vessel sinks ah mean it suh ah do kin you magine president seward thats whut itll come to yet you mark mah wods come now suh he may not git nomnated even you wanna wager suh why hes got weed an greeley in his pocket whuts that ye say tilda give you ladies the vote an twill be president douglasj hawhaw why he aint but a dam dwarf youd like to cuddle him ye say ye heah that ambrose tilda thinks douglas is right cuddlesome waal now honey ah reckon his beauteous adele might have suthin to say bout that ah jus reckon she might an so might yos truly you keep yo cuddles for papa ye heah and the lecherous old goat laid a fond paw on the arm of the languid tilda who might have been his wife but i think not from the wanton freedom with which she had been glancing in my direction ah declare tilda would put adele right in the shade cries the other rouй gallantly nevah seen her in sech looks how you do that tilda all the soirees an parties you oughta be clean wore out but darn if you dont come up freshern dew on a lily you got some magic potion sweetheart know whut shes got cries her escort she got this lectric rejuvenatin contraption an a coloured wench to mechanic it why they all the crack wi the smart gals aint they tilda puts the bloom right back in those damask cheeks in no time at all an all over too hawhaw yessir thats mah honeys secret why you make me soun like some kinda monster works on iectricty drawls the fair tilda lowering her lashes at me and showing her profile but mah machine is right stimulatin our train leaves in an hour says annette sharply you will wait in the lobby while joe fetches a carriage and keep your tongue and eyes to yourself do you hear her mouth was tight with anger and there was a little flush on her cheek do nothing to excite attention difficult when were such a handsome couple says i leering if we want to pass unnoticed why the dooce are we parading before half washington suppose one of crixuss people is about we know them all by sight and they will not be seeking you here or at the station joe has seen to it stop guzzling that wine you fool now follow me out closely what with the booze my natural taste for devilment and confidence that i was perfectly safe as long as i didnt try to run for it i felt a sudden urge to put turpentine on her dainty little tail and light it so when id drawn back her chair and she had made for the lobby without a glance at me i navigated carefully in her wake turned in the doorway surveyed the glittering splendour of the diningroom and its chattering gluttons drew a deep breath and let out a lakota warwhoop at the top of my voice a woman shrieked men sprang to their feet a passing waiter went up like a galvanised grouse and dropped his loaded tray with a tremendous smash and then there was dead silence as a hundred mouths gaped and two hundred eyes goggled every head turned in fact save for a tall chap near the door who kept his eyes fixed on his plate and another with his back turned who watched me like a hawk in a mirror on the far wall i strolled into the lobby where annette was standing rigid with fury people were craning towards the diningroom to see what the row was are you mad she hissed you were right says i the boys are in there but the kuklos ought to train em better you know taint natural not to stare when a lunatic cuts loose in public now then wheres that dilatory joe with the carriage eh her eyes were blazing but she swept off without a word leaving me to look about and wonder which of the throng in the lobby might be kuklos shadows for joe had disappeared and the two betrayed by my little ruse in the diningroom hadnt emerged but i wasnt fool enough to imagine that i wasnt being watched i gave up though for the patrons of washington hotels in those days were such a mixed lot my unseen watchers might have been anyone there were the obvious politicos standing about in knots puffing their cigars and disputing warmly wealthy citizens with stout matrons dressed up like may day cuddies young blades in fancy weskits and amazing whiskers with fashionable belles gushing and squealing on their arms plantation aristocrats in their broadbrimmed straws with little nigger boys toting their bags likelylooking fellows in city clothes but with the unmistakable silence of the frontier hanging round them like a shroud barefoot slaves waiting patiently beyond the great doors leading to the marble porch thin seedy fellows with ferret eyes questing for senator this or congressman that and muttering to each other before scurrying away like the political rodents they were one or two topdrawer strumpets immediately recognisable by being the most tastefully dressed women in view and everywhere the great curse of the new world the american child in all its raucous spoiled undisciplined selfish ghastliness the female specimens keeping up an incessant highpitched whine and the male infants racketing like cowpokes on payday theres nothing wrong with grown americans by and large you wont find heartier men or bonnier women anywhere but the only remedy i can see for their children is to run herod for president then joe was at my elbow with a slouch hat and a long coat guiding me out of the throng and down a passage to the same side door by which id entered the hotel where a growler was waiting with annette inside raging silently she said not a word as we bowled through the dusk to the station and when we drew up close by the train they had platforms in those days she whisked out and into the carriage while joe signed to me to sit tight he descended spying both ways before beckoning abruptly and i strode quickly through the wreathing steam with the bell clanging overhead and mounted into the sudden quiet of the train i wasnt well acquainted with american railroads at that time and was resigned to an uncomfortable long haul through the night to new york in one of those reeking long coaches in which id travelled down from baltimore full of noisy unwashed louts whose favourite occupation was spitting at the stove but no such thing here was a quiet corridor with private compartments which they called cabins fitted up in tiptop style annette was in number i remember i had a glimpse of an alcove bed with curtains drawn back a washstand and comfortable furniture and then joe was hustling me into number which seemed smaller but had a bed beneath the window i asked him where he was going to sleep and he replied curtly that he wasnt i made myself comfortable while he slipped out and presently i heard his deep rumble in annettes cabin and the conductor saying anything she wanted maam anything at all she should just send her boy and it would be attended to right smartly then joe returned sitting on the floor with his back against the door and a moment later the bell clanged and the steam whistled and the conductor bawled that this was the night flyer to baltimo wilminton philadelphia trenton an noo yawk and we jolted and clanked into motion and i reflected that my evasion would have to wait until journeys end i didnt fancy dropping from a moving train even if joe hadnt been on hand he was a big ugly gyascuta that one his sleeves tight on his enormous biceps as he sat with his arms folded on his barrel chest the yellowflecked eyes rolling at me whenever i stirred on the bed i found myself studying him he was your real jetblack nubian flatnosed thicklipped and could have walked into the kar nowadays no questions asked having nothing better to do for the moment i indulged my idle curiosity joe says i why are you with the kuklos he glowered suspiciously whut you mean well youre atroposs slave yet youve been with crixus on the railroad had the chance to escape to free soil why didnt you you want to be free surely he studied me in turn the black face expressionless then you got niggers in england that so yes a few and theyre all free so are the niggers in our empire in africa and the west indies no one owns em or can make em do what they dont like or sell em down the river wouldnt you like that he sat apparently thinking though you couldnt be sure with that face at last he said yo english niggers how many on em got a fine coat like this heah he ran a finger the size of a truncheon down his lapel how many on em got a silver timepiece an chain how many got five dollahs in they pocket why joe you could have all those things in canada say and be free into the bargain you could do whatever you liked go wherever you liked be your own master he digested this staring at the floor and shrugged his huge shoulders ah guess so says he slowly an ah cud be tret like black trash whenevah ah liked an git out the way nigger whenevah ah liked an go hungry whenevah ah liked an beg mah breadn go to jail whenevah ah liked he raised his bullet head and stared at me it was like looking into the eyes of an ape in a cage don have none o that wi mass charles ah his slave but he treat me like a man an folks specks me cuz ahs his nigger don git tret like no black trash nossuh git good vittles git good cloes like these yeah he closed his eyes and gave a great growling sigh an ah gits to hump his lil white lady whenevah mass charles say so oh but she is prime white meat none o yo free niggers gits that kin o pleasurin ah reckon i was shocked not that im a prude you understand but because i knew the physical loathing that annette had for black skin why at greystones any wench whod had the misfortune to touch her by accident hadnt been able to walk for a week the thought of her with this human gorilla well my little french aristo was paying a price for being the richest woman in louisiana wasnt she just you ask yo afriky niggers whether theyd ruther be free or joe growls he showing his gleaming teeth in a great wolfish grin see whut they tell yuh ah but they dont know any better joe you do theyre savages but youre well civilised i mean ive seen how you carry yourself with crixus and with atropos too youre not a common nigger why ill bet you can read cant you he stuck out a sullen lip some writin an figurin though they kinda tough its not often you find yourself conversing with a caveman and i was becoming interested but see here if you can read a little you can learn to write and ah figure fast enough why man you could make something of yourself and if you were free you could buy all the white tarts you wanted mandevilles nothing special i can tell you youre a fool joe but you neednt go on being one you know you can be something better than a slave ah caint be white growls he shaking his head and then he frowned and a wicked glitter came into his eyes say mistuh comber you tryin talk yoself out o this you tryin to fool this po coloured boy no such thing why if i wanted to be out of this as you call it dont think that you could stop me im here because im being paid ah there you have it im free you see but youre not because youre content to be bound to that great fat slug when you could be and then i caught the gleam in his eyes and i stared for a moment and then lay back on the bed looking at the ceiling anger giving way to amusement joe says i at length you are a smart black sonofabitch arent you though i began to laugh and so did he the great black face split in a melon grin his shoulders heaving oh you poor coloured boy so writing and figuring are tough are they some chuckles he caint hol de pencil in mah big black fingers nohow oh leave off begging your bread forsooth and mumbling like a fieldhand whats the capital of portugal oh lemme see ah gotta study dat taint madrid nossuh r gay paree um lisbon maybe say though which o yo lil ole english kings got hisself mudered in de tower o lunnon in foteeneightythree dont be daft oh very well which one edwad fift he was jes twelve yeahs old an his mammy wuz a lady called lizbeth woodville he sat there chortling the jolly darkie to the life damn him yes i should have remembered shouldnt i that anyone who can spy inside the underground railroad and fool crixus knows more than picking cotton went to school along with atropos master charles did you niggers don tend school no we had the same govness in the same nussery mass charless papa was an expermental genleman so he raised us the same he was smiling still but the black eyes were expressionless wanted to see how it came out ah guess but see here this is all the more reason why my questions good joe why being raised like that and educated and knowing what you do why in gods name dye stay a slave dont you want to be free for heavens sake just for a second he avoided my eye then his chin came up ma answers good too comber it came out in his harsh bass growl ah don need to be free ah serve mass charles as a friend his best friend like he told you he trusts me ah trust him the way he goes ah go he wants me to work for the kuklos ah work for the kuklos he wants me to keep a hold on b m comber an make sho lie earn that fi thousan dollahs the smile on the primitive face was a knowing glimmer now and not pleasant ah keep a hold oh maybe take a lil rise out o him fo fun an so we both know whuts whut but that don signify a bit you stay held comber all the way make no mistake bout that so there comber evidently my question anent slavery had annoyed him and he was reminding me whut was whut well joe all i can say is that master charles is fortunate in the loyalty of his friend thats right and tell me when he says hump my wife for my entertainment do you do it as a friend or as an obedient slave ill swear his eyes glowed and he wasnt a pretty sight then he smiled and was even less pretty it aint no hadship speshly cos she dont like it she don like it at all she jus caint bide niggers it seems ah well theres no pleasing some people is there happy little menage you must all have together fortunately however she can abide white men and i rather think shes expecting me i swung my legs off the bed and he seemed to flow upright like a genie towering out of a bottle i feigned surprise dont worry joe i shant run away he stood glaring down at me undecided and i wondered if he was going to assert his guardianship but he had style did joe in his own way for after a long moment he stood aside giving me his nastiest grin and unlatched the door sho you go right ahead like an obedient free white man yo right welcome to the niggers leavins an ah know you wont run cos o that fi thousan dollahs an this he pulled back his coat to show the pistol butt you go along now an enjoy yoself ye heah why joe ah blieve ah sholy will says i tell ye sumpn else joe so will she i winked at him you think bout that and she did so far as i could judge which was never easy with la mandeville quite the most unsociable mistress i ever mounted most women ive known have exchanged seductive pleasantries beforehand squealed and gasped during performance and chatted comfortably afterwards not annette when i accosted her that night in her cabin it was greystones all over again cold clawing passion and then sullen silence until she fell asleep however when the train bell woke her she went to work like poppaea on honeymoon which i took as a compliment before resuming her impersonation of a trappist nun if there is such a thing it was at this stage that i succeeded in getting a snatch of conversation out of her and most interesting it proved to be in the interval between rounds so to speak while she lay cold and quiet beside me in the cramped berth id been reflecting on joes capricious behaviour for a while there wed got on rather well hed taken me in by playing the darkie simpleton teased me cheerily and then all unintended id touched him on the raw probably by my impatient concern for his enslaved condition so hed turned ornery on me been redoubled and set down and from that moment we were sworn enemies well the hell with him at all events in trying to coax some chat out of my tiny paramour after our final gallop in which shed drawn blood in two places i mentioned joes name partly out of curiosity but mostly out of malice i confess and she started like a galvanised frog what of him what did he say aha thinks i guilty conscience capital oh this and that hes an odd chap no fool for all he looks like a backward baboon knows more english history than i do anyway what history you say she was wide awake now what does that black beast know about it the name of edward the fifths mother for one thing quite extraordinary aye a most educated nigger smart as paint im surprised your husband trusts him she was silent a moment why should he not well joes a slave aint he and here he is heading for the free states so whats to hinder him lighting out for canada i would if i were he but when i put it to him he said your husband was his best friend and hed not dream of running from him you know loyalty that sort o thing loyalty what do animals know of loyalty oh i dunno dogs are loyal they say tho i never found em so my aunt paget had one of those damned poodles when i was a kid stank but she swore it was faithful took a great lump out of my arse when i tried to sick it on to some hens what else did the brute tell you oh nothing i yawned and when she had turned away and settled down i gave a drowsy chuckle nothing much leastways oh yes i gather joe likes white women unwilling ones for choice she lay dead still so still i could sense the sudden tension of her muscles good luck to you joe thinks i if ever atropos kicks the bucket unexpected and you become the widows property i waited for her fury to vent itself in shrieks of rage or fine french oaths but nothing came for at least a minute and then the most astonishing thing happened she turned slowly towards me in the berth and her hand stole across searching for mine and to my amazement she nuzzled her head on to my shoulder her tiny body was trembling and damned if i didnt feel wetness trickling on my skin she was absolutely weeping with a soft murmuring wail that i could hardly hear until it turned into a faint broken whisper ohhh hold me i couldnt credit it annette mandeville the spurred succubus hard as a diamond and vicious with it whimpering like a lost child i slipped an arm about her marvelling and she clung closer still pushing her blubbering face under my chin ohhh hold me close close oh please well naked tits never appeal to me in vain so i drew her over me with her small rump in my one hand for she was the veriest flyweight she lay there keening away bedewing my manly bosom with her tears baffling i found it but rather jolly i disengaged the clasp of her fingers so that i could work at her poonts with one hand and her stern with tother no no not that sobs she only comfort me oh please hold me close she was crying hard now with a great yearning misery please comfort me so i did stroking her hair and petting her in a bewildered fashion asking myself if id ever understand women she clung like a clam and after a while her weeping subsided into little sniffs and sighs and i guessed she was dropping off to sleep so then i cheered her up properly some cynic once observed that it was impossible to see the sights of new york city because there were no cabs to take you about but it didnt matter because there were no sights to see anyway i cant agree whether there were cabs or not in i didnt have time to find out but for sights well there may have been no st pauls or rialto or arc de triomphe or mouldering piles of stone or dreary galleries stuffed with the rubbish of centuries but there was something far more moving inspiring and aesthetically pleasing to the eye than any of these and you didnt need a cab to see em either as they sashayed along broadway past the old astor house by the park resplendent in their silks and satins and furs with those ridiculous fetching hats and parasols above and the extravagantly high heels below i refer to the women of new york who for beauty of face and form elegance of dress and general style and deportment are quite the finest ive struck until they open their mouths that is which they do most of the time but even that incessant nasal braying cant rob them of their exquisite charm i dont mean only the trollops either of whom there were said to be two thousand in a population of threequarters of a million in but the respectable women of every class i was enchanted at first sight and if i were condemned to spend my dotage sitting in stewarts store or the metropolitan lobby contemplating the passing peaches i wouldnt mind a bit provided i was furnished with earplugs against the cackling laughter and cries of you bet be blowed and okay bo but they probably have different cries nowadays and no powdered hands or grecian bends alas they absolutely ruled the place then new york was a womans town and let no one tell you different they were the queens of the world and didnt they know it not that they were pushing you understand they were just freer and bolder and more forward and independent than any women id seen elsewhere taking it for granted that men existed to serve and minister to them and not tother way about for example you could be on an omnibus going through the inconvenience of paying the driver through his little window and three or four dollymops would come on chattering and laughing behind you drop their money in your hand and expect you to pay it over and bring em their change perfect strangers too mind you the reward of a free and easy smile and thanks chief from a pert new yorker is a delight given time id have been haunting that omnibus yet everything was for their convenience too hotels had their ladies entrances and diningrooms so that the dears wouldnt be offended by the reek of cigars and the conversation of horrid men every other shop seemed to be dedicated to cosmetics female finery and jewellery from quality establishments like ball and blacks to the seedier stores on water and mercer streets they had their own cakeandcoffee houses where no male dare enter and there were even gambling hells for ladies only where they bucked the tiger and blued their menfolks dividends at faro and billiards and their husbands sweethearts and paramours seemed to be all for it and treated em with a regard and deference youd never find in europe why this should be i dont know new york men are certainly no more chivalrous than any other it may be that women were scarce in colonial times and so grew to be particularly treasured but my own theory is that the usa being all for progress and liberty and new york in the vanguard of everything its women have become emancipated sooner than their sisters elsewhere theyve usurped not a few masculine habits too anywhere in the world youll see rouйs with fast young women in tow but only in new york was it common to see fashionable ladies of mature years settling restaurant bills and buying gifts for handsome young clerks they picked em up over departmentstore counters i was told and the new york female grows up at a startling rate my first day there i was astonished to see a party of society schoolgirls the kind whose parents live on fifth avenue and have the brats educated at murray hill driving along in a basket wagon with a tiger on the step none of em was above twelve years old and all were got up like women of twenty even to the languid airs and gestures so that was my first impression of new york gained in a few brief hours splendid women on the go but nothing else out of the ordinary for the town itself was a sort of larger glasgow there were no skyscrapers then and chiefly remarkable for being paved apparently with peanut shells which were sold by swarms of urchins and crackled underfoot wherever you turned even in the lobby of the astor house to which we drove from the station it was the place in new york just then and large even by american standards a great barracks looking east across broadway to the park with a shaving mug and brush in each room talk about luxury if you like if my impressions are sketchy i can only plead preoccupation new york was where i was going to have to cut stick not only eluding the kuklos but hiding out from them preferably with a british consul whod see to my passage home once he found out who i was it was maddening to drive through crowded bustling streets to look about the busy lobby of a great hotel to sit in the suit of rooms which had been reserved for us and to know that l darent stir a foot for fear of the unseen eyes that were following me everywhere soon after we arrived when joe had gone below stairs to chivvy the porters about our bags and annette and i were alone i excused myself to visit the privy along the way she didnt even turn her head as i slipped out into the passage which seemed empty except for a couple of darkies clinging somnolently to their brooms and then at one end there was a nondescript white man who turned his back just a shade too hurriedly at the sight of me i strode smartly the other way and became aware of a chap lounging in an alcove ahead with a round hat tilted over his eyes of course he may have been an innocent citizen but i didnt know that i stepped into the thunderhouse palpitating it was empty so far as i could see but it was six floors above ground and by this time i was convinced that there was probably an armed dwarf crouching in the bloody cistern right thinks i well have to wait until dark if im not a better nightstalker than anything the kuklos can show its a poor lookout meanwhile well be a docile little prisoner and keep our eyes peeled i headed back for our rooms and bore up sharp at the door which was ajar for voices were being raised within annettes and joes following her astonishing behaviour the previous night when shed crept into my arms blubbing like a baby id looked to see a softening of her manner in the morning but no such thing the annette who woke as we pulled into new york was her old shrewish self when i referred to our tender interlude she simply turned her back and ordered me out in her iciest tone so that she could get dressed it was the same on the drive to the hotel with joe on the box and at breakfast in the coffeeroom she either ignored my remarks or replied in cold monosyllables staring past me and now as i eavesdropped she was in fine withering form with joe who was fighting a dogged rearguard action by the sound of it i gotta wait fo a reply at theastern lectric he was protesting crixus caint git ma message till aftnoon an cud be evenin fore he telegraphs back might have to wait till mawnin even what of it dyou think i intend to sit here waiting for you might be best maam caint leave comber heah on his lone one of us oughta be with him dont be a fool of course i shant leave him here hell come with me hermess men will have him in view every moment there are two of them are there not even so maam hell be safest right heah hes a right slippy mean feller an dangrous ah know it you know it who are you to know anything you black dolt youll remember your place which is to do my bidding dyou hear now get to the telegraph office and dont return until you have crixuss order to take him to boston i dont care if you have to wait until tomorrow or the day after he muttered something which i didnt hear and she fairly hissed in fury dont dare question me dont dare comber is my concern not yours you insolent offal do you hear answer me when i address you do you hear yes maam his deep voice was shaking sposin ah git word fm crixus this aftnoon where ah find yuh you dont wait till i return now get out i met him in the doorway murmured ah joe how many free niggers get that kind of pleasuring eh and received a murderous glare before he strode off annette was putting on her bonnet before the mirror but when i inquired where she was going i was told curtly to hold my tongue and wait which i did obediently while she fussed with her appearance referring every few minutes to the little gold watch which she kept in her reticule she was paler than usual and twitchy as a nervous sepoy drawing her gloves off and on and fiddling with her toilette somethings up thinks i but after a while she seemed to settle and it was a good halfhour before she looked at her watch for the last time stood up and informed me that we were going out i have business in town you will come with me and dont move a yard from me at any time do you understand whatever i do wherever i go dont leave my side for a moment and do not contradict anything you may hear me say no do not ask questions she rapped it all out like a tiny drill sergeant steady enough but i guessed that she was up to high doh within and striving to hide it you are being watched remember do not look around for for anyone they are there do nothing out of the usual you hear your life depends upon it it was nothing she hadnt said in washington but the manner was new she was scared and i couldnt believe it was only on my account i started to ask her what was amiss but she bit my head off be quiet do as i say no more we are man and wife out in new york so try to behave in a natural manner that was rich coming from her she took a breath and handed me some change that is our streetcar fare three cents apiece pay the conductor now give me your arm it was like walking with a badly wound up clockwork doll as we descended to the street but once we were out in the sunshine and the chattering broadway crowds she became easier possibly because i showed no tendency to cut and run or bawl for a copper theres a great air of up and doing about new york everyone seems to be in a cheerful hurry and even my apprehensions about the kuklos bravos who i was sure were dogging our steps receded in that jolly bustle we mounted one of the long cars which ran on rails on the broad thoroughfare it was crowded to the doors but half a dozen gallants begged annette with much tipping of tiles and do me the honour maam to take their seats and im bound to say she played up like the actress she was smiling prettily as she accepted and even referring demurely to her husband to discourage one young blade who was being overattentive he gave me an apologetic grin and offered me a chew from his tobacco case which i declined fortunately the press was too thick for him to start the relentless inquiry to which yankees are wont to subject perfect strangers as to their origin business habits and destination and after a couple of stages annette informed me that this is our stop beauchamp and we transferred to one of the omnibuses which ran on the crossstreets here i had my encounter with the dollymops who used me as a conductor one of them exclaimed flirtatiously that id given her too much change so i said gravely that in the presence of so much beauty i invariably became confused and she should return any overpayment to my wife who handled all my financial affairs that sent them into blushing whispers and giggles with sidelong glances at annette who gave me a sharp look as i took my seat beside her but said nothing the girls lost interest in me after that and fell to discussing a party which one of them had attended on park avenoo you never seen such style it was a yellow enertainment sure everythin yellow linen glass plates an all i swear even the lampshades were yellow but then mrs van vogel shes harolds bosss wife yknow why shes just drownin in money harold reckons that party cost her fifteen thousan dollars cries of you dont say well i swan and gosh a mercy harold hated it tho cos he couldnt smoke or chew he was fit to be tied say harriet did you have to wear yellow too why sure you think id go in green or blue to a yellow party an we danced an there was a magician an an english breakfast an i never saw more policemen outside a house in my life to keep the crowds back from the carriages course harold and i we walked annette gripped my wrist come snaps she and made for the door we were at a stop some passengers had just descended and the driver was about to strap up the door again he raised a great bellow of complaint at our tardiness but annette squeezed out with me on her heels i looked back at the cursing driver in time to see him close the door on another latecomer a cove in a brown suit and bowler who was demanding that he open it again but jarvey wasnt having any and the bus rolled off with the fellow staring after us through the glass this way do not hurry and do not look round annettes fingers were tight on my arm as she guided me along the crowded sidewalk her heels clicking smartly we were on one of the avenues lined with fashionable shops and before you could say jack robinson she had whisked into one of them a splendid emporium with two large glass doors one bearing the word madam and tother celeste and with fat gilt cupids capering on the lintel above one moment we were in the crowded bustle of the street the next in the hush of an opulent interior the street noise cut off as the doors closed behind us for a moment i thought it must be an exclusive brothel for we were in a great salon all plush and gilt and mirrors with thick carpet and velvet divans and curtains looped back by silver cords and junoesque females of perfect complexion drifting about the air was heavy with perfume and then i realised that i was the only man in the place and that the junoes were shop attendants waiting on society women of all ages my astonished gaze fell on a polished counter displaying alabaster pots of mammarial balm travelled to a glass cabinet containing did my eyes deceive me corsets enhanced by globular objects labelled madam celestes patent bosom balloons with special respirator dwelt in disbelief on a plaster cast of the venus de milo attired in eternal youth pumped cups and came to rest on a double doorway consisting of an enormous oil painting of splendidly endowed females in gauzy costumes teasing the god pan who was bound to a tree and not thinking much of it above the doorway was a gilt sign enamelling studio im too young for this establishment thinks i but before i could speak we were accosted by a dark soulful beauty whod have been the picture of elegance if she hadnt been chewing like a longshoreman not baccy but a curious grey pellet like candlewax which she removed daintily as she approached and secreted in a lace handkerchief before inquiring languidly if she could render assistance to maydam i am mrs comber says annette i have an enamelling appointment with madam celeste sure drawls the beauty would maydam be requirin facial treatment only or facen shoulders or facen shouldersn buzzum what do you mean face repeated the young lady patiently or facen shoulders or she fluttered graceful fingers at annettes upper works the whole shebang i shall discuss that with madam celeste snaps annette kindly send for her at once okay sighs the beauty and spoke as one in a trance if maydamwill please to beseated an studyour tariffshe will see we offer the weekly application the monthly applicationanourspecial applicationguaranteed forone fullyeartis acapitaleconomymuchfavouredbyourreglarclienteel i said i shall discuss it with madam celeste annette kept her voice down but it was quivering with impatience she is expecting me mrs comber i must speak with her privately do you hear privately huh the beauty raised a knowing brow gave a sly glance at me and leaned forward confidentially is ah messoor to be present durin thapplication what yes yes now will you fetch madam celeste well sure right away perhaps maydam an messoor would care to study our choice of shades while you wait she presented us each with cards bearing coloured illustrations of scantily clad females with varying complexions indian ivory is specially becomin for facial application she murmured on tother hand rose blush for the buzzum is a prime favrite with gennelmen we find she tapped my card delicately perhaps messoor has a prefrence eh says i startled oh i dont know what flavours have you got bring madam celeste this instant snarls annette and the beauty gave me a wondering look and swayed off smirking while my companion made seething noises and glanced quickly over her shoulder towards the door her knuckles were white on the handle of her parasol if youre looking for the cove in the brown suit hes still on the bus whispers i and she started eyes wide with alarm he was kuklos was he look here what the devils up and what are we doing in this place are you trying to give em the slip she stared at me wildly lips trembling but before she could speak a tall beaknosed female with the beauty in tow was bearing down on us crying apologies for the delay and would mrs comber kindly step this way she bustled annette off through the enamelling studio doors and as i followed the beauty stood aside to let me by she was retrieving her chew from her handkerchief popping it between rosebud lips and i must have looked mystified for she smiled brightly and said spruce gum tis real succulent you wanna chew there was a sudden commotion at the street door a tall burly man with another behind him was pushing in looking around the salon thrusting past a girl attendant who tried to bar his way i heard annette give a little scream she was staring back whitefaced from the enamelling studio doors and at that moment the burly cove spotted us and started forward at a run barging a customer aside and overturning a table laden with pots mammarial balm probably but i didnt wait to see i was through the studio doors like a whippet and annette was crying quickly for your life this way as she and madam celeste disappeared round a corner ahead of me i followed full tilt and found myself facing a short flight of stairs leading upwards but no sign of fleeing females there was a door ajar at the stair foot though i dodged into it and now it was my turn to scream as i found myself confronting four women naked to the waist and painted entirely white seated in barbers chairs with girls in overalls lathering them in some kind of plaster from buckets for an instant we stared in mutual amaze and then someone shrieked peeping tom they rose as one enamelled female and scurried for cover and flashy tactfully withdrew and legged it upstairs four at a time i heard the studio doors crash open behind me booted feet pounding oaths and screams as my pursuers encountered the plastered poonts society a roar of this way jem and panic lent me wings as i shot up another two flights and here was madam celeste on a landing grim as a gorgon but pointing towards an open doorway through there cries she theyre waiting in the far attic run ill bar the door some chaps might have paused to offer gallant assistance or inquire who they might be but if youre me and have no notion what the hell is happening but only that youre a short stairway ahead of murderous pursuit you do as youre bid and let chivalry take care of itself i bounded through heard the door slam and the lock grate behind me and found myself in an immensely long studio gallery with a glass roof full of lumber under dustsheets annette was ten paces ahead of me pausing in her flight to wave me on i was beside her in a second bellowing for enlightenment as she fumbled in her reticule and stamped her tiny foot in dismay where are they cries she mcwatters a moil there was a distant shout from the far end and then a splintering crash as the door was burst in behind us i had a glimpse of madam celeste being hurled aside by the burly villain and then he and his mate were hallooing at the sight of us the leader drawing a revolver and annette had a derringer in her fist and was letting fly once twice the sharp reports no louder than exploding caps and god knows where the shots went for he stood unharmed covering us and roaring give up comber hold there or youre dead by thunder his muzzle swung to me as i heard annettes hammer click on an empty chamber and there was only one thing for it quick as light i gripped her by the waist and swung her bodily before me as a shield his gun boomed like a cannon in the confined space i felt the wind of the slug past my cheek and as i flung myself back clasping her to my bosom an absolute salvo of revolver fire sounded from behind us the burly man t hrew up his hands and pitched headlong his mate fell back clutching his arm and now the gallery seemed full of men running past us sixshooters at the ready bawling to our stricken pursuers to surrender one of the newcomers a whitewhiskered file in steel spectacles dropped to his knee beside us and seized annette by the arm are ye hit wumman cries he in a broad scotch accent and she plainly wasnt for she struggled from my nerveless grasp demanding furiously why he hadnt been on hand when needed and then she became aware of the smoking derringer in her fist and went into a dead swoon the scotchman swore and demanded if i was wounded i reassured him and he promptly abandoned me and hurried off to supervise the apprehension and manacling of our two assailants who were bleeding all over the shop and being deuced noisy about it and so far as i could think at all i was reflecting well if this is new york they may keep it for me sixty seconds earlier id been quietly weighing the relative merits of indian ivory and rose blush as knocker cosmetics and here i was lying winded in an attic reeking with gunsmoke sober men in large boots were pocketing revolvers and shouting at each other one was hauling me to my feet and enjoining me to take it easy and annette was lying comatose while madam celeste waved a bottle of salts under her nose one thing only penetrated my dazed mind shed led my kuklos shadows into a carefully laid trap in this unlikely titpainting emporium but why and who were these hardfaced gentry who had emerged to smite the amalekites in the nick of time there wasnt a uniform among em but they were far too official to be anything but police or government one a brisk bearded chap in a hard hat who seemed to be the leader was barking orders and bigod he was another haggisfancier no getting away from the brutes wherever you go right mcwatters awa wi them tae the tombs he was telling the whitewhiskered cove pickeringll have the third yin by now theyre tae be kept apart and solitary mind that now the black fellow simmons will still be at the telegraph office and caseys seein tae it that no message from washington will reach him till tonight your men are to observe him in the meantime but let him alone ye follow he gestured at annette who was stirring feebly eyelids fluttering and snapped his fingers at the man beside me johnson carry her down ill attend tae mr comber mysel yere no hurt he added to me capital ill be wi ye directly he clapped mcwatters on the shoulder away ye go then geordie a smart morns work my boy and so ill tell the commissioner so they were police and suddenly i was so weak with relief that my legs buckled and i sat down heavily on a pile of lumber i was safe at last and could sit there panting gratefully while the man johnson swung annette gently up in his arms and bore her out to the stairs with madam celeste in attendance my two wouldbe murderers were carried out dripping gore mcwatters ordered his men away and then the bearded man and i were alone in the silent gallery with the powder smoke still wraithing in the sunbeams from the glass roof and the blood wet on the planks he pulled a flask from his pocket and handed it to me tak your time says he and well have a wee crack you and i he was a nondescript fellow in his shabby suit but with an eye bright and unwinking as a birds questing over me and missing nothing and while he wasnt above middle height i guessed that anyone who ran into him would come away bruised youre police says i when id swallowed and gasped officer mcwatters and his men are from the new york force says he with a sour glance at his flask for mysel let us say that i serve the united states thank god for that ye can thank mistress mandeville too while yere about it shes in the same employ that startles ye aye weel tak anither pull at the glenlivet if ye like she never said eheep to ye did she and right she was the less ye knew the better shes an american agent ill be damned but lord shes married to that fat scoundrel count charles la force who calls himsel atropos aye she is that its a great convenience ill have the flask back now he added dryly good malts scarce on this side o the water i handed it back marvelling annette mandeville spying for the government on her own husbands conspiracy just as black joe in crixuss confidence was a spy for the kuklos dear god was no one in this bloody country what they seemed to be my bewilderment must have been a sight to see for my companion was looking sardonic and benign together rot him a tangled skein eh says he but not tae my agency ye see mr comber weve been following your progress ever since moody picked ye up in that washington alley and every word yeve spoken and heard since then has been reported tae me we know all about your conference wi crixus and how atropos had ye lifted and how they both schemed tae send ye to john brown and about harpers ferry the whole clanjamfry he had that complacent knowall air which is so objectionable in scotchmen especially when its justified oh aye the kuklos and underground railroad pride themsels on their secret intelligence weel sir theyre no the only ones he paused to see how i was taking it but was mum so he went on needless tae say once we knew of your presence we referred to our official records and identified ye as the british admiralty agent who was active aye uncommonly active in this country ten years ago he gave a knowing smile never fear mr comber we have no interest in that yell be glad to hear our concern wi you is here and now he regarded me with eyes like amiable gimlets so why are ye in the united states not a question youll allow to which i could give a short answer but i didnt need to since they werent concerned with my murky american past my course was clear theres no secret about it youre welcome to the whole story but not until im under the protection of the british minister either here or in washington i gave him my flashiest smile very good it wasnt of course id remind ye mr comber growls he that yere in no position to make conditions having entered this country secretly and associated wi two clandestine and illegal bodies associated my eye they kidnapped me as your eavesdroppers have certainly told you and im not an admiralty agent and never was and my name aint comber i dare say prescott is it or arnold or howard or have ye another one youre damned right i have its flashman and im a colonel in the british army and believe it or not as you choose i was on my way home from india to report to lord palmerston when i was why whats the matter for he had recoiled a step staring down at me in the oddest way not as though he didnt believe me but as though he did and couldnt credit his senses flashman did ye say flashman the afghan soldier well this was gratifying id not supposed my fame had carried so far but of course he was britishborn by his voice and must have heard of me years ago the very same cries i laughing i know it must sound damned unlikely and ive no papers or anything of the sort and i dont know a soul here to vouch for me but a telegraph to our minister in washington lord lyons i believe stop you he leaned forward abruptly we may not have tae seek so far tell me sharp now what was your wifes maiden name what my wifes what dye mean answer snaps he her maiden name why morrison but an only child was she he rapped it out face close to mine and i found myself answering why no she had three sisters their names what the devil now see here answer ye say yere flashman prove it her sisters names why mary and agnes yes and grizel where were ye married this was staggering in paisley abbey but how in gods name do you know i was on my feet now who the devil are you dye mean to say ye know me i do that says he and the sudden bark and blazing stare that had jolted the answers out of me were gone and he was regarding me with grim astonishment i could wish i didnt but well mak siccar what took ye to paisley in the first place why i was training militia that ye were what for to to help to put down the chartists there was rioting among the mill people when they read the riot act at morrisons mill what like horse were ye ridin and what colour were your breeks eh how the hold on it was a white mare i think and my pants would be cherrypink my god you were there in my minds eye were the dirty yelling faces the shaken fists the hail of clods and brickbats that had knocked the provosts hat off the peninsular veteran sergeant bawling to the wavering militia to hold their line the snarling obscenities as the mob gave back sullenly before the bayonets your correspondent near to soiling his fine cherrypicker breeks with fear and this glowering inquisitor with his rasping voice and peelers eyes remembered it too and here we were twenty years after facing each other in a new york attic where his timely intervention had probably saved my life aye i was there says he was i no man i was the ringleader no ye wont mind me its my trade no bein noticed and there were no warrants out for allan pinkerton in those days tae drive him from his native land his eyes glinted angrily and then he shrugged at least ye didnae fire on us like those fools at monmouth castle his name meant nothing to me he wasnt the most famous detective in the world then but the great thing was that he knew and could vouch for me and speed me to the british ministry in my delight i gripped his hand and pumped it congratulating him on his splendid memory he said curtly that it was easy enough to remember going hungry on a coopers wages and when i cried jovially that i meant his remembering my wife and her family he replied unsmiling that no one in paisley was ever likely to forget morrison and his brood he wasnt sharing my high spirits i could see in fact he was looking damned sour frowning and tugging his beard like a man who doesnt know what to do next its no that simple snaps he when i spoke of telegraphing lyons oh aye i ken fine who ye are and a about the crimea and the light brigade i still see the old country papers didnt i read lately about your great deeds in india and the victoria cross he ground his teeth and ye spoke of palmerston i suppose yere far ben wi the queen too being married to elspeth i understand glaswegian so i could agree that had the honour of her majestys close acquaintance but why should that upset him because comber was a poor crater of no account but flashman vc is anither kettle o fish athegither cries he becoming scotcher by the minute and my orders are tae hold comber for my chiefs and no let him near the british ministry well i aint comber so your orders dont count do they no thats where youre wrong he rounded on me comber or flashman the united states want ye and thats the end o it he added quietly so yell please to consider yoursel in my custody what you told me a moment since they dont give a dam about ten years ago and by god ive done nothing since my astonishment gave way to fury at the insolence of it custody be damned who the dooce dye think you are since i was railroaded into this bloody country ive been assaulted kidnapped threatened blackmailed and dam near killed and youve known all about it damn your eyes and never lifted a finger until now well mr allan pinkerton ive had enough of it and youll take me to the british minister or consul or whoeverthehell it is here and now or ill or yell what says he and as i gargled to a stop before that ruthless stare he pushed me unresisting back to my seat im as persuadable as the next man you know theres no help for it says he my chiefs may take a different view when they learn who ye are but i doubt it theres too much at stake and it all turns on what has happened tae ye in these few days past he regarded me sombrely the fact is we need ye well you damned well cant have me dye hear i never heard such moonshine what the blazes can you need me for perhaps tae preserve the union of these united states says he steadily but that far ahead i cannae see now ill take ye to my chiefs who are among the highest in the land i may tell ye and theyll inform ye further he chewed his lip considering this much ill tell you now since the scheme is mine for reasons quite different from those of crixus and atropos whose infernal plans must be frustrated at all costs my superiors would have ye enlist with john brown they say that yankees are the smartest salesmen in the world and ill not deny it id not have believed when pinkerton spoke those appalling words that any advocate on gods earth could have talked me into joining brown of my own free will crixus had tried by moral suasion the bloated fiend atropos by naked threats and now this steelyeyed bastard was announcing it as the policy of the us authorities he didnt say why and i didnt ask because the whole thing was outrageous i mean to say while crixus probably and atropos certainly had the means to compel me into the service of a mad farmer bent on starting a war the united states hadnt they couldnt hold an eminent british soldier against his will deny him the protection of his embassy and force him into criminal activity could they and yet i finished up at harpers ferry why because a certain shrewd new yorker understood the true art of persuasion which lies in convincing the gull against all reason that he cant afford not to buy salesmanship thats the ticket ill come to that presently my immediate response when pinkerton sprang his mine was to question his sanity and decline at the top of my voice pointing out that if he didnt drum up lyons instanter palmerston would have a fit the queen would be most displeased we might well burn washington again and he pinkerton would find himself selling matches on the street corner to which he replied bleakly that id better come along quietly i said id swim in blood first so two minutes later i was being escorted down the backstairs by two of his stalwarts standing on my dignity and doing what i was bid in the sure knowledge that i was on a sound wicket and the longer they held and hindered me the more crow theyd have to eat in the long run they put me in a black maria in the alley behind madam celestes bouncer repair shop and so to a brown building overlooking the river nothing like a police station or jail but staffed by sober silent civilians who conducted me to a comfortable enough chamber which was something between a parlour and a cell gave me a disgusting luncheon consisting of a cake of fried chopped beef smothered in onions and train oil and left me to my own devices for a couple of hours believe it or not by this time i was quite enjoying myself i was safe you see gloriously safe after all my trials nobly borne and certain of eventual deliverance poor old charity springs scheme for my undoing had gone agley altogether now that it was known who i really was there could be no question now of my answering old charges in the distant south the kuklos couldnt come near me and poor old crixus simply didnt count by now i reflected happily pinkerton would be dismaying his chiefs with the news that the lowly comber whom theyd hoped to bend to their nefarious will was none other than the admired flashy darling of the british empire and quite beyond their touch i even had a jolly daydream in which i was summoned to the white house to receive president buchanans apology for the lunch pinkertons reappearance brought me back to earth he had a couple of civilians in tow and as soon as i clapped eyes on them i smelt government one was a swell ministry ruffian a genteel lanternjaw with a flowered weskit and brass knuckles in his fob no doubt the other was your complete politico with the pudding face of a badtempered baby and no nonsense pinkerton called him senator and he plumped down in a chair with his fists on his knees scowled cut my protest off short and pitched right in pinkerton tells us you claim to be an english army colonel named flashman he had the harsh nasal rasp of new england says he recognises you from twenty years back it wont do sir not good enough he may be mistaken he also says you refuse to give any account of yourself until youve seen your minister well sir he stuck out his fat chin that wont do either after youve explained yourself and your connection with the englishman who masqueraded in this country ten years ago under various names and satisfied me that you are who you claim to be then well see about the minister he sat back folding his hands over his guts now sir you have the floor id been all set to sail into him with demands that i be released forthwith but the steady look of the shrewd eyes in that stubborn podgy face and the flat assurance of the man told me it wouldnt answer theyd keep me here until hell froze or i talked as i was certainly going to have to sooner or later to lord lyons whod be bound to pass it on to them so why not save him the trouble and i love telling a tale about myself and startling the whiffers so i decided to shelve my protests asked for something to wet my whistle warned them it would be a long story and fired away well you know it by now from my being pressed aboard springs vessel my masquerade as comber adventures on the mississippi slaverunning slavestealing underground railroad lincoln and so on to the point where id fled westward after spring killed omohundro my peregrinations beyond the wide missouri i dealt with only briefly dismissed the crimea and mutiny in a modest sentence or two and so came at last to my present misfortunes all the way from the cape to madam celestes omitting only the tender passages and im bound to admit it is one hell of a tale which id not believe myself if i hadnt been there every ghastly foot of the way they heard me out in silence and i was croaking hoarse when i finished the senator had barely moved but his petulant glower had grown deeper as i talked pinkerton had listened intently nodding and sniffing now and then and occasionally prowling about to view me from different vantages the lanternjawed sportsman had been out of my line of sight but when id done he was the first to break the silence it fits was all he said and the senator grimaced and eased himself in his chair shaking his jowls in perplexity you may say so growls he by gadfrey its the wildest thing i ever heard ill say that too wild to make up oh well now you mean you believe it i guess i know the papers on comber by heart says lanternjaw and he hasnt contradicted em not once what hes added to what we knew already well sir as i said it fits every time the senator scowled harder than ever wheres lincoln just now not in new york but you know he couldnt speak to this this gentlemans being colonel flashman no dammit the senator swung round in his chair see here pinkerton are you sure of him beyond any doubt whatever sir this is colonel flashman youd take an oath on that its no a matter of oath pinkerton was impatient i know the senator drummed his fingers brooding and then threw up his hands what the hades whichever he is hes all we have in any event he rose and faced me very well colonel flashman i make no apology for doubting you sir for if ever a man brought suspicion on himself he paused breathing hard and suddenly burst out confound it sir do they know of this in england about comber and impersonation and slaverunning and and heaven knows what no sir says l i was on leave you see my god he stared helplessly at the others and then squaring his shoulders he sat down before me again full of stern resolve ill not waste words weve had a deal too many already but we had to be sure who you were now that we know says he without much confidence i thought i am still bound to ask the question id have put to you if you were comber he took a deep breath are you prepared to place yourself at the disposal of the united states for an extraordinary service you mean to help this mad bugger brown to start a war i had my answer ready you may be sure no dammit if i told pinkerton once i no sir cries he quite the contrary to make sure that brown does not start any such thing i could only gape by god he was serious what on earth dyou mean make sure he doesnt how could i do that in heavens name if you want him stopped why arrest him or shoot him or banish him to timbuktu that cant be it was the lanternjaw crixus and atropos both told you for political reasons we darent touch him but we can restrain him given the means tae hand says pinkerton yoursel colonel me restrain him why my good ass i dont even know him thank god something pinkerton himself had said flashed into my mind you said brown was your friend well you restrain him then i cant even if i wanted to which i dam well dont hear me sir cries the senator raising a statesmanlike hand you misunderstand entirely no one can reason with john brown he is a man possessed sir not to be moved by persuasion but he could be prevented he leaned forward dramatically by a lieutenant in whom he reposed absolute trust a deputy a counsellor on whom he relied completely for the military skill and knowledge which he himself lacks could so hinder and delay his terrible design that it would die stillborn he is a simple man when all is said and the events of this past week have conspired to make you he stabbed a finger at me and only you that lieutenant that deputy who can frustrate him why already brown is looking to you the man chosen for him by his trusted friend crixus and crixus and the kuklos from far different motives have set you on the path to the same dreadful end that they both seek we are asking you to follow that path so that their infernal machinations may be confounded so help me its what he said senatorial oratory you see he took his finger out of my weskit and flourished it aloft there must be no abolitionist raid on southern soil the consequences would be too hideous to envision war sir civil war might well follow that is what hangs in the balance do not you see but it can be prevented sir without loss of life without so much as a tremor to disturb the tranquillity of not by me man alive dye know what youre saying im a british officer sworn to my countrys service or have you forgotten that i cant meddle in you have not heard me out but you must he stood firm jowls and all the peace of a nation is at stake very well you may say that you are not an american that this is no concern of yours or englands but you would be wrong as can be as a man of honour honour honour dye say a splendid horizon of humbug suddenly unfolded before me and i sprang to my feet john bull incarnate whats honourable about bamboozling this barmy peasant id like to know hoodwinking by george playing judas of all the caddish tricks pshaw and you talk about honour dammit you yankees cant even spell it im not sure i didnt stamp my foot oh the blazes with this ive heard enough i demand to see the british minister and thats my last word to you he was swelling for another burst of eloquence and pinkerton was flushed with anger but the lanternjaw motioned them aside and they conferred in urgent whispers while i stared nobly out of the window mind you i kept an ear cocked and caught a few murmurs no no twould be fatal lyons would be bound to refuse must prevail on him somehow why hes heavensent oh hell see him right enough hes set on the thing heart and soul aboard the ship then out of sight couldnt be better which was all very mysterious not that i cared now for once i was savouring the novelty of being able to face a group of selfish zealots who were intent on flinging me into the soup and present a dead bat to all their urgings i was quite cockahoop i can tell you as they emerged from their confabulation i turned to look them blandly in the eye and the senator addressed me magisterial but sour very well sir since you are not to be moved we have no choice but to place you in the charge of your consular officials who will doubtless arrange for you to see lord lyons in washington i could have cheered but confined myself to a grave inclination in the meantime there is an eminent personage in this city who desires to speak with you i shall take the liberty of presenting you to him forthwith it gave me pause for a second after all my true identity had been known only for a few hours and to a limited circle id have thought what eminent personage had got wind of me still ive never minded being lionhunted so i waved a courteous assent asking only who it might be notwithstanding your deep interest in american affairs says the senator with a sarcastic sniff i doubt if his name is known to you let us simply call him the next president of the united states for a moment i wondered if he meant lincoln since he was the only american of any note id ever met bar kit carson and it wasnt likely to be him then i remembered theyd already said lincoln wasnt on hand besides the abraham of my acquaintance while a handy man to have at your side when youve a bullet in the buttock and the slavecatchers are closing in hadnt struck me as a likely candidate for high office too goodnatured a rascal altogether and dressed like a scarecrow it didnt signify anyway whoever it was in a few hours id be among my own folk preparing to shake the dust of america from my feet forever and glad of it so now it was back to the black maria again with a sullen pinkerton for company and the other two in a carriage behind we were borne swiftly along the waterfront to a quiet quay where a trim little sailingcutter was waiting manned by navy tarpaulins pinkerton ushered us aboard and in no time we were scudding out on to the crowded river with my curiosity rising by the minute there was any amount of watertraffic about manhattan island in those days steamlaunches sailing craft paddlesteamers threedeckers even and rowing boats and what with the salt air and sunshine and cheery bustle it was quite capital i sat on a thwart drinking it all in not minding the spray or the heaving content to admire the view and wonder which river we were on for i didnt know east from hudson and still dont we seemed to be making for the far shore cutting through the water at a great rate with the steamboats shrilling their hooters and passengers crowding the rail to look down on us as we neared the shoreline of wharves ahead there seemed to be some jamboree in progress and the sound of brass bands was mingling with the steam whistles and the cry of the seabirds a little flotilla gay with bunting was making for a big seagoing paddleboat there were banners flying and people waving and hurrahing and a tug was squirting its hoses high into the air making watery rainbows in the sunlight very pretty to see some great swell taking his leave thinks i for the folk on the smaller boats were singing auld lang syne and giving three cheers again and again and as we stood off i could see a knot of people on the big paddleboat waving their hats we seemed to be waiting and then there was a great volley of orders and our sail cracked like a gunshot and we went swooping in under the paddleboats stern and round to her lee where we hooked on put this on says pinkerton handing me a big wideawake hat and turn up your collar right come on he led the way up the sideladder with two of his fellows fore and aft of me and others ahead shouting to the people to stand clear we bustled through them and i was shown into a small cabin and bidden to wait which i did for a good halfhour wondering but not alarmed until pinkerton reappeared and conducted me without a word to a door where the senator was waiting he rapped on the panels a voice cried to come in and we were in a large stateroom in the presence of a wiry little gentleman in his shirtsleeves smoking a cigar as big as himself and sighing with relief as he eased off his boots with his feet and kicked them aside ah henry cries he so this is the gentleman colonel flashman i am happy to make your acquaintance my name is william seward sit down sir sit down he exchanged a nod with the senator who went and seward grinned apologetically forgive the informality of my feet wont you they protest at this time of day i felt quite let down hang it id been expecting someone ten feet tall and here this eminent personage was a slight dapper bantam in his stockingsoles brisk enough with a head of greying reddish hair bright blue eyes under bushy brows and a curiously husky voice but his only striking feature was a nose like a battleship he looked not unlike a clever parrot or an amiable duke of wellington if you can imagine any such thing next president of the united states though i couldnt see that and as we know he never was and whos heard of him these days still i can say ive been bullied by bismarck diddled by disraeli cajoled by lincoln charmed by palmerston and bored to submission by gladstone and not one of em was harder to resist than william henry seward he was civil pleasant easy and the most vicious armtwister i ever struck he didnt even hint let alone threaten just showed you the inevitable ever so amiable which of course was why hed asked to see poor unsuspecting flashy when all other persuaders had failed he soon had me settled with whisky and cigar crying how pleased he was to meet such a distinguished soldier of whom hed heard so much that disarmed me to start with i admit then he was full of india of which he knew a surprising deal questioning me about the mutiny wondering how the natives would take to crown rule instead of john companys asking how christianity was doing in the country not my style at all if hed asked how the bombay bints compared to the punjabi bibis i could have set him right had i visited the holy land as he hoped to do when he got to europe waterloo too he must see waterloo and stirling castle and look up his relatives in wales oh hed visited england before as a lad and sneaked in to have a look at old king william at windsor haha all this as he pottered about setting his books in order placing the flowervase just so tapping the glass smoking like a chimney and at last settling himself in an armchair remarking how grand it would be to see the homeland once more for thats what it is you know to an american why i feel as excited as a child again going on a visit to granpapas house puffpuff on his cigar or ought i to say grandmamas house no twould be ungallant to your gracious queen to saddle her with that venerable title yet awhile he chuckled and grew thoughtful ah yes old england new america has it ever occurred to you colonel that our two nations are the only ones on earth who have a natural claim to each others sympathy and affection the truth is you see were not two different nations at all but merely two separate states the european and american branches of the british race puffpuff i say that with all respect to the dutch german and french citizens of this country of course we americans are still part of the british family as you are he smiled at me through the smoke dont you agree i made some idle remark about the war of independence and he burst out laughing my dear sir my grandmothers family fought for the king on that occasion grandpapa seward chose the right side though yes sir he was a colonel in washingtons army a trueblue american patriot and a welshman to the end of his days im told puffpuff no colonel political differences dont run in the veins he lit himself a new cigar and waved it philosophicallike what does polity matter after all republic monarchy england was a republic once long before there were united states puffpuff as for those differences of which so much is made accent social custom and the like why they are no greater surely between devon and delaware than shall we say between cornwall and caithness he regarded me with smiling blue eyes now you have travelled widely in this country and while i dare say it has not felt quite like home still i would venture to wager that you have felt more at home here than in france or italy or spain isnt that so it was the first sidelong mention of my american activities that hed made and i wondered what was coming next but he went cheerfully on why dare say if you were to stop a man on fifth avenue or better still on the oregon trail ten to one his name would prove to be smith or jones if it were not macpherson or clancy ah you smile youve found it so in fact id been thinking of my far western acquaintances and he was right wooton carson maxwell bridger goodwin or take your own profession he went on if someone were to exchange your british army list for our own who could tell which was which eh puffpuff no colonel we may have our rivalries and jealousies all those tiresome jests and jibes about the toplofty briton and the brash yankee but let me tell you sir the smart travellers who publish their impressions and disparage the differences between us see only the surface of our countries beneath we are one people still one language one law one thing as our norse ancestors would say he gave a little grunting laugh as a politician and statesman i confess i have frequently opposed british policy even sought to frustrate british interest but do you know he was leaning back that beak of a nose pointing at the ceiling if ever the day came which god forbid when the being aye the very existence of that dear old land were in danger then i as an american would give my life to keep it whole he paused nor do i doubt that an englishman would do as much for my country ah your pardon colonel i see your glass is almost out if you have illusions seward prepare to shed them now thinks i as he plied me with more liquor for it was plain as a pikestaff whither he was bound and if he thought he could come round me with his bloodbrotherhood fustian he was well out of court i thought of keeping mum to see how he would come to cases at last but my natural mischief decided me to play him up so i observed innocently that the occasion wasnt likely to arise surely in the united states he pushed out a lip as he set down the decanter a young country at the crossroads facing the awful question whether it shall be a free nation or a slave nation whether slavery shall wither gradually peacefully and with compromise or be slain suddenly in the terrible arbitrament of war that is a country in grave peril colonel oh it may be that given time and moderation the withering process will take place unless some evil chance some terrible folly should bring the irrepressible conflict suddenly to a head like some loony invading virginia for example why the devil couldnt he say it instead of tiptoeing coyly about we both knew what he wanted that this was the last vain attempt to coax me into joining brown was he too scared to come straight out with it or did he suppose that if he gassed long enough about it and about id be mesmerised into changing my mind it was quite amusing really and i was content to smoke his excellent cigars and sip his indifferent liquor while he skirted delicately around the point hollo was he getting there if such a catastrophe should threaten he was saying pacing slowly to and fro and contemplating his cigar ash and it lay with an englishman to avert it if he alone had been given by chance the power to avert it at no peril to himself would he feel himself bound i wonder to answer the call of blood to put aside the petty manmade trammels of mere citizenship and do the little service that would mean so much to his kinsfolk hed be quoting magna carta in a minute what would you think colonel ill tickle you you insinuating little bastard thinks i hed not hesitate a moment i said in like a shot i mean to say he couldnt refuse could he unless that is he was prevented by his duty if he was a soldier say that would rule him out altogether he didnt blink or start or do anything but nod solemnly true it depends though does it not on ones interpretation of that elusive word duty he cocked his head to his queen his country to his race to humanity even nothing about humanity in queens regulations im afraid i gave him my regretful grin and he sighed and shook his head ive no doubt youre right and yet he resumed his seat and went into another of his philosophic trances at the ceiling i wonder how the queen whose regulations they are after all would view the question what advice do you suppose would she give to one of her officers if he had the opportunity to render such a signal service to the young cousincountry for which she and her people feel such a warm affinity puffpuff if he could save it from the horror of civil strife perhaps even from destruction where would she and prince albert conceive that his duty lay i wonder he heaved another reflective sigh and sat up stubbing out his cigar well we cant say can we you know her of course which i do not but i look forward with the keenest anticipation to the honour of being presented to her at court in a few weeks time the blue eyes regarding me steadily were as innocent as a babes he even smiled oh even a staunch republican feels his pulses quicken at the prospect of conversing with your gracious queen and her consort i shall also be meeting your prime minister lord duhrby oh i must remember lord darby i should say and lord palmerston who takes a close interest in american affairs you know him i believe i must tell him that you and i have spoken ive received quite a few vicious thrusts in the low lines in lifes fencingmatch but this was the real navelslasher going to get his lieutenant that was that and no help for it and my nature being what it is i did a lightning reckoning of the possible advantages that might follow if i did what they wanted and could keep this idiot brown from flying off the handle if in a word i rendered this signal service to the great republic by gum but mr presidentinwaiting seward would have a different tale to tell to little vicky and her awful husband wouldnt he just volunteered like a shot maam knew it was irregular but felt sure your majesty would wish it sacred task blood thicker than water who would true valour see we are most gratified mr stewhard so obliging of the dear colonel was it not albert hochhoch yess colonel flashmann to rugby school wass going ja gad i might get a title out of it but no it would all have to be kept mighty quiet and unofficial still there would be whispers and knowing royal smiles when i got home and no doubt a confidence from her majesty to elspeth over the teacups and stern questions followed by a rebuke for forms sake and a wink and clap on the shoulder from old pam it ran through my mind in seconds while seward busied himself clipping another cigar and when i stood up those bright eyes searched my face for several seconds before he glanced at the clock and said why how time had run past and he expected they would be casting off soon i thank you for coming to see me says he we have had a most valuable talk im sure he paused i expect to be in england for two months at ieast perhaps i may have the pleasure of your company again or have you decided to prolong your stay in america well two could play at that game by george mr seward id been intending to take the first ship but youve roused my curiosity dont ye know i rather think ill stay on a while see something of the country what and just for devilment i added any special sights of interest you think i ought to see some people have urged me to visit virginia but ive a notion it might be rather warm at this time of year eh it took him aback but only for a second that is my understanding too says he goodbye colonel and god speed they tell me he was a man quite devoid of principles whatever they are but id put it another way and say he was a consummate politician clever no question he knew exactly how to turn me round in short order which argues some kind of capacity i suppose and theres no denying he saved the united states a few years later when he wriggled out of the trent affair he was no friend of ours by the way for all the humbug hed given me and i can think of only one good reason for wishing hed become president lincoln wouldnt have got shot the fellow with the lanternjaw was called messervy and as soon as i stepped out of sewards stateroom and announced my change of heart he took charge cutting off the senators cries of satisfaction and reminding pinkerton who surprised me by clasping my hand that there was a days work to do in two hours so goodbye senator and lets go then it was ashore in haste to the black maria which was beginning to feel like home with pinkerton firing instructions at me as we rattled along while messervy sat aloof stroking his moustache mandeville an yoursel will return to the astor house tonight as though nothin had happened and wait for black joe simmons he sent a telegraph tae crixus this mornin sayin yed been found and were willin tae enlist wi brown crixuss reply has been at the new york telegraph office this three hours past but joe hasnae seen it yet and wont until youre safe back at the hotel weve seen it though sure enough crixus is over the moon haverin on about the returned prodigal an biddin joe take ye tae concord wiout delay where yell be presented tae brown at the house of frank sanborn so yell be off tomorrow likely an neither crixus nor atropos will have an inkling o whats happened today he permitted himself a sour grin the three kuklos men who followed you this mornin are safe under lock an key and will not see the light o day until this whole brown business is by and done wi and whenll that be in the rush of events id given no thought to it messervy spoke without looking round weeks all summer maybe what but my god wheesht and listen snaps pinkerton once you an joe have left for concord mandeville will return tae washington tae inform atropos that alls well itll be days afore he begins to wonder what has happened tae his three bravos an well have one or two ploys tae keep him guessin never fear the main thing is hell be satisfied that youre safe wi brown workin your mischief he thinks crixus will be under the same misconception he glanced at messervy thats my part done i think messervy nodded and we sat in silence until our paddywagon drew up behind the big brown building it was growing dusk and as we alighted pinkerton turned to me ill bid ye goodbye colonel but ill be keepin an eye on ye until ye leave for concord he hesitated and held out his hand glad yere wi us take what care ye can of auld john brown hes worth it he wrung my hand hard an my respects tae your good lady when ye see her shell no mind me but i carried her portmantle once tae the glasgow coach then he was gone and messervy swung his cane idly as he looked after him there goes a worshipper of john brown hm follow me colonel in my time ive been sent into the deep field by some sharp politicals broadfoot parkes burnes and gordon to say nothing of old pam himself but messervy the longchinned yankee corinthian with his laconic style was as keen as any and straight to the point coaching me briskly even before wed sat down turning up his desklamps as he spoke in that lordly halfenglish accent that they learn in the best eastern colleges whatever youve heard browns not mad hes a simple man with a burning purpose his admirers like to think of him as a latterday oliver cromwell he is no such thing hes not a fool but he lacks all capacity to organise and direct his strength here he sat down shooting his cuffs as he clasped his fingers before him on the desk which you would do well to remember is a remarkable gift of inspiring absolute devotion even in men far above him in education and ability pinkerton for example and the eastern liberals who furnish him with money and arms but it is among his personal followers his gang that this loyalty is most marked he drew a sheet from a stack of papers at his elbow and pushed it across those are their names you can study them later they are almost all young men staunch abolitionists for the most part and dangerous beyond their years they include several of browns sons the others are adventurers jacksofalltrades a crank or two some free blacks and escaped slaves a number of them have been soldiers one was a militia colonel and most of em have fought in the kansas troubles only one or two are what you would call educated he considered theyre tough eager and love nothing better than shooting up slaveowners as they did a couple of months ago when they rescued a few niggers from missouri and chased the militia but for the most part they camp in the woods do a little drill or target practice a few gymnastics and sweetheart the local girls brown will be looking to you to lick em into shape and plan his great stroke in virginia how says i dyou suggest i stop him he indicated the paper in my hand there arent above a dozen names on that paper thats his weakness lack of numbers many have come and gone those names you may regard as permanent hes never been good at recruiting when he was camped out in iowa rallying support he managed to muster the grand total of nine it may well be that his want of men his inability to plan anything sensible and his habitual indecision will be his ruin with a little judicious hindrance from you skilfully contrived one thing you must not do and that is try to undermine his mens loyalty it would be fatal they love him no other word for it what weapons has he got that we know of two hundred revolvers and two wagonloads of sharps rifles and you heard about the thousand pikes yes to arm the niggers when he invades virginia it all sounds damned unlikely says i but you take him seriously like nothing since the revolution says he quietly hes a man on fire you see and if the fit suddenly takes him he may go storming into virginia at halfcock with his handful of gunfighters and it just might start a war and you say he isnt mad has he got any money hes spent much of the past two years when he hasnt been raiding or writing halfbaked constitutions trying to drum up funds here in the east said he needed and may have got close to a third of it but in arms and equipment rather than hard cash he shrugged in other ways though i suspect hes found it rewarding work unless im in error his vaunted simplicity masks a substantial vanity he seems to like nothing better than being received in abolitionist society playing the old testament prophet preaching the wrath of god hes a poor speaker by the way being adored by maiden ladies from boston who know uncle tom by heart and admired by social superiors who treat him as another moses thats one of them he took a card from his stack of papers and pushed it across to me a daguerre print of an earnest weed with flowing locks and a wispy goatee like a poetic usher frank sanborn one of the socalled secret six the committee of influential abolitionists who are browns leading supporters you may meet some of em when youre presented to him at sanborns place in concord they hang on browns lips applaud his speeches pass the hat shudder deliciously when they think of him sabring border ruffians go into prayerful ecstasies whenever he runs a nigger across the british border and are in mortal terror that hell do something truly desperate he stroked his silky moustache like attacking harpers ferry they know he means to he told em so a year ago and they almost had apoplexy you see they thought the cash and arms theyd been giving him were to be used in the free soil campaign in kansas when he sprang it on em that he was planning to invade virginia arm the blacks set up a free state in the hills hold slaveowners hostage and dare the us government to come on you may guess what effect that had on our pious idealists they besought him to give up the idea he thundered scripture and told them slavery is war and must be fought they pleaded he stood fast and they gave in like the old women they are however he decided to postpone his invasion when your compatriot hugh forbes his righthand man fell out with him over money and betrayed the whole plot to various republican senators among them mr seward whose eloquence so charmed you im sure this afternoon he raised an eyebrow at me studied his nails in the lamplight and went on sewards a trueblue abolitionist but hes not a fool or a firebrand and he has presidential ambitions he warned the six they were playing with fire and must leave off that set them shivering but instead of cutting off brown without a penny they renewed their tearful pleas to him not to do anything rash but if he did please theyd rather not hear about it beforehand messervy sat back in his chair and arched his fingers together and there colonel you have the liberal abolitionists of the north in a nutshell half hoping brown will go wild while they pull the blankets over their heads seward has more sense he wants brown stopped which is why he spoke to you today once wed convinced him that you were the likeliest means of doing it at the same time he added drily senator seward finds this a convenient moment to make the grand tour of europe which is a capital place for the republicans favoured candidate to be while brown is rampaging around breathing fire hold on says you say we convinced seward by which you mean the secret service and dont tell me different arent you meant to be working for president buchanan who i believe is a democrat not that i understand american politics i work for the united states says he coolly whose next president will not be a democrat my task is the peace youre sure of that even if he were to take harpers ferry damn it all i demanded why dont you put troops into the place he made a disdainful noise the official answer to that is that we cant be sure hes still set on the ferry forbess blowing the gaff may have scared him off it he may be thinking of some other target altogether and we cant guard the whole masondixon line myself id say a squad of marines at the ferry wouldnt hurt but try telling that to washington mandarins who are too lazy or too dense or too smug to take brown seriously he shrugged but neer mind that consider i repeat what happens if brown does invade virginia tries to stir up the niggers and shoots a few southern citizens what then without waiting for a reply he went on tapping off the points on his slim fingers ill tell you the south will explode with fury and accuse the republicans of being behind it the republicans including the two senatorial gentlemen you met today will deny it the north will bust with illconcealed delight because simon legree has been kicked in the balls the southern states will raise the cry of disunion or death and then then the bloody war will break out according to you and that fat senator says i impatiently and he nodded slowly and sipped the last inch from his glass yes it very well may id lay odds on it but then again theres a chance oh a very slim one that wiser counsels might prevail provided he raised a finger at me provided brown had been killed or lynched along the way you see if his raid had been a fiasco and he had met his just deserts well it might take a little heat out of the souths temper and northern rejoicing might be a little muted oh theyd go into mourning for their hero and mr emerson and mr longfellow would write odes to the saint departed and the secret six would beat their breasts in public and give thanks in private that dead men can tell no tales but many sober yankees would be appalled and angry at the raid and condemn brown even while they mourned him many would say hed been proved wrong and that violence is not the way he shrugged again who knows in that mood common sense might assert itself the country might shrink back from war provided john brown were dead i dont see that says i what odds would it make whether he was dead or alive considerable i think here lets finish the bottle he tipped the remains into my glass you see if brown survived the raid and was taken hed stand trial probably for treason im no lawyer but when a man writes constitutions for black rebel states and fires on the american flag i guess i could make it stick but whatever the charge one thing is sure theyll hang him well good luck to em he shook his head no sir bad luck the worst right now i doubt if one american in five has even heard of john brown but let him make his crazy raid and swing for it and the whole world will hear of him he smiled with no mirth at all and what will the world say that america the land of liberty has hanged an honest upright godfearing christian whose only crime was that he wanted to make men free a man who could stand for the archetype that made this country why he could pose for uncle sam this minute and well have put him to death the damnedest martyr since joan of arc and there will be such an outcry colonel such a blaze of hatred throughout the north such a fury against slavery and its practitioners and there is your certain war readymade awaiting the first shot he hadnt raised his voice but just for a moment the cool nil admirari air had slipped a trifle he smiled almost in apology there are many ifs along the way to be sure im envisaging the worst brown may not ride into virginia this summer his own incompetence and indecision encouraged by you may delay him long enough if he doesnt move before fall i doubt if he ever will he cant hold his followers together forever living on hope deferred and fretting to get home for the harvest he rose from his chair and went to a cupboard by the wall his voice came to me out of the shadow beyond the pool of light cast by the desklamps if you can keep him bamboozled for a couple of months why alls well but if you cant and if he does light out for dixie with his guns on and comes to grief then for the sake of this country and for tens of thousands of american lives he must not survive for trial and martyrdom at the hands of the us government no john brown must die somewhere along the road oh bully for us i knew there was another bottle you will wonder no doubt why id remained cool and complacent during the conversation ive just described ill tell you seward in making it plain that if i didnt toe the line hed blacken my fair name to our sovereign lady and her ministers had used a phrase which had quite altered my view of things at no peril to himself meaning me you see what had been proposed by crixus and atropos was that i should be one of a whooping gang of cutthroats invading the south to storm arsenals and stir up bloody insurrection the sort of thing i bar altogether as you know the proposal made by the senator and pinkerton hinted at by seward and illuminated by messervy was quite the opposite i was to restrain hinder and prevent anything of the kind and while the prospect of passing several weeks in the company of a pack of hayseeds showing em how to shoulder arms and dress by the right and discussing strategy with their loose screw of a commander was not a specially attractive one well id known a lot worse it would be hard lying and rotten grub no doubt but id be earning the gratitude of the next president for what that was worth and adding to my credit at home when the story reached the right ears as id make dam sure it did above all it would be safe at no peril to himself not that id trust a politicians word for the weather you understand but messervys information had borne him out until hed made it plain that if the worst befell id be expected to put mr john brown quietly to rest fat chance a scoundrel i may be but i aint an assassin and you will comb my memoirs in vain for mention of flashy as first murderer oh ive put away more than i can count in the line of duty from stark necessity and once or twice for spite de gautet springs to mind and the pandy i shot at meerut but they deserved it anyway i dont kill chaps i dont know but it wouldnt have been tactful indeed it would have been downright dangerous to say this to messervy so i received his disgusting proposal with the stern shrewd look of a palmerston roughneck who took backshooting in his stride i may even have growled softly anyway i nodded grimly as he brought his bottle to the desk you take the point says he looking keen quite so says i which reminds me the sooner i have a gun in my pocket the better oh and a decent knife and a map of harpers ferry wherever it is colonel says he its a pleasure doing business with you excuse me he went out humming and i punished the hungarian until he returned with a neat little tranter sixshooter a stiletto in a metal sheath and a map which he insisted i study on the spot and leave behind theres the ferry just inside virginia and only fifty miles from washington he came to my elbow the odds are youll never see the place but if brown does go for it and you have to do what needs to be done then your best course afterwards will be to make tracks for washington and your ministry the militia will round up the rest of browns gang and thatll be that youll have no difficulty with lord lyons by the way hell be given notice of your coming with an assurance from a high quarter that you have rendered a signal service to the united states in a domestic maker and we are most grateful we shant tell him officially what the service was and im sure he wont ask officially but im sure hell speed your journey home he folded the map if as is most likely john brown spends a quiet summer and nothing untoward takes place well when he starts to disband his followers you can desert him at your leisure again lord lyons will be advised to expect you with our expressions of gratitude et cetera very good i dont know lyons says i but ill bet hes nobodys fool he isnt says messervy which is why whatever course you have to take all will be well he took another turn at his moustache its in a dam good cause colonel you know it we know it and lord lyons will know it i thought it wouldnt hurt to play my part a little you yankees have a blasted cheek you know ah well i say though when im out in the bush with brown how do send messages to me you dont too dangerous brown and his people might get wise to you so might the kuklos just because weve got three of their men in the tombs doesnt mean there wont be others watching you theyll certainly have people keeping track of brown himself if either side suspected you were secret service he gave me a knowing look quite so anyway the fewer of our people who know weve got an agent with brown and a briton at that the better well be keeping an eye on thangs though and if need arises ill get word to you he took a small purse from a drawer and tossed it over thats to keep in your money belt if joe should wonder how you came by it mrs mandeville gave it you he frowned thats another thing brown will welcome you with open arms just suppose he doesnt what then he will no question youre a gift from god the point is hell also welcome joe hes all for black recruits well i dont have to remind you that joe is a kuklos man and a good one hes a damned rum bird says i oh i know he and atropos have been chums in the nursery and all that tommyrot but hang it he ought to be all for brown and black freedom surely i dont fathom him at all some of these darkies who belong to the old southern families are mighty loyal they think of themselves as kin to their owners and many of em are though i doubt if joe is but all we know of him confirms that hes staunch to atropos he shrugged maybe he reckons hes better off slave than free living high in the tents of wickedness rather than being a doorkeeper in the house of a god whod expect him to earn his own living and having a free run at massas white lady from time to time thinks l anyway beware of him says messervy hell be watching you like a hungry lynx he glanced at his timepiece its half after eight and mrs comber will be waiting she hasnt been told your real name by the way no need for her to know that the building seemed to be deserted and we went down the echoing stone stairs to a room on the ground floor where annette was waiting with a nondescript civilian who faded from view at a nod from messervy she seemed none the worse for her swooning fit of the morning and didnt give me a glance let alone a word as messervy conducted us to a closed carriage in the back court where he handed her in bowed gallantly over her hand and gave me his imperturbable nod joe wont be given crixuss message for another hour by that time youll be having a quiet supper after a days sauntering and shopping on broadway he indicated a couple of bandboxes on the floor of the cab your purchases mrs comber one of our lady operators chose them with regard to your taste i hope the yankee secret service evidently left nothing to chance good luck comber and he added quietly if need be good hunting cool as a trout rot him doffing his tile and knuckling his lipwhisker as we drove away annette sat like a frozen doll for several minutes and then to my astonishment broke out in a low hard voice you saved my life this morning when that creature fired on us my my courage failed me but for you i would have been killed i thank you i didnt twig for a second and then it dawned that she must have quite misunderstood why id seized hold of her when the lead started flying oh well all to the good i waved an airy hand my dear twas nothing i wasnt going to be a widower so soon was it i slipped an arm about her and kissed her soundly why its i should thank you for steering me clear of those kuklos villains but i say you took me in altogether you clever little puss never a word that you were working for brother jonathan all the time and you a southern creole lady too hows that come about eh if you knew what it was to be married to that devil you would not need to ask but she said it automatically her mind still fixed on that fateful moment at madam celestes siding stiff as a board while i munched at her cheek i never shot at anyone before i i was in terror not thinking what i was about or nonsense girl says i squeezing her udders why you blazed away like a drunk dragoon winged him i shouldnt wonder gave him a nasty start leastways but here we are safe and sound so take that you little peach but it was like kissing a dead flounder i might have kijled him she whispered staring ahead it would have been murder mortal sin thou shalt not kill oh let me be damn you she beat at my hands trying to struggle free have you no feeling can you think of nothing but but your filthy lust oh when i might have had that upon my soul was so shocked i absolutely let them go upon your what heavens woman what the dooce are you talking about i tried to kill him she turned on me eyes blazing i had murder in my heart cant you understand and he didnt i suppose my stars he might have done for both of us what the devils the matter i stared at the pale little face so tight and drawn aint you well its all past and done with we never took a scratch ah but youre still shaken its the shock to be sure come here you goose and ill put it right i might have killed him i wanted to kill him she closed her eyes and her voice was almost too faint to hear i would have been damned now ive seen folk take all kinds of fits after a shooting scrape or a battle or a near shave and the shock can be hours in coming on but this was a new one altogether her eyes when she opened them were full of frightened tears staring as though she were in a trance damned she whispered damned eternally they dont usually say that sort of thing until theyre at deaths door and she was as fit as a flea i wondered how to bring her out of it she was too frail to slap petting her hadnt answered and i couldnt very well ravish her in a carriage on broadway so i tried common sense well you didnt kill him and you aint going to be damned so theres no harm done dye see i know well try putting your head between your knees in my heart i murdered him cries she well it didnt do him a pennorth of harm heavens alive you never came near hitting the fellow the will was the deed i would have killed him i who never thought to take life this was too much so i took a stern line oh gammon and greens what about those black wenches of mine at greystones you had them halfkilled twasnt your fault they didnt kick the bucket and you never thought twice about damnation anyway who says theres a hell twaddle if you ask me it seemed to reach her and she stared at me as though i were mad this was a human being cries she if i had killed him she closed her eyes again and began to tremble turning away from me i waited for the waterworks but they didnt come and i saw there was nothing for it but the religious tack now see here annette you didnt kill him and if its the wish to kill thats troubling you well youre a papist aint you so if you tool along to the nearest priest hell set your conscience right in no time i thought of my little leprechaun in baltimore and dear drunken old fennessy of the eighth hussars if hes got half as much sense as the padres i know hell tell you that selfdefence aint murder in the first place and if you want to thank me i added youll do it best by recollecting that in a little while well he seeing black joe and we cant have him wondering why youre looking like marleys ghost i patted her hand so draw breath theres a girl and forget about damnation until you see old father mcgoogle in the morning and get your extreme unction or whatever it is the worst is past and if you play up now well youll be doing your fat swine of a husband a dam bad turn what possibly because of my healing discourse possibly because wed pulled up at the astor house she suddenly snapped her head erect white as a sheet but compos mentis and began to behave normally but mute as i followed her up to our suit and presently down again to the diningroom i found myself wondering if she was quite sane and to this day i aint sure id known her by turns a vicious tyrant a voracious bedmate a superb actress a forlorn child a guntoting secret agent and now of all things a penitent in terror of hellfire because she might have shot a chap but hadnt well as they say in the north country theres nowt so funny as folk but id never have credited annette mandeville with a conscience nursery education no doubt god these governesses have a lot to answer for she said not a word at supper which she attacked with it fine appetite i may say but when we returned to our room and found joe waiting she was quite her old imperious self and talked according he was in a fine excitement thrusting crixuss telegraph message into her hand it was in code and at length but its purport was precisely what everyone from atropos to pinkerton had predicted joe was commended for his zeal in running me down and helping me to see the light not that crixus had ever doubted i would come round in the end even after id lit out for he knew my devotion to the cause and that reflection would guide me to a just and righteous conclusion god bless me a thousand times finally joe was to lose no time in conducting me to concord and our good and trusty champion that the lords will might be accomplished and his banners go forward in freedoms cause amen we got no time to lose says joe all eagerness theys a train leavin fo boston fust thing an youll take a later train and reach boston after dark snaps annette youll stay the night there and keep under cover going on to concord next day and again youll arrive after dark joe would have protested but she shut him up do you think sanborn wants you to be seen entering his house in broad daylight dont you know hes watched by government operators you black dolt they don know us theyll know you even less if they never see you oh why did they entrust this business to a clod like you get out and fetch me a train schedule not now in the morning he could gladly have broken her in two but all he did was mutter that he hadnt seen hermess men about the hotel and did she know where they were she told him curtly to mind his own business and let them mind theirs and he left with a venomous glare but no suspicion ill swear that there was anything amiss her tonguelashing performance had been altogether in her best style so then it was bedtime and since i didnt expect much carnal amusement chez brown i was determined to make the most of it after annettes earlier vapourings i half expected reluctance but she was all for it and if her conscience was still troubling her she kept it on a tight rein addressing heaven only in secular terms when amorous frenzy got the better of her that interested me for her usual form was to gallop in grim silence more astonishing still she was ready to talk afterwards briefly enough at first but little by little at greater length until we were conversing almost civilly whether it was gratitude for having her life saved or i was in prime fettle or shed made her peace with god or was just getting used to me i cant tell but out came annette mandeville her life and times and diverting stuff it was id known already that she came of impoverished bayou aristocracy who had literally sold her aged fifteen to the disgusting redneck mandeville with whom shed been living at greystones when i hove in sight in after my departure mandeville had drunk himself to death leaving a heap of debt and greystones mortgaged black and blue as a personable enough young widow shed had offers aplenty but mandeville had sickened her of marriage if not of men and after a succession of lovers she had decided that a career as a mistress was no great shakes and had determined to try her luck on the stage shed been born with a talent for mimicry and being vicious immoral and vain she had taken to the theatre like a pirate to plunder and it had taken to her in a few years she was playing the principal houses in the states and canada making and spending noney mostly on men then during an engagement in chicago her company had been the victims of a daring robbery and who should be called in when the police had failed but allan pinkerton then making his mark as a private detective he had been impressed by the help shed given in pointing the way to the thieves and identifying them and had remarked that if ever she tired of acting she might do worse than police work it had been lightly said and shed forgotten it the more readily because a new and brilliant prospect had opened before her soon afterwards it was in a comedy at orleans that she had caught the lustful gooseberry eye of charles la force and while the very sight of him had set her shuddering the size of his fortune and the ruthless determination with which hed pursued her had made her think twice about repulsing him hed plied her with priceless gifts haunted the theatre and finally killed her beau of the moment in one of those ghastly knifeandpistol duels which the louisiana gentry favoured in those days stalking each other through the bayous by night after which his offer of marriage with a royal cash settlement had finally conquered her farfrommaiden heart and she had trotted up the aisle with him to her abiding regret for she had soon discovered that beneath his revolting exterior there lurked a monster whose depraved tastes would have had caligula throwing up the window and hollering for the peelers enforced bouts with joe and other menials while the husband of her bosom cheered them on had been the least of it and to make matters worse she had been drawn into the dark affairs of the kuklos but where any other wife would have lit out with whatever she could carry annettes one thought had been to vent her hatred on him and she had been hesitating between poison and a knife in bed when pinkerton had again emerged discreetly upon the scene by now he was undertaking occasional work for washington and had a finger on every pulse in america he had kept her in mind and when she had married atropos he had seen her as an invaluable agent within the kuklos if she could be persuaded she had leapt at the chance and had been betraying atropos happily ever since until the present emergency had caused pinkerton to employ her in more active work and so here we were it was plain from her account that loathing of atropos was the ruling passion of her life and knowing her cold and selfish nature i found that odd granted she was compounded of equal parts of malice and cruelty id still have thought shed have preferred to decamp with his money and pursue her theatrical and amorous careers in france or england rather than devote her existence to doing him despite it didnt seem to weigh with her either that in betraying him she was probably helping to destroy the way of life in which shed been raised the south slavery plantation society and all that gracious magnolia stuff no she was wreaking vengeance on atropos and that was enough for her well im a ready hater myself god knows and take the keenest pleasure in doing the dirty on deserving cases but id never make grudgery my lifes work i reckon you have to like or love something worth while even if its just trollops and beer or if youre lucky cash and credit and fame and elspeth it occurred to me as i put mandeville through her final mounting drill that she wasnt fit to fill my dear ones corset and i felt a great longing for those blue eyes and corngold hair and silky white skin and so forth and for that brilliant simpleton smile of welcome and the witless prattle which would follow at least i had that to look forward to annette mandeville had nothing but her revenge oh aye and her eccentric conscience she was in a vile mood in the morning snapping at me and roasting joe and for the last hour before he and i left to catch the train north she sat in stony silence staring out of the window at the last when joe was putting our valises out in the passage she closed the door quickly on him and turned her pale elfin face to me she was biting her lip and then the tears came and suddenly she was clinging round my neck the tiny body shivering against me have a care she sobbed oh have a care then she kissed me fiercely and ran into the bedroom slamming the door behind her i have only three memories of the trip from new york to concord joes ugly face under his plug hat glowering at me from the opposite seat of a railroad car the creaking bedsprings of the cheap roominghouse in which we stayed in boston and an advertisement poster of a young lady crying oh ma i gave my back the awfullest strain dancing with billy and fond mater replying mustang liniment judiciously applied will ensure certain relief my dear the rest is blank from the closing of annettes door to the opening of sanborns presumably because i was too used up to notice anything they hadnt been idle days exactly and crixus atropos and mandeville had seen to it that my nights werent tranquil either so it was small wonder i was tuckered out i had sense enough though before we reached boston to tie the tranter to my knee beneath the trouser in case the watchful joe decided to search me as i slept a wise move as it turned out for when i woke in the roominghouse my stiletto had disappeared but the tranter was still in place it was joes hammering at sanborns knocker that brought me back to life i think reminding me that it was a case of on stage again with a part to play and no room for missed cues or bungled lines with that black nemesis at my elbow i remember thinking he must have telegraphed ahead for it was sanborn himself who opened the door and greeted us by name on the spot mr comber sir welcome welcome to concord cries he and i saw that the daguerreotype had not lied for he was as intense and poetic as could be with his fluffy whiskers and anxious eyes and this is simmons to be sure abolitionist he might be he still knew a mister from the riffraff he ushered us into a hall stuffed with furniture and smelling of birdseed and sped ahead to close the door of a room from which came the rumbling conversation of worthies with beards and gold watchchains across their weskits you can always tell the quality of unseen company by the noise they make and i was willing to bet that at least half of the secret six were on hand sanborn led us into another room across the hall moving with quick agitated steps captain brown is with us says he in a confidential whisper do you know we are celebrating his birthday today yes indeed he is now in his sixtieth year but gentlemen his frame and spirit are those of a vigorous youth yes indeed although he frowned he has lately been somewhat indisposed a result no doubt of the privations endured on his recent glorious raid of liberation into africa as he calls it yes indeed he rubbed his hands a nervous habit which i realised was always accompanied by his favourite phrase yes indeed he is only now recovering from a malarial ague but he is in good heart i assure you yes indeed i asked if theyd tried quinine powder and he beamed there spoke the man of action the practical man oh mr comber you cannot know how it rejoices me to see you and he absolutely wrung my hand again we have heard so much from our good friend in washington you know who i mean im sure and of the worthy simmons er joe isnt it yes indeed yes joe he was one of your tiptoe babblers i could see smiling fidgeting and suddenly remembering to offer us refreshment with more prattle about the fatigue of travelling and the crowded condition of railroad cars if this is a sample of our abolitionist conspirators i can see american slavery flourishing for a century or two yet thinks i joe i noticed was regarding him like a cannibal inspecting an undernourished missionary he gave us a toddy apiece promised there would he supper anon muttered about seeing if captain brown was still occupied and was away like a shot leaving the door ajar we sipped our toddies in silence inspecting the antimacassars and potted plants and presently i was aware of a childs voice in the hall asking please sir may i have your signature i glanced out and there was a lad of about eight holding up a paper and pencil to a man who had just come out of the other room with sanborn at his shoulder i had a glimpse of a fine shock of hair and a full beard both grizzled and then he was speaking to the lad whats this my boy says he not an order to pay the bearer i hope oh no sir squeaks the kid i want to pay you if youll take my pocket money as a trade for your name its but six bits he added digging out his coin an its all i have but pa says every cent is blessed that goes to the good cause a practised toad this one with a soapy smile and his hair slicked down the widows mite says the bearded man to sanborn and laid his hand on the infants head bless you my boy he pocketed the six bits and scribbled his name young stearns has started quite a fashion cries sanborn yes indeed there now says he as the child took the paper fawning you have a name that will live down the ages and for only six bits too id already guessed who the owner of the beard was and as he stepped into the room i was sure of it from all id heard in the past three days id formed a picture of john brown as a towering figure with flowing white locks glaring like a fakir and brandishing an excelsior banner in one fist and a smoking colt in tother what i saw was an elderly man spare and bony in an old black suit like a rather seedy farmer come to town for market he had a long aquiline nose large ears and deepset eyes under heavy brows an imposing enough old file youd have said but nothing out of the ordinary until you met the gaze of those eyes clear bright grey and steady as a rock gunfighters eyes was my first thought but they werent cold you knew they could blaze or twinkle but what i remember most was their level certainty no one was ever going to make this man drop his gaze or talk him out of anything he came forward with a measured step holding himself erect and took my hand in both of his his grip was rough and strong and he spoke slowly in a deep rather harsh voice mr beauchamp comber says he pronounced it bochamp he gave joe the same handclasp mr joseph simmons welcome gentlemen i realised that he wasnt as tall as he looked a little over middle height my good friend crixus tells me that you are an englishman mr comber and that by joining us you risk being in disfavour with your own government have no fear of that sir i pledge my word not to reveal your presence among us by speech or writing and my friends he glanced at sanborn pledge themselves also that goes for you too mr simmons he nodded at joe indeed the names of comber and simmons are forgotten from this moment crixus refers to you sir as joshua thats good enough for me joshua and joe it shall be henceforth he seemed pleased with that and it must have been his patriarchal manner that called to my mind the verse about god seeing every thing that he had made and behold it was very good joshua and joe he repeated solemnly and took hold of our hands again one in each of his and looked from one to the other of us nodding like an approving bishop and knew upon instinct that here was one who in his own modest way was as big a humbug as i am myself only on later acquaintance did i come to realise that again like me he knew it dont mistake me im not saying he was a hypocrite or a sham because he wasnt god help him he was a sincere worthy autocratic goodnatured terrible dangerous old zealot hard as nails ironwilled brave beyond belief and possessed of all the muscular christian virtues which i cant stand he was a humbug only in the public performance he put on for his supporters back east playing the part of john brown the worthy simple son of the soil with greatness in him the homespun hero whose serenity was all the more impressive because it was so at odds with the berserk savagery of his reputation on the wild frontier it was a performance which he thoroughly enjoyed and for which he was naturally equipped with his deliberate manner calm searching eyes strong handshake and quiet tolerant humour oh it was worth paying money to see him lay it on that i found wholly admirable for i couldnt have done it better myself and im an expert at being lionhunted in his own backwoods way he had great style and odd though it may seem in one whose historical image is that of the ironside fanatic he also had considerable charm anyway for all his virtues he was a bloody hard man to dislike i didnt sum all this up in a minute of course but i got the first whiff of it and having both style and charm myself and being a born crawler to boot i responded to his welcome as befitted a bluff honest british crusader thankee captain brown says i guessing that my use of the title would flatter him sick proud to be with you at last and honoured to be accepted they tell me sir that its your birthday warmest congratulations and many of em now i hope you wont take it amiss i continued heartily if i offer a small gift to mark the occasion id not dream of doing it if i didnt know that you wont keep it for yourself but will apply it to the great cause were all privileged to serve i hauled out messervys fifty dollars and handed them over its all i have on me im afraid but well i cant do less than that manly little chap i saw out in the hall just now can i what so manyhappy returns skipper shocking bad form youll agree but this was america and id weighed my man he snapped it up like a trout taking a fly looking moved and furrowed and told me with another handclasp that i had bought shares in freedom and hed not forget it i didnt grudge the fifty bucks that was my sturdy openhanded character established and id be living at his charges for several weeks anyway then in case anyone thought he was neglecting the nigger he turned to joe and told him that his presence there as a coloured man eager to fight for the liberty of his oppressed brethren was a birthday present in itself and one whose value couldnt be reckoned in money he asked joe where he came from and when joe said he was an escaped slave who had worked for crixus on the railroad and that his family were still on a southern plantation brown gripped him again and put a hand on his shoulder swearing that he wouldnt rest until that unhappy family had been plucked from the teeth of the wicked whose jaws would be broken he got quite warm about it and for the first time i saw that gleam beneath his brows and heard the rasp in his voice which somebody described as being like a volcano disguised by an ordinary chimney flue joe didnt know what to make of it but looked confused and when brown let go his hand i saw him wince as he worked his fingers sanborn who had been listening in rapture took joe out and brown settled his coat and begged me to be seated so that we might talk he pulled up a chair cjose in front of me put his big gnarled hands on his knees looked me over carefully and then said well now friend joshua tell me who you are and what you know and what you have done or one horrid instant i thought hed found out about me that i was flashy and the yankee secret service and all the rest and then i saw it was just his manner of speech with that grave look that stern pedagogues give to naughty children to convince em that lyings useless what he was after was combers story and to inspect me so i described my life in the royal navy and how id spied on the slavers and run into crixus and brought george randolph north he lit up at that calling it the bravest stroke hed ever heard of so i embellished combers reeord with my own service with that maniac brooke against the borneo pirates he asked if they held slaves in borneo and i said droves of them and that was why id been there in the first place to turn the poor buggers loose and proclaim liberty throughout the land or words to that effect he drank it in with stern approval saying i surely had fine experience of irregular warfare he mentioned toussaint and spartacus and asked if id studied wellingtons campaign in the peninsula and the ways of the spanish guerrillas who were much in my mind when i surveyed the field of waterloo pondering how the great captain would have gone about the task of liberating our black brethren held in cruel bondage by evil laws knowing the late duke nosey i could have said that hed certainly not have put pikes in their fists and told em to take to the hills but thought it better to express toady interest in his visit to waterloo he said it had been during a tour hed made to study european fortifications so that he could acquire the knowledge necessary if he was to build strongholds in the alleghenies for revolting darkies i nodded solemn agreement reflecting that messervy had been quite wrong this fellow wasnt only mad he was raving in a quiet sort of way alas he hadnt been able to pursue his military studies at any length since his time had been taken up with selling wool in london where hed won a bronze medal for his wares and here he pulled it from his pocket chuckling that it had been some setdown for the smart londoners a poor rustic yankee winning their prize he became quite jolly in his recollection and went into a long story of how some english woolmerchants had tried to take a rise out of him by asking him to feel a sample and give an opinion say though they were out to hoax me why it wasnt wool at all no sir it was hair from a poodlehound with which they hoped to take me in so i teased it and pulled it mighty solemn and told them if they had machinery for working up doghair it might do very well that took em aback i can tell you yes sir they had to admit they couldnt pull the wool over my eyes they were cheery men though and meant it all in fun so we had no hard feelings poodle hair can you imagine that its how i see him still laughing deep in his throat slapping his thigh the great beard shaking and his eyes dancing with merriment old ossawatomie who sabred five unarmed men to death in cold blood and blew hell out of harpers ferry he got back to business after that saying soberly that i mustnt think he would harbour any feeling against me as an englishman because of the shabby way hed been served by my fellowcountryman forbes i blame myself for trusting him says he rather than him for his betrayal his heart was not in the work as yours is and he was distracted by the plight of his wife and little ones in france wanting bread and a place to lay their heads if he betrayed me well we must not judge him too hardly dreadnought comber wasnt having that i cried out in disgust that i couldnt credit chaps like forbes it was too bad and didnt bear thinking about the bounder was a disgrace to the queens coat and ought to be drummed out brown leaned forward and laid a forbearing hand on my sleeve youre timber from a different tree joshua you are what crixus said you would be and your story aye and what i see before me speak for you believe that old lad and well get on famously but now tell me he tightened his grip on my arm crixus has told you what purpose and the disappointments and delays i have suffered and my resolve that this time there shall be no turning back from the gates of gaza the grim bearded face was so close now that i could see my reflection in his eyes which is a sight nearer to john brown than youd want to get can you show me how best this great thing can be done it was more than id expected and my heart jumped you mean how to take harpers ferry his lids came down like hoods thats a name best left unspoken just now tell that to the rest of north america thinks i in this house at least but yes that is the goal when july the fourth what better day to found the new united states oh absolutely less than two months away ill have to study it i must know what force what arms you have what you mean to do afterwards you see captain says i soberly given preparation any fool can take a place holding its another story and using it that is all determined cries he glowing then ive a question ask away my boy very good says i all business am i to carry out your orders without question or will you look to me for advice he threw his head back frowning and i knew i must follow up at once im a man of war captain brown its my trade but i practise it against only one enemy slavery did you know says that william wilberforce was my uncle oh it dont matter i only tell you so that you may understand the the force within me i was the one leaning forward now going red in the face with holy zeal and just a touch of the fanatical stare i am with you because you are libertys champion in america it all rests on you whether the oppressed black people of this land are brought forth into the light or languish in bondage you must not fail i gave him my grim doordie smile ill not have you fail when we strike it must be a sure shattering blow not a pinprick not a hasty foray which miscarries for want of planning but the breach in the dyke through which the flood of freedom will surge to sweep away the foul growth of slavery forever its listening to folk like crixus that does it you know they supply the words and im the boy who can carry the tune i was out to convince brown that i was as crazy as he was and that if i found fault with his plans it wouldnt be from halfheartedness or lack of abolitionist frenzy i was the seasoned professional you understand but with the fire in my belly having let him feel the heat i collected myself again with an apologetic shrug i beg your pardon sir im presumptuous and to you of all people but you see i must be sure of victory oh not for myself but for those thousands of poor black souls crying out for deliverance ringing stuff and he took it like a man mangling my fingers again we shall win that victory cries he and well win it with your good counsel be sure of that why moses hearkened to his joshua didnt he he chuckled and clapped me on the shoulder saying id turned his hope to certainty and now it was time for me to meet our friends good men one and all bound to the cause but not men of action says he with a sigh still we depend upon them and it will put heart into them to see you take the oath this it turned out was a rigmarole which joe and i had to repeat before the company in the other room a motley bourgeois crew of about a dozen male and female among them were three of the secret six sanborn a truly enormous beard which went by the name of stearns and dr howe a keenlooking citizen who had in tow the only passable female present a spanking little redhead with a sharp eye they were affability itself but i guessed they were wary of me and joe possibly because we looked fit for spoils and stratagems they beamed approval when brown bade us raise our hands and swear to fight slavery with all our might and keep secret all our transactions but while the women clapped and murmured amen i wondered if one or two of the men were altogether easy about witnessing the men j blood getting their baptism so to speak played strong and silent and joe of course didnt say a word but it didnt matter for the purpose of the gathering was to pledge money which apparently theyd already done and thereafter to admire brown to the accompaniment of coffee and sandwiches sanborn took the lead by reading a press report by one artemus ward of a meeting which brown had addressed in cleveland some weeks earlier after his triumphant return from the missouri raid in which hed snatched eleven niggers and various horses listen to this will you cries sanborn adjusting his glasses a man of pluck is brown you may bet on that he must be rising sixty and yet we believe he could lick a yard full of wild cats without taking off his coat turn him into a ring with nine border ruffians four bears six injuns and a brace of bull pups and we opine that the eagles of victory would perch on his banner loud laughter and applause and sanborn cries he writes further that captain brown is refreshingly cool and could make his jolly fortune by letting himself out as an icecream freezer delighted cries from the ladies while brown stood gravely regarding the carpet what dyou say to that captain he has one thing right says brown drily im rising sixty at this they all cried no no ward had hit it dead on and clustered round him filling his cup and offering sugar cookies he took it all pretty cool with that stern modesty thats worth any amount of brag one shrill old sow in a lace cap said she had been told that at that same meeting captain brown had said that the only way to treat border ruffians was as though they were fencestakes and whatever had he meant by that brown looked down at her stroking his beard and asked what did she suppose people did to fencestakes why they strike them i suppose says the beldam just so maam says brown you drive em into the ground so that they become permanent settlers she cried oh my and fanned herself while the other women tittered sanborn said yes indeed and the men chortled that it was the only way one said he had much admired captain browns reply to a heckler who had accused him of stealing horses and looting the property of proslavery people brown had answered that since the proslavers had started the war in kansas it was only right that they should defray its expenses but even better cries a small snirp with a cowlick and glasses was your hit at the expense of the wiseacre who questioned your right to sell horses taken from missouri he beamed at brown do tell the company captain what you retorted he nudged his female companion listen sally twas the neatest thing why says jb very serious i believe i told him they were not missouri horses but abolitionist horses since i had converted them this had them in fits while i watched with approval for knew this game of old having played it myself a hundred times in the days when i was being heroworshipped its almost a ritual they flatter you by praising your words or actions and you play it easy and modest but just giving a hint every now and then in a humorous way what a desperate fellow you are because thats what they love above all we had a prime example of it that night when a young fellow came in with the news that one governor stewart was expected in boston soon at which there was a sensation lor this stewart was the man whod put a price of on browns head in missouri the women squealed and the men looked anxious brown standing by the fireplace asked the young chap whose name was anderson if it was stewarts intention to set the us marshal after him and were the reward posters up in boston you bet capn says anderson who was a jaunty bantam but i reckon you may stand under em and the marshal wont trouble you indeed hed better not cries howe massachusetts wont stand for any missouri warrants being served here i think massachusetts need feel no alarm says brown there were posters in cleveland and i stood under those an made myself conspicuous outside the marshals office down the street but he chose to ignore my presence i cant think why he was resting an arm on the mantelpiece and now he turned so that his coat fell open to reveal an enormous colt strapped to his hip i guess it was just civility on his part in case id feel embarrassed there was a great whoop of laughter and arch glances at the pistol while they nudged each other and agreed that it would have been real embarrassing for the marshal haha the old biddy in the lace cap said it was monstrous thatsouthern reward posters should be permitted in a northern city and what would happen if the marshal and his government hounds should try to arrest captain brown why they might have the gall to try it in one of our very own houses if they do maam says brown we shall bar the door against them i should hate to spoil your carpet that seemed to set them in the mood for a few bloodthirsty hymns with sanborn thrashing the harmonium one was about a small weak band going forth to conquer strong in their captains strength which was sung with approving smiles in our direction and a scrawny female had the impudence to press my hand in encouragement if shed been worth it id have arranged a prayer meeting with her later for theres nothing like religious fervour to put em in trim you know i gave her my brave wistful smile instead and devoted my energies to who would true valour see which concluded the soiree with brown in great voice eyes shining and beard at the charge as he roared defiance at the hobgoblins and foul fiends when the guests had gone sanborn gave us a slapup supper in his kitchen during which brown made a point of engaging joe in talk plainly to make him feel at home and an equal member of the band which was ironic in its way since joe was a sight better educated than brown or as it turned out any of his other followers he took care not to show it though which wasnt difficult since brown prosed on at length telling him that when theyd been in chicago and a hotel had refused to take the coloured people who were along with him brown and his gang had trooped out en masse and hadnt rested until theyd found a place where there was no colour bar it amused me to see joe trying to look impressed by this earnest recital but i didnt overhear much more for young anderson who was seated next to me had that curious american compulsion to tell you his lifestory as well as his views on everything under the sun he was an engaging lad freshfaced and full of beans with a colt in his armpit and that restless eye that you develop from years of learning not to sit down with your back to the door he called me josh right away told me he was jerry that hed fought on the kansas frontier as lieutenant of an irregular troop of free soilers skirmished with the us cavalry been jailed by proslavers ridden on the recent missouri raid and thought brown was the next best thing to god he was one of your trueblue hellfire abolitionists and itching to prove it its this way josh confides he solemnly i reckon this fight is more mine than most folks cos my family held slaves once till my daddy came up north so i figure i have to wipe the slate clean dont you see maybe you cant understand that bein canadian oh sure grins he winking i guessed that straight off from your accent but i feel it in my heart dont ye know i just wish i could make everyone feel that way why those poor black folk are cryin out for help down yonder but does anybody listen oh i know theres lots o good people like we seen tonight whod wish slavery away tomorrow an they talk an tend meetins an take up collections but they dont do anythin he had dropped his voice so that sanborn didnt hear now lie gritted his teeth well theres a few of us ready to do an dare people like you an me an well be enough youll see yes sir when capn brown gives the word well shake this land of liberty and equality clear to its centre i hope the rest of the gang are your sort my son thinks young and full of ideals and without a brain among you when it comes to sober planning the last thing i wanted was older and wiser heads competing with me for browns ear fortunately the old man seemed to have taken to me he wrung my hand fiercely at parting he and jerry were staying at a hotel in concord but joe and i were to bed down in sanborns attic and assured me that as soon as hed finished his work in boston the two of us would start to plan the campaign as he called it joe pricked up his ears at that and as soon as he and i were alone under the eaves where mattresses had been provided he rounded on me what did brown say to you befo when you was alone well joe i dont know that thats any of your concern says just to provoke him but before he could do more than glare i went on if you must know he wants to be in harpers ferry by the fourth of july there now does that satisfy you le came swiftly stooping under the beams and squatted down by me whispering fourth july you reckon the others know them as was heah tonight i doubt it i dont think they want to he nodded he was quite smart enough to guess that sanborn and his friends were scared of the whole business he say how many men hes got how hes gonna do it no hes waiting for me to show him thats bound to take time and i dont know how long itll take to assemble his men or how many he can count on or what arms hes got or what money i dont know if he can be ready in just two months listen his ugly black face was thrust into mine whispering furiously you better see hes ready you heah me an you now you listen i hissed as loud as i dared giving him back glare for glare the sooner we have this straight the better im being paid five thousand dollars to see that this damned farmer takes harpers ferry and no blundering black fool is going to queer my pitch i know how to do it you dont if it takes me all summer to make it sure thats my affair im his lieutenant not you and the farther you stay clear of me the safer well both be dye think you can prowl at my elbow looking like my bloody keeper dye want to make em suspicious of us i sat back sneering how long dye think wed last if they guessed you were a kuklos spy why we before i knew it i was staring into the muzzle of a cocked revolver his eyes rolling with rage behind it the day they guess that mistuh comber hisses he yo gone an case you think you kin get up to any shines with me jes remembah i aint the only one watchin you so now i forced myself to look unmoved down his barrel with my bowels doing the polka by god he was a quick hand with a barker and then to fetch an elaborate sigh as i stretched out on my mattress youre a fool joe you dont understand me at all do you why if id wanted to split on you i could have done it when i was alone with brown couldnt i but i didnt because ive got five thousand good reasons and when i make a deal i keep to it now go to sleep and in the morning do try to remember that youre not my watchdog but a grateful darkie abolitionist whos fairly sweating to set his brethren free give em a chorus of doodahday why dont you he stood looming over me for a long moment then stirred his hand and the pistol had vanished he turned on his heel and went without a word to his mattress but not to sleep with a tranquil mind as i became aware in the small hours when i woke discovered that there wasnt a pisspot to be had descended the attic ladder to a window where i relieved myself into the night and turned to find him within a yard of me pistol in hand and glowering as though hed just escaped from sinbads bottle it gave me a horrid scare but got my own back by offering to hold the pistol and keep a lookout while he took his turn at blighting sanborns geraniums he wouldnt though and when i dropped off to sleep again i guessed he was still brooding watchfully wondering what to make of me no doubt in fact i didnt sleep that long there was too much to think about and this was the first real leisure id had to do it brown was an odd case id expected a brimstonebreathing fanatic and instead id met a steady pretty decent but plainly determined old man with an admirable gift for modest showing off there was no doubt that he was fixed in his resolve hed invade virginia if it was the last thing he did which it probably would be if he ever got round to it but that was out of the question for the simplest of reasons he didnt have the brains for it he was a slow thinker if ever saw one and a dreamer messervy was right i doubted if he could have directed a nursery tea rampaging into missouri and grabbing the first niggers and horses he saw was his mark but planning a military raid no i couldnt credit it that aside where were his men scattered visiting supporters raising funds working at odd jobs or just loafing from what anderson had told me and id heard about money and weapons well id believe them when saw them as i lay there staring up at sanborns skylight my thoughts kept jumping between hope and dread one moment i felt my confidence growing that i could keep brown busy planning and dreaming and getting nowhere for as long as need be and then doubts would creep in and id have to tell myself fiercely that i was in the business now and no turning back id been a helpless cork borne on the tide until my meeting with seward then id had a plain choice and made it and while it had landed me in this ridiculous galley it had been the right one and it was too late to run now anyway with this black gunslick watching my every move i was too hot and clammy to go back to sleep now its wonderful how fears can sprout in the dark when youre as naturally windy as i am as i writhed fretfully on the lumpy mattress it struck me as damned sinister that messervy hadnt arranged some means whereby i could get a message to him why i could have let him know that harpers ferry was the certain target and he could have had the marines deployed around the place and word of that would surely have reached brown and caused him to give up the business altogether my god was it possible that messervy and his superiors whoever they were absolutely wanted brown to raid the ferry for some ghastly political reason which i didnt understand never in that case why the hell were they employing me to stop him well flashy you fool to kill him for taking six bits off that infant for it was plain as print that lincoln and palmerston were in the thing too and it was all a devilish plot to make the queen withhold my knighthood as she certainly would do once seward had told prince albert that id pissed in charity springs flowerbed at which point i awoke with a wordless cry lathered in cold sweat to discover that it was growing light and that i was in bursting need of another visit to the window below so i rolled out cursing and clambered miserably down the ladder again and blow me if simmons didnt follow me every step of the way theres a photograph which may still be kicking about somewhere showing john brown enthroned in an armchair with joe seated scowling alongside him while jerry anderson and your correspondent stand behind wearing expressions of ruptured nobility each of us resting a comradely hand on joes shoulders although as jerry observed from the look on joes face you would think we were trying to hold him down the reason for the picture was that brown wanted a new hat and in those days daguerreotypers used to dispense free headgear to their sitters with a miniature copy of the plate attached to the inside lining the hat was rubbish but brown reckoned it was a saving he had no more money sense than my beloved eispeth and was always short and its my belief that we only had our likenesses took so that he could sit there hooking like elijah with his faithful followers about him the darkie being given the other chair to show that all men are equal in the sight of god and daguerreotypers it was posed in new york in that strange month of may which i still look back on with wonder id been harried halfway round the world through the strangest series of chances and now after one of the most topsyturvy weeks of my life i found myself loafing about in the wake of an eccentric revolutionary with nothing to do but wait to see what might happen next most odd and my recollection of it is fairly incoherent with one or two episodes standing out in relief this time you see was the last tranquil twilight in the remarkable career of john brown of ossawatomie when he was saying his farewells to his eastern friends scrounging his final subscriptions and preparing for the great day which probably he alone believed was coming at last it was a sort of royal progress in which he addressed meetings shook hands with legions of admirers and stoked up the support which he hoped would burst into a great northern crusade once hed lit the fire in dixie it took us from boston to new york and various places around and since id decided that my own eventual profit and present safety would be best served by going along quietly i used the time to study the man and take the measure of his prospects an encouraging sign was that his health was none too good he complained of what he called ague and i had hopes that hed be in no shape to start a war that summer but he was a tough old bird and wouldnt pamper himself he was a great one for spartan living and at one place we stayed the maid of the house found him at daybreak fast asleep on the front steps she made the mistake of shaking him and found a colt presented at her head even up here surrounded by a friendly population he never went unarmed usually with jerry as bodyguard an office which gradually passed to me for jerry dressed like an outofwork scarecrow and didnt fit too well in the boston hotels or the halls where jb harangued the faithful messervy was proved right he wasnt a good speaker but he had a presence and the mere sight of that covenanter figurehead with its flashing eyes and rasping voice was enough to set them stamping and rummaging in their purses his message was plain talk was futile it was time for action and sure enough some oratorical gesture would give them a glimpse of the gunbutt under his coat once or twice he waxed philosophical and came adrift i remember him pouring scorn on those who felt that their strength lay in the greatness of their wrongs and so neglected action his point was that the negro had the greatest wrongs of all and a fat lot of strength that gave him you could see the folk wondering what he was talking about and fidgeting but when he came out thundering that whoever took up arms to defend slavery had a perfect right to be shot they raised the roof ringing phrases about striking off the shackles and troubling israel and hell being stirred from beneath were received with wild applause but what moved them to wrath and tears were his accounts of blood and battle in kansas and his promise of more to come it was after one of these addresses when they were crowding round to bless him and shake his hand that i heard someone say that his speech had been like that of cromwell compared to an ordinary king that delighted him cromwell was one of his heroes and people were forever likening him to the old warthog when he wasnt speechifying or paying calls he was writing letters to all and sundry one i remember him composing at the us hotel in boston reading it aloud with particular care because it was to his fiveyearold daughter i looked it up in his biography the other day hoping to edify my own grandlings who need all the morality they can get it will give you some notion of his style my dear daughter ellen i will send you a short letter i want very much to have you grow good every day to have you learn to mind your mother very quick sit very still at the table to mind what all older persons say to you that is right i hope to see you soon again and if i should bring some little thing that will please you it would not be very strange i want you to be uncommon goodnatured god bless you my child your affectionate father john brown couldnt punctuate worth a dam you see and used to say he knew no more of grammar than the farmers calves but there aint a man of letters in my time who could have put it better my grandbrats received it in polite silence and then john said we what was she to do when an older person said something wrong jemima asked if ellen was pretty alice wanted to know what the promised little thing was and augustus belched god help miss prentice say the rest of his time he spent in talk and since i was a new listener i had to endure a good deal of his prosing in those first weeks silly crackerbarrel stuff mostly although he had a curious store of halflearned knowledge bunyan was a favourite and he was well up on napoleon and caesar and assorted military history he was thirsty for anything that might be of use in fighting slavery but had no time for soldiers or soldiering and had gone to all lengths to avoid service in his youth the notion of drilling and training to kill being anathema until the abolitionist bug had bitten and hed found an enemy to hate and when he got onto the subject of his first encounters with slavery look out a change would come over him and from talking in his usual opinionated style he would go into a sort of brooding study staring ahead and growling as though a steamkettle was coming to the boil inside him it was an unnerving sight i can tell you and i shant forget the first time i saw it one evening when we were seated alone on some front porch or other i was twelve years old says he gritting his teeth and had druv some cattle a long way to the house of a gentleman with whom i had to stay for a spell he was a good man kindly and feared god and made a great pet of me and showed me off to his folks saying what a smart brave little chap i was to come a hundred miles alone well that was fine but you know he had a young black slave boy just my age and bright as a brass button and i tell you the way he tret that child would ha broke your heart oh it was the best vittles for me and a seat at table nearest the fire but for that little coloured lad why he barely fed him but scraps and beat him like a dog with a stick or a shovel or any old thing at hand he didnt have pity on him at all he choked on that and sat with his great hands working on his knees when he turned on me there were tears in the blazing eyes and his voice was hoarse as though he were on the brink of a seizure that was the moment when i first understood how the man who wrote that letter to his daughter could also be the man whod massacred the proslavers at pottawatomie he was a man possessed no other word for it i didnt see how god could let such things be cries he or could put such fell cruelty into the heart of that good kindly man why he was a us marshal yes he was he heard my prayers at night and gave me a spinning top the first i ever had i asked him if god was my father wasnt he father to the little black boy too and he told me not to trouble my head about such things not to trouble ft wasnt canny those eyes and the huge hawk nose and heaving beard all directed at me as though i was the bloody us marshal he seemed to be inviting comment but all i could think to say was that it was pretty rotten and had the fellow been tight perhaps he didnt seem to hear me luckily so i let it be and after a while he sighed and launched into a tale about a runaway nigger whom hed hidden from the slavecatchers a few years later the darkie had crawled into a wood and wben the alarm was over hed gone to look for him can you guess how i found him says he and the fit seemed to have passed for while he gripped my arm in his talons he spoke quite calmly he was lying deep in the bushes in terror of his life and i located him by the sound of his heart beating yes and its a sound that has stayed in my ears these many years that awful drumming of a human heart in agony and fear well i didnt believe it for a minute if a beating heart could give you away when youre cowering in cover id have been dead meat before i was twenty but i said that was an astonishing thing the poor chap must have been in a dreadful funk but hed got over it had he i vowed in that moment that i would never rest until the last slave had been set free says he solemnly i said hear hear and he asked me what had been my moment of revelation since i hadnt had one i had to choose at random and said it had been when id first watched blacks being packed aboard on the dahomey coast bucks to starboard wenches to port with the shapeliest females nearest the hatches for convenience but i didnt mention that he shook his head and murmured something about the waters of babylon but a moment later he was telling me about a dinner to which hed been bidden the next night and would i care to accompany him and when he bade me goodnight he was absolutely cheerful again it left me quite shaken though for a moment hed looked as though he was ready to foam at the mouth and i concluded that if he wasnt barmy as messervy claimed there was still a screw loose somewhere mostly though he was as calm and measured as you could wish going about his business of paying calls and spouting claptrap writing letters gassing to joe and jerry and me but never a word of substance about the great stroke we were meant to be preparing no talk of planning or gathering men and arms or any of the work that should have been going ahead of one thing i became surer by the day if he was bent on taking harpers ferry it wouldnt be by the fourth of july reflecting on that it seemed a pity that id no way of conveying the glad news to messervy and then by a sheer fluke i was presented with the perfect opportunity i mentioned a moment ago a dinner to which jb had invited me it was at one of the big boston hotels full of quality and local bigwigs and the two of us were guests of dr howe wed barely stepped into the lobby when he cried to jb that here was someone he must meet and who should it be but the podgy senator whod tried to dragoon me into this business in the first place and whom id last seen outside sewards cabin we bore up short at the sight of each other but he kept his countenance paying me no heed beyond the usual courtesies of presentation and fixing on jb who seemed to know who he was but took no joy of the knowledge for he drew himself up tall looked down his nose and says pretty cool i have heard senator that you dont approve of my course of action i could have told him that our fat friend wasnt the sort to take any damnyoumelad airs he stuck out his jowls and came straight back if you refer to your recent rash foray into missouri no sir i do not jbs beard went up a couple of notches indeed sir my friends tell me also that you have spoken in condemnation of it that i have snaps the senator i regard every illegal act as doing very great injury to the antislavery cause freeing slaves injures the cause is that so growls jb and the senator started to swell and go crimson let me tell you sir says he it was an imprudence that might have cost countless lives there was a time sir not long ago when such a thing might have led to the invasion of kansas by by a great number of excited people sir jb made a rumbling noise his hand twitched at his coat and for an awful second i thought he was going for his gun but he just hooked his thumbs into his weskit well i think differently sir says he i acted right and it will have a good influence youll see goodnight to you senator goodnight to you mr john brown cries the senator and they bowed and stalked off opposite ways leaving me wondering how i might seize this unexpected chance i darent go after the senator but within ten seconds i was in the deserted lavatory scribbling frantically tell messervy harpers ferry for certain july i darent go out for a waiter not knowing who might be spying on me so sent the black attendant to fetch one he brought another darkie in a liveried coat on whom i pressed the note telling him to deliver it to the fat ugly senator with the yellow flower in his buttonhole and he cried sho nuff suh and bowled off chortling but whether the note ever reached the senator i never found out if it did he must have ignored it or else messervy did and you may make of that what you will anyway id done my best it was in early june that i started to earn my corn as a military adviser when jb took me into connecticut to see the pikes which hed commissioned two years earlier he was full of misunderstood nonsense about swiss infantry and greek phalanxes and scottish schiltrouns and plainly had visions of niggers forming squares to repulse cavalry charges i couldnt believe my eyes when the blacksmith hauled out half a dozen which hed got up as samples amazing instruments six feet long with bowie blades clamped to their ends but asked my opinion i said they were capital weapons the more money jb spent on trash the less hed have for serious equipment he ordered a thousand on the spot and the smith said admiringly that he hadnt realised that richard the lionheart was operating in kansas but a thousand would cost and he couldnt deliver until august farewell july th thinks i this is splendid jb was well pleased though you could see he was itching to fight bannockburn oer again in the blue ridge mountains a few days after this we said adieu to new england jb going north to visit his family while jerry joe and i were packed off to ohio to join two of his sons who were supposed to be recruiting in that state they were the first of his celebrated brood that id met and i found them vastly reassuring owen brown jbs righthand man was big tough genial and fatheaded and john junior the oldest son was a poor critter in low spirits plainly bound for bedlam like all the brown boys they were strapping finelooking fellows but youd not have trusted either of them to light the fire owen would have made a fairish corporal given no work more taxing than lifting heavy weights and advancing into the cannons mouth but junior had always been slightly wanting jerry told me and the kansas fighting had sent him off the rails altogether hed never got over his fathers butchery at pottawatomie and soon after had fallen into the hands of border ruffians who had chained him and flogged him sixty miles over hard going which had reduced him to raving idiocy he was better now jerry opined but jb would never have him in the field again so hed been made quartermaster and chief of recruiting at which he was making no headway at all if these two are a fair sample thinks i well have a quiet summer of it but there was a third man in ohio whom i didnt meet until jb returned from up north and as soon as i shook his hand and met his eye i scented two qualities we could have done without brains and bravery he was a switzer though americanborn named kagi and he was to prove to be the only man in browns conspiracy who knew what he was about he was in his middle twenties dapper sharp wellread and keen and if there had been half a dozen like him well american history books might have a chapter today about the great virginia slave uprising hed been a teacher and had fought in kansas where hed distinguished himself by shooting a judge who in turn had put three slugs into kagi which gives you some notion of what life at the american bar was like in those days my gideon says jb in high good humour putting one hand on kagis shoulder and the other on mine and my joshua who together shall be a scourge of midian yea and of canaan and from kagis quick cool smile i knew that this smart cleanshaven youngster was itching to steer his chief into action he lost no time in drawing me aside and showing me a map of harpers ferry and asking if i had formed any plan for taking it and for the campaign that must follow i said j b hadnt asked for one yet but as i understood it taking the place was the least of it youre right says he briskly and tapped the map see here armoury rifle works arsenal all within a halfmile no troops on guard only watchmen i know the place well twill be easy as pie given the men the arms and secrecy says i and decided to impress him then strip the arsenal and armoury have wagons and mules to carry the stuff to a prearranged rendezvous in the hills food bedding clothes and boots for the slaves when they come in despatch scouts to watch for the nearest militia companies and bring word of their movements cut the wires blow the railroads paused for breath but that of course is just for a beginning id expected his face to fall but he was beaming thank god cries he a man who knows his business if i didnt i wouldnt be here says i the grim professional then i grinned to show him i was human see here though john henry isnt it aye well answer me this john these slaves jb is counting on to run away and join us how many how soon how does he intend to bring em in to us were going to need em quick but they mustnt know too soon that were coming or the whole south will know it too then theyll have to be fed clothed armed and trained i can plan for all of that given the assurance of men and equipment but getting em moving in the first place thats the key to this whole affair my boy thats where we stand or fall dye know it was only while i was talking that the sheer lunatic impossibility of the whole ridiculous business rose up and hit me a facer for the first time you see until now i hadnt thought beyond jbs intended capture of harpers ferry why should i when i didnt believe it would ever happen but now in showing off for this bright spark i found myself considering the sequel a slave uprising followed by a guerrilla campaign and when i did i wanted to burst out laughing to put it plainly jb was hoping that thousands of slaves would rise up spontaneously which seemed unlikely and suppose they did how in gods name did he hope to feed clothe equip house doctor and train the poor buggers probably the worst raw material on earth to fight the american army jb of course had the answer the lord would provide kagi being blessed with common sense could see that the lord would need considerable help but being an optimistic disciple of jb and no soldier he probably hoped that all would come right on the night after all this brilliant fellow comber was taking the thing seriously so it must be feasible i knew it wasnt not for the duke himself let alone these rustic dungslingers but it wasnt for me to say so my task must be to let the impossibles appear slowly but surely until kagi saw the thing was hopeless it would take time and delicate handling but from the respect that jb showed him i realised that he was the one to convince if kagi cried quits that would be the end of it i found myself revising my view of him far from being a dangerous nuisance he should be a godsend who unwittingly would help me to kill jbs plan stone dead i didnt know then how reckless a canny swiss can be when he hears the bugles to my question about stirring up the slaves he frowned and said we had a man in harpers ferry already who was looking into it i asked him about arms and he showed me the cases of carbines which the brown brothers had hidden in a warehouse under a pile of coffins they were good weapons but i doubted whether there would ever be men to use them junior was in despair because the fellows whod been ready to march the year before werent turning up as expected left to him the whole scheme would have been abandoned but he darent say so for fear of the old man and when kagi reminded him that there were hosts of free niggers up in canada just waiting to answer the call he pretended to perk up saying hed see to them when hed collected all the weapons and shipped them down closer to the border it was the unlikeliest beginning to a desperate venture that i can remember in a lifetime of lost causes i think of doddering old elphy bey before the kabul retreat changing his mind by the minute custer twitching and unshaven in his tent on the rosebud determined to have his way raglan imperturbable in his refusal to admit that he didnt know what the devil he was doing wheeler grey with fatigue and old age tying his britches up with string as he prepared to surrender at cawnpore each going to hell in his own way torn between hope and despair but at least they understood warfare and had good advisers about them jb didnt have the understanding or the men and for all his iron purpose he was no james brooke or fred ward or charlie gordon have a memory of a room somewhere in akron or youngstown perhaps with jb haranguing us about how well things were going what with arms to hand money in the bank everyone back east cheering us on and god letting the light of his countenance shine on our enterprise and owen brown bearded and massive hanging on pas every word junior looking glum and running his hand through his hair young oliver brown who had joined us staring before him in his dreamy soulful way kagi twitching with impatience jerry anderson yawning and picking threads from his ragged sleeve black joe watching jb with an intent puzzled scowl that i couldnt read all told it was a damned uninspiring sight and i found myself wondering what guy fawkes and the boys must have looked like on november the fourth when jb wasnt lecturing us about troubling israel and letting the foxes loose in the philistine corn he was on the go in the towns around the ohiopennsylvania line which was strong abolitionist country assuring the people that the dawn was nigh and he was girding his loins to invade virginia he made no secret of that although i dont recall that he mentioned the ferry by name and he certainly glossed over the fact that his great slave insurrection would be in effect a rebellion against the usa and its constitution if the good folk who cheered and pressed round to shake his hand and sent jenny scurrying home to fetch the ten dollars in the cookie jar for the good cause had realised that he was ready to shoot the stars and stripes to ribbons i reckon theyd have thought twice all this aimless jaunting about the country was fine by me it wasnt the grand tour what with passable food middling accommodation and no hope of vicious amusement but i tolerated it in the knowledge that id be homeward bound presently having earned the gratitude of nextpresident seward and the approval of her majesty in the meantime i conferred endlessly with jb and kagi listening straightfaced to the old idiots fierce enthusiasms conscious that kagi was watching to see how i took them and i had to be on my guard not to approve anything too halfwitted for example jb had a great bee in his bonnet about building forts in the hills from which his vast army of liberated darkies would sally forth like boer commandos i didnt remark that such forts would have taken a battalion of sappers weeks to build but when he said the forts must have underground tunnels of communication between them i had to point out that liberated slaves might not take too kindly to hacking their way through several hundred feet of granite and anyway there wouldnt be time to spare from their military training jb glowered like a spoilt child for kagi backed me up and our discussion was pretty strained until he got his way on another ridiculous point the establishment of a school in the hills for piccaninnies then he was happy again we had four or five of these staff meetings as we travelled about and while i took care to hide my disgust i could see kagis frown deepening by the day jb talked interminably and vaguely as though he didnt know what to do next there was no sign of more recruits and id made it plain that our operations must depend on numbers black or white i acted as though i expected them to roll up in troops at any time but meanwhile i said privately to kagi i could only plan in theory and wait for jb to give his orders it was after the last of these talks at a place called chambersburg that kagi asked me to come for a walk it was a lovely summer afternoon and we strolled along the dusty road out of town with joe i noticed to my amusement dogging us at a distance kagi sat down under a fingerpost and asked me straight out joshua can we do this thing time to start sowing the good seed so i answered right back take the ferry given the men certainly fight a campaign in the hills if the blacks rise in sufficient numbers i shrugged sure if they rise says he and started pulling petals off a flower oh truth to tell there aint all that many blacks around the ferry and they aint like the plantation nigras down south theyre farmhands mostly and house slaves not much cotton thereaway you see and pretty much part of their masters families i dont know whether theyll want to rise he pitched the flower away irritably maybe after the harvest thats when theyre at their orneriest and the suicides happen suicides for heavens sake yes sir see when the harvests in thats when theyre liable to be sold south maybe with cottonpicking time coming on so families are parted and they get depressed and mean but thats not till fall he kicked absently at the dust i wish jb would make up his mind hasnt he oh sure i guess so i ought to know him by now i spose how he talks and moons around and then bang hes raiding missouri itll be the same this time when the canadian blacks come in and the other fellows whove promised he turned his clever troubled face to me hoping to be reassured i just hate waiting and i wondered what you thought dyou see it was no time to cheer him up so i brooded a bit and said the five most depressing words in the language we are in gods hands but so hed never be able to say id discouraged him i added sternly with a hand on his arm never forget john that tis not the beginning but the continuing until it be thoroughly finished that yieldeth the true glory and six feet of cemetery as often as not arnold had made me write it out a thousand times for loafing in a pothouse when i should have been chasing cross country at hare and hounds kagi said it was a fine sentiment and hed remember it as we rose to walk back i chanced to look up at the signpost and he followed my glance and said it was a pretty place but quite a piece down the road and much too far to walk the name stayed in my mind for no reason as such things sometimes do gettysburg i should have jumped the train the moment the conductor took joes ticket glowered suspiciously and asked him to account for himself better still i should never have boarded the train at all and might not have done if hadnt mislaid my map id bought it in boston to keep track of our random jauntings back and forth and had traced our progress from new england to ohio most satisfactorily but after i lost it why like a careless ass i was content to roll along in happy ignorance of where we were at chambersburg i knew we were in pennsylvania which was fine and when jb said we were going to i hagerstown i never thought twice id never heard of the place and had no notion where it lay there were six of us on the train jb his sons owen and oliver jerry anderson myself and joe kagi had gone off north somewhere and john junior had been left brooding in ohio it was a baking hot journey with the sun turning the car into an oven and even playing cards was too much of a fag jb prowled up and down accosting strangers to hector them owen was snoring like the great ox he was jerry was trying to get off with a girl across the aisle and oliver was boring me to blazes he was the baby of the brown family a stalwart young adonis of twenty shy and given to books but a chance remark had brought him out of his shell to tell me about his wife martha who was up north and by his account was a cross between portia and helen of troy i was dozing off when the conductors harsh question roused me whuts yore name boy and i saw he was regarding joe with a mistrustful eye joe told him joe simmons eh an just where are you from joe jb was on the scene at once beard bristling some trouble mister conductor you know this nigger says the conductor i know this free coloured man says jb sternly he is in my employ in his travelling duds with their frayed sleeves and air of having been slept in he didnt look like an employer and the conductor sniffed he is is he an who might you be mister my name is isaac smith says jb this is my servant and these he indicated the rest of us are my sons owen oliver joshua and jeremiah well if he chose to adopt me i didnt mind mrs smith is not travelling with us he added with fine ponderous sarcasm or id be kindly proud to present her to you too the conductor blinked uncertainly jb tended to have that effect on folk and the four of us were sufficiently large and ugly to daunt the stoutest ticketwalloper no offence mr smith says he hastily ony theres been a couple o runaways from frederick lately an me seein yore boy here well i thought maybe that he might be one of them taking the train south says jb mighty droll the conductor scratched his head and laughed apologetically and said come to think of it that wasnt likely was it haha jb said no it wasnt and if the conductor was now satisfied that we werent slavestealers going in the wrong direction perhaps hed care to go about his business the fellow cried sure certainly no offence mister and went off like a scared rabbit with jb glaring after him i asked oliver what the row was about and he looked grim and said that was dixie for you all over dixie sure we crossed the line into maryland a while back didnt you know if theyre looking for runaway slaves why they think they can stop and question any black man they like that gave me a start id assumed you see that my charade with jb would be played out in the nice safe abolitionist north and here we were in the slave south and id never known it not that there had ever been warrants out for me in maryland and we were still a long way from the scene of my exploits of ten years ago but it was enough to start me sweating and i took the first chance that came to ask jb casuallike what there was to interest us in hagerstown his reply in a confidential undertone but with an alarming glint in his eye didnt quiet my fears a bit you smell the battle afar off joshua he glanced round to make sure he wasnt overheard have patience my boy the time is drawing nigh when well be done with talk and waiting at the doors of timid men yes sir were approaching the scene of the great war from which therell be no discharge were going to spy out the land says he with a grin that froze my marrow what did moses say to his joshua eh get you up this way southward and get you up into the mountain and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and joshua and his eleven spies did just that remember i didnt in fact the only thing i recollected about joshua and spying was two chaps being sent to a harlots house but this was appalling news i was hearing i asked him what he meant why well lie up a day or two at hagerstown says he and then its just a few miles down the river to where we want to be at wheres that says i trying not to croak why harpers ferry to be sure well take a good look at the country along the way and whats that restrain your language sir and keep your voice down he was glaring disapproval and darting nervous glances at the nearest passengers theres no call for excitement he whispered angrily or that kind of foul navy talk i wont have it then he patted my knee like a forgiving uncle i know youre eager ive watched you chafing these past weeks and i promise you wont have to wait much longer once weve seen how the land lies were going to find ourselves a nice out of the way place between hagerstown and the ferry and there well make our final plans and when the men have come in and the arms he sat back nodding his great bearded head eyes gleaming while i fought manfully to retain my breakfast to find myself in maryland had been bad enough but the news that we werent a kick in the arse from harpers ferry was shocking oh id seen it on the map often but it had always seemed a safe distance away americas such a big place you get into the habit of thinking youre miles from anywhere and i hadnt realised in chambersburg how close we were getting now without warning we were almost there when my guts had stopped fluttering i reflected that it might have been worse for a horrid moment when hed mentioned the name id thought he was contemplating a sudden wild onslaught but plainly it was just to be a scout before we retired to some hole in the ground for another jolly discussion about greek phalanxes or forts with connecting tunnels i could tolerate that not that i had any choice with joe at my elbow for now that we were south of the line he took to sticking close again possibly because he believed the great day was approaching i continued to doubt it for when we reached hagerstown jb was back in his indecisive mood he took us trekking about the country for a couple of days inquiring for properties to buy or rent and then it was all aboard the train again and on a bright july day we rolled across the bridge into harpers ferry and i had my first sight of that strange little town where a parcel of ragamuffins were to change the course of american history its an odd place lying on flat land at the tip of a peninsula where the shenandoah and potomac rivers meet with heights of some grandeur on either side so that the town seems to be at the bottom of a gorge behind the peninsula runs up to a third set of heights the rearmost houses climbing the slope with steps cut into the hillside in those days there was a covered road and rail bridge over the potomac from maryland to the town which lay in virginia and a smaller bridge over the shenandoah its changed a good deal having been battered and burned in the war but in my time as you came in over the maryland bridge there was a great stretch of armoury buildings running for near half a mile along the potomac bank quite unexpected in that kind of farming country id imagined a sleepy hamlet with a store and ferryboat and a few barefoot loafers snoozing and spitting in the sunshine but here was a bustling little industrial community of three thousand souls with neat houses and workshops and my first thought was that youd need a regiment to take this place and a brigade to hold it for a less defensible position i never did see those commanding heights would be a besieged garrisons nightmare and when the bridges went why youd be like a mouse in a bottle but it was the sight of jb and his boys wandering about like a party of tramps looking for a place to doss down that moved me to silent mirth they gaped at the great spread of armoury workshops and the arsenal building gazed up the shenandoah shore to the rifle works half a mile off considered the number of workmen moving briskly about the sheds and the activity about wagers station hotel by the railroad tracks and you could see in their eyes the question to jb how the devil do we take this place true there wasnt a soldier to be seen but there were several score of likely labourers and any number of townsfolk i could just picture jb hammering at the arsenal door and getting a bucket of water over him for his pains before the hads of the village swarmed out to chase us back over the bridge probably in tar and feathers as for the notion of carrying off arms and ammunition to the hills while the populace stayed obligingly in bed well id always thought the projected raid was daft but only now did i realise it was ridiculous my spirits were further raised by our conference in galts saloon where we met johnny cook who was jbs man on the spot hed been at the ferry for a year teaching school among other things and god help the childrens education a pleasant fellow enough but garrulous as a welsh parson and id sooner have trusted a secret to elspeth like kagi he was fretting about whether the slaves would rise and wanted to take soundings among em the thought of this babbling ass tooling about asking niggers if they felt like mutiny had jb almost biting his teacup he told cook with some vigour on no account to meddle with the slaves cook was crestfallen but how they goin to know an be ready without we tell em cant have a nigra uprisin if the nigras dont know can we how we goin to get them in he raised a foolish laugh and jb ground his teeth when we strike they will know it and they will come in to us i tell you and they shall be legion he was wearing his mad isaiah look as he always did when contradicted the lord will guide them to us and they will be like the standing corn for number so dont you fool with em john cook you hear me and that you should know was the last that was ever heard about stirring up the slaves a task which could never have been done in secret anyway george broadfoot would have turned his face to the wall at the mere thought the next thing was to find a lonely spot on the maryland side where we could set up shop pretending to be farmers while we girded our loins planned trained drilled accumulated arms and recruits and generally played out jbs dreams after putting it about that we were settlers who hoped to bring in cattle from the north he found the ideal place about four miles from the ferry a ramshackle threestorey farmhouse which he rented from someone named kennedy it had pasture and outbuildings and lay away from the road shielded by shrubbery in pleasant wooded country at the foot of the hills just the spot for a few eccentrics to waste time fooling themselves that they were on the brink of great things and there we stayed god help me for three solid months and if you ask me what happened in that interminable time i can only say that dusty summer drifted endlessly into golden autumn our clothes got seedier and our leader talked and talked and brooded and wrote letters north for money and accomplished absolutely nothing while in the world outside pam became prime minister again blondin walked across niagara on a tightrope someone invented the steam roadroller people read a tale of two cities and my loving elspeth i have reason to suspect misbehaved in a pottingshed at windsor castle with that randy little pig the prince of wales who at that time was just beginning to notice that girls were different from fellows somehow and not far away from the kennedy farm a chap called emmett was composing a catchy little ditty which was rather ironic when you consider that we were preparing to set the south ablaze it was called dixie you may ask how did i stand it and why easy id no choice so far as i knew the kuklos were still keeping a leery eye on me and joe certainly was still i might have tried to slide out but for one thing i never believed it could last only when you know youre in for a long haul do you grow desperate i didnt because each day i could tell myself that tomorrow or next week must see the end surely jb would realise his folly and give up or go loco entirely or the plot would leak out altogether or something would bring the whole farce to a quiet conclusion one thing i grew increasingly positive about there would be no raid and no uprising i became convinced of this in the first two weeks at the farm which i spent at jbs request in writing plans for the great invasion i did it in best staffcollege style covering reams of paper with instructions for the initial taking of the vital points in the town and the development of the rebellion a glorious exercise in impossibility since it took for granted a force of at least a hundred welltrained men properly equipped and led a total which took care not to state in bald terms and assumed that hordes of ferocious fugitive niggers would flock to join us it might encourage them i suggested if we sent riders round the country with fiery crosses and if you think that was stretching credulity you dont know jb he was delighted this was what hed needed all along he said a clear layingout by an expert there had been nothing like me since hannibal he read it over and over sighing with satisfaction as he turned the pages by the light of the oillamps his great lion head tilted back to scan them through his readingglass the fiery crosses brought an explosion of admiration and a fist thumped on the table and i reflected that feeding dreams is like flattery you cant lay it on too thick if id had a spark of decency id have felt sorry for the credulous old clown humbugging him so but i didnt hang it all its my livelihood such a masterpiece had to be discussed of course ad infinitum in every minute futile detail a copy must be sent to kagi who was now at chambersburg awaiting the shipment of arms from john junior in ohio and cook had to be summoned from the ferry so that he too could be dumfounded by my genius it was all there he agreed plain as print hed have to take a look up in the hills to select likely spots for the forts but he could get tar and turpentine right away for the fiery crosses you bet one omission in my plan disappointed him though no mention of hostages what hostages i asked did i not tell you joshua says jb when we have taken the ferry we must lay hold on the principal slaveowners as security for any of our people who may fall into the hands of the enemy by enemy he meant the usa if hed only thought about it i know a prime case says cook old colonel washington hes george washingtons greatgrandsomethinorother has a fine place close to town an hasnt he got slaves though we must take him without fail says jb it will mean much to have that great name the name of our countrys founder as a hostage hes a real fine gentleman a proper aristocrat says cook pleased to be approved for once say you should see his house though thats the banguppest place the things he has there why theres a pistol that lafayette gave to george washington an frederick the greats sword are you sure youve seen them jb fairly glowed oh to have those when we raise the flag of freedom over harpers ferry precious symbols in our countrys history lafayettes pistol in my belt great fredericks sword in my hand it kept him happy for a couple of days if only harpers ferry had also contained franklins lightningrod and jeffersons commode hed have been in wonderland for a week we were just a party of six when we moved into the farm but soon we were joined by olivers wife martha and jbs daughter annie who were to keep house for us and the recruits who arrived at intervals thereafter the two girls were bright cheery lasses in their late teens and i should put your minds at rest at once by stating that i never had carnal designs on either they werent my style or passable above half and you dont fool with the womenfolk of john brown of ossawatomie believe me martha was a capital cook and little annie a sharp sentry it was jbs great dread that wed arouse suspicion among the local people for americans are the nosiest folk on earth prying into every newcomers business trying to get sight of his furnishings and guess how much money hes got and the arrival of six mysterious stalwarts was enough to set the countryside agog later when more recruits came in little annie had to be on the lookout constantly crying warning and rebuffing visitors for it would have been fatal if the gossips had learned there were a score of men in the house ive seen a dozen of us at dinner having to lift the cloth at a moments notice and carry it off dishes scoff and all from the big commonroom off the kitchen up into the sleeping loft and aii because mrs huffmaster a barefoot slattern with half a dozen snottering brats at her heels came acallin peeping round annie on the porch to get a look inside and remarking slyly what a smart lot o shirts your menfolk has when wed carelessly put all our washing out at once and there were clothes for fifteen or twenty fluttering on the green these recruits came by twos and threes at intervals during the summer but ill list em all together for convenience at first i worried in case jb might assemble a formidable force but twenty proved to be the full count far too few for the business he had in mind and only one or two firstclass experienced men mostly they were jerry anderson over again young eager sworn abolitionists full of tripe about liberty and black equality and all under the spell of jb for most of them had been with him in kansas or up north and had dispersed after last years postponement the one formidable customer was aaron stevens a big blackavised rascal who at thirty was the oldest hed served in mexico been sentenced to death for mutiny broken out of leavenworth and fought the slavers in kansas where hed been colonel of a militia troop he and a fellow called taylor a canadian stuck together for they were both spiritualists and would prose away for hours about the beyond stevens was sane enough but taylor was nextdoor to a padded cell he believed his dreams and would tell you cheerfully that hed be dead by christmas he was too watson brown was another of jbs boys tall and goodlooking with a dandy beard and a gentle manner hed left a wife and baby up north and was yearning to get back to them al hazlett and bill leeman were wild young blades forever sneaking out when jbs back was turned to spark the local girls or get up to larks even down in harpers ferry but leeman was a favourite because hed shot it out beside the old man when the ruffians drove them from ossawatomie and charlie tidd was an ugly young brute with a temper to match there were two sets of brothers the thompsons and the coppocs just raw youngsters but all i remember of them is that dauphin thompson was a fairhaired cherub who blushed like a girl bill thompson was a jolly soul with a great fund of stories and ed coppoc was a sober youth with nursery manners who called me sir and aside from joe there were three or four blacks but they joined late in the day and the only ones of whom i have any image were emperor green an eyerolling yesmassa critter and a middleaged scotchmulatto with the astonishing name of dangerous newby those then were john browns pet lambs as i remember them lively youths without much schooling but fanatics to a man and as i note them down pictures of memory rise before me leeman slim of face and figure lolling with his feet on the table cigar at a jaunty angle talking big hazlett hawhawing at bill thompsons jokes the three brown brothers playing nap olivers fine profile and curly hair in the lamplight watson intent on his cards owen like a benign bullock jerry anderson snapping checkers across the board telling young ed coppoc he knew nothing about the game the blacks muttering quietly in a corner except for joe who often as not would be in the kitchen listening to jb prosing away in his chair by the stove the old man was always there of an evening because he said he didnt like to damp the spirits of the young men by his presence in the commonroom martha peeling potatoes for next days dinner pushing the hair out of her eyes with a damp hand stevens and taylor on the porch discussing the hereafter little annie perched on her stool keeping an eye on the distant road fading into the dusk all gone now every one and i wonder if the kennedy farm is still there in peaceful maryland or if it has crumbled into a ruin of planks and shingles overgrown in that lonely field or perhaps theres a new farm altogether whose tenants wonder what those strange conspirators were like so long ago i have another strong memory of jb conducting communal prayers night and morning the great bearded head with its fine mane of greying hair thrown back eyes closed while he exhorted god fit to shake the roof or reading aloud some bloodandthunder passage from the old testament often he would give us a brief sermon usually on a text describing the destruction of the amalekites or another of those unfortunate tribes who were forever being smitten hip and thigh if youd seen him then in full cry youd have believed all the stories about his fanaticism yet at other times he could be as jolly as punch we occasionally played games on the meadow before the house baseball or tom tiddler and i taught them football as played at rugby in my time with a bladder for a ball they took to it like sailors to rum charging and hacking in fine style and jb roared and hurrahd and laughed so much he had to sit down he would sometimes wrestle with his sons and beat watson and owen easily but oliver nothing could shift i wrestled with jb once myself at his invitation thinking id best go easy on the old fellow but it was like being wrapped in wire hawsers with a scrubbing brush buried in your neck and he grassed me before i knew it sometimes he cooked breakfast to give martha a rest skilleting out the eggs and ham in his shirtsleeves that was the time i noticed his toes sticking out of his old boots and on that same occasion he lost his temper hed brewed tea for all of us watson wanted coffee words were exchanged watson sassed him and jb suddenly blazed up and let drive a fist watson skipped away they glared at each other and then jb fairly bawled him to bits about duty and respect for elders and ungrateful children watson was on the verge of tears but still came back at him shouting the trouble is you want your sons to be brave as tigers but still afraid of you jb glowered at him a full minute and then took watsons head in the crook of his arm and held it against his breast ruffling his hair and smiling and damned if watson didnt start blubbing in earnest i reckon hed summed the old man up pretty well jb was a natural tyrant and his sons treated him as the children of israel served god with terrified affection watson told me an astonishing story of how hed punished them in childhood hed announce a number of strokes of his belt say twelve but hed give them only six and then they had to give him the other six twas the most awful punishment anyone could give a child says watson imagine havin to lick your own father i tell you josh it near broke my heart say didnt it keep us good though it wouldnt have kept this infant good id have laced the old bugger till his arse fell off but then i never had any proper filial regard and if youd ever met my guvnor youd understand why while i remember jb had a great way with animals he knew horses and they knew him and he could quiet a barking hound just by glancing at it but the strangest thing was when a brace of wrens flew into the commonroom where lie was writing fluttering about his head when he went upstairs they flew away but later when he was writing again back they came to pester him at last he went outside and they flew ahead twittering to their nest in the brush and there was the ugliest copperhead you ever saw hissing and buzzing its tail jb blew its head off with one shot and when next he sat down to write damned if the wrens didnt bowl in perching on his table even hopping on to his sleeve doing everything but shake his hand they know it friend when they see one says he and for weeks afterwards when he was writing the wrens would look in to pass the time with him another critter whose regard for jb piqued my interest as the weeks went by was joe in all our time at the farm i doubt if he ever strayed ten yards from me but he played it well and no one ever suspected he was my watchdog ready to bite he was at pains to conceal his intelligence and schooling too taking the silent dignified line but always showing willing he was the keenest hand in our football games scrimmaging with the best of them and was pretty well liked especially by jb what intrigued me was that joe seemed equally taken with the old man ive told you how hed listen to jbs gassing in the kitchen of an evening and in the talks where we all sat round debating halfbaked philosophy and how society ought to be put right or religion and military tactics and jb started laying down the law id catch joe watching him with a strange intense look in those awful bloodshot eyes and when jb got on his slavery hobbyhorse as he always did joe would sit back with his lids halfclosed and i would wonder what was going on in that shrewd black mind the arms arrived in august fifteen cases of sharps rifles and the revolvers owen brown had been our teamster in the early weeks driving the wagon up to chambersburg to take letters to kagi and to pick up supplies discreetly in villages along the route now joe and i went with him to collect the arms and while joe and owen stowed them in the wagon kagi drew me aside looking grave this plan of yours says he ill allow its sound but youre counting on a hundred men joshua i dont see us raising half that number i asked what about the free blacks in canada who were supposed to be in a great sweat to join us and he grunted juniors up there now you may guess how many hell raise oh i should have gone myself instead of wasting my time here being a postmaster and no sign of funds coming in either youll be out of food shortly and the boys darent look for work down yonder he shrugged angrily then brightened again still theres hope yet for money and men you know jb is coming up here to meet frederick douglass next week even i had heard of douglass the greatest black man in america an escaped slave who moved in the highest circles published his own newspaper lectured all over even in europe and was the nearest thing to a black messiah since toussaint iouverture jb hopes to persuade him to join the raid says kagi oh if he but could why it would change our fortunes at a stroke every black in america and canada would flock to him well enough anyway the trouble is hes always declared against violence blast it we must just see what jb can do with him this was the worst news id heard in months suppose this infernal nigger did throw in with brown and brought even fifty with him the old buzzard would be into harpers ferry like a shot and where would poor flashy be then skipping for the timber that was where with the likes of joe simmons looking to put a bullet in my back but steady on douglass most likely wouldnt come to scratch and all would be well one thing was sure when jb met him at chambersburg i was going to be on hand luckily jb was all for it saying it was right and useful that douglass should meet our strategian as he called me and when joe inevitably asked to come along he agreed right off it would be good for douglass to see such a fine upstanding man of colour in the forefront of the cause he said the meeting took place in great secrecy because jbs fears of betrayal were mounting by the day what with neighbours prying and our young men behaving carelessly showing themselves about the farm and writing indiscreet letters to wives and sweethearts making no secret of what was afoot i remember leeman reading aloud an effusion to his mother about our secret association of as gallant fellows as ever pulled trigger and how we were soon going to exterminate slavery and jb overhead him and pitched right in it isnt enough that folk come spying about us stopping us on the road demanding to know our business you have to write this kind of foolishness too think of the burden of secrecy you put on your mother and the rest of you writing to girls and special friends telling of our location and all our matters we might as well get it published in the new york herald and be done with it now drop it dyou hear he scorched them with a look and stumped off and leeman rolled his eyes and told dauphin thompson that hed better mind what he wrote to those saucy little snappers of his the infant blushed like a beetroot so we stole into chambersburg by night jb and joe in the wagon myself on the mule and lay up in a deserted quarry the old man was more nervous than id ever seen him probably because he was in such a sweat to enlist douglass and i nearly caught a bullet as a result it was around dawn that joe and i heard someone coming and when joe shook jb awake damned if he didnt come to with his colt in his fist loosing off a shot that blew splinters from the rock beside my head it shook the old fool as much as it did me and he was fairly twitching by the time kagi hove in view with douglass and a young nigger in tow douglass was one of those mulattos who are more white than black but for the wiry hair he might have been spanish or italian and i found myself reflecting yet again on the oddity that the smallest visible touch of the tarbrush in a white man makes him black but a trace of european in a negro dont make him white douglass was altogether white in speech and style but i doubt if he knew it or cared he had a fine sense of his own dignity which would have irked me whatever colour he was but while he talked down his fine straight nose at least he had none of the resentful spite or childish airs that had made george randolph such a confounded bore it soon became plain that he was far too levelheaded to be swayed by jbs nonsense or to beat about the bush he listened soberly while the old man told him that the die was cast it was virginia or bust and what did douglass think of that douglass told him straight that it was not only wrong and crazy but downright wicked it was an attack on the usa it would rouse the country against the abolitionists do untold harm to their cause and be fatal not only to brown and his gang but to every slave who was fool enough to run off and join the rebellion i wanted to cry hear hear and wondered why none of browns supporters had had the spirit to say it to him long ago jb said he didnt care two cents if the country was roused it needed rousing and douglass couldnt conceive what the taking of harpers ferry would mean why it would be a sign to the slaves that deliverance was at hand they would burst their chains and rally to his banner in thousands not only in virginia but throughout all israel amen he was in his best raving style pacing about the quarry arms flailing and eyes flashing while douglass waited sternfaced for him to run out of wind when he did douglass asked me to describe the men and means at our disposal ht was my chance and i took it telling the simple truth without opinion while jb stood nodding triumphantly as though to say there you see douglass sat back against the rock and looked up at him h cant debate the cause with you john im no match for you in such matters but from what your comrade tells me of the place and all youve said im convinced you are going into a perfect steel trap youll never get out alive youll be surrounded with no hope of escape if were surrounded well find means to cut our way out cries jb but it wont come to that well have the leading men of the district prisoners from the start with such hostages we can dictate our terms dont you see douglass stared in disbelief you cant think it why man virginia will blow you and your hostages skyhigh rather than let you hold harpers ferry an hour he turned to me is that not so mr comber you are a soldier i believe hes a sailor roars jb oh can you not see douglass that even if we were destroyed altogether we should have won the victory the fire would have been kindled the flag unfurled the nation shaken from its slumber and so on ranting and pleading by turns while douglass exclaimed in anger or shook his head in despair they argued back and forth for hours jb insisting on a sudden warlike stroke douglass trying to persuade him that if he must go mouth he should do it gradually helping slaves to escape to havens in the hills and so building a resistance that couldnt he ignored they left off only at dusk agreeing to meet again next day and when we parted douglass stepped aside to shake my hand you are english are you not well sir i must tell you that your country is dear to me beyond all others for it gave me sanctuary from my enemies here indeed says he looking stuffed i owe my name to scotland and my liberty to england douglass i borrowed from the lady of the lake and english friends purchased my freedom he sighed with a wry smile ironic is it not america cast off a royal tyranny to found a free republic yet it was the land of royal tyranny that bought my liberty from the free republic which had stolen it ah well says always happy to oblige dont ye know it sounded a bit lame so i added cost a bit o brass did it he blinked seven hundred and ten dollars says he rather stiff and ninetysix cents bless my soul says i well there it is easy come easy go what he gave me an odd look and a brief goodnight and steered clear of me when the meeting resumed next day he and jb were still altogether at odds and when the old man begged him to join the raid douglass refused pointblank much as he loved and respected jb his conscience wouldnt let him aye thinks i weve heard that tale before still jb wouldnt let up putting his arm round his shoulders and breathing zeal come with me douglass cries he i will defend you with my life i need you my friend for when i strike the bees will start to swarm and i shall want you to help hive them oh think what it will mean to them if you of all black men aye with the stripes of the lash upon you are there to greet them sword in hand amidst the smoke of battle thats the way to drum up recruits thinks douglass sensible chap wouldnt have it but he told the young darkie he might go along if he liked and to our surprise the fellow emperor green snuffled and muttered ah guess ahll go wid de ole man he looked as though hed sooner have gone to china but i suspect that word of jbs plan had spread among the wealthier free blacks and they were eager to have as many coloureds in the business as possible so poor old emperor may just have been doing what he was told it was a fine cheery trip back to the farm i dont think with jb deep in the dumps hed been so sure he could persuade douglass and all hed got was a complete damper and one rundown nigger to make matters worse we soon had word from kagi that john junior had made nothing of the canadian blacks and that various white men on whom jb had been relying werent coming some wanted a definite date others wanted to get the harvest in or didnt fancy virginia and one had decided to study law instead but the worst blow of all to jb was when two of his sons salmon and jason who were up north wrote that they werent joining salmon was quite brutal about it saying that he knew the old man and he would just dally until he was trapped so there it was as autumn advanced no more men no more money jb in the sullen frets and growling about betrayal our situation at the farm growing more precarious by the day and the young men restless and writing ever longer letters home i couldnt have wished for a better state of affairs and looked forward to the enterprise being abandoned any day it was interesting to watch the nerves starting to fray with the uncertainty its always the way men facing a definite task however desperate are manageable but give em a leader who cant make up his mind and they go all to bits quarrels became more frequent bill thompson ran out of jokes leeman and hazlett no longer got up to larks and for the first time i heard murmurs that the raid should be given up that it was madness with no more men coming in and harpers ferry would prove a deathtrap the youngsters whod been so full of ginger a month before were looking uneasy watson brown confided to me that he wanted nothing but to be home with his wife and baby and even oliver the coolest of hands wore a tired frown on his handsome face id seen dried tears on marthas cheeks and knew shed been trying to talk him out of it to add to the gloom she and annie went back north in september but one who wasnt missed was jb himself on the occasions when he went up to chambersburg to confer with kagi he was at his wits end for funds and bit the heads off leeman and tidd just for lighting cigars crying that if he had half the money that was wasted on smoking he could have outfitted an army leeman threw down his weed in a temper and tidd flung out of the house saying hed had enough he came back though after three days spent croaking to cook down at the ferry meanwhile jb was off to chambersburg again and the general feeling was that he could stay there and the rest of us could go home no such luck he drove up next day bringing the famous thousand pikes with him and tried to make it an occasion for rejoicing saying here was proof that our friends had not forgotten us but the mere sight of that great heap of lumber and metal lying in the yard sent everyones spirits into their boots he drove us to work fitting the pike heads and stowing them in the loft and then had stevens call a drill parade wed been getting slack in his absence he said and must brisk up directly for the time was coming when we must prove ourselves in earnest sure next summer maybe mutters jerry anderson and bill thompson cried no no we mustnt be in such a rush would be soon enough if we werent all dead of boredom by then the niggers hawhawed at this but joe rounded on them telling them to mind what they were about and fall in like the captain said stevens marched em up and down for an hour while i watched from the veranda and a more illnatured parade i never saw nows your time flash says i to myself and when theyd fallen out and eaten supper in sullen silence i joined stevens who was having a brood to himself in the yard aaron says i mighty earnest id value your opinion this plan of mine ive done it as best i known how jb is all for it and so i believe is kagi but youre the only real soldier in this outfit i looked him in the eye straight now what dye think of it well its a real fine plan i guess says he in his slow way for a full company of soldiers for our poor few he shrugged his big shoulders i reckon harpers ferry could be a right pretty place to die i nodded solemnly so think i well my life dont matter god the things ive said and i know you dont count yours like me you feel its a small price to pay for the cause but i paused a noble soul troubled what of the younger men and the blacks is it right that they should be sacrificed you see my plight old fellow its my plan that is dooming them their deaths will lie to my account ah thats what burdens my spirit this kind of soullashing was small talk at kennedy farm that summer and meat and drink to mystic idiots like him i knew id hit paydirt when i saw his jaw tighten he shook his head sternly everyone counted the cost before he came says he theyll give their lives gladly after all there is a better life beyond and the door is always open to pass through is but a small step continues the great loony and if in passing it falls to us to do a noble thing then who shall mind a moments affliction knowing that in death lies victory not only for us but for the thousands enslaved and oppressed god bless you old fellow cries and wrung his hand gad but you put it well youve lifted a weight from my mind i can tell you i hesitated see here aaron will you do something for me whats that joshua talk to the others the younger men as youve talked to me you know about passing through and victory and and so on theyll heed you because well you have such faith you see and a gift of words i mean if i were to say to em were all dead men but its worth it well there you are you see i dont put it too well do i but you can old boy oh twill raise their hearts why it may make all the difference and ensure that dear old jbs dream comes true you see my game being a respected seniorand a spiritualist he was just the man to put the wind right up our younger enthusiasts with his reassuring chat about the life to come with luck hed reduce the low spirits of kennedy farm to absolute zero well he did more than that god knows what he said to them privatim et seriatim over the next two days but it dam near caused a mutiny suddenly l harpers ferry was finding no takers at all on change owen got wind of the disaffection and reported to jb reminding him glumly of what happened to napoleon when lie marched on moscow against the popular will and the old boy took his head in his hands and groaned then he called us all into the commonroom and brooded at us like a vulture on a tombstone i hear growls he that with the exception of kagi who i know is staunch you are all opposed to striking the blow at the ferry i feel so depressed that i am almost willing to abandon the undertaking for the time being he threw back his head waiting but only owen contradicted him saying we had come too far and must go ahead must we grunts jb and glanced at me joshua i drew myself up all horse guards and spoke with deep feeling you know my sentiments captain but since the plan is mine i dont feel entitled to a voice i must beg to be allowed to abstain rather neat i thought but one who obviously didnt think so was joe he was glaring at me fit to kill my abstention looked to him like a rank betrayal of my engagement to the kuklos he burst out well ah aint abstainin ah say we go like capn says jb stared frowning in astonishment it came as a shock to him i think to be reminded that joe knew all about the plan the other blacks didnt you see being mere cannonfodder who hadnt been admitted to our councils no one else spoke even stevens stood mum and i could only conclude that in talking to the young men he had realised their deep reluctance and lost heart himself personally i was offering up a silent thanksgiving for i was sure that in the presence of those sullen uneasy faces jb was going to have to call it a day at long last he gave joe a weary wintry smile i thank you for your trust and loyalty joe says he but i fear that you and i and owen and kagi and joshua too i believe can hardly do the thing alone for myself i have only one life to live and to lose but i am not so strenuous for my plans as to carry them through against the companys wishes he paused sighing and rubbed his forehead all over thinks i and then the cunning old bastard faced his hole card very well i resign we will choose another leader and i will faithfully obey him reserving only the right to advise when i see fit there was a gasp of dismay jb bowed his head and walked from the room without another word and would you credit it within five minutes that pack of brainless sheep had reelected him unanimously too for when i saw where they were going two of the youngest shedding tears of remorse the others shamed into a renewal of holy zeal you may be sure i cast my lot with the majority i could have throttled the old swine the whole crazy scheme had been within a shaving of collapse and hed swung them round simply by passing the decision to them i still say he wasnt a good leader but he was one hell of a farmyard politician youd have thought with that moral victory under his belt that hed have gone for the ferry then and there while the boys were still excited in their reaction and indeed for a couple of days i was in a mortal funk that he would do just that kagi who must have got wind of our little mutiny was writing urgently from chambersburg insisting it was now or never the harvest had been good so wed have ample forage in virginia the moon was right and the slaves were restive because the suicides had started further kagi pointed out we didnt have five dollars left even to buy food we darent delay any longer neither i decided dare i all of a sudden thanks to the mutiny producing the opposite effect to what id expected the raid seemed to be on the cards for the first time and my thoughts turned to the horse stabled beneath the house and the road to washington the fly in the ointment was joe whose suspicions of me had become thoroughly roused his baleful eye was on me every minute and he had taken to sleeping across the doorway in the loft i evolved and rejected half a dozen schemes for evading him and still jb gave no sign of making up his mind if anything he was more sunk in despond than ever fearful that at any moment we might be discovered and on the other hand fretting that we darent move without what he called a treasury to sustain our campaign theres a bank in harpers ferry aint there cries jerry anderson and jb exploded we are not thieves cries he oh for a few hundred dollars i shall write to kagi again he must find us something and kagi damn him did it was a dirty october night when the blow fell jb was in the kitchen writing and the rest of us were yawning and snarling after a day which had seen us mooning indoors confined by the driving rain with nothing to do but clean weapons and make do and mend and croak at each other supper had been a meagre affair and i was noting with satisfaction that the feverish burst of enthusiasm which had followed jbs reelection had dwindled altogether after days of inaction what had damped everyones spirits most of all had been an announcement from the old man that he was contemplating a decisive act in two or three weeks wed heard that before and as leeman pointed out in less than a week never mind two or three wed be forced to disperse if only to find some grub and then there was a clatter of boots on the veranda every hand was suddenly reaching for a rifle or revolver the lamp was doused and stevens was challenging who goes there its santa claus old kriss kringle and see how you like it laughs an exultant voice and in an instant the bar had been slipped and the lamp rekindled and kagi was standing grinning all over his face in the doorway with the rain pouring off his shawl there was a tall fellow with him and as kagi ushered him into the light i saw that he limped heavily and had one eye missing in his pale sickly face this is frank meriam cries kagi wheres the captain jb emerged from the kitchen captain kagi what does this mean why are you not at chambersburg chambersburg nothing ive just come from the ferry kagi was afire with excitement frank just came in by train today oh go ahead frank show em the tall fellow pulled out a satchel from beneath his coat undid the strap and opened it over the table and out poured a cascade of dollars glittering and jingling there were cries of amazement as kagi stirred them on the table laughing and jb plumped down in a chair staring in disbelief while kagi explained that meriam was a friend from the north who had heard of jbs dire need of funds and here he was at the eleventh hour with his personal contribution to the cause jb rose with tears in his eyes and seized meriams hand god has sent you cries he he has seen his childrens need and filled their measure yea to overflowing how much is there six hundred bucks cries kagi and jb laid his hands on the gelt and raised his shaggy head in prayer praising the lord that he had furnished means to take his servants over jordan and loose the whirlwind in israel and it seemed to me to be just the right time as they all stood with bowed heads muttering their amens to slip quietly out of the stillopen door button my coat vault over the veranda rail and make a beeline for the stable door at the end of the lower storey for id known when the first coin clattered on the table that all my hopes of many months had been dashed at the hast minute he would go to harpers ferry and id never get a better chance to light out for washington and safety id done my best i had my boots on my tranter in my belt and a clear road to frederick where i could board a train south as i fumbled for a match lighting the stable lamp i was telling myself that mice id ridden a hundred yards id be free for there wasnt but the one horse a sorry screw but hed do i saddled him in feverish haste soothing him as i slipped the bridle over his head ten seconds and id be out and away and i was leading him to the door gulping with excitement when i bore up with a whinny of terror and stood rooted black joe was standing in the doorway hands loose at his sides looking like the wild man of borneo you stinkin snake says he i always knew youd run at the last git yo hand away fm yo belt there was no point in pretending i was taking the beast out for exercise i lifted my hands dont be a

pistol was gone another flicker and it was in his hand again he grinned at me nodding see another bloody madman my god was anyone in america sane in a flash i understood the way hed watched brown and hung on his words and sat in the kitchen listening to his babblings why the old bugger had converted him i couldnt credit it not black joe the shrewdest wickedest bestread nigger in dixie whose slavery had been a rosebed compared to anything he could hope for as a free man but it had happened plainly one look at those bloodinjected eyes told me that and god knows id seen enough of human lunacy not to waste speculation on the whys and wherefores and i was to be driven to sure destruction just because this demented darkie had seen the light i hadnt a hope of running now with this fearsome black gunslick dogging my every move but i could still try to reason with him joe in gods name listen youre wrong he doesnt have a hope i tell you hes going to his death so are all the rest

the ole man an then to the hills says he his face close to mine you play false you even look false an ah kill you dead a voice shouted outside and overhead it was stevens joshua you down there josh joe let go and stepped to the door jes seein to the wagon mass aaron we be theah dreckly he beckoned to me stepping aside to let me pass out into the rain dead member some wiseacre once said that the prospect of death concentrates the mind wonderfully but im here to tell you that the chance to work for a reprieve concentrates it a whole heap more i was in the trueblue horrors when i came up from that stable with joe looming at my heels and was no way cheered by the celebration taking place in the commonroom that pile of cash seemed to have acted like a tonic heaven knows why and all around were smiling faces and bustling activity kagi was pumping my hand and crying at last at last and jb was like a man transformed eyes shining fiercely and beard bristling as he stood by the table fingering the dollars while he dictated to jerry anderson whose pencil was fairly flying across the paper tidd i remember was singing the girl i left behind me in his fine tenor and the younger men were joining in and larking about and all because it was now certain that in a few hours theyd likely be getting shot to pieces and dying along the potomac or shenandoah id seen it before the hectic gaiety that can take hold of young fools at the imminent prospect of action after theyve waited long ive never been prone to it myself i had my work cut out keeping the upper lip in good order while asking myself fearfully how the devil i was going to keep a whole skin this time there was only one way that i could see and i bent my mind to it with everything i knew if harpers ferry could be taken with no heads broken and i knew it could be just provided my plan was followed to the letter and nothing went amiss then there must arise a moment surely when i could give joe the slip a few seconds was all id need and id be into the undergrowth and going like hells delight on foot if need be he couldnt watch me every second not with the confusion that must occur in taking the armoury gates the arsenal and the rifle works so that same evening when jb was poring over my plans and consulting with kagi and stevens and next day when the final preparations were made i worked on every last detail of the scheme as though my life depended on it which it did kagi and stevens to silence the watchman on the potomac bridge as we approached they were the best men for the most vital task the surly tidd next best to cut the telegraph wires with the garrulous cook who knew the ferry well to show him the way oliver the best of the browns to take and guard the shenandoah bridge his brother watson to guard the potomac bridge with the bridges in our hands id see to the armoury gates myself with jb and stevens then to the arsenal across the street leave hazlett on guard with anyone but leeman the rifle works were nearly half a mile off aye kagi could see to them and that would be harpers ferry receipted and filed for a few hours at least provided the bridge and armoury watchmen could be dealt with quietly there was no reason why we shouldnt remain undetected until daybreak and long before then id have slipped joe if i had to kill him to do it and be on my merry way i didnt consult or argue about these dispositions but rapped them out in my sharpest style with jb nodding alongside and the fellows accepted them without a murmur they spent that last day cleaning weapons and assembling gear and stevens and i inspected em to the last button while jb did the really useful work writing out our commissions if you please half the men were captains in his army and the others lieutenants except for taylor the canadian who was too cracked for anything and of course the niggers who were all privates i was a major youll be charmed to know and i have the faded paper beside me as i write with john brown commanderinchief in his spidery hand at the foot i keep it in my desk alongside my appointment as sergeantgeneral in the malagassy army my union and confederate commissions the illuminated scroll designating me a knight of the san serafino order of purity and truth the order of the elephant which i picked up in strackenz and all the other foreign stuff gad ive been about though anyway i left nothing to chance talking to each man in turn to be sure he knew his duties and jb doled out the commissions and read his constitution and administered his oath of allegiance to the latecomer meriam and a couple of the blacks who hadnt taken them before only once was there a cross word when jb tried to interfere with my arrangements for the town he said our first task must be to detach a party to take hostages but i put my foot down hard insisting that it must wait until we had both bridges and the three vital targets armoury arsenal and rifle works all secure he thrust his beard at me glittering my will must prevail in this joshua no captain brown it must not says i the hostages can wait a few minutes until our dispositions are complete ill not answer for our safety or our success unless the plan is followed to the letter it took him aback but stevens backed me up and said hed tend to the hostages himself when the time came jb gave in sulkily and then in a moment he was off on another tack telling stevens that when he took colonel washington hostage he must on no account forget to bring away lafayettes pistol and frederick the greats sword and see to it that washington in person handed the sword to one of our blacks if he doesnt care for that no matter it is symbolic and right and fitting that the sword of liberty should be placed in a coloured hand that was jb all over and then before i knew it dusk was falling and we were sitting down to our last supper in the kennedy farm it was blowing up a wild night outside and the rain was leaking in almost as fast as my courage was leaking out for i was scared as ive seldom been in my misspent life the last desperate venture of this kind that id sweated over had been when the hyderabadi cavalry had charged the breach at jhansi so that i could be deposited disguised and petrified with funk inside the fortress wall there to worm my way into the presence of the delectable lakshmibai my god that had been only last year on the other side of the world and here i was again on the lions lip forcing my dinner down with joes noisy chewing sounding like a deathknell at my ear then supper was over and we sat about in silence waiting there were no jokes now and the only smiles were nervous grimaces on the fresh young faces round the table b struck me harder then than it had ever done before what babes they were half of em with barely a growth of beard on their cheeks torn between fear and the crazy belief that they were doing the lords work and i felt a sudden anger at bloody john brown who was leading them to it and what was a sight worse leading me i can see the faces still watson brown poring over a letter from his wife olivers fine features pale in the lamplight leeman drumming his fingers and chewing an unlit cheroot hazlett sitting back brushing the fair hair out of his eyes tidd scowling as he traced a finger in a puddle of spilt coffee on the board aaron stevens with his hands clasped behind his head staring up at the ceiling kagi pacing about tight as a coiled spring old black dangerous newby whittling at a stick the youngest men stifling those yawns that are born not of weariness but of fear charlie cook cursing the rain bill thompson whistling softly through his teeth and joe seated against the wall never taking those baleful eyes off me jb came out of the kitchen putting on his coat and hat get on your arms men says he we will proceed to the ferry there were twenty of us two by two and jb driving the wagon which held the pikes and tools for forcing the armoury gates every manjack of us fifteen white men and six blacks carried a sharps rifle and forty rounds and two revolvers against the blinding rain we had our hats and loose shawls and before we were out of the lane and on to the road we were sodden through i cast a glance back as we reached the road owen and meriam and one of the youngsters were still on the veranda outlined against the light from the open door owen with his hand raised although he couldnt have seen us in the dark and i remembered something hed said as he shook hands with watson and oliver in the moment of parting if you succeed old gloryll fly over this farm some day if you dont theyll call it a den of thieves and pirates and oliver replying with a laugh why owen you can start shaping up a flagstaff right now neither of em believed it only two men in that company truly wanted to go to the ferry jb and kagi and of those two only one expected to come out alive because he was sure god must see him through one other was determined to come out alive and you may guess who he was striding resolutely through the wet night with his guts dissolving conscious of the looming black genie at his shoulder six of us marched before the wagon cook and tidd out in front then kagi and stevens and last joe and i and as we sloshed on through the dark barely able to see the muddy road before us i found myself harking back to other desperate night forays with rudi starnberg in the silent snowclad woods of tarlenheim on our way to carry out bismarcks mad design to put me on a european throne stealing through the pandy lines at lucknow with kavanagh and him figged out as sinbad the sailor with his clock covered in blacking riding with mangas colorados band of mimbreno apaches to descend on a sleeping hamlet of the rio grande hand in hand with elspeth through that dark garden at antan where wed lain doggo in the bushes and a hova guardsman had trod on her finger and broken it and the little heroine had never so much as squeaked and at the thought of her golden beauty and warm soft body entwined with mine on the green moss of the madagascar forest and now so far away and lost to me perhaps forever i could have raved aloud at the sheer blind cruelty of chance that had landed me in this beastly business while she was snug and safe in dear old london aye and like as not rogering her brainless head off with some fortunate swine the little trot i thrust the unworthy thought aside as id done a hundred times in the past for ive never been sure you see but whether or no it didnt matter i could still see that splendid milkwhite shape reclining on the bed at balmoral the blonde glory of her hair spilling on the pillows bright blue eyes wide and teasing red lips kissing at me over the fan of crimson feathers that was the only thing between me and hearts desire no by heaven i refused to say farewell to all that magnificent meat id win back to her somehow though hell should bar the way and give her loving whatfor until the springs broke in spite of jb and joe simmons and j c spring and every other sonofabitch who was trying to do me down why hadnt i taken on a black rascal every bit as big and ugly as joe that night in antan and won through just as id won through all those other terrifying scrapes with rudi and kavanagh and the rest a great rage surged up in me as i blundered along compounded of lust for elspeth and hatred against the gods i was damned if after all id suffered it was going to end in a twobit pesthole like harpers ferry a low whistle from the dark ahead banished my fond visions there a scant mile away through the murk lights were twinkling dimly the lights of the little township and below them the faint glow of the few lamps that marked the armoury buildings along the potomac shore and cast a barelyseen glimmer on the river surface left of the armoury and closer to our line of approach i could just make out the loom of the covered bridge over the potomac with a lamp at either end that was our first target the whistle had been the signal that tidd and cook were breaking off to cut the first telegraph lines and now we were hastening down the slope the wagon jolting behind us to the near end of the potomac bridge the timbers boomed beneath our feet in the wooden tunnel through which ran the baltimore and ohio railroad tracks as well as the road we were running now and a babble of voices was coming from the far end where kagi and stevens were dealing with the watchman who seemed to think it was all a joke say what are you fellers about taint halloween for a couple o weeks yet goddlemighty man take care with that piece i had a glimpse of his scared white face beneath the lamp and kagi holding a rifle to his breast as i ran past joe at my elbow and turned to face the covered bridge entrance the wagon came rumbling out with the boys running in file either side of it and as i called my orders they wheeled away like good uns each to his station watson and taylor take the watchman keep him quiet kagi and stevens close on the wagon halt her there captain oliver shenandoah bridge smart as you can and quiet oliver ran past me with dangerous newby and bill thompson at his heels and vanished under the trees at my back jb reined in and kagi and the others closed round him taylor was covering the terrified watchman at the potomac bridge mouth and watson waved his rifle to me in acknowledgment now before i go any further you should look at my map which is done as best i can remember for many of the old landmarks are gone now so i cant be dead sure where everything was ive told you how the town lay and you can see for yourselves but i must impress on you just how small was the space in which our little drama was to be played out coming out of the right fork of the potomac bridge you were looking at the wager house hotel a large gabled building with two storeys and a basement it was part of the station and hard by the railroad where it branched right from the covered bridge to your left beyond the other railroad track and partscreened by trees were the shenandoah bridge and galts saloon directly ahead of you was the arsenal building and to the right the gates and railings of the armoury enclosure beyond the arsenal and armoury were houses and shops and the town proper all these places lay within an area not much bigger than a football field perhaps eighty yards by a hundred and from the upper floor of the wager house you could see pretty well all of it unless there happened to be a tree or a freight car in the way the space between the hotel and the armoury gates was fairly open as i remember and i think part of it was cobbled there were trees here and there and i dare say some buildings ive forgotten but nothing to signify joe get the crowbar from the wagon aaron take the sledge follow me i was legging it for the armoury gates and jb jumped down from the wagon and kept pace with me the others following the rain was lighter now but it was still pretty dark save where a pool of light was cast by the lamps on the armoury gateposts a figure emerged from the shadows staring towards us and jb lengthened his stride whipping out his pistol calling to him to stand there was a confused babble of who the hell are you and give me the key this instant and ill be damned if i do and then we were at the big double gates of iron railing and joe was snapping the retaining chain with one mighty heave on the crowbar the gates were thrust back and stevens led the rush of half a dozen of our fellows into the yard there were shouts ahead as two watchmen came running from the nearest buildings but they stopped short at the sight of the weapons and were surrounded neat as wink i whistled up the wagon now driven by one of the blacks and ordered it into the yard i looked round for jb expecting to see him making for the arsenal across the street but he had his piece to the breast of the first watchman and was haranguing him in fine style i am isaac smith he was proclaiming himself and you are my prisoner submit peaceably and no harm will come to you but if you resist your blood will be on your own head yere drunk ye old fool and on a sunday too cries the other pushing the gun aside but jerry anderson ran up and clapped a pistol to his head and he just sank down in the mud squawking a voice called out of the misty darkness from the direction of the town asking what all the row was about and i wheeled on kagi take three men round up anyone on the street over there and bring em here quick and quiet leeman run to the shenandoah bridge see if alls well with oliver bring the watchman back here dauphin thompson fetch the watchman from the potomac bridge and both of you keep em quiet dye hear jerry was hustling his stricken watchman to the armoury yard and jb was stalking after them muttering i called to him but he didnt seem to hear well someone was going to have to secure the arsenal and quickly hazlett and you youngster follow me bring the crowbar i ran across to the arsenal building behind me there was a babble of voices at the armoury gate jbs among them and stevens was snapping silence all of you another sound and well put you in eternity hazlett came running with the crowbar and i snatched the lantern from above the door to give him light he shoved the bar into the jamb and with a splintering of timber the lock was burst in it was pitch dark within but with the lantern i had a glimpse of rifles racked and ammunition boxes piled high i shoved the lantern into hazletts hand stay here and keep that glim outside or youll blow the town skyhigh i ran back to the armoury gates just as kagi arrived herding three or four complaining citizens with their hands in the air they seemed to think it was some kind of practical joke until they saw the captured watchmen in the yard surrounded by levelled rifles and jb beard bristling and eyes glittering laying down the law in his best pulpit voice be silent all of you i come from kansas to this state of slavery i mean to free every negro slave and to that end i have taken your armoury if the citizens interfere with me i must only burn the town and have blood now sit down upon the ground and be quiet all they sat too scared and staring all except one old codger who faced up to jb youre crazy mister what dye mean scarin folks half to death now you put down that gun why youre as old as i am and ought to know better hold your tongue friend and do as you are bid growls jb but i heard no more for at that moment came whooping and laughter behind me and it was those noisy idiots cook and tidd to tell me proudly that the wires were cut both sides i shut them up fast enough and then dauphin was back with the guard from the potomac bridge pushing him into the yard a moment later leeman came striding across from the trees flourishing his pistol at a terrified watchman and two fellows whom oliver had picked up on the shenandoah bridge alls well cries leeman say this is a lark aint it shut up and put those men in the yard and send kagi to me jump to it man there was still the rifle works to attend to six hundred yards up the shenandoah shore a matter which jb seemed to have forgotten he was still hectoring the captives now about a dozen strong who were watching him like so many rabbits before a snake kagi came running and i told him to take two blacks to the rifle works send one of em back with the watchman and sit tight until he heard from me he jerked a thumb in jbs direction what about the captain ive been telling him that our first task must be to clear the arsenal and find wagons to carry off the arms but all he talks about is his damned hostages you must tell him josh we ought to be loading up right soon fore we have the town about our ears ill talk to him when hes got his bearings stevens can collect his precious hostages and wagons together and ill get jb to go through the arsenal in the meantime all right says he worried but josh dont let him delay will you you know what hes like we must be out of here by daybreak we will be never fear i knew one who was going to be off with you john good luck he went with another doubtful look towards jb and i strode across to the arsenal where hazlett was standing in the doorway rifle in hand and took a quick survey around i could just see watson brown under the potomac bridge lantern all was quiet towards galts saloon its lights blinking through the trees and there wasnt a sound from olivers station on the shenandoah bridge the curtained windows of the wager house glowed crimson in the dark and i could hear faint voices and laughter jb and stevens were in conference under the armoury gate lantern and beyond them the captives were squatting silent guarded by leeman and the others i looked towards the town nothing stirred a few lights shone in the houses only fifty yards away but there wasnt a soul to be seen no one was calling out or coming to see what was amiss or doing anything at all apparently except prepare for bed on a sabbath night it had stopped raining we had taken harpers ferry im quite proud of that still very well it wasnt sebastopol but my plan had gone like clockwork those gormless boys had played up like old soldiers and wed sealed the bridges cut the wires taken our three objectives the town unsuspecting and all within the hour god knows i hadnt been a willing performer and would have been over the hill but for joes presence but dammit when youve no choice but to go ahead your pulses start racing whether you like it or not and excitement grips you even though youre scared sick because you want like hell to accomplish the thing youve set your hand to however reluctantly as i stood in the chilly dark my heart hammering i felt a great unreasoning exultation just for an instant before sanity returned and joe must have felt it too for he grunted you done that pretty good comber which considering our relations was not a bad compliment by this time stevens cook tidd and a couple of blacks were hurrying off to kidnap the owner of the washington farm which lay a few miles up the potomac shore with jbs insistence that they bring back fredericks sword ringing in their ears he was in an odd state outwardly very calm but strangely detached as though his thoughts were far away when i reported all well he just nodded offhand and when i asked if we should clear the arsenal he said he would see to it presently when the hostages had come in i hinted delicately that haste might be advisable since at any moment some stray citizen might happen by and raise the alarm but at this he just frowned stroking his beard and muttered that we had time enough and gradually it began to dawn on me that he simply didnt know what to do next about finding wagons or collecting arms or rousing the slaves or taking to the hills while our luck held now of all times he was stricken again with indecision and retreating into his dreams by the look of him well it was nothing to me id done my part perforce and all that mattered now was throwing off the grim black shadow at my side and hitting the high road i must just wait my chance so i leaned against one of the gateposts smoking a weed and wondering in an academic sort of way when jb was going to take advantage of the capital start id given him times an odd thing we hit the town about tenthirty and secured the strongpoints and then followed that eerie tranquil interval of jbs irresolution which no one has ever been able to explain and which seemed to last forever in fact it was a bare thirty minutes until midnight that was when things began to come adrift and we had several hours of bloody and farcical confusion until daybreak yet to me they seemed to pass in a few moments one crazy incident on top of another in no time at all picture the scene gentle reader as midnight approaches harpers ferry drowses placidly neath the pall of night the last gleams of light in its windows blink out one by one as citizens seek their repose the town drunk nestles contentedly in his gutter the liberators of virginia stand around in picturesque uncertainty while their venerable leader contemplates the stars like a fart in a trance the prisoners mutter sullenly in one of the armoury sheds and not one solitary soul seems to be aware that the revolution has begun flashy smokes and sweats and wishes to heaven that joe would turn his back just for half a minute and hark a shot rings out and believe it or not no one pays the slightest bloody attention it came from the potomac bridge where unseen by us that canadian halfwit taylor was putting a bullet through the top hair of an inopportune railway guard who had happened along been challenged shown fight and got his skull creased for his pains we heard him soon enough bolting out of the covered bridge roaring and bleeding and taking refuge in the wager house and so help me no one emerged to protest or even inquire the town slept on undisturbed jb left off contemplating to stare towards the hotel but did nothing our fellows confined themselves to intelligent questions like who the hell was that and say did you hear shooting and nothing further took place until there came a distant whistle from far down the baltimore and ohio track and presently in steams the eastbound night train for baltimore clanking past the armoury and coming to a slow halt near the wager house only fifty yards from where i stood at which point the wounded railwayman erupted from the hotel clutching his bleeding scalp and bawling that there were road agents on the loose the train engineer silly ass got down to investigate watson brown and his idiots opened fire for no apparent reason an unfortunate nigger came striding down the track was challenged by watson turned to run and was shot in the back the engineer leapt back into his cab and reversed twenty yards with great blasts of steam some stout parties in the coaches began blazing away at watsons party passengers were screaming and tumbling from the train harpers ferry began to wake up at last jb strode to the train bellowing for everyone to hold his fire and be calm and your correspondent began to wonder if this mightnt be a good time to retire and would have done if joe hadnt been holding a pistol in each hand and demanding to know what the hell was happening either because of jbs thundering or more probably because neither side could see properly what they were shooting at the firing died away after a few moments and there followed a remarkable conversation between our leader and the engineer it began predictably with jb announcing that he had come to free the slaves at all hazards and in the name of universal liberty god helping and the engineer calling him a liar a lunatic and a damned jayhawking rascal whod swing for this and by the eternal the engineer would be there to see him do it too jb rebuked him for blasphemy assured him that no harm was intended to the train or its passengers and that he would let them proceed so that the railroad authorities should understand that the town was closed to traffic henceforth the engineer damned his eyes and said hed swim through seas of blood rather than budge before dawn when he would inspect the bridge to see what mischief you infernal scoundrels have done to it jb agreed and promised to walk over the bridge before the train to show that it was safe this discussion took some time with frequent interruptions for you must imagine it taking place in darkness illuminated only by the trains headlight and the feeble lamps of the nearest buildings against a background of babbling passengers being helped into the wager house men shouting females screaming the shot darkie being carried away a church bell belatedly sounding the alarm bewildered citizens seeking enlightenment at the tops of their voices and some of the bolder spirits who emerged from the shadows for a closer look being seized by our fellows at the armoury gates and sent to join the prisoners in the shed but no one from the town showed fight for several good reasons it was too dark to tell properly what was taking place a rumour had spread through the town that we were over a hundred strong and while the arsenal was bursting with weapons there was hardly a gun in the town except for a few fowling pieces and the like so while we held our positions the people kept their distance except for one cool hand a doctor who approached the arsenal was given the rightabout by hazlett and then crossed the street bold as brass to demand of jb what he thought he was about and on being told denounced him for a murderer the only black youve liberated so far is one who was free already the poor fellow you shot down on the tracks he was a peppery medico this with a jaw like a pike and the darkies gore all over his hands look at that hes dying this minute with your bullet in his lung you old blackguard jb said he was sorry for it but the man had run when called on to halt and the doctor must consider himself a prisoner just try it mister cries the sawbones or shoot me in the back why dont you and he stamped off to the wager house stopping on the way to survey us and hazlett at the arsenal and if ever a man was taking stock he was sure enough two hours later he was riding hellforleather for fhe nearest town to turn out the militia and meanwhileb was waiting and doing nothing hardly answering when spoken to and our fellows were fidgeting and muttering and joe was growling at me why wasnt the capn takin aholt o things and why didnt i tell him i said id told him hadnt i and every moment my gorge was rising higher with panic as i wondered if i dared make a run for it there was a clatter of wheels from the dark and here came a fine fourhorse vehicle wheeling in to the armoury gates with three white men and about a dozen darkies aboard and stevens jumping down rifle in hand he helped down one of the whites a bluff old cove in a grey coat who h guessed was washington and i heard him sing out this is ossawatomie brown of kansas as jb strode forward to meet them one of our darkies jumped down after them brandishing a sheathed sabre and calling out here tis capn here de ole sword sho nuff and jb seized on it and stood with it in his hand as he told washington that he had been taken for the moral effect it would give to our cause but he would be shown every attention and if we get the worst of it your life will be worth as much as mine whatever that meant washington took it mighty cool saying nothing and presently he and the two other whites a man and a youth were put in the yard and jb supervised the distribution of pikes to the slaves in the captured carriage telling them they were free men now and must defend their liberties and the poor black buggers stood in terrified bewilderment looking at the pikes as though they were rattlesnakes a fine rebellion were going to have thinks i ah well theyll shape better no doubt when theyve built their forts in the hills and dug communicating tunnels i kept clear of all this but so did joe damn him and my gorge rose another couple of notches for the dark was beginning to lift slowly and i could see clear to the nearest houses of the town where people were peeping out and some even gathering on the corners staring across at us there were faces at the windows of the wager house and hard by it where the train stood passengers were climbing aboard with scared glances in our direction in the armoury yard all was confusion for the prisoners had been let out of their shed and were mingling with the newcomers in a great babble of voices the niggers with the pikes looked ready to weep and our men were watching anxiously as stevens and tidd clamoured around jb who now had the sword girt round his middle and was exulting over a brace of barkers presumably the property of the late marquis de lafayette why we got more prisoners here than there is of us tidd was exclaiming and stevens was arguing with jb about loading up from the arsenal and getting nowhere jbs notion was to send washingtons carriage which was larger than our wagon over into maryland to collect the kennedy farm weapons which owen would have shifted by now to a schoolhouse closer to the potomac and bring them back to supplement the arms in the arsenal stevens frowned in dismay but capn twill be full light in an hour see here why dont we load up the carriage an the wagon from the arsenal now with everythin we need call in kagi an oliver an all of us hightail it out o here we can pick up owen an the arms from the schoolhouse an be in the hills fore noon he gestured towards the houses where more people were assembling watching us look at them folks yonder how long they goin to let us alone you reckon jb gave him a stern look you forget captain stevens that it is here at the ferry that the slaves will rally to us why if we were to leave now we should be abandoning them no more of that sir well i dont know that the slaves are coming says stevens we saw no sign of em when we came in just now i can tell you an itll take three hours easy to get to the schoolhouse an load up an come back here again cries tidd then we got to clear out the arsenal capn itll be noon forewe can get out o town why the militiall be here by then an come dawn these folks are goin to see how few we are i could see stevens was keeping his temper with difficulty they aint goin to stand by jb stilled them with a raised hand like a patient parent the hostages are our assurance of safety the people will dare nothing against us for fear of harming them and i will not desert the negroes he became peremptory captain tidd you and captains leeman and cook will take the carriage away and receive our pikes and rifles from owen but theyre three of our best men sir stevens was near despair i beg you send but one and some of the slaves but jb was deaf to all common sense and presently the carriage rolled off over the potomac bridge with cook at t he reins and tidd and leeman marching alongside with a gaggle of the freed darkies in the back stevens pleaded with at least to start clearing the arsenal first i must keep my promise to the engineer says jb and off he went to the train his rifle cradled in his arm and his sword trailing in the mud holloing to the engineer that he might get up steam the townsfolk across the way set up a murmur at the sight of his commanding figure striding towards the tracks but he paid them no mind at all and presently the train was chugging slowly on to the covered bridge with the old man striding ahead of it and the crowd before the wager house fallen silent by gad hes cool says stevens to me too dam cool i tell you josh we aint got but a couple of hours fore well have to shoot our way out what ails him he acts like we was in a town meetin it was true and everyone who was through harpers ferry will tell you the same the chancier things got the calmer grew jb as though he were in the grip of some soothing drug stevens swore through his teeth weve got to get john kagi down here hell take heed of kagi and pat on his words there was a commotion at the wager house and one of our niggers came running from under the trees brandishing his sharps the folk scattered to let him through and he came panting up to tell us he was from the rifle works and kagi wanted to know when jb planned to retire from the town because hed seen a rider galloping along the charles town road damnation whatd i say cries stevens its but eight miles off two three hours well have the militia on us the crack of a shot interrupted him sending us scurrying behind the armoury railings and then came two more from somewhere in the town there was a shrilling of women as the people gave back to the houses except for one fool who made a dart across the street towards the arsenal one of our men the younger thompson i think loosed a shot at him and he threw up his hands and flopped down in the mud to a chorus of screams and oaths from the wager house a couple of men ran out crouching and hauled him away stevens bawled stand to men and every rifle was trained on the town but now jb was striding towards us from the potomac bridge coat flapping calling to hold our fire a man came hurrying from the wager house waving his hands as though appealing for calm and jb stopped to talk to him and presently nodded and came on to us while the other scampered back to safety no further shots came but our fellows stayed at the armoury railings and behind them the prisoners cowered down all save old washington who stood his ground arms akimbo those were only squirrel rifles says jb unconcerned there will be no more of that but be at the ready men and keep up a bold front capn says stevens this wont do were in no case to fight just a handful here an the rest spread all over there will be no call to fight says jb the prisoners are our security if you count on that sir you are in error it was washington loud and steady not stirring a foot captain brown you must give over this madness either lay down your arms or avoid the town odd word to use i remember thinking look yonder sir you have put the people in fear you have shot a man down you hold us captive here all to no purpose give it up sir before worse befalls he was full of spunk and sense the old soldier both of which were wasted on our ragged napoleon he lifted a commanding hand to washington be silent sir i have my purpose as you shall learn you and all others who live by human bondage not another word sir he stood a long moment glaring like the wrath of god and then looked about him taking a slow survey of the scene turning on his heel his rifle at the port it was full light now and all plain to see our men kneeling or standing behind the railings pieces presented behind them washington foursquare among the prisoners across the street to our right the houses with people peering out of the alleys in nervous silence the arsenal with hazlett and his chum in the doorway rifles ready the wager house with faces at every window and at least a score of folk on the porch and others under the trees beyond where galts saloon could be seen with a couple of fellows sitting on the roof a few more by the railroad tracks hidden from our view by the wager house watson and taylor were on guard at the potomac bridge and not a sound except for the distant wail of the train whistle far away on the maryland shore a light rain was falling again pattering in the muddy puddles everyone just stood waiting on that gnarled bearded old scarecrow in his soiled coat and ragged hat his ridiculous sabre trailing at his side he finished his survey and fixed washington with a grim burning stare if any are in fear it is a judgment on the sins of their guilty land if any die resisting a just cause then they have brought it upon themselves as to the purpose of your own captivity i have told you it was a moral one and also because as aide to the governor of virginia you would have endeavoured to perform your duty and perhaps you would have been a troublesome customer to me he thrust a finger like a handspike towards washington i shall do my duty also and to a higher power than a slave state i shall be very particular to pay attention to you sir on my word he paused growling deep in his chest and turned to bill thompson at the railing captain thompson how many hostages are under guard thirty you say so many why that is twice our own number well now we must take account of that he leaned his rifle against the gate and stood glowering at the prisoners with his hands resting on his pistolbutts his lips moving as though in calculation and i felt the hairs rise on my neck sweet jesus whats he about gasps stevens is he crazy a rhetorical question if ever i heard one with the old deathshead glaring like dragfoot the hangman and then he swung towards our group hitching his swordhilt out of the way and fumbling in his pants pocket he lugged out a handful of the eagles meriam had given him glancing across at the wager house as he sorted the coins on his palm joe simmons says he here is fifteen dollars i want you to go to the hotel yonder and tell them we require hot breakfasts for fortyfive persons to be served to us here oatmeal and milk and some of their southern fry of eggs and ham whatever they have you understand oh and joe theyll send coffee no doubt but tell them i desire a pot of tea also i suppose cardigans walkmarch trot at balaclava is the most memorable battlefield command ive ever heard but jbs order for breakfast at harpers ferry runs it close for a moment i didnt believe it and neither did joe for he stood gaping at the coins in j bs hand and then his glance flickered in my direction and i knew at once what he was thinking that if he went off to the wager house who was going to keep an eye on slippery b m comber for a second he hesitated and then i he clever beggar saw his way out why capn ah caint do that says he they wont pay no heed to a coloured man no suh theyll mind what mass josh says though an ah kin go long an help carry mebbe and some fools say theyre not fit to vote the hope that had leapt in my breast died in a smouldering inward rage asl il nodded and handed me the money only to revive again at the thought that the crowded confusion of the wager house might give me the opportunity id been praying for all id need was a split second to get out of reach of joe and then either try to flee the town or declare myself to some responsible citizen as a government agent bigod that would be risky theyd never befieve me jb broke in on my thoughts leave your rifles and revolvers they will offer you no violence knowing that we hold their friends hostage i didnt hesitate but drew the two colts from my hipholsters and passed them to stevens along with my sharps joes eyes rolled and his ugly mouth tightened but then he too passed over his pistols jb said remember the tea joshua and we set off side by side across the open ground towards the wager house one of us casting wary sidelong glances the other with the reassuring pressure of the tranter tucked into the back of his waistband under his coat it was an interesting walk in its way under the astonished eyes of the citizens wondering what the deuce it meant two of the desperadoes who were holding their town to ransom suddenly strolling over to their hotel for a moment the crowd on the porch stood goggling and then there was a flurry of skirts and squealing as the women shrank away and some of the men drew back although most stood pat hostile but scared i played up tipping my hat and calling a cheery goodmorning as we mounted the steps and one of the men even thrust the door open for us to pass through crying john someone get john foulkes quick theyre acomin in for a moment it was like upsetting a bees nest as we strode in for the lobby was full of anxious citizens as was the dining area off to one side and the advent of a stalwart ruffian with whiskers and a massive black of forbidding mien had them almost clambering over each other i calmed them with an upraised hand and my best speechday style assuring them they had no cause for alarm that captain brown presented his compliments and would be withdrawing from their delightful township presently and that in the meantime they should remain at ease while i spoke to a waiter there was a moments stunned silence and then cries of hes a foreigner and the like and a redfaced worthy in a tile hat shouted what dyou mean by it what dye want of us and who are you and a woman fainted and another woman screamed and all was confusion until i raised my voice again and presently a small bald trembler in a white apron and an extremity of terror emerged and i gave him my order for fortyfive breakfasts strangely enough it seemed to have a calming effect on the assembly if not on the hashslinger his teeth chattered and he closed his eyes babbling that he didnt know if cookie could handle that many at such short notice and hed have to see and oh my god hed do his best and finally in a shrill whinny say mmmister how dye want the eggs at your discretion my boy says i and he stared witless before scurrying away muttering discretion while i took a quick slant about me fifty folk if there was one pale faces and round eyes women shrinking men resolute but doubtful every head in the dining section turned to stare whispers and scared murmurs no other door off the lobby but one beyond the dining tables obviously to the kitchen straight ahead of me a big bar counter with gilt mirrors behind a staircase leading to a balcony above the lobby a young negress looking down over the rail and here i paused in astonishment at the bizarre contrast of bottlebright red hair tumbling about shining ebony cheeks a plump black hand clutching a silk peignoir round a form which would have done credit to a turkish wrestler and bold protruding eyes regarding me with awakening interest i stared and received an unexpected dazzling beam of white teeth in return how many more of us ye aimin to kill ye damned brigand it was my redfaced worthy again waving a fist in my face theres a corpse alayin in back yonder an a nigger like to die an thats brown thabolitionist out yonder cries another him an his gang o kansas murderers an you ye skunk an this black villain got the gall to bust in here askin to be fed shame shame on you squawks a female and then they were surging about us spitting and cursing a fist swung at my head i ducked and my assailant blundered into joe tumbling him over my hand was on the tranter and joe sprawling was conjuring a colt from his armpit a fellow dived on him grabbing his wrist the squawking woman was belabouring me with her gamp joe was hurling his attacker aside but by that time i was going through the dining section like springheeled jack sending a table flying as i plunged through the kitchen door one backward glimpse i had of joe rearing gigantic and bellowing as the mob fell back before his pistol and then i was face to face with a wizened black granny flourishing a skillet a kitchen in uproar and my little waiter on his knees crying twont be but a moment mister honest there was a door ajar to my right i leaped through slamming it behind me and found myself in a passage with a door to the open air and a flight of stairs running up and was just about to choose the former when there was a tremendous crash and screaming from the kitchen with joe bawling whered he go you see a white man woman he wasnt five seconds behind me if i broke into the open hed nail me for certain i bounded up the stairs through a door at the top and crouched wheezing with terror in a deserted passage while the sound of a raging blackamoor bursting from the hotel in vain pursuit sounded below then i tiptoed forward past closed doors on either side wondering where the hell i could hide came to the end of my passage and dropped prone as i realised it opened slap on to the balcony above the lobby there was uproar down yonder and someone was clattering up the main staircase towards me i had no time to retreat there was a closed door to my right i grabbed in panic at the knob rolled hastily within thrust it shut and came to my feet tranter in hand andan ear to the panels my heart pounding as i heard the steps go past someone gasped in the room behind me and i whipped round with a yelp of fear to find myself confronting my dusky amazon of the balcony hennaed hair atumble hands raised in amazement i gave a frantic croak of no dont call out and she blinked eyes popping at the tranter but she didnt faint or have hysterics and when i shoved it back beneath my coat she rolled her eyes and let out an elaborate sigh of relief followed by a shrill giggle well heahs a go my caint you move aroun though she raised a whimsical eyebrow you jes passin through or you kinly plannin to stay ah hope id no time to marvel at the presence of a gaudy and eccentric negress en deshabille in a southern hotel or the nonchalance with which she greeted an armed intruder madam cries l dont be alarmed i beg i mean no harm i swear but im in a slight pickle you see hold on do i sped to the front window and peeped through the curtains there not fifty yards off were the armoury gates with jb and stevens in plain view and the fellows at the tailings to the left was the arsenal with the town houses beyond there were a few citizens by the houses and one bold spirit was shouting and shaking his fist in jbs direction whut in creations happenin out theah demands the queen of sheba an election sounds like sacramento on fourth july who you runnin from handsome the vigilantes i hopped to the rooms other window which overlooked the railroad tracks and the potomac and started back as joe suddenly appeared beneath by the side of the hotel colt in hand staring about him there was a knot of people by the tracks scattering away from him as he turned and shouted and i realised he must be addressing watson at the bridge entrance behind the hotel then he set off for the armoury gates waving and shouting to jb no doubt asking him how hed like his eggs i crouched watching until a husky voice spoke reproachfully behind me well you sho know how to flatter a fine coloured lady or is the view out theah mo pleasin than the one in heah i turned still breathless to find her regarding me with a quizzy amusement that took me even more aback than her extravagant appearance this was the south mind where darkies knew their place but here was one young sassy and black as your boot who carried herself like a dahomey duchess and looked the white boss in the eye with cheerful insolence she must have read my thought for she tossed that astonishing fiery head ahs free case you wonderin says she tartly an ahm waitin when in doubt grovel i beg your pardon maam believe me i can explain those men yonder are abolitionist raiders so ah been told says she coolly you likewise no no not at all im oh lor the fact is im a government man i was with them to well to observe them you see find out what they were up to you don say well think o that her eyes widened in mock wonder govment man huh like a police detective its true i swear i had to get away from them but the people downstairs they dont know what i am you see and they might not believe me if they found me i mean uhhuh so you got to lie low for a spell right heah is that it her smile broadened and i could have cried out in relief yes yes exactly i gave her my most appealing leer if i might stay for just a little while id be most grateful i assure you maam call me hannah chuckles she an jes try to leave she swayed majestically forward to lean on the fourposter in what i can only call a worldly attitude teasing an amber tress between her fingers and pushing out her lower lip and as i recovered my wind and appraised her at close quarters inhaling a gust of sweet heavy scent and noting the ravenous glint in her eye why dyou know all of a sudden it was like coming back to life again after months in another drab and dismal world and my immediate terrors and those of the past few hours were dwindling away by heaven though she was overwhelming sixteen magnificent stone if she was an ounce but light on her feet as a dancer pugfaced pretty in an overblown way and with a jolly sensuality in the thick purple lips and flaring nostrils spread across the fat shiny cheeks not my vision of venus exactly but it seemed as though centuries had passed since mandeville my randy imaginings of elspeth were still fresh in mind and as i contemplated those enormous endowments fore and aft and the massive shapely thigh thrust out of her peignoir i came all over atremble pointing like a gundog her languid smile became a hungry complacent smirk say thats bettuh purrs she ah wuz beginnin to think you wuz anothuh popplewell another what popplewell ma lawful wedded two days back in pittsbugh fust time fo him third for me but ma fust white husband you unnerstan she added proudly drooping a plump hand to display a stone the size of a fives pill on her ring finger rich lil runt too how else you think fie cud bring his nigguh wife to a vginia hotel sposed to be takin me honeymoonin in washinton oh don fret honey hes long gone vamoosed on that train aftuh the shootin pales a ghost the dirty dawg lef me flat an this was goin to be ma weddin night too she glanced regretfully at the bed and heaved a sigh which shivered her topgallants causing me to grunt sharply in sympathy an me tricked up in ma prettiest things an all she continued plaintively youd ha thought hed ha stayed wouldnt you and before my enraptured eyes she shrugged off the peignoir put her hands on her hips and stood there bursting out of a flimsy corset which would have been tight on mandeville she leaned forward bulging magnificently and pouted at me with lips like cushions well says she soulfullike wouldnt you no doubt about it ive been lucky with women but then as the fellow said the more you practise and no one has striven harder towards perfection than i but mrs hannah popplewell was a double stroke of good fortune first because her presence in harpers ferry which afforded me a refuge was a chance in a thousand and secondly because she was one of those insatiable ornaments of her sex who would rather gallop than go to church and just what i needed after a hard nights rebellion against the commonwealth of virginia if her conduct was forward well her connubial expectations had been dashed by the recreant popplewell and the arrival of flashy with whiskers rampant must have seemed like the answer to a randy young matrons prayer and if you wonder that i succumbed to the brazen bitchs advances with peril threatening on every side dont fear has never damped my ardour yet and the contents of that corset flopping out voluptuously under my very nose banished all thoughts but one i buried my face between em nearly crying and wrenched at the laces with one hand while discarding my britches with the other which aint easy when youre suffocating but love will find a way taken unawares the coy little flirt squeaked in pretended alarm easy boy giggles she the door gotta shoot the bolt leave that to me haha i seized handfuls of rump kneading away as she struggled playfully making feeble noises of protest but honey you aint even tol me yo name yet allow me to introduce myself i chortled and with one tremendous heave i hoisted her up all black and glossy into the firing position her eyes bugged out of her chubby face and with a silent scream she enveloped my mouth with those enormous lips heaving against me i reeled back muscles creaking as she surged up and down my stars it was like wrestling an elephant my legs hit the bed and i collapsed supine beneath that ponderous mass of ebony flesh wondering whether id be crushed or smothered but resolved to die game for a moment it was touch and go for the selfish slut had no thought but her own lustful gratification but then she remembered to take the weight on her knees and elbows as a lady should and settled into a fine raking action that sent the bed jerking across the floor and brought the canopy down on us i could tell shed done it before so i settled to the enjoyable task of holding those gigantic black boobies at a safe distance letting her have her head and as we plunged ecstatically past the post i thought good riddance popplewell shed have been wasted on you it had all been so deuced sudden flight one moment fornication the next that i was glad of the chance to lie and take stock afterwards listening to the brides contented lipsmackings and reflecting that jb and joe had more to do than fret over me and the last place the citizens would think of looking for an absconding raider was the upper floor of their hotel it wouldnt be safe to play the government agent card yet awhile though better by far to lie snug and sale rogering this prime piece of dusky blubber until jb skipped town as he soon must or perish then wait for night and slip away unobserved or better still shave off my beard and whiskers wait until tomorrow if need be muffle up well and board a convenient train perhaps with mrs popplewell on my arm to lend colour so to speak with the lintel at sixes and sevens theyd never look twice and she was the sporty kind whod think it a great lark provided i continued to give satisfaction in the meantime which i was soon called on to do it seemed that i had no sooner slipped into a ruined stupor before she was bilfowing all over me again slipping her tongue into my ear and whispering as she teased away with practised fingers that i was her sho nuff honeymoon baby of all things an whenevah she saw a cucumber aftuh this shed think o me and similar endearments shed no notion of leisurely lovemaking either thirty seconds of gentle dalliance and she started behaving like the empress theodora run amok with poor old flashy fighting for his life belaboured by balloons of black jelly capital fun mind you but gruelling and so the morning wore away and myself with it meanwhile there was little disturbance from without now and then there would be a few shots but whenever i looked out the state of play seemed unchanged jb and co ensconced around the armoury gates but taking no harm from the occasional sniping and now and then some of the townies would even approach the railings to confer with them without result that i could see it was a damned rum business when you think of it a quiet little town being held up by a gang of fanatics to no apparent purpose the two sides taking pot shots and confabbing by turns and folk going about their business a stones throw away i couldnt fathom jb at all if he didnt move he was done for but he seemed content to sit and wait while the precious minutes ticked by i gave up at last and bedded down and had the horrors when i woke to find that mrs popplewell was absent and the door ajar but at that moment i heard her on the landing saying shed take the tray in herself cos mistuh popplewell wuz still abed plain tuckered out he wuz this with a lewd giggle for the waiters benefit and here she came fat cheeks wreathed in smiles bearing vittles and news such a ruckus down theah they don know whos in the place an who aint says she so lean to an hit that fry mistuh popplewell got to keep that fine frame o yours fed i reckon come heah honey n let me nuzzle yuh

shuddered between gargantuan mouthfuls ah declare he mus be crazy freein the nigguhs whoevah heard the like anyway jus so longs they dont burn you up big boy mo coffee she poured and no belgravia mama ever did it more elegantly tipping in the precise amount of cream without a drip and as i considered her noting the delicacy with which those enormous fingers handled cups and spoons the erect posture on the edge of her chair the assured tilt of the splendid zulu figurehead with the flaming red curls spilling over her shoulders i found myself thinking back to my conversation with joe on the night flyer you dont approve of abolitionists then dam right ah dont runnin off black trash fieldhans an lowlife nigguhs to freedom think that makes em free they goin to be slaves a long time yet whether they got mancipation papers or not she tossed her head yo frien smith oh sho brown mus be a fool to think he can free em no white man can ony us nigguhs in heah she tapped her brow like ah did long

comftable right heah an he flew meet me in washinton deah creecher an heahs a hundred dollahs do not fail me they wuz his partin words so ahll meet him in ma own sweet time meet his canal shares too but right now she rose with a fine billowing of her peignoir put her arms about my neck and slid her splendid bulk on to my knee ahs real comftable the unworthy thought crossed my mind that her present misbehaviour rendered her eminently blackmailable where popplewell was concerned but it was a purely pickwickian reflection you understand id not have dreamed even given the chance for id taken a liking to this hearty black trollop a true kindred spirit pleasuring her rump off at a moments notice aye and drumming up breakfast from a kitchen in bedlam gathering the news and preparing the way for my departure as mr popplewell into the bargain you dont find many like her and i told her so well now spose you jes show me says she squirming on my lap and licking my lips so i did for the third and last time for even as we buckled to the curtain was rising on the final gruesome act at harpers ferry twelve hours had passed since wed crossed the potomac bridge and all unknown to us the alarm had been spreading since dawn from village to town to city clicking along the wire even to the white house already militia companies were tramping through the leafy virginia lanes from charles town and mustering in frederick and winchester and martinsburg and even eventually in baltimore that young beau sabreur lieutenant j e b stuart who was in washington trying to hawk his patent swordfrog to the war department found himself ordered to ride for arlington to summon colonel robert e lee of the nd cavalry and within hours the two of em were bound for the ferry in the wake of the us marines the steel trap that douglass had prophesied was closing while jb mooned away his time and kagi kept sending frantic messages from the rifle works beseeching him to move and the citizens of harpers ferry lost patience and began to gather in earnest and i well you know what i was doing and not a man in virginia was better employed and you may tell mrs popplewell i said so it came as sudden as a thunderclap a deafening burst of shooting and i was springing to the window and all hell was breaking loose between the town houses and the armoury railings with both sides blazing away and the far bank of the potomac was alive with armed men in civilian duds the charles town militia led by a man who knew his business for he was cutting off jbs line of retreat from the side window i saw them streaming down towards the potomac bridge which was out of sight from where i was behind the hotel so i didnt see them storming over the bridge shouting and huzzahing chasing watson brown and taylor who fled to the armoury i saw them run across from the tracks firing back and then the militia came into view below the hotel scores of men who looked like farmers on a rabbit hunt they spread out along the track beneath my window and on the open ground pouring fire at the armoury gates and i thought youre done jb for i expected them to rush the railings but an officer bawled to them to take cover in the wager house and i heard him ordering parties to galts saloon and the shenandoah bridge where oliver was stationed now it was pandemonium below stairs and the building shook as about fifty clodhoppers surged in hollering and crashing among the furniture and firing from the windows female shrieks arose and a stentorian voice ordered all ladies to take refuge on the upper floor there was a great pattering and squealing on the stairs and i was in terror that wed be invaded but mrs p put paid to that by showing herself in our doorway bold black and bedizened no respectable southern female was going to share a room with a nigger why tis a scandal allowing such a creature in civilised lodgings what is the world coming to suddenly there was uproar outside a fusillade of shots and from the front window i saw young oliver racing across before the hotel letting fly with his colt at pursuing militiamen hed been driven from the shenandoah bridge and was going like a stag for the armoury gates with bill thompson at his heels and hard behind them came the old black dangerous newby oliver and thompson won clear with shots kicking up the puddles around them but newby suddenly staggered his head thrown back and i saw that a shot had torn his neck horribly open he stumbled sideways and sprawled on his back in the mud and that was the first of john browns pet iambs gone and as i stared down at the twitching body and the blood welling across the ground i suddenly remembered him sobbing in a corner at kennedy farm over a letter from his wife who was still in slavery hoping that hed be able to buy her and their children soon and jb setting a hand on his shoulder saying they shall be free newby depend upon it and old dangerous saying ah know it capn ah know it they didnt let him be now that the militia were on hand and the raiders number was patently up all sorts of ragged town heroes came to join in the fun and in no time they were at the liquor in the wager house and galts place there was a fine drunken commotion beneath our feet singing and cheering and guffawing and great rage being voiced against jb and his gang they were full of bile because oliver and thompson had escaped and soon when jb sent out a hostage with a white flag to hold some parley or other with the militia half a dozen of the town vermin emerged from the hotel to take out their spite on newbys corpse kicking it and dragging it about with cries of there ye damned nigger rot in hell an serve ye right one barefoot rascal dragged off the dead mans boots and then mrs popplewell who was with me at the window cried oh sweet jesus and turned away for the rest of them were hurrahing round the corpse egging on one who knelt and sawed at its head and presently came running to the hotel bellowing who wanted a couple o abolitionist souvenirs hey and i saw he was flourishing newbys bloody ears aloft his mates cheered and clapped him on the back that was when the nightmare began shooting had broken out again heavier than ever from the houses and the heights behind the town and jbs beleaguered party had to abandon the railings and take cover among the armoury sheds they had no way out now more militia were arriving over both bridges and soon the ground about the hotel and tracks was thick with them clamouring to git at them dam niggerlovers but twas all shouts and no action either their leaders were concerned for the hostages or more likely had a healthy respect for jbs marksmen who were holding their fire now except when their tormentors came too close one idiot on horseback waving a shotgun was picked off like a squirrel from a branch and another venturing too far down the railroad tracks was dropped with a single shot as i learned later he was the mayor of harpers ferry and when the news of his death spread among the people their rage knew no bounds what with that and militiamen enflamed with drink i could see jb and co being torn limb from limb when the mob finally worked up the nerve to storm the armoury but in the meantime they were content to plaster the sheds with shot and roar bloodcurdling threats and then jb sent out another white flag there was a great howl of fury when it appeared in the armoury gateway but a militia officer bawled to them to hold their fire for it was borne by one of the hostages who came marching towards the hotel with young bill thompson by his side the crowd surged out and surrounded them drowning the hostages plea to be heard the flag was torn from him and bill thompson was dragged into the wager house battered and kicked with yells of lynch the bastard no no hangins too good for him burn the sonofabitch the drunken din from beneath was now so deafening that there wasnt a word to be made out but since they didnt haul thompson out for execution i guessed he was still alive for the time being youd have thought jb would have learned from that incident but not he not long after another white rag was seen waving in the armoury the order to cease fire was shouted again and this time it was aaron stevens and watson brown who came out side by side you bloody fools thinks i youre done for but on they came towards the hotel watson stiff as a ramrod with his head carried high and big aaron ploughing along with one hand raised like an indian in greeting for a moment it was so still i could hear their boots squelching through the puddles and then a rifle cracked and watson stumbled forward and fell on his hands and knees a great cheer went up a volley of shots followed stevens seemed to hesitate and then he came for the wager house like a bull at a gate hurling the flag away and was cut down within twenty paces of the hotel i absolutely saw his body jerk as the slugs hit him and then the hostage who had been with bill thompson came running out arms spread wide turning to put himself between the two shot men and the mob another hostage who must have been following stevens and watson from the armoury ran forward to join him and together they dragged stevens to the wager house one of them yelling you cowardly scum stop it damn you caint ye see the flag for a moment the firing stopped and then it was seen that watson was crawling on all fours back towards the armoury and the mob set up a great yell and let fly again he scrambled up and ran clutching his stomach with the bullets churning the dirt around his feet and went down again but he still kept crawling and managed to roll to cover behind one of the gateposts that sent them wild and they poured in fire harder than ever but what you ask was flashy doing while the tide of battle rolled oer harpers ferry crouched shivering at the curtains thats what sweating pints at the thought of what those boozesodden villains would do if they chanced to seek sport abovestairs and discovered that the trembling occupant of the popplewell chamber was none other than the raider whod come demanding breakfast i only had to look out at the bloody shreds that had once been newby and listen to the hells chorus from below to be almost physically sick the same thought must have occurred to mrs popplewell for after an age in which wed barely exchanged a word i felt her hand on my shoulder and the jolly black face was grim and set bes git yo cloes on dearie says she and i saw that while id been glued to the window and the horrors outside shed been attiring herself in a vast gown of dazzling green silk with yellow bows an enormous hat with a yellow plume and matching ribbons in her hennaed hair you cant imagine what she looked like luckily for you she even had a rolled umbrella sumpns up down yonder says she ahs goin to len an ear and she tiptoed with elephantine delicacy to the door a finger raised and an ear to the panels dont open it i yelped christ if those brutes see you god knows what theyll do if they find me here git them pants on an hold yo noise they aint goin to see nobody she opened the door a crack and suddenly above the clamour from below we could hear voices and they didnt soothe me one little bit for the first words i heard were so string the bastards up i say damn it to hell theres mayor beckham layin dead an you want we should he tender o these dam kansas butchers you an abolitionist yoself or whut im a soldier snaps another one of your coldsteel voices and these men are prisoners to be treated as such oh sure youre a soldier goddam frederick militia aint you comin in at the tailend well captain we tuk these yere prisoners as you call em an i reckon its for us to say how they tret aint that so boys there was a roar of agreement and the hairs rose on my neck as i heard thompsons voice crying out but not in appeal he was shouting something about dying gladly in libertys cause but it was drowned in yells of execration why you vile white nigger you have him out boys i caint stand to listen to him why gimme that pistol jem ill finish him myself now you see this gun you kansas hawg you feel it gainst yo head put that down to my amazement it was a woman shrill with anger you wont sully this house with murder while im here put it down i

with good ole georgie chamberss slugs in his guts let him suffer i say why you drunken cur cries the captain if that man could stand up with a gun in his hand youd all jump out the window a storm of yells and curses greeted this and then i heard thompson again wild and high god bless you aaron stevens they may take our lives but eighty million will rise up to avenge us and then mrs popplewell closed the door and leaned her back against it looking solemn you was right honey says she they aint in no mood to blieve yous a govment man oh my god maybe they wont come up though don bet on it theys three or four asettin on the stairs this minnit drinkin theyselves wicked an castin eyes at the rooms wheah them other shemales is she swayed across to the window it be dark in an hour or two you bes slide out then git yoself to one o they offcers or someonell listen to yuh slide out through that christ woman every militiaman in americas out there theyd tear me to pieces no no i must hide under the bed or somewhere in the cupboard the closet you stupid slut oh god too small look could you throw some of your clothes over me if i lay down theyd never think why not confound you dammit you could hide half harpers ferry under that bloody tent youre wearing help me you brainless sow is that so you wuz glad nuff to git under it snorts she my aint you the bedtime hero though you some kin o popplewells ah reckon and these infernal yankee pothouses dont have chimneys even they got attics snaps she pointing aloft and there praise be was a trap in the ceiling if yo so downright timid but i was already on the table throwing back the trap and sure enough it opened into a great musty loft which must have extended over the whole building dim and cluttered with rubbish just the bolthole for a deserving poltroon god bless you back in a jiff cries i and ill swear i heard her giggle as i heaved up lowered the trap and took stock treading softly from the small windows in either gable and the low skylights in the sloping roof i had a capital view all round north to the armoury south to galts saloon a d the shenandoah bridge and west to the bolivar heights overlooking the town with the orange ball of the sun sinking in a dirty autumn sky those distant buildings towards the shenandoah shore must be the rifle works was kagi still there closer at hand the arsenal building seemed to be deserted no sign of hazlett the front of the town was crawling with men keeping up a desultory fire on the armoury and weighing up i could see only one line of retreat for jb through the armoury proper and along the railroad between bolivar heights and the potomac but even as i looked i saw movement in that direction the figures of militia a good hundred of them skirmishing in to close on the armoury from the rear so now he was ringed in on all sides his revolution was dead and he and his juvenile fanatics with it they went piecemeal did jbs pet lambs and i saw most of em go already thered been newby watson and stevens and now even as i prepared to tiptoe back to the trap bill thompson there was a commotion behind the hotel and hastening to the skylight on that side i saw a noisy crowd milling at the mouth of the potomac bridge tunnel they were hustling thompson on to the trestle and then they stood off from him levelling their pistols for a second he was stockstill hands by his sides and then they were blasting at him pointblank and he toppled over out of sight the whole mob surged forward shouting curses and his body must have landed on the bank below for they kept emptying their pieces downwards and i found i was jerking with the shots for it might have been me i watched sick and shuddering until a fresh burst of firing came from the shenandoah side and from the other skylight which was broken i saw distant figures surging round the rifle works and heard guns popping like toys in the distance with the setting sun in my eyes i couldnt make out much but a few moments later there was a great hawhawing and laughter as a group of roughnecks and some militia came hurrying down towards galts saloon shouting that that was another couple o the bastards settled one white one nigger an twould ha been three for there had been another nigger theyd been goin to lynch but that cussed sawbones wouldnt allow it damn him spoilin sport thataway say but if you boys wantin some target practice that abolitionist skunks still alayin there sure got him in the shallows tryin to swim for it too much hot it ad in him for swimmin though hawhaw so that was kagi gone jbs right arm whod sat under that signpost by chambersburg twiddling a flower between his fingers he was the best of em the switzer consoling aint it that its always the good uns who stop the shot while fellows like me slip out from under which reminded me that id some fair slipping to do yet if i was to come out intact it was beginning to grow dark lights were twinkling in the town and down below the crowds around the wager h louse and galts were kindling torches by the sound of it they were drunker than ever and bursting with mischief rain was pattering on the roof and i debated whether to wait in that gloomy loft until full dark and then try to scramble down from one of the windows no if i didnt break my neck thered still be those boozy ruffians between me and safety better to return to the room where mrs popplewell was probably still undisturbed and lie up in comfort until morning or even longer if need be if danger threatened i could always take refuge in the loft again i tiptoed to the trap and stopped short when i saw a chink of light showing of course with dusk coming shed lit the lamp i stooped to raise the trap and almost fell over in terror for someone was talking in the room below and it wasnt black beauty unless her voice had broken in my absence i crouched quivering like an aspen as a harsh bass growl came to my ears never see a nigger yet that didnt lie truth out o dixie you had him in here ye black bitch hid him up didnt ye yeah yore abolitionist friend whered he go hey don you call me liar it was mrs popplewell no docile darkie she ahs a spectable woman an no white trash goin to bust in on me an gimme his lip you git out o heah all on yuh leave me be ah dont know nothin bout no abolitionist white trash strike me dumb ye hear that ive a mind to haul you out an lash you good you hold your noise it was the captain whod interceded for thompson see here my girl there was a man here we know it you told the waiter here it was your husband whats his name popplewell that right thats it popplewell the waiter babbling but he got on the train went out at dawn and she brung up breakfuss for two this mornin like he was still here least i think thats what she said there now you hear him girl hes mistook mrs popplewell was standing firm said no sech thing an no mans been in heah whut kin o female dye think ah am a lyin nigra whore thats what bawls the ruffian voice if you was alone what you need two breakfasts for ah is a large lady retorts she with dignity an ah eats hearty leave that tis by the way says the captain impatiently now see here girl how dye explain this and there followed a breathless pause what the devil could this be something damning obviously but youd think a man in my plight could have restrained his curiosity wouldnt you after all it didnt matter to me whether he was presenting his card or baring his buttocks so before you could have said dont you damfool i had my eye to the gap at the edge of the trap goggling down into the room i could see only a portion of it filled mostly by mrs popplewell in the height of fashion holding her brolly like a club and two ugly scoundrels with beerbellies and beards crowding her either side of the captain i could see only an outstretched hand and on it lay my tranter pistol which id forgotten in my haste well says he what o this ma husban left it fo ma purtection cries she gamely did he now favours an english firearm does he you waiter didnt you say the abolitionist who bespoke fortyfive breakfasts spoke with a foreign accent british perhaps i didnt stay for the answer if id been a man of iron nerve no doubt id have raised the trap bade them a cheery goodevening and descended nonchalantly to explain myself to the captain who was plainly a man of intelligence and sound judgment and he might have believed me again his raffish companions might have shot me on sight we cannot tell for what i absolutely did was to start to my feet in sudden alarm hit my head a shattering crash on a sloping joist lose my balance and step heavily on the trap which must have been rotten at the hinges for it gave way with a rending of timber and down i went into the room like lucifer descending the table bursting beneath my weight mrs popplewell screaming and her interrogators exclaiming in shocked surprise the only one who spoke to the point was the waiter who cried by cracky thats him and call me hasty if you will it seemed prudent to remove rather than offer explanations i was afoot and would have been through the open door in an instant if one of the ruffians hadnt barred the way i sank my knee in his essentials blundered into mrs popplewell saw the other thug start towards me and the captain beside him levelling the tranter and knew in a split second that there was only one thing for it casting gallantry aside i seized her amidships swung her off her feet with a herculean effort and hurled her at them and im here to tell you that a tenth of a ton of wellnourished negress pointblank and well driven is a damned effective missile they went down all three with a shock that rattled the hotel and i was out and bounding down the passage to the back stairs missing my footing and going arse over tip to land with a sickening jar beside the kitchen door the outer door stood open i heaved myself up and went through it bullatagate into a torchlit twilight which seemed to be full of drunken shouting rascals who stared in astonishment as i raced through them heedless of direction behind me a voice cried stop him halt or i fire it was the captain no slouch in pursuit he and then came the crack as he let fly with the tranter i plunged on dodging between trees cannoning into bodies knocking over a stand of piled rifles with angry yells and pounding feet behind me and no notion of where my terrified flight was taking me well it wouldnt have made much odds if i had taken care all ways led to disaster and death and mine took me into the open ground between the wager house and the armoury gates where i slipped in a puddle and went headlong in the mud at least in scrambling up i was able to take my bearings and damned discouraging they were for every gun in harpers ferry seemed to be slinging lead at me from the railroad tracks to my right from the town to my left and from the wager house at my back shots were slapping into the mud around me militiamen were rushing towards me from the hotel and the only place that wasnt stiff with illwishers and seemed to offer the ghost of a chance was the armoury itself i floundered out of the mire and went baldheaded for the gates it was just my confounded luck that my flight took place at the precise moment when those militia whom id seen skirmishing towards the rear of the armoury a few minutes earlier launched their attack through the sheds at the remnants of jbs little force even as i was leaving the hotel at speed they were storming up among the workshops and jb and his boys assailed from behind were downing eight of them before being forced to retire into the enginehouse just inside the armoury gateway what with my panic and the uproar around me i knew nothing of this until i sped screaming through the gates and met the militia coming the other way ahead of me the avenue between the sheds was alive with roaring ruffians charging towards me in the failing light orange flames leaping from their muzzles even as i slithered to a terrified halt shots were whipping past and as i turned to fly something like a whiplash seared across my neck and i knew id been hit oh jesus this was death and i pitched forward in agony sobbing god damn you spring damn you to hell clutching at my wound the warm blood running between my fingers my ears deafened by the hellish din of rifle fire and battlecry torchlight blinding me and i knew this was the end joshua a harsh voice was shouting close by joshua i struggled up on one elbow and not ten yards before me were the great twin doors of the enginehouse with jb himself standing between them his sharps smoking in his hands his scarecrow coat flapping round his lean shanks his battered hat jammed down on his brows the door in the lefthand arch was shut but that on the right was wide and there was joe his face contorted with rage a colt in either fist pumping shots at the advancing militia and taylor the canadian kneeling his sharps at his shoulder and oliver was waving his rifle come on josh well cover you by god flashy you aint dead yet i thought and then i was on my feet bellowing with fear staggering towards them all four were firing now and from the tail of my eye i saw the militias advance waver but they were shooting back damn them slugs were buzzing about me something plucked at the skirt of my coat missed you duffer but the next one didnt a hammer blow struck my thigh numbing my leg and i went down like a shot rabbit sprawling in t he mud within a few feet of cover and roaring if i remember rightly for jesus to save me which was optimism run mad i admit but i was dying remember god knows how i crawled the few yards to the enginehouse doorway heaving along on two hands and one knee plastered with filth my precious blood leaking in two places howling my head off and taylor was darting forward hoisting me up and dragging me on then everything seemed to be happening terribly slowly but crystal clear as is often the case when youre helpless in deadly danger taylors grip loosed and something warm and wet struck me in the face and as i fell back he was standing over me but where his head should have been was a hideous crimson mess and i cried out in horror pawing at his blood and brains that had spattered over me someone heaved me to my feet it was jb and i remember the earthy cattle smell of his coat as my face pressed against it joes pistol exploding almost in my ear his shout of goddam slavin bastards oliver firing round the doorpost while rifle balls smacked into the timber and brickwork and the choking reek of powder smoke in my mouth and eyes as i clung weeping to jb i heard oliver sing out i see him paw and i can still see the eager grin on the pale handsome face under the wideawake hat but as he whipped the sharps to his shoulder he suddenly staggered with an odd barking little cough looking down at the bloody stain spreading on his shirt he dropped the sharps and sat down heavily against the door raising his head in surprise and exclaiming oh paw look and that is the last thing i remember before well i could say something poetic about blackness enfolding me like a shroud or a dark mist engulfing my senses but the plain fact is that i fainted from pure funk wounds believe it or not can be quite handy if you know how to make use of them i speak with authority having taken over twenty in my time from my broken thigh at pipers fort to the selfinflicted graze which enabled me to collapse artistically during the boxer rising in between ive been shot in the back the breast the arm the leg and the arse been blown up now and then flogged scalped racked and roasted had my shoulder opened by a chink hatchet my cheek by a german schlager and my abdomen by a turkish knitting needle and still carry a scorchmark on my elbow from the hot metal of the cannon from which i was dam near blown at gwalior not bad going for a thoroughbred coward and decamper and those are only the ones i remember theres a smallcalibre hole in my left palm and blessed if i know how i came by that senility creeping on i suppose the point is that ive made capital out of my dishonourable scars by adhering to one golden rule flashys sufferance i call it always convey but never say that your injury is a sight worse than it really is its elementary really in convalescence this ensures sympathy if you play it properly the barely perceptible wince the sharp little intake of breath the faint smile followed by the quick shake of the head and never a word of complaint from the dear brave boy but far more importantly in the heat of battle it enables you to feign mortal hurt and shirk any further part in the action not that i was faking when i keeled over maidenlike in the enginehouse i was convinced that the great peeler had his hand on my collar at last and only when i came to and recalled that the pandemonium around me was not hell after all did i discover that my wounds while painful were not fatal or even serious my shirt and coat were sticky with blood but frenzied inspection assured me that this came not from my jugular but from a nasty nick near the shoulder and my other hurt was quite a curiosity the slug must have been almost spent for it was only halfembedded in my leg some way above the knee like a currant on a cake i pawed at it weeping tears of gratitude that it hadnt struck home a few inches noreast and the beastly thing fell out leaving an ugly hole oozing gore i subsided whimpering with anguish and relief clutching the affected parts and lying petrified as i took in the appalling scene for the interior of that enginehouse looked and sounded like the inferno gone wild the building reverberated to the incessant din of rifle fire glass was shattering timber splintering men were screaming and cursing and all in halfdarkness for there wasnt a light in the place bar the flashes from the guns and only torchglare outside as i cowered down by the wall halfchoked by smoke and panic i could just make out the shapes of bodies on the straw at my feet and beyond them shadowy figures which crouched in the halfopen doorway shooting out while answering shots crashed into the walls and the long low firecarts which seemed to fill most of the great brickbuilt shed one slug hit a firebell with an earsplitting clang setting it swinging and pealing all i could do was lie there trying to staunch my neck wound with my sleeve praying that id not be hit again god of all the cruel strokes of fate after all my scheming and evasion and taking cover at the eleventh hour id leapt from the fire back into the fryingpan and now there was nowhere to run even if id been able to only a yard away jerry anderson was hacking at the bricks to make a loophole fragments rained down on me and when i sang out he dropped down beside me eyes wild in a bloodstreaked face my god josh cries he are ye done for brandy croaks i and he thrust his flask at me i clutched it and as he jumped back to his loophole i set my teeth and spilled half the contents on my neck squawling to wake the dead at the burning agony of it i clapped the mouth of the flask to my leg wound writhing and whimpering and had just enough strength to pour the rest down my throat i was halffainting with pain and i must have swooned again for the next thing i knew there was a blinding glare before my eyes the shooting had ceased altogether and there were voices talking close by i raised my head and saw that the glare came from a stormlantern in the doorway where jb seemed to be holding a parley with a couple of civilians while joe covered them with his sixguns the light ell on the faces of the bodies near my feet and i shrank back horrified as i saw that they were watson and oliver both apparently dead and beyond them the shattered corpse of taylor sprawled on the bloodsodden straw to my right on the back wall behind the engines young ed coppoc and emperor green the black had their rifles at the ready through loopholes in the brick and jerry anderson was at his post on the side wall straddling olivers body dauphin thompson the pretty youth who looked like a girl stood by the nearer engine a rifle in his hands my god was this all that was left six sound men three corpses and flashy playing possum now one of the civilians was speaking a tall brisk chap with a trim moustache and goatee my captain from the wager house by george he got about though didnt he you can only make it worse cries he pointing to the bodies sakes alive man isnt that enough youre surrounded by hundreds of militia and colonel lees marines theyre under orders from the president of the united states to demand your unconditional surrender nothing less he gestured about him look at this the end is certain and resistance can mean only more bloodshed they know my terms rasps jb his face was dreadful in the lampglare haggard with hunger and lack of sleep but his voice was strong when all my men living and dead have been delivered to me here with their arms and ammunition and our horse and harness your horse cries the other in disbelief god help us then and only then i shall retire into maryland taking the prisoners with me continues jb calmly there i shall release them at a safe distance and enter into negotiations with the government youll not take us into maryland it was old washington coming round the back of the engines and i saw there were half a dozen of the hostages lurking at the far side of the shed he strode past where i was lying up to the group in the doorway no threat shall compel me from this spot ill tell you that they stood eye to eye the old soldier planted like a rock jb with his head thrown back rifle in hand fredericks sword trailing at his hip the goateed captain stepped between them hands raised forcing himself to speak quiet but firm it wont do captain brown cant you see sir colonel lee cannot yield to those terms the united states cannot he took a deep breath your position oh come sir in the name of sense what do you hope for jb turned on him eyes flashing for honourable dealing according to the usages of war would you have me surrender to the creatures who shot down my men like dogs under a white flag my own son sir dying there of wounds inflicted by those drunken cowards that was the militia colonel lee is a gallant gentleman and stonecold sober retorts the captain oh i am sorry for your son but my god when men take up arms in treason against their country they can expect to be shot like dogs what of the poor souls youve killed this day he broke off with a helpless shrug oh wheres the sense of it i beg of you sir see reason and give up while you can colonel lee will show you every consideration and in the meantime he gestured at the bodies at least let doctor taylor see to your wounded jb considered a moment and then nodded to the other civilian a stout little greybeard with a black bag who signed to jerry to bring the lantern and knelt down by watson fumbling for his pulse even through halfclosed eyes in that light i could tell it was the stars and stripes for watson no error his face was like wax and he didnt seem to be breathing the little sawbones evidently agreed for he pursed his lips and moved on to oliver whose eyes blinked open in the light he stirred and gave a little whispered sob paw shoot me oh paw please its awful sore let me die please paw jbs voiced croaked out of the shadows in an awful parody of reassurance oh youll get over it noll interrupted by a stifled scream from oliver as the bellybutcher probed at his chest you maynt credit it but i believe i heard the loving paterfamilias mutter something about dying like a man say that to me you old sod thinks i and ill spit in your eye i was reviving you see under the spur of selfpreservation and while i was weak as a rat with fear and shock and hurting like sin i was by no means hors de combat the feeling had returned to my leg and the gash in my neck seemed to have stopped bleeding but the outlook was uncertain youll agree if this parley ended with jbs throwing in his hand all would be well once hed been disarmed i could show my true colours and refer them to messervy if he wouldnt surrender i could only keep mum declaring myself a us agent in the hope that the captain could protect me would be madness why the crazy old bastard would probably shoot me on the spot then there was the vexed question of where the devil id been all day and joe was lurking in the background on the whole the closer i appeared to be to deaths door and unable to answer embarrassing questions the better so when the poulticewalloper shook his head over oliver and glanced towards me lying there all bloodspattered and pathetic i was ready with a feeble gesture to keep him at a distance the last thing i wanted was the little bugger poking at me and exclaiming why this fellows barely scratched a spoonful of jalop and hell be fitter than i am i neednt have fretted possibly he was fed up peering at abolitionists for having glanced he shrugged and said hed call again in the morning meanwhile the goateed captain had been moving heaven and earth to make jb see reason with as much success as youd expect i knew what we might be called on to undergo when i set my hand to this work says the stubborn old ragamuffin i have weighed the responsibility and shall not shrink from it and your prisoners cries the captain if this madness continues and they pay for it with their lives youll take responsibility for that too will you i shall take every care of them replies jb they are in gods hands so are we all the captain could have burst at the sanctimonious smugness of it but he mastered himself and stood up tall you are a vain and selfish man says he god forgive you then anger got the better of him youll die to no purpose you know that oh to some purpose i believe says jb and laid a hand on his shoulder as though talking to a child be of good cheer captain sinn we shall this day light such a candle by gods grace in virginia as shall never be put out this was too much for old washington who went purple you dare you dare to use those words he spluttered why why its a blasphemy youre a pagan sir a brazen forehead go behind the engines colonel says jb there is no more to be said the old soldier stood fuming for a moment then turned on his heel and strode off to the far side where the other hostages were peeping over the engines looking scared come along doctor says the captain we have done what we could he hesitated in the doorway and turned to jb for the last time mr brown will you not reconsider jb stood silent staring at the ground and sinn and the doctor went out into the darkness id listened in growing consternation for there was no doubt what was coming thanks to the blind stubborn folly of that pigheaded yokel the besiegers would storm the enginehouse their first ranks would be cut down by the defenders fire and when the drunken rabble finally burst in by sheer weight of numbers theyd butcher every last one of us in a fury of spite and vengeance id not have a dogs chance of surrender or to proclaim myself to them id be just another kansas murderer to go the way of thompson and stevens and watson unless in the meantime i could make myself known to old washington and take shelter among the hostages when the final charge came home the marines would have orders to look out for them and see them safe but how to put washington wise without betraying myself to jb and even as the thought formed here came our gallant commander brushing aside something that jerry anderson was saying ordering him back to his post and moving purposefully in my direction he passed his sons bodies without a glance and loomed above me and my innards turned over at the sight of that ravaged headstone of a face with its burning eyes the tangled hair sprouting from under the old hat was dirty white like his scrub of beard and when he spoke it was like gravel under a door can you hear me joshua are you badly hurt what became of you i had my answer ready a red herring that should distract him if anything could delivered with a weary flicker of the eyelids and a tremulous whisper to let him see i was at my last gasp kagi i muttered kagi what of kagi cries he stooping over me hes dead captain says i very faint shot at the river and the others leary copeland those were the two blacks dead i think i gave a muted gasp of agony by way of business and they killed thompson too murdered used his body target practice he made a dreadful noise it was his teeth grating so they did with leeman the fool ran for the river and was taken they put a pistol to his head and he knelt down by me and there were tears on the leathery cheeks did you speak with kagi i ventured a weak shake of the head no i tried to no use too many of em ah my leg i gave just a touch of feeble thrash eyes tight shut in anguish joshua the callous ruffian actually gripped me by the shoulder what happened why did you run from the hotel that was the question of course and id been cudgelling my wits for an answer and in a heavensent flash it came to me the perfect excuse that might also be my salvation if only i played it properly the one thing that might turn this selfish lunatic from his fatal resolve kagi i whispered went to bring kagi ah too late whats that you say he was frowning in bewilderment you wanted to fetch kagi to me you mean but why playing for time while i chose my words i gave a shivering moan and bit my lip and could have cheered when he went on in a puzzled tone joe told me you had deserted i would not believe it why then joshua do you hear me speak man i decided it was time to rally a little so i forced a brave wry smile and when he asked if i was in great pain i halfraised a palsied hand and let him grip it in his horny fist not too bad thankee says i loss o blood and my leg but ill be at my post presently never fear gad i was game got a gun have you id no least intention of joining the defence but it showed the right spirit and whatever happened i wanted a piece handy he drew a colt from his belt and laid it by me asking again about kagi but i was taking my time ah thankee skipper thats fine want to go out fighting you know talk about the last act of hamlet if must i opened my eyes wide in gallant appeal must we captain what dye mean joshua says he frowning and i clenched my teeth as in sudden pain breathed a silent prayer and let him have it why i went for kagi i began gasped and went on i knew youd fight to a finish youre like me i explained with a ghastly grin no surrender what aye but the last thing kagi said to me at the farm he said at all costs josh you must see the captain safe he must live even if we die he has the voice and it must not be silenced i paused almost at the end of my tether but determined well when i saw this morning that if we waited for the slaves you know wed be cut off killed most likely i knew i must bring kagi to to talk to you make you see that your life was well too precious to lose another pathetic smile i knew you wouldnt listen to me i knew youd heed kagi though you always did made me quite jealous sometimes neer mind i stopped for another useful wince and any fool could have seen i was gathering my strength for one last noble effort i gripped his hand listen to kagi now wont you surrender for his sake inspired i drivelled on and for the sake of of all those poor black souls crying for deliverance dont fail them now live that the voice may not be silenced oh surrender now call back that captain and kagi wont have died in vain i sank back eyes closing in an exhaustion that wasnt entirely bogus for id given it all i knew fine fevered stuff in my best heroic style a deathbed variation on the theme id used when i talked wheeler into running up the white lag at cawnpore two years earlier aye but wheeler was a levelheaded soldier not an ignorant fanatic and when i opened my eyes again my heart sank for the bright eyes were as hard as ever and his mouth was turned down in a stubborn scowl he withdrew his hand from mine you too joshua says he first anderson now you he hears captain sinn talk of treason so his conscience smites him now hell not fire again on his countrys flag he says good for you jerry sanity at last and kagi you tell me and now you he gave a deep sigh and went on in a weary voice cannot you see we are all dead men if we surrender we hang and where is my voice then and if we surrender we shall have betrayed our cause and that ill not do god he was dense captain i croaked and in my desperation i forgot i was dying and came up on one elbow to whine at him in earnest dont you see if we surrender theres bound to be a trial youll be able to speak out then to tell america tell the whole world what what we came here for the cause dammit and the darkies and everything for gods sake i yammered everyone will hear you and and be inspired to carry on but if you die here why theyll never know dont you understand dye know i doubt if he did for before id done bleating he had turned his glance aside in that brooding distant way i knew so well he hadnt even noticed how suddenly id come to life i could have wept for i wanted to shout in his face listen you puddingheaded dotard im showing you the finest soapbox your bloody cause could have youll speak your piece and then youll swing and good riddance but theyll have heard you from hell to honolulu and ill be out of here alive and safe you selfish hound but it would have done no good i knew that from the grim dull set of the lined puritan face hed fixed what he called his mind and that was that he stood up moving stiffly and brushed the straw from his ragged britches i have stated my terms says he and i believe them to be honourable if they will not accept them for the sake of the prisoners he paused frowning and i wondered did he still have some wild hope that he could bluff his way out or even that the slaves would rise to his rescue he was daft enough he stood there a moment a gaunt tattered figure silhouetted by the lamp that still burned near the doorway the outline of his stark profile like that of some great bird of prey and looked slowly around the enginehouse half in shadow the light glinting on the metal of the long firecarts maybe he was reviewing what was left of his pet lambs joe on guard at the halfopen door ed coppoc at the side loophole the cherubic dauphin thompson at the rear wall emperor green stretched halfasleep on the straw his lips moving in an inaudible mutter jerry anderson dozing with his back to an engine mouth open and fair hair tousled beyond the engines i could hear the hostages stirring on the straw that and the occasional uneasy gasp and groan from oliver were the only sounds in the big gloomy shed from the dark outside came the distant sound of singing and laughter from the wager house and galts and the dull incessant murmur of the surrounding troops no ill not go back on my word it was jb calm and quiet now as though he were talking to himself i came to this place of a purpose to set free the slaves and until that is done ill not lay down my arms i came in no vindictive spirit seeking no mans blood but only to liberate those held cruelly in bondage to that end we have fought a handful of us against a great multitude to surrender now would be to deny our cause and to abandon those we fought for we have kept the faith with them and with our fallen comrades and ill not break it at the last he raised his head and looked about him again eyes bright and far away and just the glimmer of a smile on the old face it doesnt end here says he it begins they left us alone all night and you may well wonder why there were more than a thousand men ringed about that dingy building by the armoury gates besieging half a dozen very well most of em were green militia and drunken louts but there were near a hundred of americas crack regiment too the vaunted leathernecks from the halls of montezuma why the devil didnt they walk in on our pathetic rabble then and there ive heard it asked since by the usual valiant knowalls and the answer is because my old chief robert lee knew his business thats why and wasnt about to waste lives and risk the hostages by brawling in the dark when he could wait until daylight and until the spirits of those in the enginehouse were that much lower and possibly open to reason so he waited canny imperturbable lee and if that long cold night did nothing to weaken the resolve of the idiotinchief of our ridiculous garrison it played havoc with the yellow belly of the chiefofstaff cowering in his corner in despair im not at my best wounded and in the dark with corpses at my feet and not even a ray of hope visible for id quite given up the notion of making myself known to old washington i doubted if hed believe me he never came within whispering distance anyway and i didnt dare try to attract his attention what with jb prowling about armed to the teeth and joe turning every now and then to view my recumbent form with scowling suspicion id halfexpected him to be at my throat over my desertion at the wager house but of course he wasnt there was nothing he could say or do however muchhe mistrusted me we were both sailing under false colours with jb and he couldnt expose me without exposing himself but i cant pretend to know what was passing in that strange black mind i knew that from having been a loyal agent of the kuklos and devoted to atropos hed apparently found his road to damascus in the months at kennedy farm and become a worshipper of jb and a fervent enemy of slavery or at least so he said and the glimpse id had of him during the retreat to the enginehouse bore him out for hed been fighting like a ghazi blasting away and damning the militia well ive known stranger changes of heart and id seen enough of jb to know the kind of spell he could cast joe might be educated but he had all the blacks deepseated hatred of the white race and i guess jb had given him a different slant on his slave condition again he may simply have been as mad as a hatter many people are you know he was certainly in the grip of some kind of brainstorm on that last night in the enginehouse violent action does that to some folk faced with death they lose all sense of habit and ingrained conduct and their primitive nature hidden under years of custom and training comes raging out why even i in extremity have been moved to belligerence against chaps bigger than i am and run risks that i go weak to think of afterwards mind you in my case the madness dont last above a split second not with joe his derangement was permanent and it took the oddest form a growing anger against jb if that astonishes you i can only illustrate it by telling you what i heard passing between them in the long watches of that awful night i never slept you see what with distress of mind and body and there was nothing to do but lie and quake in the dark for the lamp burned out after an hour leaving us in pitch black so no one moved about much old washington came round to talk with jb at one time but i couldnt hear what they were saying it wasnt a quarrel though for their voices never rose i heard jerry anderson and emperor green croaking that theyd never understood that what they were doing was treason jerry shut up after a while but the nigger crawled under one of the engines and sobbed his soul out calling himself a pore blind fool and railing againsti b and douglass who had brought him to this misable end an he hadnt wanted to do hurt to nobody or free any niggers cos he was jes a plain pore nigger hisself an oh lawd ha mussy on an unhappy sinner his cries made a doleful chorus with the groans and pleas of young oliver who was delirious most of the time but would wake now and then with a scream and his agony was terrible to hear when he fell silent jb called his name a couple of times and then i heard him say i guess hes dead it was after this that joe pitched in his two pennorth i may have dozed for i was suddenly aware that he was nearby whispering angrily and jb was snapping back at him indeed the first words i heard were jb growling to him to keep his place and mind who he was talking to min ma place an whut place is that hey that was when i realised we had a new joe on our hands hed never have dreamed of taking that tone with jb at the farm ahll tell yuh john brown its right heah waitin to git kilt when ah should ha bin in the hills this minute thats wheah ma place should ha been you forget yourself joseph jb sounded more shocked than angry get to your post my boy and no more of this ah aint forgettin nothin you the one thats forgettin how we was goin to free the niggers and make an army in the hills wheah is they all them slaves you was goin to free that was goin to come in to us you nevah looked near em you didnt try to rouse em all you

fine talk an promises an gittin us trapped an all git kilt cos highn mighty john brown aint got the brains of a buzzard an didnt need to cud ha been in the hills right now rousin the niggers to tear up you white slavin bastards if youd jes listened the oily double click of a colt hammer stopped him dead and i knew jb was covering him get to your post joe his voice was firm but almost gentle i might shoot you for mutiny but you are not in your right mind so i have not heard you now go there was a long moment in which i held my breath in sudden excitement for jb didnt know what he was dealing with the blinding speed with which joe could unlimber and fire suppose he blew the old man to blazes we might win clear yet arrange a surrender no joe himself would never allow that hed likely try to shoot his way clear go says jb again while i strained my eyes uselessly against the darkness and then there was the shuffle of the straw as joe turned away and went to the open doorway i saw his outline for a moment against the night sky glowing faintly with the torches of the besiegers then he crouched down in the shadow i could picture the black face contorted with anger glaring out into the night whod have thought it eh joe of all people to tell jb the truth to his face much good it would do now oh lord why hadnt i lain doggo in the hotel loft instead of barging about like a headless fowl i might have been snug and warm and larruping mrs popplewell this minute why hadnt i bolted from the farm or jumped out of the train to hagerstown or dived down an alley in new york why for that matter had i let myself be lured into that washington hotel by the designing dwarf mandeville and gone like a lustful lamb to the slaughter with springs diabolical daughter or slavered after that doughfaced heifer in calcutta that had been less than a year ago and here i was like a rat in a pit awaiting the terriers and around me the blackness was fading to grey figures and objects were coming into view in the dim interior of the enginehouse and in the distance a cock was crowing there was a stirring in the surrounding host a whistle blowing shouts of command and the clatter of equipment the militia were standing to a kettle drum began to beat in a sharp staccato roll followed by the tramp of marching feet washington stood up beyond the engines listening with his grey head to one side signing to the other hostages to be still jb was already on his feet he put down his sharps carefully examined the cylinder of his pistol and finally drew fredericks sword with a slow grating noise that had every head turning towards him stand to your arms men says he be ready for a sudden rush i picked up the pistol hed given me and checked the loads with trembling fingers god alone knew what i was going to do with it but i wanted it ready god knew what i was going to do about anything if it came to that wait and fight back my fear and hope for some miracle i eased myself up against the wall moving my wounded leg id flexed and tested it in the darkness and knew it would bear my weight the flesh around the bloody pock caused by the slug was one great black bruise and it ached abominably but that mattered less than the stiffness in my joints could i run if need be i hauled myself up by the wall leaned on the limb and almost came a cropper jesus id be lucky if i could manage a hobble i clung to the rough brick for support the sweat running off me for all that it was bitter cold jb glanced round and saw me for a second he seemed puzzled then he gave me a grim approving nod faithful to the last hed be thinking someone comin capn jerry anderson was at a loophole shrill with excitement two officers an they aint armed oh capn dont shoot em we dont want to fight no more i was lurching along the wall before the words were well out of his mouth clinging to the brickwork like a stricken lizard and praying that my leg wouldnt betray me for the news hed shouted could mean only one thing another parley before the storm and i was going to be in on it if i had to crawl every inch of the way pain stabbed through my knee and id have fallen if i hadnt wrenched jerrys carbine from his hand and thrust it into the ground as a crutch it was too short by half and i tottered there like long john silver in drink roaring for assistance until emperor whod emerged from under the engine where hed been weeping gave me a shoulder jb was already at the doorway cocking his rifle motioning joe to stand aside when i arrived at a stumbling run grabbing at the closed side of the door jb shot me a startled look so i gave him a glaring grin a hand on the colt in my waistband to let him see i was at his side ready to sell my life dearly he said nothing and we both turned our eyes to the crack of the door two men were walking towards us a tall blackavised fellow striding like a guardsman and a smaller chap in the darkandlight blue of the us marines but what took my eye was the dense throng of people watching hardly more than a long stones throw away there were hundreds of em among the armoury sheds and outside the gates on the open ground towards the railroad tracks militia mostly but many townsmen and women and children too all spellbound in a strange silence broken only by the steady tread of the two approaching officers they stopped about twenty yards off conferring then the marine turned and marched back and the big fellow came on alone more slowly he wore what looked like a cavalry cloak and uniform cap an erect soldierly figure and i was wondering where id seen him before when it dawned he was devilish like me not a double perhaps and lacking a couple of inches of my height but like enough what with his handsome head broad shoulders and damnyoumlad carriage he walked up to the door and jb shoved out his carbine and demanded his business james stuart lieutenant first cavalry says he in a pleasant southern voice am i addressing mr smith jb pushed the door wider and stuart surveyed him a moment with keen blue eyes before glancing briefly at me propped panting against the timber and looking like the last survivor of fort despair i dont doubt he pulled a paper from his breast and offered it to jb i have a communication from my superiors colonel lee commanding the troops and mr messervy of the treasury department he added his eyes averted from me and as i caught his slight emphasis on the second name and realised what it meant i almost cried out he knew who i was and was letting me know it of course he must have had my description from messervy himself and had recognised me under all the blood and filth the alert resourceful subaltern i was to form a good opinion of jeb stuart in later years but i never held him in higher esteem than at that moment for whatever happened now even if jb refused to chuck in the towel and it came to a final storming party the attackers would be looking out for me and id be immune and safe at last even as stuart at jbs request began to read the letter aloud i was warily scanning the distant spectators the militia the marines a group of officers apart a regimentallooking buffer in civilian duds astride a horse by the trees and sure enough a tall graceful figure pacing leisurely to and fro by his stirrup messervy all careless elegance at six in the morning people were crowding behind us to hear the message washington a couple of other hostages jerry and joe absolutely breathing down my neck it was a plain demand for surrender promising that wed be held pending orders from president buchanan but that if we resisted lee couldnt answer for our safety jb listened in grim silence and if youd been there and seen that huge crowd hemming us in and the militia standing to their arms and out before them the navy frocks and skyblue pants and white belts of the marines drawn up at attention well youd have known he must give in at last but damme if he didnt come straight back at stuart with his own impudent demand that we be allowed to march out unmolested and given time to get clear away stuart said politely that there could be no terms butlees and still the stubborn jackass went at him sounding ever so calm and reasonable never raising his voice but keeping his carbine trained on stuarts midriff and refusing to budge let us go or wed fight to the end how long these futile exchanges lasted i dont know jeb said later that it was a long parley but they became quite heated with washington and his friends joining in begging stuart to bring lee in person stuart shaking his head jerry protesting that he hadnt known it was treason joe grunting most alarmingly in my ear and jb prosing away blandly as though he were passing the time of day with a fellowidler on a street corner at one point he asked if he and the lieutenant hadnt met before and jeb smiled and said yes when his cavalry had dispersed jbs riders after some scrimmage on the santa fe trail three years before you were ossawatomie brown in those days says he and jb said solemnly that he was glad to see that jeb was well and prospering in the service you behaved with great good sense on that occasion says stuart will you not do the same now and spare many lives my life is a small thing says jb i am not afraid to lose it i dare say not says stuart it may be forfeit sooner than you think that is all one to me says jb well im sorry says stuart but if you are determined and there is no more to be said there he paused and all of a sudden there was that electric feeling in the air that comes in moments of crisis jb sensed it his hand tightened on his carbine stock and imperceptibly stuart shifted his weight from his heels to his toes he hadnt looked at me since that first glance but now he did without any expression at all and then his eyes travelled to the colt at my waist and back to my face again before returning to jb all in a couple of seconds while jb waited for him to finish his sentence and stuart waited for me i could hear messervys voice in that washington office clear as a bell john brown must die somewhere along the road for the sake of this country and tens of thousands of american lives he must not survive for martyrdom stuart glanced at me again and ive no wish to impute anything to a chivalrous southern gentleman but if his look wasnt saying mr messervys compliments and if youll be good enough to shoot the old bastard on the spot and roll out of harms way hell be much obliged to you then ive never seen an unspoken invitation in my life he didnt have a hope not my style at all especially not in the immediate presence of a highly unpredictable coloured gentleman who was one of the fastest guns id ever seen and had been itching to give me lead poisoning for months ive often wondered how joe in his excited condition would have reacted to the assassination of his erstwhile hero but id no intention of finding out i let my right hand fall loose at my side and what happened next is history stuarts versions is a masterpiece of nonchalance so soon as i could tear myself away i left the door and waved my cap id say he tore himself away at the speed of light sideways like a leaping salmon but i didnt see him wave because even as he sprang the marines were charging forward from fifty yards away bayonets fixed with the little officer brandishing his sword and jb was letting fly a shot and slamming the door to all in one movement unfortunately he closed it on my injured leg and for several seconds i took no further interest being blind with agony and rolling on the floor in which time he and joe had jammed the bar into place coppoc and young thompson were blazing away through gaps in the door timbers at the advancing marines and emperor green burst into tears and tried to hide behind an engine it had happened in split seconds one moment peaceful parley the next carbines and revolvers booming in the confined space the hostages diving for cover jerry yelling no no we surrender the doors shuddering to the blows of sledgehammers wielded by the leading marines a great roaring and cheering without and shouts of defiance within mingling with the crash of shots and splintering of timbers black powder smoke filling the enginehouse in a stifling cloud and flashy scrambling away as fast as his game leg would take him intent on rounding the engines to take cover among the hostages i didnt get even halfway there was a rending crash behind me and as i clung to the nearer engine for support i saw that a bottom section of the battered door was caving in the planks were starting asunder and through the narrow gaps could be seen glimpses of the attackers jb had stepped away to reload his carbine joe had his back to the door stretching sideways to shoot through a ragged hole in the wood and suddenly he screamed like a wounded horse and staggered away from the door clutching his left arm behind him a bloody bayonet point was jutting through the planks stand firm men bawls jb sell your lives dearly he ran to the shattered section of the door stooping to shove his sharps through the opening and firing either side of him the two boys coppoc and thompson were shooting through the gaps pointblank at the marines heaving at the outside of the door joe had halffallen a couple of yards behind jb he came up on one knee his black face demonically contorted with rage and pain mouthing curses that were lost in the uproar jb turned and shouted gesturing to him to come on courage joe dont give in now i cant explain what followed though ive had more than half a century to think about it i can only tell you that joe let out a terrible anguished cry and levelled his pistol at jb the old man was turned away revolver in one hand and carbine in tother shooting through the halfwrecked door when joe squeezed the trigger and his piece misfired he screamed wordlessly and i can only think that all the fury he felt at jbs failure betrayal id heard him call it had welled up at the last when death was staring him in the face and he was venting it on the old fellow in a fit of blind anger as a passionate child will strike out at a parent that i can accept what i cannot explain is what happened in the next second when joe thumbed back the hammer for a second shot and i put two bullets in his back i cant pretend i was consciously trying to save jb why should i when id no thought for any life but my own and god knows i owed him nothing i drew and fired as instinctively as you throw up a hand to ward an unexpected blow dick burton who fancies himself a psychologist says i gave way to a primitive impulse of racesurvival and killed joe because he was black and jb was white would i have shot kagi or stevens if theyd been in joes place grins clever dick likely not but snooks to you burton id not have shot mrs popplewell or ketshwayo either because i quite liked them you see and kagi and stevens while i detested joe so perhaps it comes to this that deep down for all the harm and horror he did me i must have quite liked old jb well enough at any rate not to have him shot by that black sonofabitch if i could help it anyway i settled joe and he went down like a riven oak his pistol exploding into the floor as he fell and at that moment the bottom of the door gave way with a tremendous rending of timber and through it like a ferret from its hole came the little marine officer flourishing his sword he plunged straight past jb i threw myself aside and he darted round the engines yelling to the hostages to stand clear washington sang out theres old ossawatomie pointing over the engine to jb who was standing erect before the doorway throwing lead for all he was worth as the marines came bursting and yelling through the shattered wreckage of the door their bayonets at the present i believe he downed two of them for i saw one reel away clutching his face with blood running through his fingers and another pitched headlong at his feet and then the little officer was on him like a wildcat thrusting at his body jb tumbled forward and as the officer hacked at his head i saw that the blade was bent at rightangles he hammered away at the old fellows skull and all around was screaming struggling confusion as the leathernecks came surging in bayonetting everything in sight jerry anderson was skewered to the floor shrieking horribly as he tried to dive beneath an engine young thompson was flung bodily against the back wall and pinned kicking like a beetle by several blades someone was bellowing quarter quarter we surrender everywhere were snarling faces glittering steel swirling smoke but never a shot now for the last of our people was down or overpowered and the marines had been ordered not to fire one of them a redfaced corporal glaring like a madman and roaring inarticulately came lunging out of the press of struggling men his bayonet driving at me and as i threw myself back the little officer thrust him aside shouting not him prisoner and i echoed him bellowing not me im a hostage the corporal fairly howled with disappointment but kept his point to my breast as i struggled into the corner my hands raised and as i sat there trembling there was a long bubbling scream from above and thompsons body streaming blood slid down the wall beside me and collapsed across my legs he was still alive for i felt him give a convulsive shudder then he was still and as he died so did the shouting and confusion the harpers ferry raid was over i reckon about two minutes had passed since stuart jumped aside at the doorway and in that brief terrible scrimmage four men had died which was fewer than id have guessed as i gazed in horror at the shambles there was blood everywhere spattering the walls and soaking the straw and more bodies strewn on the floor than there were men standing up or so it seemed a marine was slumped against the post of the nowopen door ahead of me clasping a hand to his wounded face another lay still across the threshold jb was lying face down his white head horribly dabbled and beside him joe was on his back his pistol in his hand the bodies of oliver watson and taylor lay close by jerry anderson was twitching in death beneath the engine and thompson his girls face slack and ugly under the blond curls lay lifeless on my legs until the marine corporal rolled him clear the only unwounded raiders seemed to be emperor green who was crouched wailing against the wall and young ed coppoc who was looking pretty cool considering that four leathernecks were standing over them with bayonets poised the officer was shepherding the hostages out through the other door which had been unbarred and an almighty cheer went up from the crowds outside as they passed into the open air there was a time when id have lain shivering from shock after such an ordeal i might even have wept at the carnage around me but as i sprawled exhausted in that enginehouse watching the marines making short work of heaving the bodies and woundedaway i felt nothing but a huge blissful weariness and a growing exultation the nightmare that had begun at the cape when i heard springs tread on the deck overhead was surely past and done with now the frantic days and nights when crixus and atropos and the damned yankee bogies had plunged me into this mad business the long months of weariness while jb mismanaged his preparations the terror of the raid and this final horror in the enginehouse i was here safe and whole with nothing but two paltry scratches that did no more thanache coated with blood and filth to be sure but who minds that when you see before your eyes what might have been young handsome oliver of the merry laugh brash eager jerry anderson poor daft taylor gone to explore his spirit world dauphin thompson who had blushed like a maiden if you so much as asked him the time all being dragged out by the heels to lie in the mud under blankets bad luck lads but sooner you than me jb and watson were still alive so they carried them away on stretchers the old mans hair was stiff with dried blood and one hand dangled from the stretcher like a skinny brown claw then they marched out the two prisoners which left me and the corporal and the late joe simmons i made shift to rise but the leatherneck growled to me to stay put those were his orders i didnt mind lying there holding my private little thanksgiving service and listening to the distant murmur of the mob outside and after a while marines came at the double placing lanterns on the engines shrouding fhe broken windows and loopholes heaving the wrecked door into place and closing it behind the little officer and a tall civilian in a tile hat and frock messervy surveying the ruin impassively prodding at joes corpse with his walking stick and then picking his way carefully through the bloody straw to where i lay he looked down at me stroking his moustache with a gloved finger the longjawed yankee corinthian as ever was and just the sight of him looking so cool and civilised cheered me up even further well well says he how are you i couldnt be bothered to think of a smart answer so i said pretty fair he asked if i was wounded and when i told him he sighed removed his hat and gloves looked for a place to put them declined the corporals offer to hold them and finally set them down on the engine then he stooped to examine my neck and knee nothing that soap and water wont cure says he mr green would you be good enough to bring them yourself with bandages a towel some spirits and a marine cloak and cap he rose smoothing his coat and resumed his hat and gloves now i want a marine guard round this building no one to be allowed closer than twenty yards that he indicated joes body is to be removed after dark and buried away from the town and the burial party are then to forget all about it this gentleman he turned to me never existed youll not mention him and if questions are asked by anyone you never heard of him is that clear green nodded looking keen corporal you understand what genleman are you referrin to sir asks the leatherneck staring to his front messervy gave a faint smile i beg your pardon i should have said sergeant shouldnt i mr green yes sir beams green ill see to it capital now ill be leaving here presently with someone in a marine coat and cap we are to be ignored and i trust by that time you will have dispersed any gaping sightseers the soap and water now if you please they were all i needed to complete my restoration and when green had brought them and left us alone i sluiced away the filth with a will i felt as though i was cleansing myself of harpers ferry and john brown and the whole disgusting business the wounds looked clean enough and when id clapped on the dressings messervy helped me with the bandages talking to the point as usual brown is not only alive but surprisingly well and damned talkative which as you know is the last thing we wanted the old brute must be made of leather run through the kidneys the doctor tells me and has lost any amount of blood though youd not know it to hear him conversing like a politician which i suspect he is he knotted my neck bandage and stepped back pity you didnt shoot him twould have saved a few lives today and who knows how many hereafter well mine wouldnt have been one of em says i not with joe crowding me in that doorway ah yes joe he glanced at the body your work i take it the marines had orders not to shoot settling a score were you accident he got in the way when i was sighting on brown why shouldnt i get credit by pretending id tried to do messervys dirty work for him since you were so allfired eager to have brown dead why didnt you get the marines to do it when they stormed this place or have someone shoot him yesterday hang it he was walking around town large as life why dont you slip something in his dinner now and dont tell me it aint your style unofficial death warrants have a habit of recoiling says he coolly my countrymen have one great failing they talk too much aye so you shanghai some poor bloody foreigner to do the job well i didnt have the ghost of a chance until today and ill tell you messervy i aint apologising i served your turn because that damned little squirt seward put a pistol to my head but why the hell should i murder for you tell me that he shrugged leaning against the engine and stirring the straw with his cane it would have been convenient now the law must take its course and god only knows where that will lead still thats not your affair i guess you did what you could to keep brown out of virginia youre damned right a pity your own people didnt do as much i still cant fathom it you knew what he intended where he was who his backers were what men and money he had confound it you knew the very bloody place here why in gods name didnt you stop him you and i tried says he but we aint politicians what did you call us government ruffians he wrinkled his fine nose and became businesslike thats neither here nor there the sooner youre out of this the better hurrah for that lord lyons he dont want to see you yes theres been a word in his ear from the very highest quarter and warm in your praise it has been too but he agrees with us that theres no useful purpose to be served by prolonging your presence in this country a moment longer than need be sensible chap when do i leave you catch the baltimore train tonight from the station over the way its a train youre probably familiar with says he drily since your friend brown held it up two nights ago it is now running normally at baltimore theres a berth already reserved for you on a packet sailing for liverpool tomorrow its paid for and this he handed me an envelope is three hundred dollars to cover expenses en route for which id like a signed receipt in the name of comber i suggest ill say this for the americans they waste no time why by tomorrow night id be at sea with all this horror behind me a couple of weeks and id be in england home with elspeth and my indian honours thick upon me and warm praise conveyed by diplomatic channels it was too good to be true and standing there in that beastly bloodstained shed with the reek of powder smoke and the stench of death i felt the tears start to my eyes and absolutely had to turn away messervy brought me back to earth ive arranged quarters here where you can wait unobserved until the train comes in tonight go straight aboard keep to your cabin until you reach baltimore then take a cab directly to the dock and the ship all your tickets and directions are in the envelope with the money in the meantime you can shave off your beard and ill furnish you with some decent clothes keep your collar up and your hat down no sense in taking risks thats a word that always makes me raise an eyebrow what risk i asked and received one of his ironic looks well now i dont suppose youd want to run into anyone from the underground railroad or the kuklos on the street would you not that you havent served their turn admirably john brown has run his raid which is what they both wanted and while crixus will go into deep mourning when he learns the result id say atropos will be drinking your health with three times three still better not to renew their acquaintance dont you think at the mention of their names id started like the dear gazelle i hadnt given them a thought since the raid began but now ill telegraph to have someone keep an eye open in baltimore anyway he reassured me those kuklos operators are still in the tombs by the way and if atropos set other men to watch you what of it he shrugged he certainly has no reason to wish you harm after this splendid debacle he doesnt know about that he pointed his cane at joes body and he never will no right now hell be congratulating himself on five thousand dollars well spent he can keep it for me says i and meant it youre right though why hell think ive done him proud which you have says he drily prouder than you did crixus or the us government not that your efforts arent appreciated he was peering through a crack in the makeshift door i think we might venture out now the citizens seem to have lost interest in the sight of marines guarding a dilapidated firehouse though i dare say the souvenir seekers will be stripping it bare shortly what you dont care to take a brick as a memento there were still a number of folk idling beyond the armoury gates staring hopefully through the railings but our way led into the armoury proper where messervy had commandeered an office guarded by two beefy civilians in hard hats one of them brought me an enormous fry from the wager house with a jug of coffee and i smiled to think what the little waiter would have said if hed known who the customer was from that i turned inevitably to fond memories of the generous mrs popplewell gad shed been an unexpected windfall splendidly equipped if you like abundance which i must say i do after a long abstinence resourceful lass too finding me a bolthole and loyal the way shed answered back those ruffians whod been threatening her aye shed served her turn in more ways than one bless her black bounties there was a cot in the office but i was too excited to sleep so i followed messervys advice and removed my face furniture all but the moustache and whiskers of course its a great delight to see your chin again after a hard slog in the field reminds you that there are finer things in life like england and home and sleeping sound and strolling down piccadilly with your hat on three hairs and women and drink and elspeth i was grinning at myself in the mirror when messervy bowled in and told me to put on my cap and coat double quick and to muffle up well he had something to show me i followed him wondering along an alley between the armoury buildings he stopped at a door and told me to pull my cap well down over my brows stay close behind me says he softly and led the way there was an open inner door ahead with mens backs turned to us messervy went right up behind them and i followed peering over his shoulder the little room was crowded with people standing and sitting all intent on a man lying propped up on a palette against the far wall and i bit back a gasp it was jb hed never been a happy sight but now he looked like the proceeds of a grave robbery theyd washed the blood out of his hair and beard and given him a clean shirt but his face was gaunt and pallid tight over the bones and there were dark stains under the sunken eyes but they were burning still with that same grim fire and his voice was harsh and strong as ever for he was croaking away on the old line about how hed come to free the slaves and for no other purpose no one had sent him here but god and jb or the devil if that was how they chose to view it and he could have got clear away but had been concerned for his hostages and had wanted to reassure anyone who thought he was only there to burn and kill someone cried out that he had killed people going quietly about the streets jb replied that he didnt know about that and had done his best to save lives hed been fired on repeatedly without shooting back thats not so cries another why you killed an unarmed man by the tracks yes and another one jb turned his head with an effort and pointed a talon at the speaker see here my friend its useless to contradict your own people who were my prisoners they will tell you otherwise there was a babble of protests and questions and i saw that two fellows sitting close to him had pencils and notebooks newspaper reporters if youll credit it the rest of them were sober citizens lee was there and a dignified cove who i believe was the governor and jeb stuart with a face like thunder and all crying out and badgering away at the old beggar and him with a hole clear through to his kidneys and his head cut to bits my first thought was why you bloody vandals i dont shock easy and have no more of the milk of human kindness than youd put in a cup of tea ill taunt and gloat over a fallen foe any day and put a boot in his ribs if he sasses back but im a brute and a bully these were your upstanding pillars of society bursting with christian piety and love thy neighbour and here they were shaking their sanctimonious heads as they harassed and goaded a seemingly dying man aye and feasted their eyes on him as though he were a beast in a circus when youd have thought that decency demanded that he be let alone they even had the effrontery to argue and hector him now that he was beat and helpless id have liked to see em argue with him eight hours back when he was standing up with his guns on why flashy you ask this aint pity or sentiment surely not a bit of it dont mistake disgust and contempt for the tormentor with compassion for the victim i didnt pity jb one jot but i was enraged at first sight by those worthy ghouls enjoying the sensation and as i watched him old and stricken and frail answering so calm and courteous well i couldnt help thinking good for you jb thats your sort and then it dawned on me that the old bugger was fairly revelling in it hed got his audience at last hadnt he just the first of that worldwide congregation who would revere his name and sing his song and enshrine him in history forever ill swear he knew it lee had asked him if hed like the mob excluded but jb wouldnt hear of it come one come all was his style so that he could preach to as many as possible that they were enemies whod come to vent their abomination of him and his notions or to gloat or just to indulge their curiosity made it all the better for him he could answer their harrying and abuse with urbanity and resolution and thats where the legend was born believe me in that shabby little paymasters office for in whatever spirit they came they left in something like awe and admiration the gamest man i ever saw the governor said and jeb stuart remarked to me years later that without men like jb there wouldnt be an america you see like so many legends it was true he deserved their respect and didnt he know how to make the most of it the vain old showoff here were his enemies the ungodly oppressors of the enslaved against whom hed struggled for years whod cursed him for a border cutthroat and nothing more and now they were hanging on his words recognising him in dead earnest with wonder and no little fear ironic aint it hed failed and found his triumph wounded and doomed he was a man uplifted and he laid it off to them with his matchless mixture of deep sincerity and sheer damned humbug you can read all three hours of it in the new york papers of the time and its an education i heard only some of the words but they should be enough to give you the tune which was truly extraordinary there he was wounded in half a dozen places too weak to stand fagged out and facing certain death and talking as easily and pleasantly as though he were in a drawingroom answering their questions like a kindly old professor dealing with backward students when a young militia greenhorn scoffed that he couldnt have hoped to achieve anything with just a handful of men jb looked him over smiled and said patiently well perhaps your ideas and mine on military matters would differ materially and when another demanded that he justify his acts he sighed as though explaining something to a dunce for the umpteenth time i dont wish to be offensive but i think my friend that you of the south are guilty of a great wrong against god and humanity i believe it is perfectly right for anyone to ah interfere with you so far as to free those you wickedly and wilfully hold in bondage please understand i dont say this insultingly he went on to lecture them on the golden rule of doing unto others as they would have others do unto them which for some reason put jeb stuart in a bait for he accused jb of not believing in the bible and got a pained look and a gentle certainly i do in reproof jeb the ass came back at him when someone asked how much hed paid his followers and jb said no wages whatever jeb cried out piously the wages of sin is death to which jb replied gently i would not have made such a remark to you if you had been a prisoner and wounded in my hands he rubbed salt in it by observing that he could have killed jeb just as easy as a mosquito they tried to make him tell who his northern backers were and got nowhere any questions that i can honourably answer i will says he and when they quoted a letter in the papers from a prominent yankee abolitionist predicting a slave uprising he even raised a laugh by saying drily that he hadnt had the opportunity of reading the new york herald for the past day or two more soberly he went on i wish to say that all you people of the south should prepare yourselves for a settlement of the slave question and the sooner you are prepared the better you may dispose of me very easily i am almost disposed of now but the question is still to be settled once or twice i regret to say he lied he claimed that hed been wounded after i had consented to surrender for the benefit of others not for my own he didnt surrender ever not that i heard he also claimed that he had not impressed any slave against his will and to my astonishment someone called out i know of one negro who wanted to go back and who should it be but aaron stevens lying on a palette farther along the wall i had to crane my neck to see him mighty pale with a bloody bandage on his chest who that negro was i dont know but jbs biggest stretcher was that hed done his damnedest not to kill anyone i dare say he meant it but youve read my account and can judge for yourselves when someone called him a fanatic he bristled up and said they were the fanatics not he at which the governor weighed into him telling him his silver head was red with crime and hed do well to start thinking of eternity jb put him down in his best style governor says he cheerfully judging by appearances i have about fifteen or twenty years start on you in the journey to that eternity of which you so kindly warn me fifteen years or fifteen hours im ready to go the difference between your tenure of life and mine is only a trifle and i tell you to be prepared all you who hold slaves have more need to be prepared than i its going to be worse than i feared says messervy when we were back in my quarters far worse if only he didnt sound so almighty reasonable and and saintly damn it he was more upset than id seen him absolutely tweaked his moustache instead of stroking it what did you think of him from an english point of view i mean what i was thinking was that i was damned glad id shot joe when i did im as sentimental as the next man you see from an english point of view well theyd not take him in whites not sure about the reform though oh very well seriously then they maynt put him up in trafalgar square in place of nelson but itll be a closerun thing if you hang him that is put him in a madhouse and nobodyll notice hes not mad says messervy im not sure he wasnt the sanest man in that room no hell hang before the next election fortunately or hed be liable to beat seward for the republican nomination join me in a drink my sorrows are in need of submersion he poured them out i ask myself if he talks like that when hes shot full of holes what will he be like when hes better and standing up in court with every paper in the country reporting him well be lucky says he thoughtfully if this doesnt lead to war well we must just hope for the best i thought he was talking through his hat one crazy farmer being topped for murder and treason didnt strike me as a reasonable casus belli which shows how much i knew but it didnt matter to me anyway so i devoted myself to the brandy and contemplation of home while he sat meditating finally he gave a little rueful smile and said reflectively dye know flashman sometimes i wish i had presidential power and the whole us treasury to draw on secretly i said id fancy it rather above half myself and what had he in mind at this moment ill tell you id consider very seriously paying you and pinkerton a fortune to rescue john brown from the clutches of the law and spirit him to canada twould be an international scandal i dare say and a great rattling of sabres but ive no doubt buchanan and palmerston could settle it without too much fuss possibly with the assistance of prince albert and our northern liberals interesting idea dont you think highly diverting what good would that do apart from sparing us a martyr it would unite north and south as nothing else could perfidious albion meddling in our most sacred private quarrel even the diehard abolitionists would be up in arms against you you could have him shot trying to escape says cynical flashy too late now says he and closed his eyes if only he could have stopped a bullet in that enginehouse if only that ass green had been carrying a sabre instead of his toy sword what we might have been spared well we can only leave it to the lawyers and politicians and the great american public now weve come to the parting of the trails jbs and mine and high time too if you ask me he was to take the high road to the gallows and immortal fame and i the low road to well ill come to that in a moment first i should tell you briefly and at second hand what happened to him in the little time that was left to him and the momentous effect it had on america and i dare say on the world my last memory of him is in that paymasters office propped up on his mattress battered but brighteyed not two pounds of his stringy old carcase hanging straight but laying down the law in his best accustomed style god help him and i suppose i must say god bless him too for forms sake of all the men of wrath who have disturbed my chequered course hes about the only one towards whom i feel no ill will old pest and all that he was he was decent enough to me and if he led me through hell and high water well you might as well blame the lightning or the whirlwind i wasnt there to see his departure from the ferry next day but he came near to being lynched there was a great crowd full of drink and fury when they put him on the train to charles town he and stevens had to be carried through the throng baying for their blood in panic as well as rage for the wildest rumours were flying that the raid had been only the prelude to a general invasion that the slaves were on the brink of rebellion that a great conspiracy was brewing in the north it was even reported that a family in a village just a few miles from the ferry had been massacred but when lee went galloping to the scene he found everyone safe in bed and the slaves tranquil the fact was that not a single slave had joined in the raid other than those taken by stevens from washingtons farm and places nearby and most of them had slipped off home as soon as they could or been passive altogether but the mischief was done a great thrill of fear ran through the south virginia was preparing for war some places were under martial law dixie suspected that it was sitting on a black powderkeg ready to explode and the storm that broke in the newspapers only added to the hysteria one of lees first acts had been to send jeb stuart to the kennedy farm where they found all jbs papers and correspondence with the names of his northern supporters which the brilliant old conspirator had left behind in a carpet bag and once the democrats and proslavery journals got hold of the names the fat was in the fire the black republicans the secret six and even moderate abolitionists became the villains of the day plotting to wreak havoc in the south and among those who came in for special vilification and serve him right was william h seward the cigarchewing blighter whod blackmailed me into the business in new york he was the arch agitator who is responsible for this insurrection and for all i know this may have cost him the presidency it did no good for him and other northerners including lincoln to condemn the raid all the south could hear was the growing peal of admiration for brown the champion of liberty which came even from those who deplored what brown the raider had done you can see the souths point of view he was a murderous old brigand who was out to overthrow them and you can see the norths he was a fearless crusader who wanted only to set black men free both views were true and one cant blame the southerners for believing that he represented the north in its true colours or the north for believing as one speaker put it that whether his acts had been right or wrong jb himself was right the truth was that hed fuelled the passions of the wildest elements on both sides and convinced even sensible and moderate people that the only answer was disunion or war his trial which began only a week after the raid fulfilled messervys glummest fears here was the poor old hero so weak and wounded that he had to be toted into court on a cot submitting to his fate with christian patience in fact he wasnt as poorly as he looked and could walk when he had to and he put on the performance of his life telling them hed never asked for quarter and if they wanted his blood they could have it there and then without the mockery of a trial as to his defence he was utterly unable to attend to it my memory dont serve me my health is insufficient although improving i am ready for my fate ill bet there wasnt a dry eye from cape cod to cincinnati the trial was a formality or a farce if you like much was made of the speed with which it took place but if theyd given him until it would have made no difference for there could be no question of his guilt or the penalty his lawyers would have had him plead insanity but the old fox wouldnt hear of it and dye know if id been called to testify on the point id have had to back him up i know that in these pages ive frequently called him mad and lunatic and suggested his rightful place was in a padded cell but thats just flashy talking we all say such things without meaning that the object of our censure is seriously deranged no he wasnt mad read his letters his speeches the things he said to reporters and take the word of one who knew him well a fanatic yes a man driven by one burning idea certainly a fool in some things perhaps but never a madman it wasnt a long trial but seems to have had some interesting features one of the prosecutors was too drunk to plead they say and tother was the father of one of the men whod murdered bill thompson on the bridge none of that or the legal wrangling about jurisdiction and delays was of the least importance only one thing mattered and that was the bearing of the accused thats what the world remembers the brave old border soldier calm dignified and unflinching rising gamely to speak with a chap supporting him either side lying patiently on his cot as sentence of death was passed closing his eyes in unconcern and pulling the blankets up beneath his chin even the most hardbitten proslavers couldnt but admire the conscientiousness the honour and the supreme bravery of the man you may imagine what the good ladies of concord and boston thought and the fervour with which they wept and prayed for him they made the mistake of giving him a months grace before he was topped which meant that all america could picture the gallant lonely old martyr in his cell worn with struggle but wonderfully cheerful waiting with quiet courage for the end it gave the wiser heads time for second thoughts some suggested that he should be jailed or put in an asylum for they knew the revulsion with which his execution would be greeted not only in america but the world they knew that his martyrdom would only harden the resolve of the north to carry on his campaign and the determination of the south to resist on the other hand there were those who hoped that his death would hasten the rupture between north and south which they regarded as inevitable messervys notion of a rescue occurred to others by the way there was a plot but when jb heard of it he wanted no part of it he wanted to die im sure of that because like the wiser heads he could see clearly what it would lead to the last note he wrote on the morning of his execution put it plain i john brown am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood i had as now think vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done they hanged him outside charles town virginia on december the second before a great host of troops among whom were john wilkes booth who murdered lincoln six years later and stonewall jackson he didnt kiss a little black child on his way to the gallows as the sentimentalists like to believe but as he rode on his coffin across the meadow he looked around and said this is a beautiful country i never had the pleasure of seeing it before when they asked if he wanted a signal before they dropped him he said it didnt matter but he didnt want to be kept waiting his admirers of course treasure such details but what struck me peculiar when i read about it and made me think yes thats my old jb was that he was hanged in his carpet slippers they rang the bells for him in the north and there was talk of statues and memorials and such an outpouring of eulogy and grief and noble sentiment as would have done credit to joan of arc and lord nelson together i doubt if any man in the history of the united states was more deeply or sincerely mourned and i aint forgetting friend abraham either he was even more detested in dixie than jb and he was just a politician while jb was a fighting man and a rebel a combination which no american can resist even in the south they respected him for his courage i remember the verdict delivered to me during the civil war of a grizzled alabama veteran crimson with booze and chewing on his wheeling tobey ole ossawatomie well now suh ah reckon he lived like a skunk an died like a lion im not arguing you know my views on bravery and by now you should know em on jb he was a bit of a crook and a lot of a humbug and he put me through the mangle and theres a case to be made for saying he was the most evil influence ever let loose in north america threequarters of a million is a powerful lot of dead men to say nothing of wounded and crippled and bereaved you may say their great war would have happened anyway but hes bound to bear some of the blame maybe he would have thought it a price worth paying for the destruction of slavery but i say slavery would have ended anyway without the war and without him but thats no business of mine i came through harpers ferry and the war that followed so he did me no lasting damage though he scared the innards out of me and took a year out of my life i can tolerate him at my time of life and when i hear the grandlings singing the old song i can look hack if not with pride at least with a curious satisfaction as the young faces pass by in memory kagi stevens oliver watson leeman cook taylor ed coppoc the thompsons dear old dangerous newby and all the other ghosts white and black whose features have faded and last of all the grizzled old ironside with his eagle face and burning eyes no doubt my satisfaction is because im still here and theyre all long gone one way or another watson died of his wounds coppoc and green whod survived the enginehouse fight were hanged two weeks after jb as was cook who got himself captured in maryland the duffer stevens survived the four bullets they took out of him but was hanged in the spring of with hazlett whod escaped from the ferry but was caught later the black who was with him in the arsenal got clear away and so did the fellows whom jb sent back with the wagon to collect arms and the men whod been left behind at the farm meriam whod brought the six hundred dollars and tidd and another of the young men and owen brown all those who escaped served in the civil war except owen who lived to a ripe old age like your humble obedient as i say i take no pride in my part in harpers ferry and was a damned unwilling actor but well i was one of john browns pet lambs after all and dine out on it regular and am redeemed in the eyes of such as miss prentice and others of the elect who figure that an old man however deplorable must have some good in him if he stood at armageddon and battled for the poor downtrodden darkies they dont know about joe of course which brings me back at last to the point where the trails parted and i went my separate way from harpers ferry rejoicing en route to baltimore and home i spent the day resting in the office which messervy had made my quarters he was out and prowling about most of the time like a good little civil servant and when we dined together in the evening he told me what hed seen and heard i could see he was depressed and agitated for he frowned at least twice and stroked his moustache both sides what was disturbing him was that stuart had found all jbs letters at the kennedy farm and the wager house was agog with rage and alarm at the proof they appeared to contain of diabolical yankee designs that stupid oaf wise this was the virginia governor has been reading them aloud to the drunken rabble over yonder and you may guess the effect by this time tomorrow half the south will have heard of them and be convinced that a northern army is on the march with the republican party in the van intent on rousing the slaves to butcher their masters and burn every plantation tween here and texas what immutable law he went on decrees that the obtuser the politician the higher he will rise i suppose it takes a peculiar combination of the imbecile the toady and the braggart to run for office in the first place cant wise see the harm hes doing or can he i wonder i looked intelligent and he explained that wise was a former secessionist who might be out to make mischief hes put them in a rare frenzy i can tell you packs of drunken ruffians are out niggerhunting this minute and at least two fools have been arrested who claim to be john brown raiders harpers ferry will be lucky if its still standing in the morning ive put you on an earlier train by the way no sense lingering in this madhouse so it was about midnight that i wrapped a scarf round my chin pulled my hat down and made the short walk to the station with messervy at my arm and the beefy birds striding ahead as we passed the enginehouse shuttered and silent with the marine sentries on guard i wondered about joe and messervy must have read my thought for he remarked they buried him down on the river a couple of hours ago lord love me is that ass wise still at his folly i believe he wont rest until he has the whole state in an uproar it was like mafeking night between the armoury gates and the station the wager house was blazing light at every window and shaking to the uproar within there were groups of staggering merrymakers everywhere militiamen and roughnecks some discharging their pieces in the air others forming raucous gleeclubs and in two places thronging round tubthumpers on makeshift platforms who were working themselves and their listeners into a riotous frenzy their themes seemed to be the necessity of lynching john brown closing ranks against the murderous yankees and putting every black in the state under lock and key or lynching them too if they felt like it our escort shouldered a way through the torchlit confusion of milling figures and flushed yelling faces to the comparative quiet of the station where the train stood it had been there half an hour and messervy had timed our walk to arrive just as the bell was beginning to clang and the whistle was adding its plaintive wail to the general din he didnt shake hands simply murmured goodbye with a tap on the arm and i climbed aboard into the quiet dimlit corridor with only a brief glance at the tall figure raising his cane to his hatbrim in nonchalant salute before he turned away the darkie porter showed me into my cabin and all of a sudden i was dizzy with tiredness and an overwhelming sense of relief as i sank on to the cot the train jolted and clanked into motion and a moment later was booming and rumbling over the trestles of the potomac bridge across which id come running rifle in hand and heart in mouth only fortyeight hours before now it was behind me the nightmare which i could hardly believe had ever happened the rush of action in the dark the shouted commands the bearded faces hurrying by the crack of shots and the inferno of the enginehouse and here i was safe and sound bar the two smarting wounds in my neck and knee rattling over the ties out of that awful world and back to life again i couldnt be bothered to undress id no nightshirt or a blessed stitch except what i was wearing anyway have to do something about that no time to shop in baltimore even if id been fool enough to venture into the town borrow some duds when i got aboard the packet perhaps the devil with it sufficient unto the day i was content to lie exhausted wondering idly if the porter could forage me a bottle of something sensible pat on the thought there was a soft knock on the door and his beaming black face appeared yo podden suh says he de party in de nex cabin axes if you kinly like to partake o some refreshment fore you settles to rest he chuckled with a knowing look says if yo sociably inclined be honnered to make yo acquaintance over a little glass or two id seen that look before in french hotels and while it was unexpected here it was by no means unwelcome i wasnt as exhausted as all that of course i might be misreading his expression and find myself closeted with some boring old buffer who couldnt sleep and messervy had told me to stay close but what the blazes it was only next door and the darkie was positively leering thats most civil of the gentleman says i and he tittered behind his hand in a way that settled my doubts and brought me off the cot smoothing my hair and glancing in the glass he effaced himself and i slipped out and knuckled the timber adjoining no reply so i turned the handle and found myself in an empty but welllit cabin ah it was one with an alcove bunk with the curtains drawn eureka thinks i twitching the curtains aside and well hello yoself handsome says mrs popplewell i stood rooted in astonishment partly from the shock of seeing her of all people when id expected some railroad rattler partly because she was reclining languidly on one elbow like that continental tart in the painting you know the one bare buff except for a ribbon round her neck and a nigger maid in the background mrs popplewell wasnt wearing even a ribbon she lay there all black and glossy in the lamplight smiling a welcome and extending a plump hand and if i hadnt been so dumfounded i dare say id have pressed it to my lips on the spot if you know what i mean seen you comin to the train says she in answer to my incoherent inquiry couldnt hardly blieve ma eyes why ah made sure you was gone in that awful fightin las night an this mornin nevuh see such doins shootin an killin she seized my nerveless hand and dragged me into a sitting position beside her well don jes gape like a fish out o water tell me whut happen an wheah you bin and how you come to be heah unless she grinned hugely and transferred her hand from my wrist to my britches unless you can think o suthin better to do fust oh my ah should think you can she was right you know the babble of questions that rose to my lips became a muted howl as she fondled with one hand and hauled me down with the other i seized hold marvelling at my luck and fairly wallowed partaking of refreshment as the porter had advised and i must say de party in de nex cabin was sociably inclined to the point of delirium it was a wonder the train didnt jump the tracks and only when she had subsided moaning and i had got my breath back did we resume the conversation with mutual expressions of bewilderment before all was explained explained on my side that is for she brushed aside my demands to know how she had fared with sinn and the ruffians who had been interrogating her id have thought that my sudden descent from the skylight and my precipitate departure thereafter would have compromised her altogether but apparently not she had been able to satisfy sinn of her innocence she said and ten dollars apiece from her purse had been enough for the others they aint used to black ladies with money tuk the starch right out o them she chuckled but that don matter ahs heah aint ah but howd you git out o that scrape why honey ah nevuh thought to see you live again now you jes tell hannah cos shes dyin to heah say but lemme kiss you fust you deah big lovinmachine theah now you jes play gentle while you tell me but don talk too long will yuh cos we got a deal o pleasurin to do fore we gits to baltimo so i spun her at greater length the yarn id told her on first acquaintance that i was in the employ of the us government and had enlisted in jbs band as a spy even to the length of taking part in their raid all of which was true enough as was my explanation of why id taken refuge with her until such time as it was safe for me to reveal myself to someone in authority you saw what it was like all the confusion and shooting with those drunk madmen whod have killed me on sight it was only after i got away from your room and i say im awfully sorry i had to mishandle you so roughly you mishandle me any ole way you like dahlin she purred toying lazily in a most distracting fashion go on honey tell me mo but keep right on mishandlin well i managed to get away and by great good luck the marines had arrived and i was able to make myself known to colonel lee that the fine soldier with the moustache ah saw this aftnoon came to the hotel with govner wise an the other people say there was one real fine man theah big an hansome kinda like you but not neah as lovesome made me all shivery tho jes to look at him my but ah jes love men with black beardsn whiskers like you best with jes yo whiskers tho gives me somepn to bite at and she nibbled my chin yes well when id spoken to lee of course everything was all right you know what happened after that the marines caught brown and the others and that was the end of it and now im on my way to baltimore as you see to report to my superiors you sure are one lucky man says she stroking my whiskers an ahm one lucky gal why when ah saw you comin to the train with that tall genleman say hes a right pretty feller too he a friend o yours what who oh that fellow no dont know who he is one of the governors people i think why i dont know i felt the less i said about messervy the better the handsome man you saw with colonel lee by the way was probably lieutenant stuart fancied him did you dye know what hannah ive a notion you fancy all men dont you you bet dahlin says she pushing her tongue into my mouth thats mah weakness but ah jes fancy em one at a time now hold on theah you mus be dry aftuh all that talkin she slipped from my grasp and got out to fill two glasses at the buffet i put mine down at a gulp while she sipped hers standing then she put down her glass and vibrated her gleaming bulk in the lamplight looking down at me and hefting her huge poonts in her hands smiling wickedly at my reaction ah reckon you bout ready now says she and once again she was right absolutely well now says she afterwards that was whut ah calls pleasure she shivered sitting astride and stretched luxuriously her arms above her head then she sighed regretfully and removed her massive weight from my creaking thighs climbing out and donning her peignoir ahm real sorry tis over shouldnt ha done it not once let lone twice but ah got to tell you dahlin you are the screwinest man ah ever did see thats my scuse she sighed again anyway that was pleasure an now business she sat down carefully on the chair across the cabin and asked mildly what happened to joe simmons i gave a start that almost brought the cot loose from its moorings but i couldnt speak for shock and she went on you know joe now he was with you when you came to the hotel first time i saw you mr la forces man who brought you up to noo yawk and then to concord and so on after she fluttered her fingers and even in my stunned bewilderment i realised that the broad dixienigra voice had modulated into soft southern tones we know he was in that enginehouse but he never came out with the others what happened to him we it was all i could say sure the kuklos the plump pug face beamed in a smile didnt atropos tell you wed be watchin you an joe all the way sure he did oh we lost you in noo yawk for a spell when the police took those three fellows who were shadowin you and miz mandeville mr la force was real grieved bout her thought she was true to him never suspected she was operatin for the govment till you an she showed up in company with messervy you see we have a man watchin him permanent those three men of hermess in noo yawk they werent the only ones we got up there i found i was shaking in every limb as i lay there stark on the cot instinctively i jerked the sheets over myself and her big lips twitched in a smile dont do that sweetheat i jus love lookin at you my but you are the finest now then tell me bout joe i i dont know what you mean if he was in the enginehouse well he must have been killed or captured if he was in there you know he was you were in there your own self we saw you come out this mornin with messervy you you saw not me one of my boys i have two of them theyre at the ferry right now watchin the enginehouse waitin to see what happened to joe she was regarding me almost amiably shaking her head but youre all confused so id better tell you im medusa you know mr la force likes to give us those ole names ive been in these parts all summer havin you watched at the farm an so forth oh joe didnt know bout that didnt know bout me even bein a lot lower down in the kuklos than i am all he had to do was watch you see you did as mr la force desired you know the raid she smiled approvingly you did that right well too didnt you leastways it happened which was what we wanted mr la forcell be right pleased with you maybe give you the ten thousand dollars you asked for if you feel like collectin do you she was watching me closely now as i sat palpitating too shaken to think let alone speak i felt as though id been struck by a thunderbolt it was incredible too much to take in we didnt mind you workin for the govment or pretendin to work for them whichever it was as things were you didnt have a choice did you what did they want you to do anyway stop brown makin the raid or help him to make it mr la force couldnt make up his mind bout that my belief is oh well it dont matter what i believe the raid went in thats what matters she rose from the chair took my glass and refilled it you look like you need this dahlin go on drink it down an dont look like you saw a ghost alls well except for joe we have to know what happened to him in that enginehouse he was quite a pet of mr la forces you know hell be real grieved if anythin bads happened to joe she swayed ponderously back to her seat so theres two questions to answer what happened to joe and why didnt he cut loose an run at the hotel when you did when i watched the two of you from my window comin to the hotel yesday mornin i thought clever fellers theyve done their work an now the raids happened theyre gettin away from brown you did an you know what she chuckled the great body shaking with mirth when you came in my door i thought how does he know to run to me he cant know who i am that im medusa he cant know im kuklos and then pretty soon i saw that you didnt it was just chance brought you to me an dahlin she broke into laughter i never miss such a chance oh that was some mornins sport we had together i was so melted i thought to tell you who i was but then id seen joe go back to brown i couldnt understand that i suspicioned somethin was wrong somewhere so i kept quiet showed you the way out to the loft tho didnt i when it looked like it dont usually take me long to act when im cornered but id been so shaken that only in the last minute had i summoned my wits sufficiently to move one ghastly fact had imprinted itself on my mind she had men watching the enginehouse theyd have seen the marines bring out joes body under cover of darkness and bury it by the river theyd dig it up for certain and find two bullets in his back and whod put them there then from all that id seen of the kuklos they were experts theyd know or soon find out that the attackers hadnt fired a single shot theyd report to atropos that his pet nigger had been shot and buried clandestine by the government for whom i might or might not have been acting by god hed want to get to the bottom of it and hed not ask as gently as this damned medusapopplewell all this in a flash through my mind to one lightning conclusion instant flight and she was only one woman i came off the bed in a bound and stopped dead before the derringer in her great black hand oh dahlin says she that was foolish what you got to be fractious for hm she shook her head no longer smiling now then ive asked an im waitin why did joe go back to brown and what happened to him afterwards well i could answer the first question at least he went back to brown because he was betraying you its the truth he he went over to browns side i dont know why but he well brown convinced him at the farm that the raid would lead to a slave rebellion and that it would succeed and theyd all win their freedom joe believed him i tell you he changed sides he told me so i swear to god its true she didnt move a muscle the plump black features were without expression the derringer stayed trained on my midriff an what happened in the enginehouse i dont know i i never saw him after the attack i dont know i tell you maybe he was killed or captured you didnt like him did you fact is you couldnt bide him so mr la force figured he thought it was real amusin figured you an joe were rivals for the favours of miz mandeville were you when i didnt reply she shrugged it dont matter she aint around any more mr la force cant abide traitors well joe was a traitor i swear he was i dont disbelieve you dahlin i wouldnt trust a nigger an inch myself she sat there black and placid as she said it did you kill joe no for gods sake why should i maybe cos you hated him maybe for the us govment maybe even cos youre tellin true when you say joe went over to brown an you killed him out o loyalty to mr la force an that five thousand dollars he promised you honey i dont mind she leaned forward smiling almost wistfully but the derringer was steady as a rock whats one black buck more or less if you killed him fine it dont matter to hannah i didnt i swear to god dearest you dont need to not to me its what you swear to mr la force that signifies an whether he believes you an i truly do doubt whether hell believe joe betrayed him you know joen he were boys together playmates why he loved that joe like a brother bout the only thing he ever loved i guess an if joes dead an my boysll find it out if he is i dont know what mr la forcell do she shook her head sadly but if he suspicions that you killed him an i do so i guess he might well i jus hope you can prove you didnt i sat like a rabbit before a snake while she regarded me with pity and concern then she smiled again and reached out to stroke my cheek with her free hand oh dahlin dont look so down i tell you it dont matter to me you can kill every nigger in creation if youve a mind to far as im concerned you know why her eyes narrowed and her voice was trembling cos you pleasured me like i never been pleasured before i didnt know there was pleasurin like that an believe me boy i made a study i come over faint jus thinkin bout you she shivered and grimaced an now i got to go back to popplewell oh sure there is a popplewell randy little runt all i tol you bout him an my other husbands is true cept i married him two years ago not two days an twasnt him but one o my white boys left me at the wager house she gave one of her gross chuckles think theyd take a nigger woman there be her husband never so rich no but theyd take the devil hisself if the kuklos is payin the bill she stood up and to my amazement slipped the derringer into the bosom of her robe then she stooped over me took my face in her hands looking soulful and kissed me with sudden passion her tongue and lips working feverishly at my mouth and cheeks and eyes and back to my mouth again before she broke moistly away breathing hard oh ah got sech a kindness fo you mr beauchamp comber or mr tom anold or whatevah yo name is ah don know an ah don care an ah got sech a misry when ah think whut mr la forcell do she shuddered enormously with a little whimpering sigh and i thought nows your time lad and thrust my whiskers between her boobies going brrr she let out an ecstatic wail the derringer clattered to the floor and i sank clutching fingers into her buttocks and munched away for dear life for i could see only one way out of this fearful dilemma to play on her feminine frailty in the only way i know how but even as i grappled roaring lustful endearments she heaved away from me eyes rolling and thrust out a mighty hand to hold me at arms length oh dahlin oh goddamussy she gasped and in her agitation it came out in broad dixie oh honey don think ah aint cravin you cos ah is sumpn cruel but we aint got the time dammit she stamped rattling the cabin and her eyes were wild theys ony one stop tween heah an baltimo an it comin up real soon oh lordy deres de whistle don stand theah she panted seizing my wrist you gotta git off cos mah boys at the ferryll

ahd die she surged to the door and wrenched it open and damned if she wasnt snivelling great tears over her shiny black cheeks so git outa heah now will yuh oh gi me one las kiss do now git yore ass offa this train an take care ye heah appendix i flashman and john brown flashmans was not an affectionate nature that he loved his wife elspeth is evident from his memoirs and now and then his regard for other ladies goes some way beyond the merely physical usually one suspects when he is writing in a mood of brandyassisted nostalgia but outside his family he plainly doted on his greatgrandchildren and felt for his natural son frank standing bear a paternal affection which lasted for several days he seldom finds much to like in people he betrays an occasional fellowfeeling at a safe distance for such rascals as rudi von starnberg and has a halfamiable tolerance of acquaintances whom he has no cause to detest like his old chief colin campbell and his afghan bloodbrother ilderim khan but that as a rule is his limit yet he seems to have had a kind of protective affection for john brown underneath the sneers and curses there is a hint of indulgence an inclination to defend the old nuisance and even to give him a tuscan cheer which is not characteristic of flashman we may be sure it springs from no kindly or charitable impulse or the least sympathy with browns aims he found the man and his mission ridiculous and writes of them with contempt at the same time he remembers brown as a bloody hard man to dislike which is a rare tribute of course it may have been a gratifying novelty to flashman to come across a strong and fearsome autocrat who treated him with some deference and respect a strong man moreover whom he could manipulate and in whom he detected an appealing streak of humbug and however lofty his disdain of brown there is no doubt that he took a perverse pride in their association i was one of john browns pet lambs after all this is pure flashman throughout his memoirs he revels in reflected glory the more so when it is ingloriously undeserved and when it comes to dining out harpers ferry plainly ranks with balaclava and little big horn and cawnpore one detects a condescending gratitude to brown and his ragged commandos for adding another leaf to the flashman laurels and a complacent satisfaction that he helped them along the road to immortality whether he liked brown or not he has done him justice the figure who stalks his narrative is the man of the biographies and contemporary accounts even to his quoted speech thoughts manner appearance and the small details of everyday from their first meeting at concord to the last glimpse of the weary serene old prisoner lying in the paymasters office flashmans story tallies convincingly with recorded fact and differs no more from the standard authorities than they do from each other his record of browns travels in the north may be verified in villard as may his account of life at the kennedy farm of which mrs annie brown adams browns daughter who acted as lookout for the conspirators has left a lively record as invariably happens when there is a multitude of eyewitnesses there are many discrepancies to be found in accounts of the actual raid on harpers ferry it would have been tedious and confusing to footnote them all and most of them are trivial it hardly matters whether john brown visited the rifle works in person or at which end of the potomac bridge the watchmen were posted or whether lee was on horseback or what kind of hat jeb stuart wore or the precise moment when brown retreated to the enginehouse or the exact place and time of certain incidents there is no conflict on the main course of events and here flashman is in step with other historians it was a weird affair the handful of men invading in the dark the holdup and release of the train the taking of the prisoners the first haphazard shootings the bewildered township waking to find itself menaced by terrorists gunfight and murder alternating with parleys and demands for breakfast the militia storming in and taking to drink the brutal lynchings and the local doctor tending the invaders wounded the siege of the enginehouse the final call to surrender the last bloody melйe with the marines and most bizarre of all the wounded brown holding court while his captors bombard him with questions the whole thing has elements of a modern hostage drama followed by a television press conference it was a fiasco the irony is that it need not have been brown the most incompetent of planners and irresolute of leaders gained an initial success of which a commando leader might be proud and then did nothing he could have stripped the arsenal and been in the hills without losing a man that he could have organised a slave rebellion is highly improbable but he would have struck a blow to shake the nation why did he delay did he cling to the hope that the slaves would rally to him as cook had assured him they would it is possible yet it seems more likely that flashmans diagnosis is sound faced with crisis brown simply did not know what to do his judgment failed him as his courage never did and with that fatal indecision which was his besetting weakness he threw away what little chance he had but while flashman may have read him aright at the ferry and while his whole portrait of brown is a fair one he has probably come no closer than other biographers to explaining the old abolitionists strange and complex character it is not surprising brown was not understood in his own time and much that has been written about him since has done more to embellish the legend than to clarify the nature of the man he and his cause are emotional subjects and the emotions often run to extremes he has been described in terms that would become a saint and vilified with an intemperance that is selfdefeating the impression persists in most peoples minds of a good and simple soul on fire with a dream a fanatical crusader pursuing a splendid goal with imperfect means a misguided quixote whose head was wrong but whose heart was right great men and women have given him the accolade and who that reads his story can dissent kindness compassion a burning love of liberty a gift of inspiring devotion and matchless courage he had if as has been charged perhaps not unjustly he was also devious foolish vain selfish unscrupulous and irresolute in crisis his admirers can say that these are human faults and far outweighed by the simple nobility of the martyr who died and died gladly to make men free and then there is pottawatomie the question of his sanity cannot be answered now he was held fit to plead at his trial rightly so far as we can tell but not many laymen would on the evidence call him normal or balanced reasoning insanity is the judgment of one eminent historian and it will do as well as any other we cannot know him but it does not matter he is part of history and historic legend and if what he tried to do was not heroic then the word has no meaning appendix ii the harpers ferry mystery the most remarkable thing about john browns raid is that it was allowed to happen at all months beforehand it was known in washingtons corridors of power that he intended to invade virginia and that his first target would be harpers ferry at least eighty people in the country including the secretary for war and two us senators had been told of the plan how many others had picked up the rumours or had reason to believe that some great stroke was imminent it is impossible to say yet nothing was done to stop him no defensive measures were taken this should be one of those great historical mysteries that scholars love to debate when one considers the oceans of ink that have been spilled over little big horn and the alamo the comparative neglect of the question why wasnt brown stopped is almost as baffling as the mystery itself brown had invasion in mind as early as when he described to frederick douglass how he would use a small picked band to run off the most restless and daring slaves and wage a guerrilla campaign in the alleghenies in late or early he proposed a raid on harpers ferry to colonel daniel woodruff a veteran of the war of browns daughter annie the sentry of kennedy farm remembered the ferry being specifically mentioned at the time hugh forbes knew about the plan in some detail in and revealed it to senators wilson and seward in at which time the secret six also knew of it and the scheme was postponed early in james redpath who had met brown and was to become his first biographer published a book dedicated to john brown senior of kansas citing him as a believer in slave insurrection advocating revolt and hinting at future servile and civil wars not hard information but a significant straw in a wind that had been blowing for some time secret intelligencegathering was fairly makeshift in the us before the civil war and it is possible that the government had no substantial knowledge of browns intentions before or if they had that they did not take him seriously the wild schemes of a crazy farmer might well be dismissed as moonshine although given the growth of abolitionist feeling in the north and southern anxiety about slave unrest it seems odd that no one thought them worthy of any inquiry at all but odd is not the word for the behaviour of john floyd secretary of war when he received a detailed and compelling warning of the raid on august seven weeks before it took place it came in a letter admittedly anonymous but obviously the work of a responsible person who named old john brown of kansas stated that he intended to liberate the slaves of the south by general insurrection gave particulars of his preparation and armament identified harpers ferry as the point of invasion and predicted that the slaves would be armed and the blow struck within a few weeks nothing could have been clearer but floyd whom bruce catton generously describes as a bumbling incompetent ignored the letter because among its wealth of cogent information it contained one trifling error the writer stated that brown had an agent in an armoury in maryland floyd apparently had not the wit to connect old john brown of the letter with the notorious john brown on whose head president buchanan and the state of missouri had put a price but like a good little bureaucrat he knew that there was no armoury in maryland that there was a large undefended armoury within a stones throw of maryland just across the river in virginia did not occur to him he decided incredibly that the rest of the letter must be untrue according to sanborn he did not even bother to read it twice explaining himself later to the mason committee investigating the raid floyd said that he was satisfied that a scheme of such wickedness and outrage could not be entertained by any citizens of the united states and the committee decided that no one apart from browns gang had any suspicion of existence or design committees know their own business best and there is no reason why a senior minister should not be an illinformed idiot such things have been known but even if floyd was guilty of nothing worse than stupidity and negligence it is still remarkable that despite all the advance publicity john brown and his projected raid had received from the halls of congress to the kansas border and from the drawingrooms of boston to the saloons of ohio no one in washington took any notice or apparently felt a moments unease to be sure governments can be uncommonly blind deaf and lazy to which the last survivor of john browns band would certainly add aye especially when they dont want to see hear or move there were many in the north and doubtless some in the south who wanted the raid to happen crixus and atropos were not alone but probably only a cynic like flashman would speculate that there were those in authority who knowing of the plot and having the power to prevent it allowed it to go ahead for their own inscrutable ends since there is no evidence to support this view we can only accept the alternative that it was just monumental bad luck that no responsible person got wind of the plot or took it seriously or bothered to investigate it or thought it worth posting even a couple of armed sentries on an unguarded arsenal at a time when talk of slave insurrection was in the air or decided to keep an eye on the most violent and ruthless abolitionist in the country the butcher of pottawatomie who was stumping the sticks and cities preaching the invasion of virginia bad luck indeed for the upshot was that against all the odds and in spite of all his follies and hesitations and mismanagement john brown was given what he had no right to expect a clear run at harpers ferry appendix iii john browns men john browns knapsack is strapped upon his back hes gone to be a soldier in

at harpers ferry no slaves were liberated notes john arthur johnson the first black boxer to win the world heavyweight title was the most unpopular of champions and in the opinion of the most respected ring historians the best he won the title in by beating tommy burns of canada having pursued him from america to england and finally to australia and lost it in to jess willard of the usa in the intervening years he was the object of a campaign of race hatred unique in sport in that colourconscious age johnsons arrogance in and out of the ring his cruelty to opponents his white wives his complacent smile showing goldcapped teeth his skipping bail to paris to avoid a prison sentence in america and above all his undoubted supremacy in a game which had always been a peculiar source of white pride brought out the very worst in the sporting public none was more vicious than the novelist jack london who had covered burnss funeral as he called it for the new york herald and who conducted the notorious whip the nigger campaign to remove the golden smile from johnsons face he and others persuaded jim jeffries a former champion to come out of retirement to challenge for the title the fight took place in reno nevada in and so highly charged was the atmosphere beforehand that sir arthur conan doyle was invited to act as referee it was felt rightly that no sportsman on earth was so universally respected or more likely to exert a calming influence doyle wanted to accept but his own campaign against the atrocities in the belgian congo was demanding all his attention and after a weeks hesitation he reluctantly declined in the event johnson won easily there were no disturbances and the quest for a white hope lasted another five years until johnson succumbed to the gigantic but undistinguished willard flashmans view of johnson was widely shared his unquestioned brilliance as a ring mechanic apart the black champion was not an endearing figure but it is only fair to quote the opinion of another wellknown victorian who had the rare distinction of meeting him in the ring and coming out on his feet victor mclaglen was an admired british heavyweight long before he became a film actor he went six rounds to a draw in a nodecision bout with johnson in and wrote afterwards that the champion fought like a gentleman was undoubtedly the hardest man to hit whom i ever met and was also the most charming opponent flashman was born in so the present memoir was presumably written in two years before his death the famous march one of many john brown songs sung in the us civil war is said to have originated in a sarcastic tune which men in a massachusetts outfit made up as a jibe against one sergeant john brown of boston if so it soon became associated with the famous abolitionist a union soldier private warren lee goss records that when the th massachusetts regiment marched down broadway on july they sang the then new and always thrilling lyric john browns body five months later mrs julia ward howe the author reformer and abolitionist wrote new words to the old tune they subsequently appeared in the atlantic monthly as the battle hymn of the republic one tradition is that she had been scandalised by the words which she heard soldiers singing the accepted story is that she and a party of friends were singing patriotic songs and one of them suggested to her that new verses would be appropriate for evidence that benjamin franklin and his assistant edward bancroft were working for british intelligence during their time at the american embassy in paris and passed information to london which resulted in heavy american shipping losses see richard deacon a history of british secret service flashman is habitually vague about dates and it is impossible to say when he left calcutta it may have been late in or even early in but he was certainly at the cape sometime in january or february of the new year in that case it seems probable that the stranded wreck was the madagascar which ran ashore off port elizabeth on december the selfdestruction of the zoza tribe began late in when the belief arose that spirits of the dead speaking through the medium of a girl of the tribe had promised that if all cattle and crops were destroyed these would be replaced in abundance on a certain day and the hated white men driven from the land in obedience to their chief the xhosas destroyed their food supplies entirely and in the famine which followed more than are believed to have died in view of recent south african history and the common belief that would be the milestone marking the introduction of universal suffrage it is worth noting that in cape colony in the s under british rule every man had the vote regardless of race or colour the only qualifications were birth in the colony and a financial condition set so low that many nonwhites were enfranchised like many progressive features of the old british empire it is one that modern revisionists are either unaware of or choose to forget the pollution of the thames and the antismoking campaign were perennial topics the act of parliament removing the disabilities of the jews had passed in july and lionel de rothschild had become the first jewish mp flashmans summary of south african affairs in if characteristically sketchy is accurate and perceptive and his portrait of the cape governor is fair if anything he gives him more sympathetic treatment than he usually metes out to imperial proconsuls a class of whom he tended to take a jaundiced view sir george grey was that peculiarly victorian compound of the man of action scholar visionary and maverick his guiding principles were the welfare and progress of the people he was given to rule and getting his own way and he pursued them with an energy and impatience which frequently brought him into conflict with his superiors at home and eventually brought his career to a premature close which was his countrys loss for he was one of the best he left the army when he was twentythree to explore northwestern australia an adventure of extreme danger and hardship in which he skirmished with aborigines was wounded lost his supplies and finally tramped alone into perth so altered by suffering that he was unrecognisable he was twentynine when he was appointed governor of south australia and subsequently of new zealand where he defeated the maoris won their friendship and established a popular and prosperous administration before being transferred to the cape in there he prevented a kaffir uprising encouraged settlement and acquired something rare if not unique in south african history the trust and respect of britons boers and tribesmen alike foreseeing that the peaceful development of the country depended on recognising and balancingthe interests of all three he worked tirelessly to bring about a confederation won the support of the boers of the orange free state and the british of the cape and would have succeeded but for the reluctance of the home government to assume further responsibility and expense in southern africa his persistence caused offence at the colonial office and he was recalled in a few months after flashman met him palmerstons new administration reinstated him but his plan of confederation was shelved in he was again governor of new zealand fought in the maori wars and was making progress towards a settlement between settlers and maoris when his highly individual style having given renewed offence in whitehall he was recalled he was only fiftyfive the rest of his life was spent mostly in new zealand he left behind a standard work polynesian mythology and splendid libraries at cape town and auckland but his great achievement was that whatever his chiefs at home thought the people of all races and colours whom he governed were invariably sorry to see him go a handsome slightlybuilt man with a cold eye and a quiet voice grey seems to have been quite as assured and impatient of opposition as flashman found him an idealist he had a strong ruthless streak and his portraits do not suggest a man whom it would be safe to cross during his final months at the cape his health was poor and his marital relations were approaching a crisis something with which we may be sure flashman had nothing to do or he would certainly have told us about it the first ministry of lord palmerston who had sent flashman on secret service to india shortly before the great mutiny of had ended in february when he was succeeded as prime minister by the earl of derby palmerston regained office in june a few months after the meeting of flashman and sir george grey at the cape the outdoor swimming pool was an occasional feature of private gardens at the cape the constantia mansion the first large country house in the colony dating from the seventeenth century had one in its grounds a native of new england especially a typical seafarer from the coast of maine reputed to be unusually tough and reactionary and supposedly socalled because the region lay east and downwind of the main american atlantic ports the term was also applied to ships there was no british embassy in washington at this time hm government was represented by a minister not an ambassador a diplomatic distinction which flashman could not be expected to appreciate if so it was a slow passage a clipper would have done it in half the time given favourable weather which flashmans ship does not seem to have had captain robert waterman was one of the foremost clipper captains of the day famous for his recordbreaking runs in the sea witch between china and new york and notorious for the brutal discipline he imposed on his crews flashman mentions him twice in earlier packets of the papers but there is no evidence that they ever met p there is something of a literary mystery here the knitting swedes hostelry is mentioned in the blood ship published some time early in this century by norman springer but i cannot recall whether it was located in baltimore or not however the two bucko mates of the blood ship were certainly fitzgibbon and lynch the names of the skipper and mate of the vessel which carried flashman to america these things can hardly be coincidental a remark attributed to senator david r atchison of missouri when urging on border ruffians before the sack of lawrence kansas headquarters of the free staters on may crixuss account and flashmans interpolations between them provide a rough but balanced biographical summary of john brown up to the spring of whether the famous abolitionist was a mayflower descendant has been disputed but he certainly came of old american stock born in torrington connecticut on may he received a rudimentary education and worked at various rural trades with indifferent success his business ventures ended in failure and he was usually hard pressed for money he married twice and had twenty children his hatred of slavery inherited from his father and nourished by his own observations took an active form when he was still in his twenties and his home was a station on the underground railroad in at springfield massachusetts he organised a black defence group the league of gileadites to resist slavecatchers and prevent fugitives from being returned to the south it is not certain when he conceived the idea of invading virginia but he was talking about it as early as and in the winter of was discussing a raid on harpers ferry and making notes on guerrilla warfare from stocquelers life of the duke of wellington at this time several of his sons imbued with their fathers abolitionist zeal went to kansas where the slave or free territory issue was coming to a head and were soon followed by brown himself ostensibly to set up in business but in fact to fight on the free state side he soon became the most notorious of the border irregulars organising a guerrilla band called the liberty guards with himself as captain and four of his sons owen frederick salmon and john junior among his followers and earning a fearsome reputation as a result of one savage exploit in the summer of the pottawatomie massacre took place on the night of may and arose directly from the destruction of the town of lawrence and another incident on the following day on may an antislavery orator senator charles sumner of massachusetts denounced the lawrence attack in the us senate and was then assaulted by representative preston brooks of south carolina who invaded the chamber and thrashed sumner who was seated at his desk so brutally with his cane that the unfortunate senator did not recover for two years brown who had been too late to defend lawrence and was in a fury because the citizens had not put up a fight was already contemplating retaliation against the proslavers when news of bully brookss outrage reached him on may at this according to his son salmon the old man went crazy crazy and on being urged t use caution cried caution caution sir i am eternally tired of hearing that word caution it is nothing but the word for cowardice and set off to strike back at the barbarians this consisted of descending on three houses along the pottawatomie creek first murdering a proslavery man named doyle and two of his sons then another named wilkinson and finally one sherman the killings were carried out with the utmost brutality the men being forced from their beds and despite the pleas of wives and the presence of children hustled out into the dark and literally hacked to pieces with sabres fingers hands and arms were severed and skulls split owen and salmon brown killed the three doyles and browns soninlaw henry thompson and a man named theodore weiner murdered the two other men brown himself does not seem to have struck a blow although he probably fired a single shot into the corpse of the oldest doyle later when his son jason taxed him with the killings brown said i did not do it but i approved of it nor did he ever deny responsibility and only once offered anything like an excuse for the crime according to an old kansas settler brown claimed that the five had been planning to kill him i was satisfied that each of them had committed murder in his heart and i felt justified in having them killed this is doubtful and even browns most admiring biographers are at a loss when confronted with pottawatomie one suggests that he was in a trance another refers to the murders as executions but none can offer an acceptable explanation let alone a defence at the time crixuss view of the affair was shared by many in the north who believed that brown was justified by necessity and that his terrorist tactics and subsequent skirmishing against the proslavery forces were of critical importance in the kansas struggle certainly pottawatomie did nothing to lessen support for brown among northern liberals some might condemn it but others especially the group known as the secret six gave him moral and financial assistance and the great mass of abolitionists regarded him as a champion he continued to operate against the proslavery forces with some success before being driven from his base at ossawatomie in a battle in which his son frederick was killed for almost three years thereafter brown divided his time between campaigning for the abolitionist cause in the east and preparing in the field for his projected invasion of virginia there are many biographies of brown and they cover the closing years of his life in detail drawing on a wealth of contemporary sources indeed there is almost an embarrassment of information one writer villard has even been able to compile a daily calendar of his life from mid to his death in december most of the early biographies including those by sanborn and redpath who knew brown personally are friendly one by peebles wilson is a raging denunciation of special interest is the autobiographical sketch written by brown in which is the best source for his early life and is quoted in full in villard franklin b sanborn the life and letters of john brown james redpath the public life of captain john brown h peebles wilson john brown soldier of fortune barrie stavis john brown the sword and the word oates r d webb life and letters of captain john brown louis ruchames a john brown reader allan keller thunder at harpers ferry hugh forbes the british adventurer whom brown hired as an instructor and military advisor at a month shared certain characteristics with flashman he was tall handsome soldierly plausible and probably something of a confidence man he was born about had been a silk merchant in italy claimed to have fought under garibaldi and styled himself colonel but when brown met him in new york in he was eking a bare living as a fencingmaster translator and occasional journalist in browns employ he worked on a manual of guerrilla tactics and produced a pamphlet apparently designed to lure us soldiers to the abolitionist cause but his chief talent was for absorbing money to support his family whom he described as starving in paris eventually he and brown fell out over alleged arrears of pay and perhaps more seriously the harpers ferry project forbes was convinced that an attempt to rouse the slaves for a guerrilla campaign must fail and proposed instead a series of stampedes in which small parties of slaves would be run off from properties close to the northsouth border thus eventually making slaveholding impossible in the region and forcing the slave frontier gradually southwards it was at least a feasible plan but brown rejected it forbes then began writing to browns leading supporters from many of whom he had begged money hinting that unless further payments were made he would divulge the invasion plan a threat which he carried out in the spring of when he accosted two republican senators seward and wilson on the floor of the senate and told them what was planned the senators both devoted abolitionists seem to have kept the information to themselves but warned browns supporters and the project was postponed the marble frontage and later clues in flashmans narrative suggest that the hotel was browns at the junction of pennsylvania avenue and sixth street it was much patronised by southerners the parcae or fates of classical mythology were clotho lachesis and atropos the arbiters of birth life and death the dandys little joke lay in suggesting that they should have called themselves eumenides the name ironically applied by the greeks to the furies the white hoods and the name kuklos are strongly reminiscent of the infamous ku klux klan founded by confederate exofficers in tennessee after the civil war originally a social and literary club it became an antinegro terrorist organisation which flourished intermittently into modern times it certainly owed its name to the greek kuklos a circle but there is no evidence either of its existence before or to suggest that it had its origins in the kind of southern intelligence network which atropos described to flashman the identities of clotho and lachesis cannot even be guessed at telemaque vesey and nat turner led the two most notable slave revolts in and respectively vesey a mulatto who had bought his freedom with lottery winnings organised a plot to take charleston but was betrayed by a slave out of affection for his owner and went to the gallows with more than thirty black comrades several whites who were implicated in the plot were imprisoned nat turner a black lay preacher who was inspired by the bible to believe himself the chosen deliverer of his people led a rebellion of some seventy slaves at southampton virginia in which more than fifty whites and twice as many blacks died turner himself was executed how many other smaller outbreaks took place it is impossible to say no doubt some went unrecorded unrest was certainly more widespread than southerners cared to admit the contention that slaves were happy or resigned concealed a genuine fear which was reflected in strict laws against black assembly and education patrols curfews and the kind of savage treatment dealt out to a band of about seventy maryland runaways who were executed or sold down the river in rumours spread of a general slave conspiracy in the years before the civil war a byproduct perhaps of southern fears of the growing abolitionist feeling in the north for they seem to have been unfounded if flashman and annette had a table for two as he seems to suggest they were singularly favoured since most american hotels of the period favoured the common table the comfort of a quiet table to yourself is quite unknown complained a british traveller of the period the living at these hotels is profuse to a degree but generally speaking most disagreeable first because the meal is devoured with a rapidity which a pack of foxhounds after a weeks fast might in vain attempt to rival and secondly because it is impossible to serve up dinners for hundreds without ninetenths thereof being cold stephen a douglas leader of the democrats in the north was a portly dynamic figure known to admirers as the little giant and to enemies as the dropsied dwarf and best remembered for the debates in which he successfully defended his seat as senator for illinois against lincoln in douglas was to the fore in the slavery question his first wife was the daughter of a slaveholder but douglas himself was a champion of popular sovereignty holding that it was up to the residents to decide whether a state should be slave or free and his declaration that any territory could exclude slavery irrespective of the supreme courts ruling cost him the support of many southern democrats the party split before the presidential election of with the deep south states breaking away and although douglas was nominated as one of the candidates against lincoln he was heavily beaten his second wife adele was a noted beauty and leader of washington society in the years before the civil war the cynic was anthony trollope who gave this unflattering view of new york in his north america flashmans impressions of new york are echoed by other british travellers of the midnineteenth century as well as by american writers like them he was struck by the size and uptodate appointments of the hotels with their hundreds of apartments halfhour laundry services nosmoking areas for ladies diningrooms which seemed to foreshadow massproduction peanut shells cigar fumes and continual clamour and bustle which many european visitors used to smaller and cosier establishments found trying nor is he alone in his admiration of the citys women and the freedom and independence which they enjoyed compared to their european sisters trollope had the same experience of paying ladies fares on the omnibuses and james silk buckingham an english observer of the previous decade enthused at some length about their beauty he also noted the deference shown to them by american men and their dependence on it a contemporary of flashmans g ellington devoted a long book to the citys women of every class and kind from the society set of fifth and madison avenues to the fallen angels of the house of the good shepherd he is a mine of information on fashions parties amusements social behaviour shopping menus and polite trivia as well as on the female underworld the cruisers of broadway the downtown cigarstore girls the allwomen gambling and billiard halls and the drug scene from him we learn of the popularity among society ladies and their imitators of powdered hands the grecian bend dancing the german blonde hair and exaggerated high heels he knows the price of everything from murray hill boardingschool fees to the going rate paid by white slavers for recruits and presumably is a reliable guide to what was done going to saratoga and the white mountains in summer and what was not done being seen anywhere south of th street among other commentators theodore roosevelt is critical of s new york deploring its vulgarity devotion to money and slavish copying of paris fashion and is interesting on the swamping of native american stock by irish immigration the growth of roman catholicism the new york mobs tendency to riot the corruption of local politics and the attempt by its democrat mayor to align the city with the south in the civil war by seceding from the union and establishing the commonwealth of triinsula the hon henry murray whose strictures on public dining arrangements are mentioned in note is an entertaining source of domestic detail barbers shops hotel security bibles in bedrooms and bridal suites alexander mckay is worth reading on angloamerican attitudes in general and american sensitivity to british opinion in particular his reporting of conversations is firstclass the enamelling studio in which ladies had their faces shoulders and busts coated with a mixture of arsenic and white lead was the forerunner of the modern beauty salon to judge from advertisements of the time the range of cosmetics treatments and appliances for enhancing the female face and figure was almost as extensive as it is now flashmans description is accurate and the prices he quotes tally with those of one of the broadway studios what the effect of an application designed to last for a full year must have been can only be imagined allan pinkerton the most famous of all private detectives and founder of the agency which bears his name was born in glasgow the son of a police sergeant he trained as a cooper and became an enthusiastic member of the chartist movement for workers rights taking part in the glasgow spinners strike and in the attempt to free a chartist leader from monmouth castle newport in when shots were exchanged between rioters and police it was about this time that flashman was engaged in training militia at paisley and was briefly involved in a disturbance at a mill belonging to his future fatherinlaw john morrison subsequently pinkertons chartist activities took him into hiding to avoid arrest and in he emigrated to chicago he worked as a cooper at dundee illinois but crime prevention was evidently in his blood and after running down a counterfeiting gang he was appointed deputy sheriff of kane county and later of cook county chicago here he organised his detective agency in and had considerable success against railway and express company thieves he foi led an assassination attempt against presidentelect lincoln in and in the civil war became effective head of the us secret service but while he was an efficient spycatcher he broke the confederate espionage ring operated in washington by the glamorous rose greenhow he was less successful as gatherer of military intelligence and his overestimation of confederate strength in the peninsular campaign contributed to a union reverse he was eventually replaced but his agency

waving hats hands and handkerchiefs william henry seward who had been a schoolteacher and lawyer before embarking on a political career was an implacable enemy of slavery as governor of new york he had refused to move against those who rescued slaves passed laws to hinder the recapture of runaways and in a memorable speech in coined the phrase irrepressible conflict which means that the us must and will sooner or later become either entirely a slaveholding or entirely a freelabour nation his nomination as republican candidate in the presidential election was widely taken for granted and when he visited europe in he was received with the attention due to a presidentelect as he had forecast to flashman he met the queen lord palmerston the foreign secretary lord john russell gladstone lord macaulay and many other prominent figures when the republicans met in chicago in the following year seward was still firm favourite but although he won the first two ballots he was defeated on the third by the comparatively unknown abraham lincoln the prairie lawyer as seward called him he became lincolns secretary of state and rendered vital service to his country in the trent affair of when the seizure by an american warship of a british vessel carrying confederate diplomats to europe caused a crisis which might well have led to war three things helped to a peaceful solution the breakdown of the transatlantic cable made hasty communication impossible prince albert and the queen moderated the tone of the british governments demand for the release with apologies of the diplomats and seward performed the apparently impossible by climbing down without losing face it was a turningpoint in american history for if the us had refused to yield and war had followed she could not have hoped to fight britain and the confederacy together the civil war would have been lost and southern independence assured yet yielding would have outraged the american public which was jubilant at britains discomfiture and might have weakened lincolns government to the point where it could no longer save the union that britain was for once entirely in the right naturally made the problem no easier seward solved it with a reply to the british demand which was a masterpiece of flannel confused the question brilliantly managed to suggest that america had won the argument and concluded by saying that the diplomats would be cheerfully liberated he heaped coals of fire on the lions head by granting free passage across american soil to the british expeditionary force which had been sent to canada in anticipation of war with the us but had been forced to put in at an american port because the st lawrence was icebound sewards other claim to fame is as the purchaser of alaska in flashman paints a fair picture of the shrewd egotistical little statesman of whom it was said justly or not that he never spoke from conviction his passion for cigars and for informal behaviour is well attested in private he was genial given to cursing and to kicking off his shoes he could not be described as an anglophile yet he obviously took entirely for granted what came to be called the special relationship references to the natural sympathy and affection between the european and american branches of the british race are to be found in his speeches and letters the secret

mingled with sound moral advice the autobiography addressed to my dear young friend and dated red rock iowa th july was much admired by browns supporters as evidence of his warm human qualities but excited the scorn of browns fiercest critic peebles wilson who found it valuable as an exhibit of his scheming to finance operations no doubt brown knew it would impress young stearnss parents on whom he depended for funds but that is not to say that he was being insincere or was unmoved by the boys gift anyway it is a fascinating document simple homely naive perhaps eccentrically punctuated and quite beautifully written one would have to be a hardened cynic to be altogether untouched by it and if as wilson suggests it was written for sordid motives then brown in addition to being a fine english stylist carried hypocrisy into the realms of high art there are two words to describe john browns appearance grim and formidable even allowing for the fact that photography of the time required the sitter to hold his pose for some seconds which often resulted in a fixed stare the face that looks out of his pictures is a daunting one the long anglosaxon head prominent nose and ears wide mouth set like a trap stern certainty of expression and above all the level implacable eyes bring to mind immediately words like ironside yankee puritan and covenanter it is if not handsome an extremely fine face and it is easy to understand the spell that he seems to have cast over his followers and supporters equally easy too to see why he was called a fanatic the most impressive portraits show him cleanshaven the early photograph taken when he was in his midforties one hand raised in pledge while the other holds the white flag the imposing boston portrait of by j j hawes the daguerreotype of in which he looks drawn and tired quite the least convincing is the fullbearded painting by n b onthank based on a photo taken in the month when flashman met him by the time of his famous raid brown had trimmed his beard short although only five feet nine inches in height he looked taller despite the stoop of his later years he walked slowly had a deep metallic voice normally wore a serious and patient expression and had a fine head of dark brown hair sprinkled with grey this promise of browns explains what would otherwise have been an insoluble mystery why in the highly detailed records of the harpers ferry raid and in all the correspondence of john brown and his associates is there no mention of comber and joe simmons plainly brown kept his word as did those american agents and officers who were well aware of the presence in browns band and at the ferry of these two additional raiders brown visited london in on a woolmarketing venture which proved a costly failure he travelled to yorkshire and spoke highly of english farming stonemasonry and roast beef but thought the horses inferior to those of the us he had time for a brief trip to the continent where he visited paris hamburg brussels and the field of waterloo the poodle hair story is to be found in his biographies undoubtedly mrs julia ward howe who two years later became famous as the author of the battle hymn of the republic this grim joke of browns was obviously one he enjoyed repeating it occurs in a different context in his biographies as do many of the remarks which flashman reports from their first meeting at sanborns house artemus wards description of brown appeared in the cleveland plain dealer of march from the martial hymn lift up your heads ye gates of brass by james montgomery jerry anderson echoed his words to flashman in a letter of july their cries for help go out to the universe daily and hourly there are a few who dare to answer this call in a manner that will make this land of liberty and equality shake to the centre the speaker may have been henry david thoreau the celebrated american writer who makes the comparison in his plea for captain john brown thoreau first met brown in and became an immediate admirer writing of his rare common sense a man of ideas and principles and his pentup fire he also coined the description quoted earlier by flashman a volcano with an ordinary chimney flue the first of browns anecdotes is to be found in his own autobiography the second in villard it is remarkable that flashman never mentions the senator by name and it is possible that he never knew it but this was henry wilson of massachusetts the physical description fits and senator wilson described his meeting with brown at the bird club when he testified before the senate investigating committee after the harpers ferry tragedy his account echoes flashmans whether the warning note reached him or not is unimportant the date apart it merely confirmed what he knew already for he was one of the republican senators to whom forbes had disclosed the plot a year earlier wilson was a fervent abolitionist a former farm labourer and shoemaker who became chairman of the senate military affairs committee during the civil war he was one of many leading politicians who came under the spell of the magnetic mrs greenhow the washington hostess who was also a highly successful confederate spy when she was arrested by pinkerton loveletters signed h were found among her papers but handwriting experts decided that they were not wilsons which in view of his official position was just as well flashman is slightly misquoting sir francis drakes famous dispatch to washington there must be a beginning of any great matter but the continuing unto the end until it be thoroughly finished yields the true glory newbys christian name was dangerfield but he may have been known jokingly as dangerous the average age of browns followers was twentyfive only two of them were over thirty and this has led some commentators into the error of underrating them in fact they were a formidable party with no lack of experience of irregular warfare and the standard of their weapon handling and marksmanship appears to have been high the ironical nickname pet lambs which occurs in john browns body speaks for itself frederick douglass was born in maryland the son of a white father and a negroindian mother he escaped from slavery in worked as a stevedore and handyman and became a lecturer for the massachusetts antislavery society his success as a speaker and journalist combined with his fine presence and polished manners gave rise to the suggestion that he had never been a slave at all but he refuted this by publishing a detailed autobiography he was frequently assaulted by proslavery supporters for he went out of his way to fight segregation and was also in danger from slavecatchers but purchased his freedom in with funds raised on a visit to britain he published an abolitionist newspaper the north star campaigned for womens suffrage was active in black recruiting during the civil war and held the post of marshal of the district of columbia before becoming us minister to haiti as flashman says he was the most famous black man in america as a campaigner for his people he was to the nineteenth century what martin luther king was to the twentieth the mutiny browns resignation as leader and his reelection took place more or less as flashman describes villard says that twice at least there was almost a revolt against the plan watson browns letters to his wife at this time give an interesting indication of the feeling at kennedy farm in them he describes the suicide of a local slave whose wife had been sold and the murders of five other slaves and says i cannot come home as long as such things are done here but it seems plain that like some of his companions he regarded harpers ferry as a deathtrap francis meriam the son of an abolitionist family had made previous attempts to join brown but he was a frail unbalanced youth and according to owen brown his only qualification was his hatred of slavery in september he heard from a black freedman in boston lewis hayden that brown was short of money and resolved to contribute part of a recent inheritance to the cause he arrived at harpers ferry on the day before the raid and was brought to the farm by kagi according to flashman by one of browns sons according to villard if flashmans map of harpers ferry is primitive and incomplete it should be remembered that he was drawing it more than half a century later and relying entirely on his memory of only a small part of the town observed mostly at night and in a state of some alarm it was a curiouslooking place that he saw in halfvillage halfarmoury standing on its peninsula surrounded by heights and enclosed along its river banks by the tracks of two railways the winchester potomac and the baltimore ohio which ran on trestles and stone embankments designed to prevent flooding six years later it had been reduced to ruin by nine major civil war actions fought in the vicinity and with the old landmarks gone it is not surprising that most historians of the brown raid have confined themselves to written descriptions or that flashmans rough sketch leaves much to be desired for example in the area marked town where he has shown a bare right angle of shops and houses there were many more buildings behind as there were between the arsenal and the rifle works there were also some minor buildings between the wager house and the armoury railings close to the tracks and beside galts saloon on the shenandoah shore he has forgotten that the arsenal and the large building adjoining were within a railed enclosure and has erred in showing the shenandoah bridge farther downstream than it actually was but despite these flaws his map is accurate enough in its essentials the relative positions of the wager house the armoury gates and enginehouse the arsenal galts saloon the railway lines and the forked covered bridge across the potomac as i have been able to verify by comparison with the us government printing office maps of made available to me through the kindness of jeff bowers and kyle mcgrogan of the harpers ferry national historical park old soldier was a natural mistake on flashmans part colonel lewis washington greatgrandnephew of george washington behaved with soldierly courage throughout the harpers ferry raid but in fact he held his military title as an aide to the governor of virginia it was a strange chance that brought two of americas great military heroes together at a time when both were still virtually unknown robert edward lee a lieutenantcolonel of cavalry with a sound but unremarkable record as a military engineer and superintendent of west point military academy happened to be in washington on leave from texas in october james ewell brown stuart a subaltern who had invented a patent device for attaching a sabre to a belt was waiting in the hope of showing it to the secretary for war when news came of the harpers ferry crisis and he was abruptly despatched to summon lee to the white house when lee was sent to deal with browns raid stuart accompanied him as aide a curious beginning to a famous association only a few years later lee as commanderinchief of the confederate armies was being hailed by many as the greatest captain since wellington a reputation which his surrender to grant at appomattox did nothing to diminish and jeb stuarts skill and daring had made him the outstanding cavalry general of the us civil war lee called him the eyes of the army flashman who served on both sides in the civil war as a confederate staff colonel and as a major in the union forces with whom he won the congressional medal of honor seems to have known both men well that he rode with stuart is already established he refers to lee as my old chief in the present volume and in an earlier one recalls a conversation which suggests that they were more than official acquaintances the young woman who intervened on thompsons behalf was miss christina fouke sister of the wager houses proprietor in a letter to the st louis republican she explained that she wanted to see the law take its course and to prevent any outrage in the hotel although flashman did not know it his order for breakfasts for the raiders and hostages had been filled by the hotel not without reluctance the dishes were carried to the armoury by waiters but brown washington and another hostage ate nothing apparently suspecting that the food might have been poisoned in fact there were eleven hostages in the enginehouse chosen by brown as being the most important of the thirtyodd whom he had taken prisoner the remainder were left in the watchroom which was attached to the enginehouse but had no communicating door in view of browns religious upbringing it is not surprising that he was familiar with the famous last words of bishop hugh latimer burned at the stake in be of good comfort master ridley and play the man we shall this day light such a candle by gods grace in england as shall never be put out flashmans memory must be playing him false here there may have been a lantern in the enginehouse during the parley with captain sinn but brown would hardly have left it burning afterwards to assist the besieging marksmen whatever illumination there was probably came from the enginehouse stove j e b stuart described the parley at the enginehouse door in a letter to his mother and seems to make it clear that this was his only interview with brown however captain dangerfield clerk of the armoury who was one of the hostages in the enginehouse and gave a detailed account of his experiences to the century magazine states that stuart made an earlier visit to the enginehouse during the night with a demand for surrender and said that he would return at dawn for a reply dangerfields recollections are so convincing he talked at length with brown during the night and gives a vivid description of the fighting and final storming of the enginehouse that it is difficult to know what to make of this discrepancy unless dangerfield confused stuart with captain sinn who as we know called on brown to surrender during the night messervy was right there was some trade in harpers ferry souvenirs including fakes of the pikes with which brown had intended to arm the slaves there have been few more dramatic scenes in american history wrote o g villard of the extraordinary interview with john brown which took place only a few hours after his capture it was recorded by a reporter from the new york herald and the essentials are given in sanborn what must strike anyone who reads it is browns complete composure and alertness throughout considering his wounded condition it was a remarkable performance once or twice he gives a sharp retort to an aggressive question but for the rest he is unfailingly courteous measured and even goodhumoured the impression he made on his interrogators was profound and the report of governor wise of virginia is particularly significant in view of the controversy about browns sanity they are mistaken who take brown to be a madman he is a bundle of the best nerves i ever saw a man of clear head of courage fortitude and simple ingenuousness he is cool collected and indomitable flashmans brief version of the interview corresponds with the herald report but he differs on small points from harpers weekly which says that browns hair was a mass of clotted gore and that his speech was frequently interrupted by deep groans reminding me of the agonised growl of a ferocious beast because the marines had been ordered to wear full dress lieutenant green was carrying only a light ceremonial sword this almost certainly prevented his killing brown in the enginehouse political reaction to the raid was predictable stephen douglas spoke for the democrats when he called it the inevitable result of republican policy the republican leaders denounced it and disclaimed all responsibility but could not deny their sympathy with browns cause if not with his methods lincoln thought it right that he should hang even though he agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong that cannot excuse violence bloodshed and treason seward condemned the raid as a criminal act of sedition and treason but could pity the raiders because they acted under delirium neither statement did anything to mollify a south furious at the discovery that wealthy and influential northerners like the secret six and others had been browns paymasters for their part three of the six took prompt evasive action sanborn decamped to canada but soon returned and was briefly arrested dr howe and george stearns followed him and stayed away until after browns execution of the other three theodore parker was dying in europe thomas higginson the most militant of the six stayed put and tried with sanborn to organise browns escape gerrit smith went temporarily mad and spent six weeks in an asylum of all browns supporters frederick douglass had most to fear within hours of the raid a warrant was out for his arrest on charges of murder treason and inciting slave revolt and he fled to canada on the day after the raid and subsequently to britain plotting to rescue brown began within a few days of his capture a group who included two of the six higginson and sanborn commissioned one of browns defence counsel to investigate the possibility of an escape but brown himself refused to be party to any such attempt allan pinkerton may also have considered the possibility of a jailbreak his biographer quotes him as follows had it not been for the excessive watchfulness the pages of american history would never have been stained with the record of his execution
