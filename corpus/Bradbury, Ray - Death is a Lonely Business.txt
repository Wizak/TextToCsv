death is a lonely business ray bradbury venice california in the old days had much to recommend it to people who liked to be sad it had fog almost every night and along the shore the moaning of the oil well machinery and the slap of dark water in the canals and the hiss of sand against the windows of your house when the wind came up and sang among the open places and along the empty walks those were the days when the venice pier was falling apart and dying in the sea and you could find there the bones of a vast dinosaur the rollercoaster being covered by the shifting tides at the end of one long canal you could find old circus wagons that had been rolled and dumped and in the cages at midnight if you looked things lived fish and crayfish moving with the tide and it was all the circuses of time somehow gone to doom and rusting away and there was a loud avalanche of big red trolley car that rushed toward the sea every halfhour and at midnight skirled the curve and threw sparks on the high wires and rolled away with a moan which was like the dead turning in their sleep as if the trolleys and the lonely men who swayed steering them knew that in another year they would be gone the tracks covered with concrete and tar and the high spiderwire collected on rolls and spirited away and it was in that time in one of those lonely years when the fogs never ended and the winds never stopped their laments that riding the old red trolley the highbucketing thunder one night i met up with deaths friend and didnt know it it was a raining night with me reading a book in the back of the old whining roaring railcar on its way from one empty confettitossed transfer station to the next just me and the big aching wooden car and the conductor up front slamming the brass controls and easing the brakes and letting out the hellsteam when needed and the man down the aisle who somehow had got there without my noticing i became aware of him finally because of him swaying swaying standing there behind me for a long time as if undecided because there were forty empty seats and late at night it is hard with so much emptiness to decide which one to take but finally i heard him sit and i knew he was there because i could smell him like the tidelands coming in across the fields on top of the smell of his clothes there was the odor of too much drink taken in too little time i did not look back at him i learned long ago looking only encourages i shut my eyes and kept my head firmly turned away it didnt work oh the man moaned i could feel him strain forward in his seat i felt his hot breath on my neck i held on to my knees and sank away oh he moaned even louder it was like someone falling off a cliff asking to be saved or someone swimming far out in the storm wanting to be seen ah it was raining hard now as the big red trolley bucketed across a midnight stretch of meadowgrass and the rain banged the windows drenching away the sight of open fields we sailed through culver city without seeing the film studio and ran on the great car heaving the floorboard whining underfoot the empty seats creaking the train whistle screaming and a blast of terrible air from behind me as the unseen man cried death the train whistle cut across his voice so he had to start over death another whistle death said the voice behind me is a lonely business i thought he might weep i stared ahead at the flashing rain that rushed to meet us the train slowed the man rose up in a fury of demand as if he might beat at me if i didnt listen and at last turn he wanted to be seen he wished to drown me in his need i felt his hand stretch out and whether as fists or claws to rake or beat me i could not guess i clutched the seat in front of me his voice exploded oh death the train braked to a halt go on i thought finish it is a lonely business he said in a dreadful whisper and moved away i heard the back door open at last i turned the car was empty the man had gone taking his funeral with him i heard gravel crunching on the path outside the train the unseen man was muttering out there to himself as the doors banged shut i could still hear him through the window something about the grave something about the grave something about the lonely the train jerked and roared away through the long grass and the storm i threw the window up to lean out and stare back into wet darkness if there was a city back there and people or one man and his terrible sadness i could not see nor hear the train was headed for the ocean i had this awful feeling it would plunge in i slammed the window down and sat shivering i had to remind myself all the rest of the way youre only twentyseven you dont drink but i had a drink anyway here at this far lost end of the continent where the trail wagons had stopped and the people with them i found a laststand saloon empty save for a bartender in love with hopalong cassidy on late night tv one double vodka please i was astounded at my voice why was i drinking for courage to call my girlfriend peg two thousand miles away in mexico city to tell her that i was all right but nothing had happened to me had it nothing but a train ride and cold rain and a dreadful voice behind me exhaling vapors of fear but i dreaded going back to my apartment bed which was as empty as an icebox abandoned by the okies on the way west the only thing emptier was my great american novelists bank account in an old roman temple bank building on the edge of the sea about to be washed away in the next recession the tellers waited in rowboats every morning while the manager drowned himself in the nearest bar i rarely saw any of them with only an occasional sale to a pulp detective magazine there was no cash to deposit so i drank my vodka i winced jesus said the bartender you look like you never had booze before i never did you look horrible i feel horrible you ever think something awful is going to happen but you dont know what its called the heebiejeebies i swallowed more vodka and shivered no no something really terrible closing in on you is what i mean the bartender looked over my shoulder as if he saw the ghost of the man on the train there did you bring it in with you no then its not here but i said he spoke to me one of the furies furies i didnt see his face god i feel worse now good night lay off the booze but i was out the door and peering in all directions to catch the thing that was waiting for me which way home so as not to meet up with darkness i chose and knowing it was the wrong choice i hurried along the dark rim of the old canal toward the drowned circus wagons how the lion cages got in the canal no one knew for that matter no one seemed to remember how the canals had gotten there in the middle of an old town somehow fallen to seed the seeds rustling against the doors every night along with the sand and bits of seaweed and unravelings of tobacco from cigarettes tossed along the strandshore as far back as but there they were the canals and at the end of one a dark green and oil scummed waterway the ancient circus wagons and cages flaking their white enamel and gold paint and rusting their thick bars a long time before in the early twenties these cages had probably rolled by like bright summer storms with animals prowling them lions opening their mouths to exhale hot meat breaths teams of white horses had dragged their pomp through venice and across the fields long before mgm put up its false fronts and made a new kind of circus that would live forever on bits of film now all that remained of the old parade had ended here some of the cage wagons stood upright in the deep waters of the canal others were tilted flat over on their sides and buried in the tides that revealed them some dawns or covered them some midnights fish swarmed in and out of the bars by day small boys came and danced about on the huge lost islands of steel and wood and sometimes popped inside and shook the bars and roared but now long after midnight with the last trolley gone to destinations north along the empty sands the canals lapped their black waters and sucked at the cages like old women sucking their empty gums i came running head down against the rain which suddenly cleared and stopped the moon broke through a rift of darkness like a great eye watching me i walked on mirrors which showed me the same moon and clouds i walked on the sky beneath and something happened from somewhere a block or so away a tidal surge of salt water came rolling black and smooth between the canal banks somewhere a sandbar had broken and let the sea in and here the dark waters came the tide reached a small overpass bridge at the same moment i reached the center the water hissed about the old lion cages i quickened i seized the rail of the bridge for in one cage directly below me a dim phosphorescence bumped the inside of the bars a hand gestured from within the cage some old liontamer gone to sleep had just wakened to find himself in a strange place an arm outstretched within the cage behind the bars languidly the liontamer was coming full awake the water fell and rose again and a ghost pressed to the bars bent over the rail i could not believe but now the spiritlight took shape not only a hand an arm but an entire body sagged and loosely gesticulated like an immense marionette trapped in iron a pale face with empty eyes which took light from the moon and showed nothing else was there like a silver mask then the tide shrugged and sank the body vanished somewhere inside my head the vast trolley rounded a curve of rusted track choked brakes threw sparks screamed to a halt as somewhere an unseen man jolted out those words with every run jump rush death is a lonely business no the tide rose again in a gesture like a seance remembered from some other night and the ghost shape rose again within the cage it was a dead man wanting out somebody gave a terrible yell i knew it was me when a dozen lights flashed on in the little houses along the rim of the dark canal all right stand back stand back more cars were arriving more police more lights going on more people wandering out in their bathrobes stunned with sleep to stand with me stunned with more than sleep we looked like a mob of miserable clowns abandoned on the bridge looking down at our drowned circus i stood shivering staring at the cage thinking why didnt i look back why didnt i see that man who knew all about the man down there in the circus wagon my god i thought what if the man on the train had actually shoved this dead man into the cage proof none all i had was five words repeated on a night train an hour after midnight all i had was rain dripping on the high wire repeating those words all i had was the way the cold water came like death along the canal to wash the cages and go back out colder than when it had arrived more strange clowns came out of the old bungalows all right folks its three in the morning clear away it had begun to rain again and the police when they had arrived had looked at me as if to say why didnt you mind your own business or wait until morning and phone it in anonymous one of the policemen stood on the edge of the canal in a pair of black swim trunks looking at the water with distaste his body was white from not having been in the sun for a long while he stood watching the tide move into the cage and lift the sleeper there beckoning a face showed behind the bars the face was so gonefaroffaway it was sad there was a terrible wrenching in my chest i had to back off because i heard the first trembling cough of grief start up in my throat and then the white flesh of the policeman cut the water he sank i thought he had drowned too the rain fell on the oily surface of the canal and then the officer appeared inside the cage his face to the bars gagging it shocked me for i thought it was the dead man come there for a last insucked gasp of life a moment later i saw the swimmer thrashing out of the far side of the cage pulling a long ghost shape like a funeral streamer of pale seaweed someone was mourning dear jesus it cant be me they had the body out on the canal bank now and the swimmer was toweling himself the lights were blinking off in the patrol cars three policemen bent over the body with flashlights talking in low voices id say about twentyfour hours wheres the coroner phones off the hook tom went to get him any wallet id hes clean probably a transient they started turning the pockets inside out no not a transient i said and stopped one of the policemen had turned to flash his light in my face with great curiosity he examined my eyes and heard the sounds buried in my throat you know him no then why why am i feeling lousy because hes dead forever christ and i found him my mind jumped on a brighter summer day years back i had rounded a corner to find a man sprawled under a braked car the driver was leaping from the car to stand over the body i stepped forward then stopped something pink lay on the sidewalk near my shoe i remembered it from some high school laboratory vat a lonely bit of brain tissue a woman passing a stranger stood for a long time staring at the body under the car then she did an impulsive thing she could not have anticipated she bent slowly to kneel by the body she patted his shoulder touched him gently as if to say oh there there there oh oh there was he killed i heard myself say the policeman turned what made you say that how would i mean how would he get in that cage underwater if someone didnt stuff him there the flashlight switched on again and touched over my face like a doctors hand probing for symptoms you the one who phoned the call in no i shivered im the one who yelled and made all the lights come on hey someone whispered a plainclothes detective short balding kneeled by the body and turned out the coat pockets from them tumbled wads and clots of what looked like wet snowflakes papiermвchй what in hells that someone said i know i thought but didnt say my hand trembling i bent near the detective to pick up some of the wet paper mash he was busy emptying the other pockets of more of the junk i kept some of it in my palm and as i rose shoved it in my pocket as the detective glanced up youre soaked he said give your name and address to that officer over there and get home dry off it was beginning to rain again and i was shivering i turned gave the officer my name and address and hurried away toward my apartment i had jogged along for about a block when a car pulled up and the door swung open the short detective with the balding head blinked out at me christ you look awful he said someone else said that to me just an hour ago get in i only live another block get in i climbed in shuddering and he drove me the last two blocks to my thirtydollaramonth stale crackerbox flat i almost fell getting out i was so weak with trembling crumley said the detective elmo crumley call me when you figure out what that paper junk is you stuck in your pocket i started guiltily my hand went to that pocket i nodded sure and stop worrying and looking sick said crumley he wasnt anybody he stopped ashamed of what he had said and ducked his head to start over why do i think he was somebody i said when i remember who ill call i stood frozen i was afraid more terrible things were waiting just behind me when i opened my apartment door would black canal waters flood out jump and elmo crumley slammed his door his car was just two dots of red light going away in a fresh downpour that beat my eyelids shut i glanced across the street at the gas station phone booth which i used as my office to call editors who never phoned back i rummaged my pockets for change thinking ill call mexico city wake peg reverse the charges tell her about the cage the man and christ scare her to death listen to the detective i thought jump i was shaking so violently now that i couldnt get the damn key in the lock rain followed me inside inside waiting for me was an empty twentybytwenty studio apartment with a bodydamaged sofa a bookcase with fourteen books in it and lots of waiting space an easy chair bought on the cheap from goodwill industries a sears roebuck unpainted pinewood desk with an unoiled underwood standard typewriter on it as big as a player piano and as loud as wooden clogs on a carpetless floor in the typewriter was an anticipatory sheet of paper in a wood box on one side was my collected literary output all in one stack there were copies of dime detective detective tales and black mask each of which had paid me thirty or forty dollars per story on the other side was another wooden box waiting to be filled with manuscript in it was a single page of a book that refused to begin untitled novel with my name under that and the date july which was three months ago i shivered stripped down toweled myself off got into a bathrobe and came back to stand staring at my desk i touched the typewriter wondering if it was a lost friend or a man or a mean mistress somewhere back a few weeks it had made noises vaguely resembling the muse now more often than not i sat at the damned machine as if someone had cut my hands off at the wrists three or four times a day i sat here and was victimized by literary heaves nothing came or if it did it wound up on the floor in hairballs i swept up every night i was going through that long desert known as dry spell arizona it had a lot to do with peg so far away among all those catacomb mummies in mexico and my being lonely and no sun in venice for the three months only mist and then fog and then rain and then fog and mist again i wound myself up in cold cotton batting each midnight and rolled out all fungus at dawn my pillow was moist every morning but i didnt know what i had dreamed to salt it that way i looked out the window at that telephone which i listened for all day every day which never rang offering to bank my splendid novel if i could finish it last year i saw my fingers moving on the typewriter keys fumbling i thought they looked like the hands of the dead stranger in the cage dangled out in the water moving like sea anemones or like the hands unseen of the man behind me tonight on the train both men gestured slowly slowly i sat down something thumped within my chest like someone bumping into the bars of an abandoned cage someone breathed on my neck i had to make both of them go away i had to do something to quiet them so i could sleep a sound came out of my throat as if i were about to be sick but i didnt throw up instead my fingers began to type xing out the untitled novel until it was gone then i went down a space and saw these words begin to jolt out on the paper death and then is a and then lonely and then at last business i grimaced wildly at the title gasped and didnt stop typing for an hour until i got the stormlightning train rolled away in the rain and let the lion cage fill with black sea water which poured forth and set the dead man free down and through my arms along my hands and out my cold fingertips onto the page in a flood the darkness came i laughed glad for its arrival and fell into bed as i tried to sleep i began sneezing and sneezing and lay miserably using up a box of kleenex feeling the cold would never end during the night the fog thickened and way out in the bay somewhere sunk and lost a foghorn blew and blew again it sounded like a great sea beast long dead and heading for its own grave away from shore mourning along the way with no one to care or follow during the night a wind moved in my apartment window and stirred the typed pages of my novel on the desk i heard the paper whisper like the waters in the canal like the breath on my neck and at last i slept i awoke late to a blaze of sun i sneezed my way to the door and flung it wide to step out into a blow of daylight so fierce it made me want to live forever and so ashamed of the thought i wanted like ahab to strike the sun instead i dressed quickly my clothes from last night were still damp i put on tennis shorts and a jacket then turned the pockets of my damp coat out to find the clot of papiermвchй that had fallen from the dead mans suit only a few hours ago i touched the pieces with my fingernail exhaling i knew what they were but i wasnt ready to face up to it yet i am not a runner but i ran away from the canal the cage the voice talking darkness on the train away from my room and the fresh pages waiting to be read which had started to say it all but i did not want to read them yet i just ran blindly south on the beach into lost world country i slowed at last to stare at the forenoon feedings of strange mechanical beasts oil wells oil pumps these great pterodactyls i said to friends had arrived by air early in the century gliding in late nights to build their nests startled the shore people woke to hear the pumping sounds of vast hungers people sat up in bed wakened by the creak rustle stir of skeletal shapes the heave of earthbound featherless wings rising falling like primeval breaths at three am their smell like time blew along the shore from an age before caves or the men who hid in caves the smell of jungles falling to be buried in earth and ripening to oil i ran through this forest of brontosauri imagining triceratops and the picketfence stegosaurus treading black syrups sinking in tar their laments echoed from the shore where the surf tossed back their ancient thunders i ran past the little white cottages that came later to nest among the monsters and the canals that had been dug and filled to mirror the bright skies of when the white gondolas sailed on clean tides and bridges strung with firefly lightbulbs promised future promenades that arrived like overnight ballet troupes and ran away never to return after the war and the dark beasts just went on sucking the sand while the gondolas sank taking the last of some partys laughter with them some people stayed on of course hidden in shacks or locked in some few mediterranean villas thrown in for architectural irony running i came to a full halt i would have to turn back in a moment and go find that papiermвchй mulch and then go seek the name of its lost and dead owner but for now one of the mediterranean palaces as blazing white as a full moon come to stay upon the sands stood before me constance rattigan i whispered can you come out and play it was in fact a fiery white arabian moorish fortress facing the sea and daring the tides to come in and pull it down it had minarets and turrets and blue and white tiles tilted precariously on the sandshelves no more than one hundred feet from where the curious waves bowed to do obeisance where the gulls circled down for a chance look and where i stood now taking root constance rattigan but no one came out alone and special in this thunderlizard territory this palace guarded that special cinema queen a light burned in one tower window all night and all day i had never seen it not on was she there now yes for the quickest shadow had crossed the window as if someone had come to stare down at me and gone away like a moth i stood remembering hers had been a swift year in the twenties with a quick drop down the mine shaft into the film vaults her director old newsprint said had found her in bed with the studio hairdresser and cut constance rattigans leg muscles with a knife so she would no longer be able to walk the way he loved then he had fled to swim straight west toward china constance rattigan was never seen again if she could walk no one knew god i heard myself whisper i sensed that she had ventured forth in my world late nights and knew people i knew there were breaths of near meetings between us go i thought bang the brass lion knocker on her shorefront door no i shook my head i was afraid that only a blackandwhite film ectoplasm might answer you do not really want to meet your special love you only want to dream that some night shell step out and walk with her footprints vanishing on the sand as the wind follows to your apartment where shell tap on your window and enter to unspool her spiritlight in long creeks of film on your ceiling constance dear rattigan i thought run out jump in that big white duesenberg parked bright and fiery in the sand rev the motor wave and motor me away south to coronado down the sunlit coast no one revved a motor no one waved no one took me south to sun away from that foghorn that buried itself at sea so i backed off surprised to find salt water up over my tennis shoes turned to walk back toward cold rain in cages the greatest writer in the world but no one knew just me i had the moist confetti the papiermвchй mulch in my jacket pocket when i stepped into the one place where i knew that i had to go it was where the old men gathered it was a small dim shop facing the railway tracks where candy cigarettes and magazines were sold and tickets for the big red trolley cars that rushed from la to the sea the tobaccoshedsmelling place was run by two nicotinestained brothers who were always sniveling and bickering at each other like old maids on a bench to one side ignoring the arguments like crowds at a boring tennis match a nest of old men stayed by the hour and the day lying upward about their ages one said he was eightytwo another bragged that he was ninety a third said ninetyfour it changed from week to week as each misremembered last months lie and if you listened as the big iron trains rolled by you could hear the rust flake off the old mens bones and snow through their bloodstreams to shimmer for a moment in their dying gaze as they settled for long hours between sentences and tried to recall the subject they had started on at noon and might finish off at midnight when the two brothers bickering shut up shop and went away sniveling to their bachelor beds where the old men lived nobody knew every night after the brothers grouched off into the dark the old men dispersed like tumbleweeds blown every which way in the salt wind i stepped into the eternal dusk of the place and stood staring at the bench where the old men had sat since the beginning of time there was an empty place between the old men where there had always been four now there were only three and i could tell from their faces that something was wrong i looked at their feet which were surrounded by not only scatterings of cigar ash but a gentle snowfall of strange little paperpunchouts the confetti from hundreds of trolley line tickets in various l and x and m shapes i took my hand out of my pocket and compared the now almost dried soggy mess with the snow on the floor i bent and picked some of it up and let it sift from my fingers an alphabet down the air i looked at the empty place on the bench wheres that old gent i stopped for the old men were staring at me as if i had fired a gun at their silence besides their look said i wasnt dressed right for a funeral one of the oldest lit his pipe and at last puffing it muttered hell be along always does but the other two stirred uncomfortably their faces shadowed where i dared to say does he live the old man stopped puffing who wants to know me i said you know me ive come in here for years the old men glanced at each other nervously its urgent i said the old man stirred a final time canaries murmured the oldest man what canary lady his pipe had gone out he lit it again his eyes troubled but dont bother him hes all right hes not sick hell be along he was protesting too much which made the other old men writhe slowly secretly on the bench his name i asked that was a mistake not to know his name my god everyone knew that the old men glared at me i flushed and backed off canary lady i said and ran out the door to be almost killed by an arriving venice short line train thirty feet from the shop door jackass cried the motorman leaning out and waving his fist canary lady i yelled stupidly shaking my fist to show i was alive and stumbled off to find her i knew her address from the sign in her window canaries for sale venice was and is full of lost places where people put up for sale the last worn bits of their souls hoping no one will buy there is hardly an old house with unwashed curtains which does not sport a sign in the window nash reasonable rear or brass bed hardly used cheap upstairs walking one thinks which side of the bed was used and how long on both sides and how long never again twenty thirty years ago or violins guitars mandolins and in the window ancient instruments strung not with wire or catgut but spider webs and inside an old man crouched over a workbench shaping wood his head always turned away from the light his hands moving someone left over from the year when the gondolas were stranded in backyards to become flower planters how long since he had sold a violin or guitar knock at the door the window the old man goes on cutting and sandpapering his face his shoulders shaking is he laughing because you tap and he pretends not to hear you pass a window with a final sign room with a view the room looks over the sea but for ten years no one has ever been up there the sea might as well not exist i turned a final corner and what i was searching for was there it hung in the sunbrowned window its fragile letters drawn in weathered lead pencil as faint as lemon juice that had burned itself out selferased oh god some fifty years ago canaries for sale yes someone half a century ago had licked a pencil tip lettered the cardboard and hung it to age fixed with flypaper adhesive tape and gone upstairs to tea in rooms where dust lacquered the banister in gums choked the lightbulbs so they burned with an oriental light where pillows were balls of lint and shadows hung in closets from empty racks canaries for sale i did not knock years before out of mindless curiosity i had tried and feeling foolish gone away i turned the ancient doorknob the door glided in the downstairs was empty there was no furniture in any of the rooms i called up through the dusty sunlight anyone home i thought i heard an atticwhisper no one flies lay dead in the windows a few moths that had died the summer of dusted their wings on the front screens somewhere far above where ancient rapunzelwithouthair was lost in her tower a single feather fell and touched the air yes a mouse sighed in the dark rafters come in i pushed the inner door wider it gave with a great grinding shriek i had a feeling that it had been left unoiled so that anyone entering unannounced would be given away by rusty hinges a moth tapped at a dead lightbulb in the upper hall up here i stepped up toward twilight at noon past mirrors that were turned to the wall no glass could see me coming no glass would see me go yes a whisper i hesitated by the door at the top of the stairs perhaps i expected to look in and find a giant canary stretched out on a carpet of dust songless capable only of heart murmurs for talk i stepped in i heard a gasp in the middle of an empty room stood a bed on which eyes shut mouth faintly breathing lay an old woman archaeopteryx i thought i did i really did i had seen such bones in a museum the fragile reptilian wings of that lost and extinct bird the shape of it touched on sandstone in etchings that might have been made by some egyptian priest this bed and its contents was like the silt of a river that runs shallow traced now in its quiet flow was a jackstraw litter of chaff and thin skeleton she lay flat and strewn out so delicately i could not believe it was a living creature but only a fossil undisturbed by eternitys tread yes the tiny yellowed head just above the coverlet opened its eyes tiny shards of light blinked at me canaries i heard myself say the sign in your window the birds oh the old woman sighed dear she had forgotten perhaps she hadnt been downstairs in years and i was the first perhaps to come upstairs in a thousand days oh she whispered that was long ago canaries yes i had some lovely ones again in the whisper her voice faded the years stopped there just the other morn just the other noon they used to sing my lands how they sang but no one ever came to buy why i never sold one i glanced around there was a birdcage in the far north corner of the room and two more halfhidden in a closet sorry she murmured i must have forgotten to take that sign out of my window i moved toward the cages my hunch was right at the bottom of the first cage i saw papyrus from the los angeles times december hirohito ascends throne the young monarch twentyseven this afternoon i moved to the next cage and blinked memories of high school days flooded me with their fears addis ababa bombed mussolini claims triumph haile selassie protests i shut my eyes and turned from that lost year that long ago the feathers had stopped rustling and the warblers had ceased i stood by the bed and the withered discard there i heard myself say you ever listen sunday mornings to the rocky mountain canaryseed hour with an organist that played and a studio full of canaries that sang along the old woman cried with a delight that rejuvenated her flesh and reared her head her eyes flickered like broken glass when its springtime in the rockies sweet sue my blue heaven i said oh werent the birds find fine i had been nine then and tried to figure how in hell the birds could follow the music so well i once told my mom the birdcages must have been lined with dimestore songsheets you sound like a sensitive child the old womans head sank exhausted and she shut her eyes they dont make them that way any more they never did i thought but she whispered you didnt really come see me about the canaries no i admitted its about that old man who rents from you hes dead before i could speak she went on calmly i havent heard him in the downstairs kitchen since early yesterday last night the silence told me when you opened the door down there just now i knew it was someone come to tell me all thats bad im sorry dont be i never saw him save at christmas the lady next door takes care of me comes and rearranges me twice a day and puts out the food so hes gone is he did you know him well will there be a funeral theres fifty cents there on the bureau buy him a little bouquet there was no money on the bureau there was no bureau i pretended that there was and pocketed some nonexistent money you just come back in six months she whispered ill be well again and the canaries will be on sale and you keep looking at the door must you go yesm i said guiltily may i suggest your front doors unlocked why what in the world would anyone want with an old thing like me she lifted her head a final time her eyes flashed her face ached with something beating behind the flesh to pull free no onell ever come into this house up those stairs she cried her voice faded like a radio station beyond the hills she was slowly tuning herself out as her eyelids lowered my god i thought she wants someone to come up and do her a dreadful favor not me i thought her eyes sprang wide had i said it aloud no she said looking deep into my face youre not him who the one who stands outside my door every night she sighed but he never comes in why doesnt he she stopped like a clock she still breathed but she was waiting for me to go away i glanced over my shoulder the wind moved dust in the doorway like a mist like someone waiting the thing the man whatever who came every night and stood in the hall i was in the way goodbye i said silence i should have stayed had tea dinner breakfast with her but you cant protect all of the people in all of the places all of the time can you i waited at the door goodbye did she moan this in her old sleep i only knew that her breath pushed me away going downstairs i realized i still didnt know the name of the old man who had drowned in a lion cage with a handful of train ticket confetti uncelebrated in each pocket i found his room but that didnt help his name wouldnt be there any more than he was things are good at their beginnings but how rarely in the history of men and small towns or big cities is the ending good then things fall apart things turn to fat things sprawl the time gets out of joint the milk sours by night the wires on the high poles tell evil tales in the dripping mist the water in the canals goes blind with scum flint struck gives no spark women touched give no warmth summer is suddenly over winter snows in your hidden bones then it is time for the wall the wall of a little room that is where the shudders of the big red trains go by like nightmares turning you on your cold steel bed in the trembled basement of the not so royal lost canary apartments where the numbers have fallen off the front portico and the street sign at the corner has been twisted north to east so that people if they ever came to find you would turn away forever on the wrong boulevard but meanwhile theres that wall near your bed to be read with your watered eyes or reached out to and never touched it is too far away and too deep and too empty i knew that once i found the old mans room i would find that wall and i did the door like all the doors in the house was unlocked waiting for wind or fog or some pale stranger to step in i stepped i hesitated maybe i expected to find the old mans xray imprint spread out there on his empty cot his place like the canary ladys upstairs looked like late in the day of a garage sale for a nickel or a dime everything had been stolen away there wasnt even a toothbrush on the floor or soap or a washrag the old man must have bathed in the sea once a day brushed his teeth with seaweed each noon washed his only shirt in the salt tide and lain beside it on the dunes while it dried if and when the sun came out i moved forward like a deep sea diver when you know someone is dead his abandoned air holds back every motion you make even your breathing i gasped i had guessed wrong for there his name was on the wall i almost fell leaning down to squint over and over his name was repeated scrabbled on the plaster on the far side of his cot over and over as if fearful of senility or oblivion terrified at waking some dawn to find himself nameless over and over he had scratched with a nicotinestained fingernail william and then willie and then will and beneath the three bill and then again again again smith smith smith smith and under that william smith and smith w his multiplication table swam in and out of focus as i stared for it was all the nights i ever dreaded to see somewhere up ahead in the dark ages of my future me in alone and my fingernail making micesound graffiti on plaster my god i whispered wait the cot squealed like a cat touched in its sleep i put my full weight down and probed with my fingerprints over the plaster there were more words there a message a hint a clue i remembered some boyhood magic where you had pals write quotes on pads and then tear off the quotes but you took the pads out of the room and rubbed a soft pencil across the hidden indentations left on the blank pages and brought forth the words now i did just that i found and rubbed the flat lead of my pencil gently across the wall surface the nail scratches illusioned themselves forth here a mouth there an eye shapes forms bits of an old mans halfdreams four am and no sleep and below that a ghostly plea please god sleep and a dawn despair christ but then at last something that snapped my knees as i crouched lower for here were these words hes standing in the hall again but that was me i thought outside the old womans room five minutes ago upstairs that was me outside this empty room a moment ago and last night in the dark rain on the train and the great railcar bucking the curves and groaning its wooden slats and shivering its tarnished brass as someone unseen swayed in the aisle behind me and mourned the funeral trains passage hes standing in the hall again he stood in the aisle on the train no no too much it was no crime was it to stand in a train aisle moaning or stand here in the hall simply looking at a door and letting an old man know of your being there just with your silence yes but what if one night whoever it was came into the room and brought his lonely business with him i looked at the graffiti as faint and faded as the canariesforsale sign in the window outside i backed off pulling away from that terrible sentence of loneliness and despair outside in the hall i stood feeling the air trying to guess if another man had stood here again and again in the last month with the bones showing behind his face i wanted to whirl and shout upstairs to rattle the empty birdcages if that man comes back sweet jesus call me how i saw an empty telephone stand nearby and a stack of yellow pages from under it yell from your window then but who would hear the sound of her voice like an old key turned in a rusted lock ill come and stand guard i thought why because the dead seabottom mummy that old autumn woman lying in funeral bandages up there was praying for a cold wind to drift up the stairs lock all the doors i thought but when i tried to shut the front door it wouldnt close and i could hear the cold wind still whispering in i ran a ways and then slowed down and stopped heading toward the police station because the dead canaries had begun to rustle their dry wings just behind my ears they wanted out only i could save them and because i sensed around me the quiet waters rising in the nile silt which would flow to erase ancient nikotris the pharaohs twothousandyearold daughter only i could stop the dark nile from sanding her away downstream i ran to my underwood standard typewriter i typed and saved the birds i typed and saved the old dry bones feeling guilty but triumphant triumphant but guilty i rolled them out of the platen and laid them out flat in the bottom of my birdcagesandstone riverbottom novel box where they sang only when you read the words and whispered only when you turned the page then bright with salvation i went away i headed for the police station filled with grand fancies wild ideas incredible clues possible puzzles evident solutions arriving i felt i was the finest acrobat performing on the highest trapeze suspended from the greatest balloon little did i realize that detective lieutenant elmo crumley was armed with long needles and an air rifle he was coming out the front door of the station as i arrived something about my face must have warned him i was about to explode my notions fancies concepts and clues all over him he made a premature gesture of wiping his face almost ducked back inside and came warily down the walk as if approaching a landmine what are you doing here arent citizens supposed to show up if they can solve a murder where do you see murders crumley eyed the landscape and sure enough there were none next subject you dont want to hear what i have to say ive heard it all before crumley brushed by me and headed for his car parked at the curb every time anyone drops dead of a heart attack or trips over his shoelaces in venice theres someone there the next day to tell me sixteen to the dozen how to solve the stopped heart or retie the shoelaces youve got the heartattack shoelace look about you and i didnt sleep last night he kept going and i ran after for he was doing the harry truman stepstotheminute march he heard me coming and called over his shoulder tell you what young papa hemingway you know what i do for a living everyone in venice knows every time you got a story in dime detective or flynns detective the whole town hears you yelling down at the liquor store newsrack pointing at the magazines oh i said the last of the hot air going out of my balloon grounded i stood across the car from crumley biting my lower lip crumley saw this and got a look of paternal guilt jesus h christ he sighed what you know the one thing that gripes my gut about amateur detectives said crumley im not an amateur detective im a professional writer with big antennae that work so youre a grasshopper who knows how to type said crumley and waited for my wince to die but if youd been around venice and my office and the morgue as many years as i have youd know that every vagrant who wanders by or any drunk who stumbles in is full of theories evidence revelations enough to fill a bible and sink a baptist sundayouting picnic boat if we listened to every maundering preacher who fell through the jail doors half the world would be under suspicion one third under arrest and the rest fried or hanged that being so why should i listen to some young scribe who hasnt even begun to make his name in literary history again my wince again he waited who just because he finds a lion cage full of accidental drowning thinks he has stumbled on crime and punishment and feels like raskolnikovs son end of speech respond you know raskolnikov i said in amaze almost before you were born but that doesnt buy horseflakes plead your case im a writer i know more about feelings than you do balls im a detective i know more about facts than you do you afraid a fact will confuse you tell me this kiddo anything ever happen to you in your life anything yeah i mean anything big in between small anything like sickness rape death war revolution murder my mother and father died peacefully yes but i had an uncle shot in a holdup once you see him shot no but well that dont count unless you see i mean you ever find anything like men in lion cages ever before no i said at last well there you have it youre still in shock you dont know what life is i was born and raised in the morgue this is the first real touch of marble slab you ever had so why dont you quiet down and go away he heard his own voice getting much too loud shook his head and said no why dont i quiet down and go away which he did he opened the car door jumped in and before i could reinflate my balloon was gone cursing i slammed into a telephone booth dropped a dime in the slot and called across five miles of los angeles when someone picked up at the other end i heard a radio playing la raspa a door slammed a toilet flushed but i could feel the sunlight that i needed waiting there the lady living in a tenement on the corner of temple and figueroa nervous at the phone she held in her hand at last cleared her throat and said que mrs gutierrez i shouted i stopped and started over mrs gutierrez this is the crazy oh she gasped and then laughed si si you want to talk to fannie no no just a few yells will you yell down please mrs gutierrez i yell i heard her move i heard the entire ramshackle rickety tenement lean someday a blackbird would land on the roof and the whole thing would go i heard a small chihuahua tapdance on the linoleum after her built like a bull bumblebee and barking i heard the tenement outer porch door open as mrs gutierrez stepped out onto the third floor and leaned to call down through the sunshine at the second floor aai fannie aai its the crazy i called into my end tell her i need to come visit mrs gutierrez waited i could hear the secondfloor porch creak as if a vast captain had rolled out onto its plankings to survey the world aai fannie the crazy needs to visit a long silence a voice sprang sweetly through the air above the tenement yard i could not make out the words tell her i need tosca tosca mrs gutierrez yelled down into the yard a long silence the whole tenement leaned again the other way like the earth turning in its noon slumbers the strains of the first act of tosca moved up around mrs gutierrez she spoke fannie says i hear the music mrs gutierrez that means yes i hung up at the same instant a hundred thousand tons of salt water fell on the shore a few yards away with exquisite timing i nodded at gods precision making sure i had twenty cents in my pocket i ran for the next train she was immense her real name was cora smith but she called herself fannie florianna and no one ever called her otherwise and i had known her years ago when i lived in the tenement and stayed in touch with her after i moved out to the sea fannie was so huge that she never slept lying down day and night she sat in a largesized captains chair fixed to the deck of her tenement apartment with bruise marks and dents in the linoleum which her great weight had riveted there she moved as little as possible her breath churning in her lungs and throat as she sailed toward the door and squeezed out to cross the hall to the narrow watercloset confines where she feared she might be ignominiously trapped one day my god she often said wouldnt it be awful if we had to get the fire department to pry me out of there and then back to her chair and her radio and her phonograph and only a beckon away a refrigerator filled with ice cream and butter and mayonnaise and all the wrong foods in the wrong amounts she was always eating and always listening next to the refrigerator were bookshelves with no books only thousands of recordings of caruso and gallicurci and swarthout and the rest when the last songs were sung and the last record hissed to a stop at midnight fannie sank into herself like an elephant shot with darkness her great bones settled in her vast flesh her round face was a moon watching over the vast territorial imperatives of her body propped up with pillows her breath escaped and sucked back escaped again fearful of the avalanche that might happen if somehow she lay back too far and her weight smothered her her flesh engulfed and crushed her lungs and put out her voice and light forever she never spoke of it but once when someone asked why there was no bed in her room her eyes burned with a fearful light and beds were never mentioned again fat as murderer was always with her she slept in her mountain afraid and woke in the morning glad for one more night gone having made it through a piano box waited in the alley below the tenement mine said fannie the day i die bring the piano box up tuck me in hoist me down mine oh and while youre at it theres a dear soul hand me that mayonnaise jar and that big spoon i stood at the front door of the tenement listening her voice flowed down through the halls it started out as pure as a stream of fresh mountain water and cascaded through the second to the first and then along the hall i could almost drink her singing it was that clear fannie as i climbed up the firstfloor steps she trilled a few lines from la traviata as i moved on the second flight pausing eyes shut to listen madame butterfly sang welcome to the bright ship in the harbor and the lieutenant in his whites it was the voice of a slender japanese maiden on a hill on a spring afternoon there was a picture of that maid aged seventeen on a table near the window leading out onto the secondfloor tenement porch the girl weighed pounds at most but that was a long time ago it was her voice that pulled me up through the old stairwell a promise of brightness to come i knew that when i got to the door the singing would stop fannie id say i heard someone singing up here just now did you something from butterfly how strange i wonder who it could have been we had played that game for years talked music discussed symphony ballet opera listened to it on radios played it on her old edison crankup phono but never never once in three thousand days had fannie ever sung when i was in the room with her but today was different as i reached the second floor her singing stopped but she must have been thinking planning maybe she had glanced out and seen the way i walked along the street maybe she read my skeleton through my flesh maybe my voice calling far across town on the phone had brought the sadness of the night and the rain with it anyway a mighty intuition heaved itself aware in fannie floriannas summer bulk she was ready with surprises i stood at her door listening creaks as of an immense ship blundering through tides a great conscience stirred there a soft hissing the phonograph i tapped on the door fannie i called the crazy is here she opened the door to a thunderclap of music great lady she had put the shaved wooden needle on the hissing record then surged to the door held the knob waiting at the whisk of the baton down she had flung the door wide puccini flooded out gathered round pulled me in fannie florianna helped it was the first side of tosca fannie planted me in a rickety chair lifted my empty paw put a glass of good wine in it i dont drink fannie nonsense look at your face drink she surged around like those wondrous hippos turned light as milkweed in fantasia and sank like a terribly strange bed upon her helpless chair by the end of the record i was crying there there whispered fannie refilling my glass there there i always cry at puccini fannie yes dear man but not so hard not so hard true i drank half of the second glass it was a st emilion from a good vineyard brought and left by one of fannies rich friends who came clear across town for good talk long laughs better times for both no matter whose income was higher i had seen some of toscaninis relatives going up the stairs one night and waited i had seen lawrence tibbett coming down once and we had nodded passing they always brought the best bottles with their talk and they always left smiling the center of the world can be anywhere here it was on the second floor of a tenement on the wrong side of la i wiped tears on my jacket cuff tell me said the great fat lady i found a dead man fannie and no one will listen to me about it my god her round face got rounder as her mouth opened her eyes went wide then softened to commiseration poor boy who it was one of those nice old men who sit in the ticket office down at the venice short line stop been sitting there since billy sunday thumped the bible and william jennings bryan made his cross of gold speech ive seen them there since i was a kid four old men you felt theyd be there forever glued to the wooden benches i dont think i ever saw one of them up and around they were there all day all week all year smoking pipes or cigars and talking politics thirteen to the dozen and deciding what to do with the country when i was fifteen one of them looked at me and said you going to grow up and change the world only for the best boy yes sir i said i think youll do it he said wont he gents yes they all said and smiled at me the old man who asked me that hes the one i found in the lion cage last night in the cage under water in the canal this calls for one more side of tosca fannie was an avalanche getting up a tide flowing to the machine a mighty force cranking the windup arm and gods whisper putting the needle down on a new surface as the music rose she came back into her chair like a ghost ship regal and pale quiet and concerned i know one reason why youre taking this so hard she said peg she still in mexico studying been gone three months might as well be three years i said christ im lonely and vulnerable said fannie shouldnt you call her christ fannie i cant afford and i dont want to reverse the charges ill just have to hope shell phone me in the next day or so poor boy sick with love sick with death the awful thing is fannie i didnt even know that old mans name and isnt that a shame the second side of tosca really did it i sat there head down with the tears running off the tip of my nose into the wine youve ruined your st emilion said fannie gently when the record ended now im mad i said why fannie standing like a great pomegranate mother by the phonograph sharpened a new needle and found a happier record why someone killed him fannie someone stuffed him in that cage there was no other way for him to have gotten in oh dear she murmured when i was twelve one of my uncles back east was shot in a holdup late at night in his car at his funeral my brother and i vowed wed find the murderer and do him in but hes still in the world somewhere and that was a long time back in another town this time its here whoever drowned the old man lives within a few blocks of me in venice and when i find him youll turn him over to the police fannie leaned forward in one massive but tender motion youll feel better after a good sleep then she read my face no she said at my funeral you wont feel better well go on be the fool all men are god what lives we women lead watching the fools kill each other and the killers kill the killers and us over on the sidelines yelling stop and nobody listening cant you hear me love she put another record on and let the needle down like a loving kiss to the grooves and came surging over to touch my cheek with her great pink chrysanthemum fingers oh please do be careful i dont like venice not enough streetlights and those damned oil wells pumping all night long no letup with a case of the moans venice wont get me fannie or whatever it is wandering around venice standing in halls waiting i thought outside old mens and old womens doors fannie became a giant glacier standing over me she must have seen my face again where everything was given away nothing hidden instinctively she glanced at her own door as if a shadow had passed outside her intuition stunned me whatever you do her voice was lost deep down in hundreds of pounds of suddenly haunted flesh dont bring it here death isnt a thing you can bring with you fannie oh yes it is scrape your feet before coming in downstairs do you have money to get your suit drycleaned ill give you some shine your shoes brush your teeth dont ever look back eyes can kill if you look at someone and they see you want to be killed they tag along come here dear boy but wash up first and look straight ahead horsefeathers fannie and hogwash that wont keep death away and you know it anyway i wouldnt bring anything here to you but me lots of years fannie and love that melted the snow in the himalayas she turned in a slow carousel motion suddenly we both heard the music that had long since started on the hissing record carmen fannie florianna sank her fingers into her bosom and seized forth a blacklace fan flitted it to full blossom flirted it before her suddenly flamenco eyes shut her lashes demurely and let her lost voice spring forth reborn fresh as cool mountain water young as i had felt only last week she sang and as she sang she moved it was like watching the heavy curtain lift daintily high at the metropolitan to be draped around the rock of gibraltar and whirled at the gesturings of a maniac conductor who knew how to electrify elephant ballets and call spiritspout white whales from the deeps by the end of the first song i was crying again this time with laughter only later did i think to myself my god for the first time in her room she sang for me downstairs it was afternoon i stood in the sunlit street swaying savoring the aftertaste of the wine looking up at the second floor of the tenement the strains sounded of the song of farewell the leavetaking of butterfly by her young lieutenant all in white sailing away fannie loomed on her porch looking down at me her little rosebud mouth smiling sadly the young girl trapped in her round harvestmoon face letting the music behind her speak our friendship and my leavetaking for now seeing her there made me think of constance rattigan locked away in her moorish fort by the sea i wanted to call up and ask about the similarity but fannie waved i could only wave back i was ready for venice in clear weather now little balding man who doesnt look like a detective elmo crumley i thought here i come but all i did was loiter in front of the venice police station feeling like a gutless wonder i couldnt decide whether crumley was beauty or the beast inside there such indecision made me ache out on the sidewalk until someone who looked like crumley glanced out of an upstairs jail window i fled the thought of him opening his mouth like a blowtorch to scorch the peach fuzz off my cheeks made my heart fall over like a prune christ i thought when will i face up to him at last to unload all the dark wonders that are collecting like tombstone dust in my manuscript box when soon during the night it happened a small rainstorm arrived out front of my apartment about two in the morning stupid i thought in bed listening a small rainstorm how small three feet wide six feet tall all just in one spot rain drenching my doormat falling nowhere else and then quickly gone hell i leaped to yank the door wide there wasnt a cloud in the sky the stars were bright with no mist no fog there was no way for rain to get there yet there was a pool of water by my door and a set of footprints arriving pointed toward me and another set barefoot going away i must have stood there for a full ten seconds until i exploded now hold on someone had stood there wet for half a minute almost ready to knock wondering if i was awake and then walked off to the sea no i blinked not to the sea the sea was on my right to the west these naked footprints went to my left east i followed them i ran as if i could catch up with the miniature storm until i reached the canal where the footprints stopped at the rim jesus i stared down at the oily waters i could see where someone had climbed out and walked along the midnight street to my place and then run back the strides were bigger to dive in god who would swim in those filthy waters someone who didnt care never worried about disease someone who loved night arrivals and dark departures for the hell the fun or the death of it i edged along the canal bank adjusting my eyes watchful to see if anything broke the black surface the tide went away and came back surging through a lock that had rusted open a herd of small seals drifted by but it was only kelp going nowhere you still there i whispered what did you come for why to my place i sucked air and held it for in a hollowedout concrete cache under a small cement bunker on the far side of a rickety bridge i thought i saw a greasy fringe of hair rise and then an oiled brow eyes stared back at me it could have been a seaotter or a dog or a black porpoise somehow strayed and lost in the canal the head stayed for a long moment half out of water and i remembered a thing i had read as a boy leafing african novels about crocodiles that infested the subterranean caves under the rims of congo riverbanks the beasts sank down and never came up submerged they slid to hide up inside the secret bank itself waiting for someone foolish enough to swim by then the reptiles squirmed out of their underwater dens to feed was i staring at a similar beast someone who loved night tides who hid in caches under the banks to rise and step softly to leave rain where he walked i watched the dark head in the water it watched me with gleaming eyes no that cant be a man i shivered i jumped forward as one jumps toward a horror to make it vanish to scare spiders rats snakes away not bravery but fear made me stomp the dark head sank the water rippled the head did not rise again shuddering i walked back along the trail of dark rain that had come to visit my doorstep the small pool of water was still there on my sill i bent and plucked up a small mound of seaweed from the middle of the pool only then did i discover i had run to and from the canal dressed only in my jockey shorts i gasped glanced swiftly around the street was empty i leaped in to slam the door tomorrow i thought ill go shake my fists at elmo crumley in my right fist a handful of trolley ticket dust in my left a clump of moist seaweed but not at the police station jails like hospitals sank me to my knees in a faint crumleys home was somewhere shaking my fists id find it for about days a year in venice the sun doesnt show through the mist until noon for some sixty days a year the sun doesnt come out of the fog until its ready to go down in the west around four or five oclock for some forty days it doesnt come out at all the rest of the time if youre lucky the sun rises as it does for the rest of los angeles and california at fivethirty or six in the morning and stays all day its the forty or sixtyday cycles that drip in the soul and make the riflemen clean their guns old ladies buy rat poison on the twelfth day of no sun but on the thirteenth day when they are about to arsenic their morning tea the sun rises wondering what everyone is so upset about and the old ladies feed the rats down by the canal and lean back to their brandy during the fortyday cycles the foghorn lost somewhere out in the bay sounds over and over again and never stops until you feel the people in the local graveyard beginning to stir or late at night when the foghorn gets going some variety of amphibious beast rises in your id and swims toward land it is swimming somewhere yearning maybe only for sun all the smart animals have gone south you are left stranded on a cold dune with an empty typewriter an abandoned bank account and a halfwarm bed you expect the submersible beast to rise some night while you sleep to get rid of him you get up at three am and write a story about him but dont send it out to any magazines for years because you are afraid not death but rejection in venice is what thomas mann should have written about all this being true or imagined the wise man lives as far inland as possible the venice police jurisdiction ends as does the fog at about lincoln avenue there at the very rim of official and bad weather territory was a garden i had seen only once or twice if there was a house in the garden it was not visible it was so surrounded by bushes trees tropical shrubs palm fronds bulrushes and papyrus that you had to cut your way in with a reaper there was no sidewalk only a beaten path a bungalow was in there all right sinking into a chinhigh field of uncut grass but so far away from the street it looked like an elephant foundering in a tar pit soon to be gone forever there was no mailbox out front the mailman must have just tossed the mail in and beat it before something sprang out of the jungle to get him from this green place came the smell of oranges and apricots in season and what wasnt orange or apricot was cactus or epiphyllum or nightblooming jasmine no lawnmower ever sounded here no scythe ever whispered no fog ever came on the boundary of venices damp eternal twilight the bungalow survived amid lemons that glowed like christmas tree lights all winter long and on occasion walking by you thought you heard okapi rushing and thumping a serengeti plain in there or great sunset clouds of flamingos startled up and wheeling in pure fire and in that place wise about the weather and dedicated to the preservation of his eternally sunburned soul lived a man some fortyfour years old with a balding head and a raspy voice whose business when he moved toward the sea and breathed the fog was bruised customs broken laws and the occasional death that could be murder elmo crumley and i found him and his house because a series of people had listened to my queries nodded and pointed directions everyone agreed that every late afternoon the short detective ambled into that green jungle territory and disappeared amid the sounds of hippos rising and flamingos in descent what should i do i thought stand on the edge of his wild country and shout his name but crumley shouted first jesus christ is that you he was coming out of his jungle compound and trekking along the weedpath just as i arrived at his front gate its me as the detective trailblazed his own uncut path i thought i heard the sounds i had always imagined as i passed thompsons gazelles on the leap crosswordpuzzle zebras panicked just beyond me plus a smell of golden pee on the wind lions seems to me groused crumley we played this scene yesterday you come to apologize you got stuff to say thats louder and funnier if youd stop moving and listen i said your voice carries ill say that lady i know three blocks from where you found the body said because of your yell that night her cats still havent come home okay im standing here and with every one of his words my fists had jammed deeper into my sports jacket pockets somehow i couldnt pull them out head ducked eyes averted i tried to get my breath crumley glanced at his wristwatch there was a man behind me on the train that night i cried suddenly he was the one stuffed the old gentleman in the lion cage keep your voice down how do you know my fists worked in my pockets squeezing i could feel his hands stretched out behind me i could feel his fingers working pleading he wanted me to turn and see him dont all killers want to be found out thats what dimestore psychologists say why didnt you look at him you dont make eye contact with drunks they come sit and breathe on you right crumley allowed himself a touch of curiosity he took out a tobacco pouch and paper and started rolling a cigarette deliberately not looking at me and you shouldve heard his voice youd believe if youd heard my god it was like hamlets fathers ghost from the bottom of the grave crying out remember me but more than that see me know me arrest me crumley lit his cigarette and peered at me through the smoke his voice aged me ten years in a few seconds i said ive never been so sure of my feelings in my life everybody in the world has feelings crumley examined his cigarette as if he couldnt decide whether he liked it or not everyones grandma writes wheaties jingles and hums them until you want to kick the barleymalt out of the old crone songwriters poets amateur detectives every damn fool thinks hes all three you know what you remind me of son that mob of idiots that swarmed after alexander pope waving their poems novels and essays asking for advice until pope ran mad and wrote his essay on criticism you know alexander pope crumley gave an aggrieved sigh tossed down his cigarette stepped on it you think all detectives are gumshoes with glue between their ears yeah pope for christs sake i read him under the sheets late nights so my folks wouldnt think i was queer now get out of the way you mean all this is for nothing i cried youre not going to try to save the old man i blushed hearing what i had said i meant i know what you meant said crumley patiently he looked off along the street as if he could see all the way to my apartment and the desk and the typewriter standing there youve latched on to a good thing or you think you have so you run fevers you want to get on that big red streetcar and ride back some night and catch that drunk and haul him in but if you do he wont be there or if he is not the same guy or you wont know him so right now youve got bloody fingernails from beating your typewriter and the stuffs coming good as hemingway says and your intuition is growing long antennae that are ever so sensitive that and pigs knuckles buys me no sauerkraut he started off around the front of his car in a replay of yesterdays disaster oh no you dont i yelled not again you know what you are jealous crumleys head almost came off his shoulders he whirled im what i almost saw his fingers reach for a gun that wasnt there and and and i floundered you youre never going to make it my insolence staggered him his head swiveled to stare at me over the top of his car make what he said whatever it is you want to do youwontdoit i jolted to a full stop astounded i couldnt remember ever having yelled like this at anyone in school i had been the prize custard every time some teacher slammed her jaws my crust fell but now unless you learn i said lamely feeling my face fill up with hot color to ah listen to your stomach and not your head norman rockwells philosophical advice for wayward sleuths crumley leaned against his car as if it were the only thing in the world that held him up a laugh burst from his mouth which he capped with his palm and he said muffled continue you dont want to hear kid i havent had a laugh in days my mouth gummed itself shut i closed my eyes go on said crumley with a gentler tone its just i said slowly i learned years ago that the harder i thought the worse my work got everyone thinks you have to go around thinking all the time no i go around feeling and put it down and feel again and write that down and at the end of the day think about it thinking comes later there was a curious light in crumleys face he tilted his head now this way to look at me and then tilted it the other way like a monkey in the zoo staring out through the bars and wondering what the hell that beast is there outside then without a word or another laugh or smile he simply slid into the front seat of his car calmly turned on the ignition softly pressed the gas and slowly slowly drove away about twenty yards down the line he braked the car thought for a moment backed up and leaned over to look at me and yelled jesus h christ proof god damn it proof which made me yank my right hand out of my jacket pocket so fast it almost tore the cloth i held my fist out at last and opened my trembling fingers there i said you know what that is no do i know what it is yes do i know who the old man is yes do you know his name no crumley put his head down on his crossed arms on the steering wheel he sighed okay lets have it these i said staring at the junk in my palm are little as and small bs and tiny cs alphabets letters punched out of trolley paper transfers because you drive a car you havent seen any of this stuff for years because all i do since i got off my rollerskates is walk or take trains im up to my armpits in these punchouts crumley lifted his head slowly not wanting to seem curious or eager i said this one old man down at the trolley station was always cramming his pockets with these hed throw this confetti on folks on new years eve or sometimes in july and yell happy fourth when i saw you turn that poor old guys pockets inside out i knew it had to be him now what do you say there was a long silence shit crumley seemed to be praying to himself his eyes shut as mine had been only a minute ago god help me get in what get in god damn it youre going to prove what you just said you think im an idiot yes i mean no i yanked the door open struggling with my left fist in my left pocket i got this other stuff seaweed left by my door last night and shut up and handle the map the car leaped forward i jumped in just in time to enjoy whiplash elmo crumley and i stepped into the tobacco smells of an eternally attic day crumley stared at the empty space between the old men who leaned like dry wicker chairs against each other crumley moved forward to hold out his hand and show them the drycaked alphabet confetti the old men had had two days now to think about the empty seat between them sonofabitch one of them whispered if a cop murmured one of them blinking at the mulch in his palm shows me something like that its gotta come from willys pockets you want me to come identify him the other two old men leaned away from this one who spoke as if he had said something unclean crumley nodded the old man shoved his cane under his trembling hands and hoisted himself up crumley tried to help but the fiery look the old man shot him moved him away stand aside the old man battered the hardwood floor with his cane as if punishing it for the bad news and was out the door we followed him out into that mist and fog and rain where gods light had just failed in venice southern california we walked into the morgue with a man eightytwo years old but when we came out he was one hundred and ten and could no longer use his cane the fire was gone from his eyes so he didnt even beat us off as we tried to help him out to the car and he was mourning over and over my god who gave him that awful haircut when did that happen he babbled because he needed to talk nonsense did you do that to him he cried to no one who did that who i know i thought but didnt tell as we got him out of the car and back to sit in his own place on that cold bench where the other old men waited pretending not to notice our return their eyes on the ceiling or the floor waiting until we were gone so they could decide whether to stay away from the stranger their old friend had become or move closer to keep him warm crumley and i were very quiet as we drove back to the asgoodasempty canariesforsale house i stood outside the door while crumley went in to look at the blank walls of the old mans room and look at the names the names the names william willy will bill smith smith smith fingernailscratched there in the plaster making himself immortal when he came out crumley stood blinking back into the terribly empty room christ he murmured did you read the words on the wall all of them crumley looked around and was dismayed to find himself outside the door staring in hes standing in the hall who stood here crumley turned to measure me was it you you know it wasnt i said edging back i could arrest you for breaking and entering i suppose and you wont do that i said nervously the door all the doors have been open for years anyone could come in someone did crumley glanced back into the silent room how do i know you didnt scratch those words on that wall with your own damned fingernail just to get my hair up and make me believe your cockamamie theory the writing on the wall is wobbly an old mans scribble you could have thought of that and imitated an old mans scrawl could have done but didnt do my god what do you need to convince you more than gooseflesh on my neck ill tell you that then i said my hands back in my pockets again making fists the seaweed still hidden but waiting the rest is upstairs go up look come down tell me what you see crumley tilted his head to give me one of those monkey looks then sighed and went up like an old shoe salesman carrying an anvil in each hand at the top of the stairs he stood like lord carnarvon outside tutankhamens waiting tomb for a long moment then he went in i thought i heard the ghosts of old birds rustling and peering i thought i heard a mummy whisper rising from river dusts but that was the old muse in me anxious for startlements what i heard was crumley pacing the milkweed silt on the old womans floor which muffled his tread a birdcage gave a metallic bell sound he had touched it then what i heard was him bending over to lend an ear to a wind of time that moved from a dry and aching mouth and what i heard finally was the sound of the name on the wall whispered once twice three times as if the old canary woman were reading the egyptian hieroglyphs symbol by symbol when crumley came back down he was carrying the anvils in his stomach and his face was tired im getting out of this business he said i waited hirohito ascends throne he quoted the old newsprint he had just seen at the bottom of the cage addis ababa i said was it really that long ago now youve seen it all i said whats your conclusion what conclusion should i have didnt you read it in her face didnt you see what shes next what its all there in her eyes she knows about the man who stands in the hall hes been up to her room also but hasnt gone in shes simply waiting and praying for him im cold all over and cant get warm just because you were right

think what you just said you got to eat sometime or sleep you cant be here and you know it the first time you run for a hotdog is when he him who whomever if he exists will come in make her sneeze and shes gone there was never any man here it was only an old hairball blowing by in the night the old guy heard it first mrs canary hears it now crumley stared up the long dark stairs toward the place of no birdsong no springtime in the rockies no bad organist playing for his tiny yellow friends in some lost year give me time to think kid he said and let you be an accessory to murder there you go again crumley yanked the door so it screamed on its hinges how come i spend half my time almost liking you and the rest being mad as hell do i do that to you i said but he was gone crumley did not call for twentyfour hours grinding my teeth into a fine powder i primed my underwood and steamrollered crumley into the platen speak i typed how come crumley responded typing from somewhere inside my amazing machine i spend half my time almost liking you and the rest being mad as hell then the machine typed ill telephone you on the day the old canary lady dies its obvious that years back i had pasted two gummed labels on my underwood one read official ouija board the other in large letters dont think i didnt i just let the old ouija board bang and clatter how soon do we work together on this problem you responded crumley in my fingertips are the problem will you become a character in my novel i already am then help me fat chance damn i tore the page out of the machine just then my private phone rang it seemed it took me ten miles of running to get there thinking peg all the women in my life have been librarians teachers writers or booksellers peg was at least three of those but she was far away now and it terrified me she had been all summer in mexico finishing studies in spanish literature learning the language traveling on trains with mean peons or busses with happy pigs writing me lovescorched letters from tamazunchale or bored ones from acapulco where the sun was too bright and the gigolos not bright enough not for her anyway friend to henry james and consultant to voltaire and benjamin franklin she carried a lunchbucket full of books everywhere i often thought she ate the brothers goncourt like high tea sandwiches in the late afternoons peg once a week she called from somewhere lost in the churchtowns or big cities just come up out of the mummy catacombs at guanajuato or gasping after a climb down teotihuacan and we listened to each others heartbeats for three short minutes and said the same dumb things to each other over and over and over the sort of litany that sounds fine no matter how long or often you say it each week when the call came the sun blazed over the phone booth each week when the talk stopped the sun died and the fog arose i wanted to run pull the covers over my head instead i punched my typewriter into bad poems or wrote a tale about a martian wife who lovesick dreams that an earthman drops from the sky to take her away and gets shot for his trouble some weeks as poor as i was we pulled the old telephone operator calling from mexico city would ask for me who i would say what was that again operator would hear peg sigh far away the more i talked nonsense the longer i was on the line just a moment operator let me get that again the operator repeated my name wait let me see if hes here whos calling and pegs voice swiftly would respond from two thousand miles off tell him its peg peg and i would pretend to go away and return hes not here call back in an hour an hour echoed peg and click buzz hum she was gone helped into the booth and yanked the phone off the hook yes i yelled but it wasnt peg silence who is this i said silence but someone was there not two thousand miles away but very near and the reception was so clear i could hear the air move in the nostrils and mouth of the quiet one at the other end well i said silence and the sound that waiting makes on a telephone line whoever it was had his mouth open close to the receiver whisper whisper jesus god i thought this cant be a heavybreather calling me in a phone booth people dont call phone booths no one knows this is my private office silence breath silence breath i swear that cool air whispered from the receiver and froze my ear no thanks i said and hung up i was halfway across the street jogging with my eyes shut when i heard the phone ring again i stood in the middle of the street staring back at the phone afraid to go touch it afraid of the breathing but the longer i stood there in danger of being run down the more the phone sounded like a funeral phone calling from a burial ground with bad telegram news i had to go pick up the receiver shes still alive said a voice peg i yelled take it easy said elmo crumley i fell against the side of the booth fighting for breath relieved but angry did you call a moment ago i gasped howd you know this number everyone in the whole goddamn towns heard that phone ring and seen you jumping for it whos alive the canary lady checked her late last night that was last night thats not why im calling damn it get over to my place late this afternoon i might just rip your skin off why three oclock in the morning what were you doing standing outside my house me you better have a good alibi by god i dont like being spooked ill be home around five if you talk fast you get maybe a beer if you bat an eye i kick ass crumley i yelled be there and he hung up i walked slowly back toward my front door the phone rang again peg or the man with cold ice in his breath or crumley being mean i banged the door open jumped in slammed it and then with excruciating patience rolled a fresh white sheet of elmo crumley into my underwood and forced him to say only nice things to me ten thousand tons of fog poured over venice and touched at my windows and came in under the cracks in the door every time it is a damp drear november in my soul i know it is high time to go from the sea again and let someone cut my hair there is a thing in haircutting that assuages the blood and calms the heart and makes the nerves serene beyond that i heard the old man stumbling out of the morgue in the back of my mind wailing my god who gave him that awful haircut cal of course had done that awful job so i had several reasons to go visit cal the worst barber in venice maybe the world but cheap called across the tidal waves of fog waiting with his dull scissors brandishing his bumblebee electric clippers that shocked and stunned poor writers and innocent customers who wandered in cal i thought snip away the darkness short in front so i can see short on the sides so i can hear short in back so i can feel things creeping up on me short but i didnt make it to cals just then as i stepped out of my apartment into the fog a parade of great dark elephants went by on windward avenue which is to say a pavane of black trucks with huge cranes and immense pilepullers on the back they were in full thunder and heading for the pier to knock it down or begin to knock it down the rumors had been afloat for months and now the day was here or tomorrow morning at the latest i had more of the day to wait to go see crumley and cal was not exactly the greatest lure in the world the elephants lumbered and groaned their machineries and shook the pavement on their way to devour the fun house and the horses on the carousel feeling like an old russian writer madly in love with killing winter and blizzards on the move what could i do but follow by the time i got to the pier half the trucks had lumbered down on the sand to move out toward the tides and catch the junk that would be tossed over the railings the others had headed out toward china on the rotting planks sawdusting the wooden mulch on the way i followed sneezing and using kleenex i should be home lying with my cold but the thought of going to bed with so many fog and mist and rain thoughts slogged me on i stood amazed at my own blindness halfway down the length of the pier wondering at all the people here i had seen but never known half of the games were nailed shut with freshcut pine planks a few stayed open waiting for the bad weather to come in and toss hoops or knock milk bottles down outside half a dozen stalls the young men who looked old or the old men who looked older stood watching those trucks growling out on the sea end of the pier getting ready to tooth and nail sixty years of past time i looked around realizing i had rarely seen behind the dropped flat doors or the rolleddown and battened canvasses i had the feeling again of being followed and spun about a big plume of fog came along the pier ignored me and passed on so much for premonition here halfway to the sea there was a small dark shack that i had passed for at least ten years without seeing the windowshades up today for the first time the shades were raised i looked in my god i thought theres a whole library there i walked swiftly over wondering how many similar libraries were hidden away on the pier or lost in the old alleys of venice i stood by the window remembering nights when i had seen a light behind the shade and a shadowhand turning pages in an invisible book and heard a voice whispering the words declaiming poetries philosophizing on a dark universe it had always sounded like a writer with second thoughts or an actor slipping downhill into a ghost repertory lear with two extra sets of mean daughters and only half the wits but now at noon this day the shades were up inside a small light still burned in a room empty of occupants but filled with a desk a chair and an oldfashioned but huge leather couch around the couch on all sides towering to the ceiling were cliffs and towers and parapets of books there must have been a thousand of them crammed and shoved up to the ceiling i stepped back and looked at the signs i had seen but not seen around and above the shack door tarot cards but the print was faded the next sign down read palmistry the third one in block letters was phrenology and beneath handwriting analysis and to one side hypnotism i sidled closer to the door for there was a very small business card thumbtacked just above the doorknob i read the name of the shacks owner a l shrank and underneath the name in pencil not quite so faint as canaries for sale these words practicing psychologist a sextuplethreat man i put my ear to the door and listened in there between precipice shelves of dusty books did i hear sigmund freud whispering a penis is only a penis but a good cigar is a smoke hamlet dying and taking everyone along virginia wolf like drowned ophelia stretched out to dry on that couch telling her sad tale tarot cards being shuffled heads being felt like cantaloupes pens scratching lets peek i said again i stared through the window but all i saw was the empty couch with the outline of many bodies in its middle it was the only bed nights a l shrank slept there days did strangers lie there holding on to their insides as if they were broken glass i could not believe but the books were the things that fascinated me they not only brimmed the shelves but filled the bathtub which i could glimpse through a halfopen door to one side there was no kitchen if there had been the icebox would have been filled no doubt with copies of peary at the north pole or byrd alone in antarctica a l shrank it was obvious bathed in the sea like many others here and had his banquets at hermans hotdogs down the way but it was not so much the presence of nine hundred or a thousand books as it was their titles their subjects their incredible dark and doomed and awful names on the high always midnight shelves stood thomas hardy in all his gloom next to the decline and fall of the roman empire which leaned on dread nietzsche and hopeless schopenhauer cheek by jowl with the anatomy of melancholy edgar allan poe mary shelley freud the tragedies of shakespeare the marquis de sade thomas de quincey hitlers mein kampf spenglers decline of the west and on and on eugene oneill was there oscar wilde but only his sad prison essay none of his lilac fluff or gentian laughs genghis khan and mussolini leaned on each other books with titles like suicide as an answer or the dark night of hamlet or lemmings to the sea were on the high shelf in snows on the floor lay world war two and krakatoa the explosion heard round the world along with india the hungry and the red sun rises if you run your eye and mind along books like that and run your stare along again disbelieving there is only one thing you can do like a bad film version of mourning becomes electra where one suicide follows another and murder tops murder and incest incites incest and blackmail supersedes poisoned apples and people fall down stairs or step on strychnine tacks you finally snort toss back your head and laugh whats so funny said someone behind me i turned i said whats so funny he stood with his thin pale face about six inches from the tip of my nose the man who slept on that analysis couch the man who owned all those endoftheworld books a l shrank well he said your library i stammered a l shrank glared waiting luckily i sneezed which erased my laugh and let me cover my confusion with a kleenex forgive me forgive i said i own exactly fourteen books its not often you see the new york public library imported to venice pier the flames went out in a l shranks tiny brightyellow fox eyes his wirethin shoulders sank his tiny fists opened up my praise caused him to glance through his own window like a stranger and gape why he murmured amazed yes theyre all mine i stood looking down at a man no taller than fiveone or fivetwo maybe less without his shoes i had a terrible urge to check to see if he wore threeinch heels but kept my eyes level with the top of his head he was not even aware of my inspection so proud was he of the proliferation of literary beasts that infested his dark shelves i have five thousand nine hundred and ten books he announced you sure its not five thousand nine hundred and eleven he very carefully looked only in at his library and said in a cold voice why are you laughing the titles the titles he leaned closer to the window to search the shelves for some bright traitor among all those assassin books well i said lamely arent there any summers good weather fair winds in your library dont you own any glad books happy finds like leacocks sunshine sketches of a little town the sun is my undoing in the good old summertime june laughter no shrank stood on tiptoe to say this then caught himself and sank down no how about peacocks headlong hall or huck finn three men in a boat how green was my father pickwick papers robert benchley james thurber s j perelman i machinegunned the titles shrank listened and almost cringed back at my recitation of joy he let me run down how about the savonarola joke book or the funny sayings of jack the ripper i stopped a l shrank was all shadow and ice turning away sorry i said and i was what id really like to do some day is come by to browse that is if youll let me a l shrank weighed this decided i was repentant and moved to touch his shopfront door it whined softly open he turned to examine me with his tiny bright amber eyes his thin fingers twitching at his sides why not now he said i cant later mr shrank a l shrank consulting psychologist no not shrink as you might be thinking as in psychiatrist just plain shrank meadow doctor to lost creatures he was imitating my banter his thin smile was a weaktea duplicate of my own i felt it would vanish if i in turn shut my mouth i glanced above him how come youve left that old tarot card sign in place and what about phrenology and hypnotism you forgot to mention my handwriting analysis sign and the one mentioning numerology is just inside the door be my guest i moved but stopped come along said a l shrank come on he said really smiling now the smile of a fish however not of a dog step in at each gentle command i inched forward my eyes touching with all too obvious irony on the hypnotism sign above the tiny mans head his eyes did not blink come said a l shrank nodding at his library without looking at it i found the invitation irresistible in spite of the car crashes dirigible burnings mine explosions and mental delapidations i knew each book contained well i said at which moment the entire pier shook far out at the end in the fog a great creature had struck the pier it was like a whale brunting a ship or the queen mary plowing into the ancient pilings the big iron brutes out there hidden were beginning to tear the planks apart the vibrations knocked the planks and came up through my body and shranks body with jolts of mortality and doom our bones shook in our blood we both jerked our heads to try to stare through the fog at the devastation somewhere beyond the mighty blows jarred me a modicum away from the door the titanic buffeting trembled and shivered and inched a l shrank on his sill like a lost toy a paleness bloomed within the paleness of his face he looked like a man panicked by an earthquake or a tidal wave rushing at the pier again and again the great machines hammered and pounded in the fog a hundred yards away and invisible cracks seemed to appear in a l shranks milkglass brow and cheeks the war had begun soon the dark tanks would lumber along the pier destroying as they came a flood of carnival йmigrйs running before them toward land a l shrank soon to be among them as his house of dark tarot cards fell it was my chance to escape but i failed shranks gaze had returned to me as if i could save him from that invasion just beyond in a moment he might seize my elbow for support the pier shook i shut my eyes i thought i heard my secret office telephone ring i almost cried out my phone its for me but i was saved from that by a tide of men and women and a few children hurrying the other way not toward land but rushing toward the sea end of the pier a large man in a dark cloak and a floppy g k chesterton hat leading the way last ride last day last time he yelled last chance come on shapeshade whispered a l shrank and thats who it was shapeshade the sole owner and proprietor of the old venice cinema at the foot of the pier which would be ground underfoot and turned to celluloid mulch within the week this way called shapeshades voice from the mist i glanced at a l shrank he shrugged and nodded giving permission i ran off into the fog the long chattering clack and grind the ascending slow clang rattle and roar like some robot centipede of immense size scaling the side of a nightmare pausing at the top for the merest breath then cascading in a serpentine of squeal rush and thunderous roar in scream in human shriek down the abysmal span there to attack more swiftly this time another hill another ascending scale rising yet higher and higher to fall off into hysteria the rollercoaster i stood looking up at it through the mist in an hour so they said it would be dead it had been part of my life as long as i could remember from here most nights you could hear people laughing and screaming as they soared up to the heights of socalled existence and plunged down toward an imaginary doom so this was to be a final ride late in the afternoon just before the dynamite experts taped explosives to the dinosaurs legs and brought him to his knees jump in a boy yelled its free even free i never thought it was anything but torture i said hey look whos here in the front seat someone called and behind mr shapeshade was there cramming his vast black hat down over his ears laughing back of him was annie oakley the rifle lady back of her sat the man who had run the fun house alongside him was the old lady who spun the pink cotton candy machine and sold illusion that melted in your mouth and left you hungry long before chinese food back of them were the knock a milk bottle and the toss a hoop team everyone looking like they were posing for a passport photo to eternity only mr shapeshade as coxswain was jubilant as captain ahab said dont be yellow he called that made me feel like a sheep i let the rollercoaster tickettearer help me into the cowards back row this your first trip he laughed and my last everyone set to scream why not cried shapeshade let me out i thought well all die here goes the ticketman yelled nothing it was heaven going up and hell all the way down i had this terrible feeling they blew the legs out from under the rollercoaster as we descended when we hit bottom i glanced over a l shrank stood on the pier staring up at us lunatics who had willingly boarded the titanic a l shrank backed off in the fog but we were climbing again everyone screamed i screamed christ i thought we sound as if we mean it when it was over the celebrants wandered off in the fog wiping their eyes holding on to each other mr shapeshade stood beside me as the dynamite men ran in to wrap their explosives around the girders and struts of the great ride you going to stay and watch said mr shapeshade gently i dont think i could stand it i said i saw a film once where they shot an elephant right on screen the way it fell down and over collapsed hurt me terribly it was like watching someone bomb st peters dome i wanted to kill the hunters no thanks a flagman anyway was waving us off shapeshade and i walked back through the fog he took my elbow like a good middleeuropean uncle advising his favorite nephew tonight no explosions no destructions only joy fun great old times my theater maybe tonight is our last cinema night maybe tomorrow free gratis nice boy be there he hugged me and plowed off through the fog like a great dark tugboat on my way past a l shranks i saw that his door was still wide open but i didnt step in i wanted to run call collect on my gas station telephone but i feared that two thousand miles of silence would whisper back at me of deaths in sunlit streets red meats hung in carneceria windows and a loneliness so vast it was like an open wound my hair grayed it grew an inch cal i thought dear dreadful barber here i come cals barber shop in venice was situated right across the street from the city hall and next door to a bail bond shop where flies hung like dead trapeze artists from flypaper coils that had been left in the windows for ten years and where men and women from the jail across the way went in like shadows and came out like uninhabited clothes and next door to that was a little maandpa grocery but they were gone and their son sat on his pants in the window all day and sold maybe a can of soup and took horserace telephone bets the barber shop though it had a few flies in the window that had been dead no more than ten days at least got a washdown once a month from cal who ran the place with welloiled shears and unoiled elbows and spearmint gossip in his allpink mouth he acted like he was running a bee farm and afraid it would get out of hand as he wrestled the big silver bumbling insect around your ears until it suddenly froze bit and held on to your hair until cal cursed and yanked back as if he were pulling teeth which is why along with economics i had my hair cut only twice a year by cal twice yearly also because of all the barbers in cal in the world cal talked sprayed gummed cudgeled advised and droned more than most which boggles the mind name a subject he knew it all top side and bottom and m the middle of explaining dumb einsteins theory would stop shut one eye cock his head and ask the great question with no safe answer hev did i ever tell you about me and old scott joplin why old scott and me by god and by jesus listen that day in when he taught me how to play the maple leaf rag let me tell you there was a picture of scott joplin on the wall signed in ink a few centuries ago and fading like the canary ladys message in that photo you could see a very young cal seated on a piano stool and bent over him joplin his big black hands covering those of the happy boy there was that joyous kid forever on the wall captured on film hunched over to seize the piano keys ready to leap on life the world the universe eat it all the look on that boys face was such that it cracked my heart every tune i saw it so i didnt look at it often it hurt enough to see cal looking at it gathering his spit to ask the ageold great question and with no begs or requests dash for the piano to maple leaf that rag cal cal looked like a cowpuncher who now rode barber chairs think of texas cowhands lean weatherbeaten permanently dyed by sun sleeping in their stetsons glued on for life taking showers in the damn hats that was cal circling the enemy the customer weapon in hand eating the hair chopping the sideburns listening to the shears admiring the bumblebee electrics harmonics talking talking as i imagined him cowhandnaked dancing around my chair stetson jampacknested above his ears craveitching to leap to that piano and rake its smile sometimes id pretend i didnt see him throwing those mad stares shuttling his love glances at the waiting black and white white and black keys but finally id heave a great masochistic sigh and cry okay cal git cal got galvanized he shot across the room in a cowboy shamble two of him one in the mirror faster and brighter than the real one yanking the piano lid up to show all that yellow dentistry just aching to have its music pulled listen to this son you ever hear anything ever ever in life ever hear anything like this no cal i said waiting in the chair with my head halfruined no i said honestly i never did my god cried the old man coming out of the morgue a final time inside my head who gave him that awful haircut i saw the guilty party standing in the window of his barber shop gazing out at the fog looking like one of those people in empty rooms or cafes or on street corners in paintings by hopper cal i had to force myself to pull open the front door and step in gingerly looking down there were curlicues of brown black and gray hair all over the place hey i said with false joviality looks like you had a great day you know said cal looking out the window that hair has been there five six weeks aint nobody in their right mind coming in that door save tramps which isnt you or fools which isnt you or bald men which isnt you asking directions to the madhouse and poor people which is you so go sit down in the chair and prepare to be electrocuted the electric clippers have been on the fritz for two months and i aint had the cash to get the goddamn things fixed sit obedient to my executioner i bounded forward and sat and stared at the hairstrews on the floor symbols of a silent past that must have meant something but said nothing even looked at sidewise i could figure no strange shapes or imminent forecasts at last cal turned and waded across that forlorn porcelain and forelock sea to let his hands pick up all by themselves the comb and scissors he hesitated behind me like the axeman sad to have to chop some young kings head he asked how long i wanted it or how ruined i wanted it take your choice but i was busy staring across the glaring white arctic emptiness of the shop at cals piano for the first time in fifteen years it was covered its grayyellow oriental smile was invisible under a white mortuary bedsheet cal my eyes were on the sheet i had forgotten for a moment the old venice ticket office man lying cold with a terrible haircut cal i said how come youre not maple leafing the old rag cal let his scissors snipsnip and then snipsnip around my neck cal i said something wrong i said when does the dying stop said cal a long way off and now the bumblebee buzzed and stung my ears and made the old chill ripple down my spine and then cal got busy hacking away with his dull scissors as if he were harvesting a wild wheat crop cursing under his breath i smelled a faint whiskey odor but kept my eyes straight ahead cal i said shoot no shit is what i mean he threw the scissors comb and dead silver bumblebee on the shelf and shambled across the ocean of old hair to yank the sheet off the piano which grinned like a big mindless shape as he sat down and laid his two hands like limp paintbrushes on the keys ready to paint god knows what what came out was like broken teeth in a mashed jaw damn hell crud i used to do it used to play the living guts outa that thing scott taught me old scott scott his voice died he had glanced up at the wall above the piano he glanced away when he saw me looking but it was too late for the first time in twenty years that picture of scott joplin was gone i lurched forward in the chair my mouth dropped wide at which time cal forced himself to hurl the sheet back over the smile and return a mourner at his own wake to stand behind my chair and pick up the torture instruments again scott joplin ninetyseven cal the barber zero he said describing a lost game he ran his trembling fingers over my head jesus look what i done to you my god thats a lousy cut and im not even halfway in i ought to pay you for all the years you let me make you run around looking like an airedale with mange on top of which let me tell you what i did to a customer three days ago its terrible maybe i made the poor sonofabitch look so bad someone killed him to put him out of his misery i lurched forward again but cal put me gently back i should give novocain but i dont about this old guy listen im listening cal i said for that was why i was here sat right where you are sitting now said cal sat right there just like youre sitting looked in the mirror and said shoot the works thats what he said cal shoot the works biggest night of my life he said myrons ballroom downtown la havent been there in years called

draining of color the telephone rang three times arent you going to answer it cal i said cal looked at it the same way i looked at my gas station office phone and two thousand miles of silence and heavy breathing along the way he shook his head why would i answer a phone when theres nothing but bad news on it he said some days you feel that way i said i pulled the apron from around my neck slowly and got up automatically cals hand went palm out for my cash when he saw his hand there he cursed and dropped his hand turned and banged the cash register up jumped no sale i looked at myself in the mirror and almost barked like a seal at what i saw its a great haircut cal i said git outa here on the way out i put my hand up to touch where the picture of scott joplin used to hang playing great stuff with fingers like two bunches of big black bananas if cal saw this he didnt say i slipped on some old hair going out i walked until i found sunshine and crumleys buriedindeepgrass bungalow i stood outside crumley must have felt me there he yanked the door open and said you doing that again i never did im no good at being out scaring people at three oclock in the morning i said he looked down at his left hand and shoved it at me there was a small clot of oily green seaweed on his palm his clench marks in it i held out my hand like someone trumping an ace and opened my fingers my identical clump of seaweed drier and brittle lay in my palm crumleys eyes moved from both our hands up to my eyes my brow my cheeks my chin he exhaled apricot pie halloween pumpkins backyard tomatoes late summer peaches santa clauss california son you look like all of them with a face like that how can i yell guilty he dropped his hands and stood aside you do like beer dont you not much i said would you rather i fix you a chocolate malt could you no goddamn it youll drink beer and like it get it in here he wandered off shaking his head and i came in and shut the door feeling like a high school student come back to visit his tenthgrade teacher crumley was standing in his parlor window blinking out at the dry dirt path i had wandered up a moment ago three oclock by god he muttered three right out there i heard someone weeping how you figure that crying gave me the goosebumps sounded like a banshee woman hell let me look at your face again i showed him my face jesus he said do you always blush that easily i cant help it christ you could massacre half a hindu village and still look like peter rabbit what are you stuffed with chocolate bars and i keep six kinds of ice cream in my icebox when i can afford it i bet you buy it instead of bread i wanted to say no but he would have caught the lie take a load off your feet and what kind of beer do you hate most i got budweiser which is awful budweiser which is dreadful and bud which is the worst take your pick no dont allow me he ambled off to the kitchen and came back with two cans theres still a little sun lets get out of here he led the way into his backyard i couldnt believe crumleys garden why not he steered me out the back door of his bungalow into a green and luscious illumination of thousands of plants ivies papyrus birds of paradise succulents cacti crumley beamed got six dozen different species of epiphyllum over there thats iowa corn against the fence thats a plum tree thats apricot thats orange want to know why everyone in the world needs two three jobs i said without hesitation one job isnt enough just as one life isnt enough i want to have a dozen of both bullseye doctors should dig ditches ditchdiggers ought to run kindergartens one day a week philosophers should wash dishes in a greasy spoon two nights out of ten mathematicians should blow whistles at high school gyms poets should drive trucks for a change of menu and police detectives should own and operate the garden of eden i said quietly jesus crumley laughed and shook his head and looked at the green seaweed he ground in his palm youre a painintheass knowitall you think you got me figured surprise he bent and twisted a garden valve hark as they used to say hist a soft rain sprang up in brilliant blooms that touched all around eden with whispers that said soft quiet serenity stay live forever i felt all my bones diminish in my flesh something like a dark skin fell from my back crumley tilted his head to one side to study my face well i shrugged you see so much rot every week you need this trouble is the guys over at the station wont try anything like this sad huh to just be a cop and nothing else forever christ id kill myself you know what i wish i could bring all the rot i see every week here and use it for fertilizer boy what roses id grow or venus flytraps i said he mused on that and nodded that earns you a beer he led the way into his kitchen and i stood looking out at the rainforest taking deep breaths of the cool air but not able to smell it because of my cold ive passed your place for years i said and wondered who could possibly live back in such a great homemade forest now that ive met you i know it had to be you crumley had to stop himself from falling on the floor and writhing with joy at the compliment he controlled himself and opened two really terrible beers one of which i managed to sip cant you make a better face than that he asked you really like malts better yeah i took a bigger sip and it gave me courage to ask one thing what am i doing here you asked me over because of that stuff you found out front of your house that seaweed now here i am surveying your jungle and drinking your bad beer no longer a suspect oh for christs sake crumley swigged his own drink and blinked at me if i thought you were any kind of mad liontamer cagefillerupper youd have been in the toilet two days ago you think i dont know all about you theres not much to know i said sheepishly like hell there isnt listen crumley took another swig shut his eyes and read the details off the back of his eyelids one block from your apartments a liquor store and an ice cream parlor and next to that a chinese grocery they all think youre mad the nut they call you the fool on occasion you talk loud and lots they hear every time you sell a story to weird tales or astonishing stories its all over the pier because you open your window and yell christ but the bottom line is kid they like you you got no future sure they all agree because who in hell is really going to go and land on the moon when between now and the year will anyone give a damn about mars only you flash gordon only crazy nut you buck rogers i was blushing furiously head down halfangry and somewhat embarrassed but somehow pleased at all this attention i had been called flash and buck often but somehow when crumley did it it went right by without wounding crumley opened his eyes saw my blush and said now cut that out why would you have known all this about me a long time before the old man was i stopped and changed it before he died im curious about everything most people arent i discovered that when i was fourteen everybody else gave up toys that year i told my folks no toys no christmas so they kept on giving me toys every year the other boys got shirts and ties i took astronomy out of four thousand students in my high school there were only fifteen other boys and fourteen girls who looked at the sky with me the rest were out running around the track and watching their feet so it follows that i turned instinctively for something had stirred in me i found myself wandering across the kitchen i got a hunch i said could i what said crumley you got a workroom here sure why crumley frowned with faint alarm that only made me push a bit harder mind if i see well i moved in the direction toward which crumleys eyes had darted the room was right off the kitchen it had once been a bedroom but now it was empty except for a desk a chair and a typewriter on the desk i knew it i said i went to stand behind the chair and look at the machine which was not an old beatup underwood standard but a fairly new corona with a fresh ribbon in it and a stack of yellow sheets waiting to one side that explains why you look at me the way you do i said lord yes always tilting your head this way and that scowling narrowing your eyes trying to xray that big head of yours see if theres a brain in there and how it does what it does said crumley tilting his head now to the left now to the right nobody knows how the brain works not writers no one all i do is throw up every morning clean up at noon bullshit said crumley gently truth i looked at the desk which had three drawers on either side of the cubby i put my hand out and down toward the bottom drawer on the left crumley shook his head i shifted and reached over to touch the bottom drawer on the right crumley nodded i pulled the drawer open slowly crumley exhaled there was a manuscript there in an opentop box it looked to be about to pages beginning on page one with no title page how longs this been down here in the bottom drawer i asked pardon its all right said crumley five years youre going to finish it now i said like hell i am why because i told you so and i know shut the drawer said crumley not just yet i pulled out the chair sat and rolled a sheet of yellow paper into the machine i typed five words on one line and then shifted down and wrote three more words crumley squinted over my shoulder and read them aloud quietly death is a lonely business he took a breath and finished it by elmo crumley he had to repeat it by elmo crumley by god there i placed my new title page down on top of his waiting manuscript and slid the drawer shut thats a gift ill find another title for my book now youll have to finish it i rolled another sheet of paper into the machine and asked what was the number of the last page on the bottom of your manuscript one hundred sixtytwo said crumley i typed and left the paper in the machine there i said its waiting tomorrow morning you get out of bed walk to the machine no phone calls no newspaper reading dont even go to the bathroom sit down type and elmo crumley is immortal bs said crumley but ever so quietly god promises but you got to work i got up and crumley and i stood looking at his corona as if it were the only child he would ever have you giving me orders kid said crumley no your brain is if youd just listen crumley backed off walked into the kitchen got some more beer i waited by his desk until i heard the back screen door bang i found crumley in his garden letting the whirlaround watertosser cover his face with cooling raindrops for the day was warm now and the sun out full here on the rim of fog country what is it said crumley forty stories you sold so far at thirty bucks apiece yeah the rich author you are rich i stood down at the magazine rack at abes liquor yesterday and read that one you wrote about the man who finds he has a skeleton inside him and it scares hell out of him christ it was a beaut where in hell do you get ideas like that i got a skeleton inside me i said most people never notice crumley handed me a beer and watched me make yet another face the old man william smith yeah william smith the autopsy report came in this morning there was no water in his lungs that means he didnt drown that means he was killed up on the canal bank and shoved down into the cage after he was dead that proves dont jump ahead of the train youll get run down and dont say i told you so or ill take that beer back i offered him the beer gladly he nudged my hand aside what have you done about the haircut i said what haircut mr smith had a really lousy haircut the afternoon before he died his friend moaned about it at the morgue remember i knew only one really lousy barber could have done it i told crumley about cal the prizes promised william smith myrons ballroom modestis the big red train crumley listened patiently and said flimsy its all we got i said you want me to check the venice cinema to see if they saw him out front the night he disappeared no said crumley you want me to check modestis the train myrons ballroom no said crumley what do you want me to do then stay out of it why because said crumley and stopped he glanced at the back door of his house anything happens to you my goddamn novel never gets finished somebodys got to read the damn thing and i dont know anybody else you forget i said whoever stood outside your house last night stands outside mine already i cant let him do that can i i cant go on being spooked by that guy who gave me the title i just typed on your machine can i crumley looked at my face and i could see his thinking was apricot pie banana cake and strawberry ice cream just be careful he said at last the old man may have slipped and knocked his head and was dead when he hit the water which is why there was no water in his lungs and then he swam over and put himself in the cage sure crumley squinted at me trying to guess my weight silently he went away into the jungle and was gone about a minute i waited then far away i heard an elephant trombone the wind i turned slowly into a drench of garden rain listening a lion closer opened his vast beehive valves and exhaled a killer swarm a herd of antelopes and gazelles dusted by like a summer wind of sound touching the dry earth moving my heart to their run crumley was suddenly on the path smiling wildly like a boy halfproud halfashamed of a madness unknown to all the world until now this hour he snorted and gestured two fresh beers up at six lilyhorn sound systems suspended like great dark flowers in the trees from these the antelopes gazelles and zebras circled our lives and protected us from the nameless beasts out beyond the bungalow fences the elephant blew his nose once more and knocked my soul flat african recordings said crumley unnecessarily swell i said hey whats that ten thousand african flamingos airlifted from a bright freshwater lagoon back five thousand days ago when i was a high school kid and martin and osa johnson were flying in from the wildebeest african trails to walk among us plain folks in california and tell great tales and then i remembered the day i was supposed to run full speed to hear martin johnson speak he had been killed in a plane crash just outside la but right now in elmo crumleys jungle compound eden retreat there were martin johnsons birds my heart went with them i looked at the sky and said what are you going to do crumley nothing he said the old canary lady is going to live forever you can bet on it im broke i said when the drowned people showed up later that day it really spoiled the picnics all up and down the beach people were indignant packed their hampers went home dogs that ran eagerly down to look at the strangers lying on the shore were called back by angry women or irritable men children were herded away and sent off with a reprimand not to associate with such peculiar strangers ever again drowning after all was a forbidden subject like sex it was never discussed it followed then that when a drowned person dared touch shore he or she was persona non grata children might dash down to hold dark ceremonies in their minds but the ladies who remained after the families had cringed off and gone away raised their parasols and turned their backs as if someone with unruly breath had called from the surf nothing in emily post could help the situation very simply the lost surfers had come without invite permission or warning and like unwanted relatives had to be hustled off to mysterious icehouses inland at a double dogtrot but no sooner was one surfstranger gone than you heard the sandpiping childrens voices crying look mommy oh look git away get and you heard the rush of feet running away from the stillwarm landmines on the shore walking back from crumleys i heard about the unwelcome visitors the drowned ones i had hated to leave the sun which seemed to shine forever in crumleys orchard reaching the sea was like touching another country the fog came as if glad for all the bad shoreline news the drownings had had nothing to do with police night traumas or dark surprises in canals that sucked their teeth all night it was simply riptides the shore was empty now but i had an even emptier feeling when i lifted my gaze to the old venice pier bad rice i heard someone whisper me an old chinese imprecation shouted at the edges of crops to guarantee a good harvest against the devastation of the envious gods bad rice for someone had at last stepped on the big snake someone had stomped it down the rollercoaster was gone forever from the far end of the pier what was left of it now lay in the late day like a great strewn jackstraws game but only a big steam shovel was playing that game now snorting bending down to snap up the bones and find them good when does the dying stop i had heard cal say a few hours back with the empty pierend ahead its skeleton being flensed and a tidal wave of fog storming toward shore i felt a fusillade of cold darts in my back i was being followed i spun but it wasnt me being pursued by nothing across the street i saw a l shrank he ran along hands deep in overcoat pockets head sunk in his dark collar glancing back like a rat before hounds god i thought now i know who he reminds me of poe the famous photographs the somber portraits of edgar allan with his vast milkglass lampglow brow and brooding nightfire eyes and the doomed and lost mouth buried under the dark moustache his tie askew on his untidy collar over his always convulsing and swallowing throat edgar allan poe poe ran shrank ran glancing back at a swift fog with no shape christ i thought its after all of us by the time i reached the venice cinema the fog impatient had already gone in mr shapeshades old venice cinema was special because it was the last of a series of night riverboats afloat on the edge of the tide anywhere in the world the front part of the cinema was on the concrete walk that leads from venice down toward ocean park and santa monica the back half of it stuck out on the pier so that its rear end was over the water i stood in front of the movie house at this late hour of the day glanced up at the marquee and gasped there were no films listed only one huge twofoothigh word goodbye it was like being stabbed in the stomach i stepped forward to the ticket booth shapeshade was there smiling at me with manic good will as he waved goodbye i said mournfully sure shapeshade laughed tata toodleoo farewell and its free go in any friend of douglas fairbanks thomas meighan milton sills and charles ray is a friend of mine i melted at the names from my childhood people i had seen flickering on ancient screens when i was two three four on my mothers knee in a cool movie house in northern illinois before the bad rice came and we steamed west in an old beatup kissel ahead of the okies my dad looking for a twelvebuckaweek job i cant go in mr shapeshade look at the boy who wont shapeshade threw his hands to the heavens and rolled his eyeballs like stromboli irritated by pinocchio and itching to cut his strings why not when i come out of movies in daylight i get depressed nothings right so wheres the sun cried shapeshade by the time you exit its night anyway i wanted to ask you about three nights ago i said did you by any chance see that old ticket office man bill willy william smith waiting out front here that night i yelled at him yes what happened to your head i said did a grizzly bear claw your wig off i said his hair was a laugh riot so who took a lawnmower to him demon cal yeah did you see someone meet william smith and take him away i got busy all of a sudden six people came for tickets six when i looked around mr smith willie was gone why my shoulders sank my frustration must have shown in my face shapeshade quickened with sympathy and enunciated his sensen breath through the ticket booths glass speakhole guess whos inside on the big mothholesieved silver screen fairbanks the black pirate gish broken blossoms lon chancy phantom of the opera who was greater lord mr shapeshade those are all silent so where were you in you didnt notice the more talkie the less movie statues they played mouths moved and your feet went to sleep so these last nights silence hmm quiet yes silence and gestures forty feet across and scowls and leers twenty feet high quiet phantoms mumstheword pirates gargoyles and hunchbacks who talked in winds and rains and let the organ speak for them eh plenty of seats go he thumped his brass ticket key the machine stuck a nice fresh orange ticket out at me yes i took the ticket and looked into the face of this old man who hadnt been out in sun for forty years who loved films madly and would rather read silver screen than the encyclopaedia britannica his eyes were gently mad with his love of old faces on yesterdays posters is shapeshade your real name i said at last it means a house like this where shades are shaped and all shapes are shadows you got a better name no sir mr shapeshade and i hadnt what i started to ask but shapeshade guessed with relish what happens to me tomorrow when they knock my movie house down say not to worry i got protection so have my films all three hundred of them up in the booth now but soon down the beach one mile south the basement there where i go run films and laugh constance rattigan i cried ive often seen that funny light flickering in her basement window or up in her front parlor late nights was that you who else beamed shapeshade for years now when i finish here i just foxtrot along the shore with twenty pounds of film under each arm sleeps all day constance does watches films and eats popcorn with me all night thats rattigan and we sit and hold hands like two crazy kids and rob the film vaults and cry sometimes so much we cant see to rewind the spools i looked out at the beach beyond the cinema front and could not help but see mr shapeshade jogging the surf in the dark toting popcorn and mary pickford holloway suckers and tom mix on his way to that ancient queen to be her subservient lover of multifold darks and lights that sprocketed the dream screen with just as many sunrises as sunsets and then shapeshade watching just before dawn as constance rattigan so the rumors said ran naked to leap into the cold salt waves and rise with healthfood seaweeds in her straight white teeth and regally braiding her hair while shapeshade limped home in the rising sun drunk on remembrance mumming and humming the drones of the mighty wurlitzer in his marrow soul heart and happy mouth listen he leaned forward like ernest thesiger in the dim halls of the old dark house or as dr praetorius looming in bride of frankenstein inside go up behind the screen have you ever no climb up on stage in the night behind the screen what an experience like being in caligaris lopsided chambers youll thank me forever i shook his hand and stared my gosh i cried that hand of yours isnt that the paw that slid out of the dark behind the library bookshelves in the cat and the canary to grab and vanish the lawyer before he could read the will shapeshade stared down at his hand cradled in mine and beamed arent you a nice boy he said i try mr shapeshade i said i try inside i blundered down the aisle until i felt my way to the brass rail and halfflopped up the proscenium steps onto an alwaysmidnight stage to duck behind the screen and look at the great ghosts and ghosts they were the tall pale and blackeyed shadow phantoms of time twisted like white taffy from the slanted angle at which i saw them gesturing and mouthing in the silence waiting for the organ music which had not yet begun and there in swift clip after chop after clip was fairbanks with an askew face and gish waxmelting down the screen and fattie arbuckle thinned from this sideview and knocking his starved head against the top of the frame and slithering off into the dark while i stood feeling the tide move under the floor the pier the theater which foundered in swarming waters now tilting and creaking and shivering with the smell of salt coming up through the boards and more pictures white as cream dark as ink blinking across the screen as the theater lifted like a bellows and sank down exhaling like a bellows and me sunk with it just then the organ exploded it was like that moment a few hours ago when the great unseen steamliner had plunged to strike the pier the theater careened heaved up and fell as if on a rollercoastal tide the organ shouted and brayed and ricocheted a bach prelude so that dust flew off the ancient chandeliers the curtains stirred restlessly like funeral gowns and myself behind the screen reaching out to hold on to something but terrified that something might touch back above me the pale images ached and gibbered their mouths and the phantom strode down the stairs at the paris opera in his whiteskull mask and plumed hat even as shapeshade a moment before must have strode down the dark aisle to rattle and chime the brass rings holding the short curtain around the organ and seat himself like destiny and doom to spider the keys and shut his eyes and gape his mouth to let bach out afraid to look behind i stared out past the thirtyfoot phantoms at an audience unseen riveted in place shuddering with music drawn by terrible images lifted and then jolted down by the night tide under the theater deck among all those pale faces fixing their eyes upon the flickering past was he there the mourner on the train the pacer along the canal rim the leaver of threeinthemorning rains was that his face over here or that one over there colorless moons trembling in the dark a cluster of souls in front another back halfway fifty sixty people dreadful suspects on yet another fog excursion rushing to collide with nightmare and sink with no sound only the great suck of the sea going back for reinforcements among all these night travelers which was he i wondered and what could i shout to panic him up the aisles with me in wild pursuit the giant skull smiled from the screen the lovers fled to the opera roof the phantom pursued to unfurl his cape and overhear their fearful lovetalk and grin the organ shrieked the theater bucked and heaved with heavy waters celebrating sea burials should the planks gape and drop us down through my eyes raced from dimly upturned face to face and up up to the little window of the projectionists booth where a section of brow and a maniac eye peered down at the delicious dooms painted on the screen in geysers of light and dark poes raven eye or rather shrank tarot card reader psychologist phrenologist numerologist and film projectionist someone had to run the film while shapeshade clawed the organ in paroxysms of delight most nights the old man ran from ticket booth to projection room to organ bouncing off each like a manic boy disguised as rambling man but now who else for a late night menu of hunchbacks striding skeletons and hairy paws snatching moonpearls from a sleeping womans neck shrank the organ music peaked the phantom vanished a new clip from jekyll and hyde jittered across the screen i leaped down off the stage and ran up the aisle among all the fiends and murderers the poe eye in the projectionists window was gone by the time i reached the projection booth it was empty the film unspooled itself in the firefly machine jekyll on his way to becoming hyde slid down the lightbeams to strike a hairball on the screen the music stopped downstairs on the way out i found an exhausted but happy shapeshade back in the ticket booth selling seats to the fog i thrust my hands in to grab his and squeeze no bad rice for you huh what cried shapeshade complimented but not knowing why youll live forever i said what do you know that god doesnt asked shapeshade come back later one in the morning veidt in caligari two chancy in laugh clown laugh three the gorilla four the bat who could ask for more not me mr shapeshade i moved off into the mist youre not depressed he yelled after i dont think so if you got to think about it youre not full night had arrived i saw that modestis cafe had closed early or forever i didnt know which i couldnt ask questions there about william smith and celebratory haircuts and dinners the pier was dark only a single light shone in a l shranks tarot card shack window i blinked scared the damn light went out bad rice said crumley on the phone but his voice was bright hearing that it was me what kind of talk is that crumley i said swallowing hard i got another name to add to our list what list along with the canary lady thats not our list its yours shrank i said what a l shrank the venice pier psychologist tarot card reader weirdo librarian amateur numerologist fifth horseman of the apocalypse you know him kid i know everyone up down above in and under the pier every weight lifter kicking sand every dead bum on the night beach resurrected by the smell of seventyninecent muscatel comes the dawn a l shrank that measly dwarf no way dont hang up i can see it in his face hes asking for it hes next i wrote a story last year in dime detective about two trains in a station going opposite ways stopped at a siding for a minute one man looks across at another man they trade stares and the one man realizes he should never have looked across because the man on the other train is a murderer the murderer looks back and smiles thats all smiles and my hero realizes that he himself is doomed he looks away trying to save himself but the other man the killer keeps staring and when my hero looks up again the train window across the way is empty he realizes that the killer has gone to get off the train a minute later the killer appears on my heros train in his car walks down the aisle and sits in a seat right behind my hero panic huh panic great idea but it dont happen that way said crumley more often than you think a friend of mine drove a rollsroyce across country last year on the way he was almost run off the road six times through oklahoma and kansas and missouri and illinois by men who resented that expensive car if they had succeeded it would have been murder and no one the wiser thats different an expensive car is an expensive car they didnt care who was in it kill but what youre saying is there are murderers and murderees in this world the old man in the trolley waiting room was a murderee so is the canary lady its in their eyes take me it said favor me spoil me away forever shrank i finished id bet my life on it dont said crumley suddenly quieter youre a good kid but god youre wet behind the ears shrank i said now that the piers collapsing hes got to collapse too if someone doesnt kill him hell tie decline of the west and anatomy of melancholy around his neck and jump off whats left of the far end of the pier shrank as if agreeing with me a lion roared hungry for blood off in crumleys african territory just when you and i were beginning to get along so well said crumley and hung up all over venice windowshades were going up for the first time in weeks months or years it was as if the ocean town were coming awake just before going to sleep forever a windowshade right across from my apartment in a little whiteflakepainted bungalow had lifted during the day and as i entered my apartment that night i glanced over and was fascinated the eyes were staring at me not just one pair but a dozen not a dozen but a hundred or more the eyes were glass and lay in shining paths or were displayed on small pedestals the eyes were blue and brown and green and hazel and yellow i walked across my narrow street and stood looking down and in at the fabulous aggiemarble display what a game that would make in the schoolyard dirt i said just to me the eyes said nothing they rested on their stands or strewn in little clusters on a white velvet cloth fixing their gaze through and beyond me at some cold future just over my shoulder and down my spine who had made the glass eyes and who had put them in the window and who waited inside to sell them and pop them into peoples sockets i could not say whoever it was was another of venices unseen manufacturers and salesmen i had on occasion far back in the cavern reaches of this bungalow seen a piercing bluewhite flame and someones hands working at teardrops of melting glass but the old man had his face hidden behind a thick metalandglass firetorch mask all you could see far off was a new stare coming to life a blind eye being brought to focus in flame to be laid out like a bright bonbon in the window next day whether anyone ever came to buy this special jewelry that also i did not know i had never seen anyone blundering into the place or striding out with a fresher gaze the windowshade had only been raised once or twice a month during the last year looking down i thought strange eyes do you see the lost canaries and where did they go and added watch my place yes during the night stay alert the weather may change rain may come shadows may touch my doorbell much note please and long remember the shiny agatemarblemib longyearsago schoolyard companions did not so much as blink at which point a hand like a magicians slid from the shadows behind the display and pulled the lid down over the eyes it was as if the glass blower resented my staring at his stares or perhaps he feared i might sneeze out one eye and come in for a refill a customer that might spoil his perfect record ten years of blowing glass and not a single sale as a sideline i wondered does he sell bathing suits from back in my apartment i glanced out the shade had gone back up again now that i was not the inquisition standing outside the eyes were bright and waiting what i wondered will they see tonight with nothing trembles instantly i awoke what i said to the empty ceiling had lady macbeth said that with nothing trembles to be afraid of nothing for no reason and having to live with that nothing until dawn i listened was that the fog bruising my door was that the mist testing my keyhole and was that the special miniature rainstorm prowling my doormat leaving seaweed i was afraid to go look i opened my eyes i looked at the hall which led to my twobyfour kitchen and my twobytwo singers midgets bathroom i had hung an old torn white bathrobe there last night but now the robe wasnt a robe with my glasses off and lying on the floor by my cot my vision being what it was almost legally blind the robe had changed it was the beast when i was five years old living east in illinois and had to go up some dark stairs in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom the beast was always at the top of the stairs unless the small stairwell light was lit sometimes my mother would forget to turn it on i would try terribly hard to make it to the top without looking up but always i was afraid and i had to look up and the beast was always there with the sound of the dark locomotives rushing by far out in night country funeral trains taking dear cousins or uncles away and stood at the bottom of the stairs and screamed now the beast was hanging here on the edge of my door leading into darkness the hall the kitchen the bathroom beast i thought go away beast i said to the shape i know youre not there youre nothing youre my old bathrobe the trouble was i couldnt see it clearly if i could just reach my glasses i thought get them on jump up lying there i was eight and then seven and then five and then four years old getting smaller smaller and smaller as the beast on the door got bigger and darker and longer i was afraid to so much as blink afraid that that motion would make the beast float softly down to ah someone yelled because the phone across the street rang shut up i thought youll make the beast move the phone rang four in the morning four christ who peg trapped in a mexican catacomb lost the phone rang crumley with an autopsy report i would hate to hear the phone rang or a voice of cold rain and running night and raw alcohol raving in the storm and mourning terrible events as the great train shrieked on a curve the phone stopped with my eyes clenched my teeth gritted the covers over my head turned away against the sweaty pillow i thought i heard a drifting whisper i froze i kept my breath i stopped my heart for just now at that very instant hadnt i felt something touch and weigh itself on the end of my bed a l shrank was not the next victim nor did the canary lady suddenly fly around her room once and expire someone else vanished and not long after dawn the bright glass eyes across the street from my tired apartment saw the arrival of the evidence a truck pulled up outside sleepless and exhausted i heard it stirred someone knocked on my coffin door i managed to levitate and balloondrift over to crack the door and peer gumeyed into the face of a great beefy ox the face named me i assented to the name the ox told me to sign here i signed something that looked like a doa slip and watched the delivery man hoof back to his halftruck and wrestle a familiar bundled object off the back and wheel it along the walk my god i said what is it who but the big rolling bundle struck the doorjamb and gave off a musical chord i slumped knowing the answer where do you want it said the ox glancing around groucho marxs overcrowded stateroom this as good as any he heaved the wrapped object to one side against the wall looked around with contempt at my goodwill sofa my rugless floor and my typewriter and cattletrotted back out to his truck leaving the door wide over the way i saw the ten dozen bright blue brown hazel glass eyes watching even as i ripped away the covering to stare at the smile my god i cried thats the piano that i heard playing the maple leaf rag wham the truck door slammed the truck roared away i collapsed on my already collapsed sofa totally disbelieving that big vacant ivory smile crumley i said in my mind i felt the lousy haircut too high in back too short on the sides my fingers were numb yeah kid said crumley i changed my mind i thought crumley its not going to be shrank or the old bird lady who vanishes gosh said crumley who cal the barber silence a sigh then click buzz which is why gazing at this relic from scott joplin years i did not race forth to telephone my police detective friend all the glass eyes across the street examined my haircut and watched me shut my door god i thought i cant even play chopsticks the barber shop was open and empty the ants the bees the termites and the relatives had been there before noon i stood in the front door looking at the total evisceration it was as if someone had shoved a gigantic vacuum cleaner through the front door and sucked everything out the piano of course had come to me i wondered who had gotten or would want the barber chair the liniments the ointments the lotions that used to color the mirrored wall with their tints and tinctures i wondered who got all the hair there was a man in the middle of the barber shop the landlord i seemed to recall a man in his fifties moving a pushbroom over no hair just gliding over the empty tiles for no obvious reason he looked up and saw me cals gone he said so i see i said bastard ran off owing me four months rent business was that bad was it it wasnt the business so much as the haircuts even for two bucks they were the lousiest won awards in the whole state i felt the top of my head and the nape of my neck and nodded bastard ran off owing me five months rent i heard from the groceryman next door cal was here at seven this morning goodwill came at eight for the barber chair salvation army got all the rest who knows who got the piano id like to find and sell that get some of my money the landlord looked at me i said nothing the piano was the piano for whatever reasons cal had sent it to me where you think hes gone i said got relatives in oklahoma kansas missouri i hear someone was just in said he heard cal say two days ago he was going to drive until the land gave out and then pitch right into the atlantic cal wouldnt do that no he more likely will sink somewhere in the cherokee strip country and good riddance jesus that was bad haircutting i wandered in over the clean white tiles through nohair territory not knowing what i was looking for who are you said the landlord halfraising his broom into artillery position the writer i said you know me the crazy hell i didnt recognize you did cal do that to you he stared at my hairline i felt blood rush along my scalp only yesterday i said he could be shot for that i wandered across and around behind a thin wooden partition that hid the backside of the barber shop the trash barrels and the restroom i stared down into the trash barrel and saw what i was looking for there the photograph of cal and scott joplin covered with a months supply of hair which was not much i reached down and picked up the photo in the next five or six seconds my whole body turned to ice because scott joplin was gone cal was still there forever young smiling his thin fingers spidering the piano keys but the man who stood over him grinning it wasnt joplin it was another man black younger more sinful looking i peered very close there were marks of old dry glue where scotts head had once been jesus god have mercy on cal i thought none of us ever thought to look close and of course the picture was always under glass and hung rather high on the wall not easy to reach or take down sometime a long while ago cal had found a picture of scott joplin razor cut around it and pasted it over this other guys face head on head he must have forged the signature as well and all these years we had looked at it and sighed and clucked and said hey cal great arent you special looky there and all those years cal had looked at it and known what a fraud it was and he was and cut hair so you looked as if youd been blown dry by a kansas twister and combed by a maniac wheat harvester run amok i turned the photograph over and reached down into the barrel trying to find scott joplins decapitated and missing part i knew i would not find it someone had taken it and whoever had peeled it off the photo had telephoned and sent a message to cal you are known you are naked you are revealed i remembered cals phone ringing and cal afraid refusing to answer and coming into his barber shop what two days three days ago casually checking the photograph cal had been kicked in the gut with joplins head gone cal was gone all he could do was goodwill the barber chair salvation army the tonics piano me his piano i stopped searching i folded the photograph of cal without joplin and went out to watch the landlord broom the hairless tiles cal i said the landlord paused his broom cal didnt i said i mean cal wouldnt i mean cals still alive crud said the landlord alive about four hundred miles east of here by now still owing seven months rent thank god i thought i wont have to tell crumley about this one not now anyway going away isnt murder or being murdered no going east isnt cal a dead man driving a car i went out the door boy said the landlord you look bad coming and going not as bad as some people i thought where do i go now i wondered now that the smile is there filling up my bedsittingroom and me only able to play an underwood standard the gas station telephone rang at twothirty that afternoon exhausted by no sleep the night before i had gone back to bed i lay listening the phone wouldnt stop it rang for two minutes and then three the more it rang the colder i got by the time i lunged out of bed and floundered into my bathing trunks and trudged across the street i was shuddering like someone in a snowstorm when i lifted the receiver i could feel crumley a long way off at the far end and without his speaking i could guess his news its happened hasnt it i said how did you know crumley sounded as if he had been up all night too what made you go by there i asked while i was shaving an hour ago i had a hunch jesus like the ones you talk about im still here waiting for the coroner you coming by to say i told you so no but ill be there i hung up back in my apartment nothing still hung on the hall door leading to the bathroom i yanked it off the door hurled it to the floor and stepped on it it seemed only right since it had gone off during the night to visit the canary lady and come back without telling me just before dawn christ i thought standing numbly on the bathrobe all the cages are empty now crumley stood on one side of the lower nile the dry riverbed i stood on the other one police car and the morgue van were waiting downstairs youre not going to like this said crumley he paused waiting for me to nod him to pull back the sheet i said did you call me in the middle of the night crumley shook his head how long has she been dead we figure about eleven hours i ran my thoughts back four in the morning when the phone had rung across the street in the night when nothing had called to tell me something if i had run to answer a cold wind would have blown out of the receiver to tell me this i nodded crumley pulled back the sheet the canariesforsale lady was there and not there part of her had fled in the dark what was left was terrible to see her eyes were fixed on some dreadful nothing the thing on the top of my hall door the invisible weight at the end of my bed the mouth that had once whispered open saying come up come in welcome was now gaped in shock in protest it wanted something to go away get out not stay holding the sheet in his fingers crumley glanced at me i guess i owe you an apology for what it was hard to talk for she was staring up between us at some terror on the ceiling for guessing right that was you for doubting that was me it wasnt hard to guess thats my brother dead thats my grandfather and my aunts dead and my mother and father all deaths are the same arent they yeah crumley let the sheet drift down a snowfall over the nile valley on an autumn day but this is just a simple death kid not a murder that look on her face you can find on all kinds of people when they feel their heart coming out of their chest with an attack i wanted to shout arguments i bit my tongue something seen from the corner of my eye made me turn away and move over to the empty birdcages it took a few moments for me to see what i was looking at jesus i whispered hirohito addis ababa theyre gone i turned to stare at crumley and point someones taken the old newspaper headlines out of the cages whoever came up here not only scared her to death but took the papers my god hes a souvenir collector i bet hes got a pocketful of train ticket punchout confetti and scott joplins peeledoff head too scott joplins what he didnt want to but at last crumley came to look at the bottoms of the cages find those newspapers and youll find him i said easy as pie crumley sighed he led me down past the turnedtothewall mirrors that had not seen anyone come up during the night and did not see him go in the downstairs stairwell area was the dusty window with the sign in it for no reason i could figure i reached out and pulled the sign away from its flaking scotchtaped frame crumley was watching me can i have this i asked itll hurt you every time you look at it said crumley oh hell keep it i folded it and tucked it in my pocket upstairs the birdcages sang no songs the coroner stepped in full of midafternoon beer and whistling it had begun to rain it rained all across venice as crumleys car drove us away from her house away from my house away from phones that rang at the wrong hours away from the gray sea and the empty shore and the remembrance of drowned swimmers the car windshield was like a great eye weeping and drying itself weeping again as the wiper shuttled and stopped shuttled and stopped and squeaked to shuttle again i stared straight ahead inside his jungle bungalow crumley looked in my face guessed at a brandy instead of a beer gave me that and nodded at the telephone in his bedroom you got any money to call mexico city i shook my head now you have said crumley call talk to your girl shut the door and talk i grabbed his hand and almost broke every bone in it gasping then i called mexico peg who is this its me me my god you sound so strange so far away i am far away youre alive thank god sure i had this terrible feeling last night i couldnt sleep what time peg what time four oclock why jesus why nothing i couldnt sleep either hows mexico city full of death god i thought it was all here what nothing lord its good to hear your voice say something i said something say it again why are you shouting peg i dont know yes i

poverty sure i will ill be home in ten days and take both vows ten days ten years why do women always have to ask men for their hands because were cowards and more afraid than you ill protect you some conversation this i thought of the door last night and the thing hanging on the door and the thing on the end of my bed youd better hurry do you remember my face she said suddenly what you do remember it dont you because god just an hour ago this terrible horrible thing happened i couldnt remember yours or the color of your eyes and i realized what a dumb fool i was not to bring your picture along and it was all gone that scares me to think i could forget youll never forget me will you i didnt tell her i had forgotten the color of her eyes just the day before and how that had shaken me for an hour and that it was a kind of death but me not being able to figure who had died first peg or me does my voice help yes am i there with you do you see my eyes yes for gods sake first thing you do when you hang up mail me a picture i dont want to be afraid any more all i have is a lousy twentyfivecent photo machine picture i send it i should never have come down here and left you alone up there

married fine youll just have to get used to my working while you finish the great american epic and to hell with it shut up someday later on you support me are you ordering me around sure because i hate to hang up and i just want this to go on all day and i know its costing you a mint say some more the things i want to hear i said some more and she was gone the telephone line humming and me left with a piece of wire cable two thousand miles long and a billion shadow whispers lingering there heading toward me i cut them off before they could reach my ear and slide inside my head i opened the door and stepped out to find crumley waiting by the icebox reaching in for sustenance you look surprised he laughed forget you were in my house you were so busy yakking forgot i said and took anything he handed me out of the fridge my nose running my cold making me miserable grab some kleenex kid said crumley take the whole box and while youre at it he added give me the rest of your list our list i said he narrowed his eyes wiped his balding head with a nervous hand and nodded those who will die next in order of execution he shut his eyes heavily burdened our list he said i did not immediately tell him about cal and while youre at it crumley sipped another beer write down the name of the murderer it would have to be someone who knows everyone in venice california i said that could be me said crumley dont say that why because i said it scares me i made the list i made two lists and then suddenly discovered myself making three the first list was short and full of possible murderers none of which i believed the second was choose your victim and went on at some length on who would vanish in short order and in the middle of it i realized it had been some while since i trapped all the wandering people of venice so i did a page on cal the barber before he fled out of my mind and another on shrank running down the street and another on all those people on the rollercoaster with me plummeting into hell and yet another on the big night steamboat theater crossing the styx to ram the isle of the dead and sink mr shapeshade i did a final sermon on miss birdsong and a page about the glass eyes and took all these pages and put them in my talking box that was the box i kept by my typewriter where my ideas lay and spoke to me early mornings to tell me where they wanted to go and what they wanted to do i lay halfasleep listening and then got up and went to help them with my typewriter to go where they most needed to go to do some special wild thing so my stories got written sometimes it was a dog that needed to dig a graveyard sometimes it was a time machine that had to go backward sometimes it was a man with green wings who had to fly at night lest he be seen sometimes it was me missing peg in my tombstone bed i took one of the lists back to crumley how come you didnt use my typewriter said crumley yours isnt used to me yet and would only get in the way mine is way ahead of me and i run to catch up read that crumley read my list of possible victims christ he murmured you got half the venice chamber of commerce the lions club the flea circus and the pier carnival owners of america on here he folded it and put it in his pocket why dont you throw in some friends from where you once lived in downtown la an icefrog jumped in my chest i thought of the tenement and the dark halls and nice mrs gutierrez and lovely fannie the frog jumped again dont say that i said wheres the other list of murderers you got the chamber of commerce on that too i shook my head afraid to show it to me because im in the lineup with the rest of them asked crumley i took that list out of my pocket glanced at it and tore it up wheres your wastebasket i said even as i had been talking the fog had arrived across the street from crumleys it hesitated as if searching for me and then to verify my paranoid suspicions sneaked across and blanketed his garden dousing the christmas lights in his oranges and lemons and drowning the flowers so they shut their mouths how dare it come here i said everything does said crumley que is this the crazy si mrs gutierrez do i call the office si mrs gutierrez fannie is calling outside on her porch i hear her mrs gutierrez far away in the sun inland where there was no fog or mist or rain and no surf to bring strange visitors in was the tenement and fannies soprano calling like the sirens tell him i heard her sing i have a new recording of mozarts the magic flute she says her voice carries mrs gutierrez tell her thank god thats a happy one she wants you to come see she misses you and hopes you forgive her she says for what i tried to remember she says fannies voice floated on the warm clear air tell him to come but dont bring anyone with that knocked the air out of me the ghosts of old ice creams rose in my blood when had i ever done that i wondered who did she think i might bring along uninvited and then i remembered the bathrobe hanging on the door late nights leave it there canaries for sale dont fetch the empty cages the lion cage dont roll it through the streets lon chancy dont peel him off the silver screen and hide him in your pocket dont my god fannie i thought is the fog rolling inland toward you will the mist reach your tenement will the rain touch on your door i shouted so loudly over the phone fannie could have heard it downstairs tell her mrs gutierrez i come alone alone but tell her only maybe i come i have no money not even for train fare maybe i come tomorrow fannie say if you come she give you money swell but meantime my pockets empty just then i saw the postman cross the street and stick an envelope in my mailbox hold on i yelled and ran the letter was from new york with a check for thirty dollars in it for a story i had just sold to bizarre tales about a man who feared the wind that had followed him around the world from the himalayas and now shook his house late at night hungry for his soul i ran back to the telephone and shouted if i make it to the bank tonight i will come fannie got the translation and sang three notes from the bell song from lakme before her translator hung up i ran for the bank graveyard fog i thought dont get on the train ahead of me headed for fannie if the pier was a great titanic on its way to meet an iceberg in the night with people busy rearranging the deck chairs and someone singing nearer my god to thee as he rammed the plunger on the tnt detonator then the tenement at the corner of temple and figueroa was still afloat down the middle of the barrio with curtains people and underwear hanging out of most windows laundry being churned to death in backporch machines and the smell of tacos and delicatessen corned beef in the halls all to itself it was a small ellis island adrift with people from some sixteen countries on saturday nights there were enchilada festivals on the top floor and conga lines dancing through the halls but most of the week the doors were shut and people turned in early because they all worked downtown in the dress lofts or the dime stores or in what was left of the defense industry in the valley or in olvera street selling junk jewelry nobody was in charge of the tenement the landlady mrs obrien came to visit as rarely as possible fearful of purse snatchers terrified for her seventytwoyearold virtue if anyone was in charge of the tenement it was fannie florianna who from her secondfloor opera balcony could singsong orders so sweetly that even the boys in the poolhall across the street stopped preening like pigeons and roosters and came cues in hand to wave up and cry ole there were three chinese on the first floor along with the usual chicanos and on the second floor one japanese gentleman and six young men from mexico city who owned one white ice cream suit each got to wear it one night a week there were also some portuguese men a night watchman from haiti two salesmen from the philippines and more chicanos mrs gutierrez with the only phone in the tenement was there yes on the third floor the second was mostly fannie and her pounds along with two old maid sisters from spain a jewelry salesman from egypt and two ladies from monterey who it was rumored sold their favors at no great price to any lost and lustful pool player who happened to stumble upstairs uncaring late friday nights every rat to his warren as fannie said i was glad to stand outside the tenement at dusk glad to hear all the live radios playing from all the windows glad to smell all the cooking smells and hear the laughter glad to go in and meet all the people some peoples lives can be summed so swiftly its no more than a door slammed or someone coughing out on a dark street late at night you glance from the window the streets empty whoever coughed is gone there are some people who live to be thirtyfive or forty but because no one ever notices their lives are candlebrief invisiblesmall in and around the tenement were various such invisible or halfvisible people who lived but did not exactly live in the tenement there was sam and there was jimmy and there was pietro massinello and there was the very special blind man henry as dark as the halls he wandered through with his negro pride all or most of them would vanish in a few days and each in a different way since their vanishing occurred with such regularity and variety no one took notice even i almost missed the significance of their last farewells sam sam was a wetback wandered up from mexico to wash dishes beg quarters buy cheap wine and lie doggo for days then up like the nightprowling dead to wash more dishes cadge more quarters and sink into vino toted in a brownbag valise his spanish was bad and his english worse because it was always filtered through muscatel nobody knew what he said nobody cared he slept in the basement out of harms way so much for sam jimmy you couldnt understand either not as a result of wine but because someone had stolen his bite his teeth delivered gratis by the citys health department had vanished one night when he was careless enough to dime himself into a main street flophouse the teeth had been stolen from a water glass by his pillow when he woke his great white grin was gone forever jimmy gapemouthed but convivial on gin came back to the tenement pointing at his pink gums and laughing and what with the loss of his dentures and his immigrant czech accent he was like sam unintelligible he slept in empty tenement bathtubs at three in the morning and did odd jobs around the place each day laughing a lot at nothing in particular so much for jimmy pietro massinello was a circus of one allowed like the others to move his feast of dogs cats geese and parakeets from the roof where they lived in summer to a basement lumber room in december where they survived in a medley of barks cackles riots and slumbers through the years you could see him running along los angeles streets with his herd of adoring beasts in his wake the dogs frisking a bird on each shoulder a duck pursuing as he toted a portable windup phonograph which he set down at street corners to play tales from the vienna woods and dance his dogs for whatever people threw him he was a tiny man with bells on his hat black mascara around his wide innocent mad eyes and chimes sewn on his cuffs and lapels he did not speak to people he sang the sign outside his leanto basement lumber room read manger and love filled the place the love of beautifully treated and petted and spoiled animals for their incredible master so much for pietro massinello henry the blind colored man was even more special special because he not only spoke clean and clear but walked without canes through our lives and survived when the others had gone without trumpets off in the night he was waiting for me when i came in the downstairs entrance to the tenement he was waiting for me in the dark hid back against the wall his face so black it was unseen it was his eyes blind but white rimmed which startled me i jumped and gasped henry is that you scare you did i henry smiled then remembered why he was there i been waiting on you he said lowering his voice looking around as if he could actually see the shadows something wrong henry yes no i dont know things is changing the old place aint the same people is nervous even me i saw his right hand fumble down in the dark to touch and twitch a peppermintstriped cane i had never seen him carry a cane before my eye ran down to the tip which was rounded with what looked to be a good weight of lead it was not a blind mans guide it was a weapon henry i whispered and we stood for a moment while i looked him over and saw what had always been there blind henry he had everything memorized in his pride he had counted and could recall every pace in this block and the next and the next and how many steps across at this intersection or that and he could name the streets he strode past with sovereign certainty by the butcher or shoeshine or drugstore or poolhall smokes and smells and even when the shops were shut he would see the kosher pickle scents or the boxed tobaccos or the lockedaway african ivory aromas of the billiard balls in their nests or the aphrodisiac whiff from the gas station when some tank flooded and henry walking staring straight ahead no dark glasses no cane his mouth counting the beats to turn in at als beer and walk steadily and unswervingly through the crowded tables toward an empty piano stool there to sit and reach up for the beer that was automatically popped in place by al before his arrival to play exactly three tunes including the maple leaf sadly better than cal the barber drink the one beer and stride out into a night he owned with his paces and counts heading home calling out to unseen voices naming names proud of his shuttered genius only his nose steering the way and his legs firm and muscled from ten miles of strides per day if you tried to help him across the street which i made the mistake of doing once he yanked his elbow away and stared at you so angrily that your face burned dont touch he whispered dont confuse you put me off now where was i he threw some abacus beads in his dark head he counted cornrows on his skull yeah now thirtyfive across thirtyseven over and on he went alone leaving you on the curb his own parade thirtyfive steps across temple this way and thirtyseven the other across figueroa an invisible cane tapped cadence for him he marched by god he truly marched and it was henry with no last name henry the blind who heard the wind and knew the cracks in the sidewalk and snuffed the dust of the night tenement who gave the first warnings of things waiting on the stairs or too much midnight leaning heavy on the roof or a wrong perspiration in the halls and here he was now flattened back against the cracked plaster of the tenement entryway with full night outside and in the halls his eyes wobbled and shut his nostrils flared he seemed to bend a bit at the knees as if someone had struck him on the head his cane twitched in his dark fingers he listened listened so hard that i turned to stare down the long cavernous hall to the far end of the tenement where the back door stood wide and more night waited whats wrong henry i said again promise you wont tell florianna fannie takes on fits you tell her too much wrong stuff promise i wont give her fits henry where you been last few days i had my own troubles henry and i was broke i could have hitchhiked in but well lots goes on in just fortyeight hours pietro him and his dogs and birds and geese you know his cats what about pietro someone turned him in called the police nuisance they said police come take all his pets away take him away he was able to give some of them to folks i got his cat up in my room mrs gutierrez got a new dog when they led him out pietro he was crying i never heard a man cry so hard before it was terrible who turned him in henry i was upset myself i saw the dogs adoring pietro i saw the cats and the geese that lovingly followed and the canaries on his bellchiming hat and him dancing on street corners through half of my life who turned him in trouble is no one knows cops just come and said here and all the pets gone forever and pietro in jail a nuisance or maybe he kicked up a fuss out front there hit somebody striking a cop nobody knows but somebody did that aint all what else i said leaning against the wall sam what about him hes in the hospital booze someone gave him two quarts of the hard stuff damn fool drank it all what they call it acute alcoholism if he lives tomorrow its gods will no one knows who gave him the booze then theres jimmy thats the worst god i whispered let me sit down i sat on the edge of the steps leading up to the second floor no news or what killed the dog huh an old seventyeight rpm record when i was a kid no news or what killed the dog dog ate burned horseflakes from the burneddown barn how did the barn burn down sparks from the house blew over and burned down the barn sparks from the house from inside the house the candles around the coffin candles around the coffin someones uncle died on and on it all ends with the dog in the barn eating the burned horseflakes and dying or no news or what killed the dog your stories are getting to me henry sorry sorry is right jimmy now you know how he sleeps from floor to floor nights and once a week he just up and strips down and takes a bath in the thirdfloor tub or the firstfloor washroom sure well last night he got in the full tub drunk turned over and drowned drowned drowned aint that silly aint that a terrible thing to put on your obittombstone save he wont have a tombstone potters field found in a bathtub of dirty water turned over so drunk he slept himself into the grave and him with new false teeth just this week and the teeth gone how you figure that when they found him in the tub drowned oh my christ i said stifling a laugh and a sob in one yes name christ god help us all henrys voice trembled now you see what i dont want you to tell fannie well let her know one at a time spread it out over weeks pietro massinello in jail his dogs lost forever his cats driven away his geese cooked sam in the hospital jimmy drowned and me looky this handkerchief all wet from my eyes balled in my fist i dont feel so good nobodys feeling very good right now now henry put his hand out unerringly toward my voice and took hold of my shoulder gently go on up and be cheerful with fannie i tapped on fannies door thank god i heard her cry a steamboat came upriver flung wide the door and churned back downstream over the linoleum when fannie had crashed into her chair she looked into my face and asked whats wrong wrong oh i turned to blink at the doorknob in my hand do you leave your door unlocked all the time why not who would want to come in and storm the bastille but she did not laugh she was watchful like henry she had a powerful nose and i was perspiring i shut the door and sank into a chair who died said fannie what do you mean who died i stammered you look like you just came back from a chinese funeral and were hungry all over again she tried to smile and blinkyblink her eyes oh i thought quickly henry just scared me in the hall is all you know henry you come along a hall and cant see him for the night youre a terrible liar said fannie where have you been i am exhausted waiting for you to come visit are you ever tired just worn out with waiting ive waited dear young man fearful for you have you been sad very sad fannie there i knew it it was that dreadful old man in the lion cage wasnt it how dare he make you sad he couldnt help it fannie i sighed i imagine he would much rather have been down at the pacific electric ticket office counting the punchconfetti on his vest well fannie will cheer you up would you put the needle on the record there my dear yes thats it mozart to dance and sing to we must invite pietro massinello up mustnt we some day soon the magic flute is just his cup of tea and let him bring his pets yes fannie i said i put the needle on a record which hissed with promise poor boy said fannie you do look sad there was a faint scratching on the door thats henry said fannie he never knocks i went to the door but before i could open it henrys voice behind it said only me i opened the door and henry sniffed spearmint gum thats how i know you you ever chew anything else not even tobacco your cabs here said henry my what since when can you afford a taxi asked fannie her cheeks pink her eyes bright we had had a glorious two hours with mozart and the very air was luminous around the big lady so yeah since when can i afford i said but stopped for henry outside the door was shaking his head once no his finger went to his lips with caution its your friend he said taxi driver knows you from venice okay okay i said frowning if you say so oh and here this is for fannie pietro said give it over hes so crammed full downstairs no room for this he handed over a plump purring calico cat i took and carried the sweet burden back to fannie who began to purr herself when she held the beast oh my dear she cried happy with mozart and calico what a dream cat what a dream henry nodded to her nodded to me and went away down the hall i went to give fannie a big hug listen oh listen to his motor she cried holding the pillow cat up for a kiss lock your door fannie i said what she said what coming back downstairs i found henry still waiting in the dark halfhidden against the wall henry for gods sake whatre you doing listening he said for what this house this place shh careful now his cane came up and pointed like an antenna along the hall there you hear far away a wind stirred far away a breeze wandered the dark the beams settled someone breathed a door creaked i dont hear anything thats cause you trying dont try just be just listen now i listened and my spine chilled someone in this house whispered henry dont belong here i got this sense im no fool someone up there wandering around up to no good cant be henry is he whispered a blind man tells you stranger underfoot henry has the word you dont hear me you fall downstairs or drown in a bathtub i thought but what i said was you going to stay here all night someones got to stand guard a blind man i thought he read my mind he nodded old henry sure now run along its a big fancysmelling duesenberg out front no taxi i lied who would be picking you up this late know anyone with a fancy car no one get on out ill mind fannie for us but wholl mind jimmy now not even jim not even sam i started out from one night into another oh one last thing i paused henry said what was the bad news you brought tonight and didnt tell not to me not to fannie i gasped how did you know i thought of the old woman sinking in the riverbed silent in her sheets out of sight i thought of cal the piano lid slammed on his maple leaf hands even though explained henry with good reason you chew spearmint gum your breath was sour tonight young sir which means youre not digesting your food proper which means a bad day for writers come inland with no roots it was a bad day for everyone henry im still huffing and puffing henry stood tall and shook his cane at the darkening halls where the lightbulbs were burning out and the souls were guttering low watchdog henry you now git i went out the door toward something that not only smelled but looked like a duesenberg it was constance rattigans limousine it was as long and bright and beautiful as a fifth avenue shop window somehow arrived on the wrong side of la the back door of the limo was open the chauffeur was in the front seat hat crammed down over his eyes staring straight ahead he didnt look at me i tried to get his attention but the limousine was waiting its motor humming and i was wasting time i had never been in such a vehicle in my life it might be my one and only chance i leaped in no sooner had i hit the back seat than the limousine swerved in one boaconstrictor glide away from the curb the back door slammed shut on me and we were up to sixty by the time we reached the end of the block tearing up temple hill we made something like seventyfive we managed to make all of the green lights to vermont where we wheeled over to wilshire and took it out as far as westwood for no special reason maybe because it was scenic i sat in the back seat like robert armstrong on king kongs lap crowing and babbling to myself knowing where i was going but wondering why i deserved all this then i remembered the nights when i had come up to call on fannie and met this very same smell of chanel and leather and paris nights in the air outside her door constance rattigan had been there only a few minutes before we had missed colliding by one or two hairs of mink and an exhalation of grand marnier as we prepared to turn at westwood we passed a cemetery which was so placed that if you werent careful you drove into a parking lot or was it that some days looking for a parking lot you mistakenly motored between tombstones a confusion before i could give it great mind the cemetery and the parking lot were left behind and we were halfway to the sea at venice and windward we wheeled south along the shore we passed like a slight rainfall that quiet and swift not far from my small apartment i saw my typewriter window lit with a faint light i wonder if i am in there dreaming this i thought and we left behind my deserted office telephone booth with peg two thousand miles away at the end of the silent line peg i thought if you could see me now we swerved in behind the big bonewhite moorish fort at exactly midnight and the limousine stopped as easily as a wave sinks in sand and the limo door banged and the chauffeur still quiet after the long silent glide streaked into the backside of the fort and did not appear again i waited a full minute for something to happen when it did not i slid out of the back of the limousine like a shoplifter guilty for no reason and wondering whether to escape i saw a dark figure upstairs in the house lights went on as the chauffeur moved about the moorish fort on the venice sands i stayed quietly anyway i looked at my watch as the minute hand counted off the last second of the last minute the front portico lights went on i walked up to the open front door and stepped into an empty house at a distance down a hall i saw a small figure darting about the kitchen making drinks a small girl in a maids outfit she waved at me and ran i walked into a living room filled with a menagerie of pillows of every size from pomeranian to great dane i sat on the biggest one and sank down even as my soul kept sinking in me the maid ran in put down two drinks on a tray and ran out before i could see her over her shoulder she threw away drink in what was or was not a french accent it was a cool white wine and a good one and i needed it my cold was worse i was sneezing and honking and sneezing all the time in the year they excavated an old tomb or what they thought to be a tomb on the shoreline of california where it was rumored queens and kings once ruled then went away with the tides along the flats some were buried with their chariots it was said some with relics of their arrogance and magnificence some left behind only images of themselves in strange canisters which held to the light and spun on a shuttle talked in tongues and tossed blackandwhite shadowshows on empty tapestry screens one of the tombs found and opened was the tomb of a queen and in that vault was not a speck of dust nor furniture just pillows in midfloor and all around row on row rising to the ceiling and stack on stack reaching to touch that ceiling canisters labeled with the lives that the queen had lived and none of these lives were true but they seemed true they were tinned and prisoned dreams they were containers from which djinns screamed forth or into which princesses fled to hide for eternity from the reality that killed and the address of the tomb was speedway ocean front venice california in a lost year under sand and water and the name of the queen with her film in cans from floor to roof was rattigan and i was there now waiting and thinking i hope shes not like the canary lady i hope shes not a mummy with dust in her eyes i stopped hoping the second egyptian queen had arrived and not with a grand entrance at all and she wasnt wearing a silver lame evening gown or even a smart dress and scarf or tailored slacks i felt her in the door across the room before she spoke and what was she a woman about five feet tall in a black bathing suit incredibly suntanned all over her body and with a face dark as nutmeg and cinnamon her hair was cropped and a kind of blonde gray brown and tousled as if what the hell she had given it a try with a comb and let it go the body was neat and firm and quick and the tendons of her legs had not been cut she ran quickly barefoot across the floor and stood looking down at me with flashing eyes you a good swimmer not bad how many laps of my pool could you do she nodded to the great emerald lake outside the french doors twenty i can go fortyfive any man i know has got to do forty before he goes to bed with me i just flunked the test i said constance rattigan she grabbed my hand and pumped it i know i said she stood back and eyed me up and down so youre the one who chews spearmint and likes tosca she said you been talking to both henry the blind man and florianna right wait here if i dont have my night dip ill go to sleep on you before i could speak she plunged out the french doors skirted the pool and headed for the ocean she vanished into the first wave and swam out of sight i had a feeling she wouldnt want wine when she came back i wandered out to the kitchen which was dutch cream white sky blue and found a percolator in full perk and the smell of coffee brewing for the start of a new day i checked my cheap watch almost one in the morning i poured coffee for two and took it out to wait for her on the veranda overlooking the incredibly greenyblue swimming pool yes was her answer as she ran to shake herself like a dog on the tiles she grabbed the coffee and should have burned her mouth drinking it between gasps she said this starts my day what time do you go to bed sunrise sometimes like the vampires noons not for me how do you get such a tan sunlamp in the basement why are you staring because i said youre so different from the way i thought you would be i imagined someone like norma desmond in that movie that just came out you see it hell i lived it half of the films me the rest bilge that dimwit norma wants a new career all i want most days is to hole up and not come out ive had it with hishandonmyknee producers and mattressspring directors timid writers and cowardly scripts no offense you a writer i damn well am you got spunk kid stay away from films theyll screw you where was i oh yeah i gave most of my fancy gowns to hollywood volunteer sales years ago i go to maybe one premiere a year disguised as someone else once every eight weeks if its some old chum i have lunch at sardis or the derby then hole in again fannie i see about once a month usually around this time shes a nightowl like yours truly she finished her coffee and toweled herself off with a huge soft yellow towel that went well with her dark tan she draped it over her shoulders and gave me another stare i had time to study this woman who was and wasnt constance rattigan the great empress from my childhood on screen twenty feet of gliding villainous mantrapping woman dark haired ravishing in her slenderness here a sunblasted desert mouse quick nimble ageless all cinnamon and nutmeg and honey as we stood in the night wind out in front of her mosque by her mediterranean pool i looked at that house and thought no radios no television no newspapers she was quick with her telepathy right only the projector and the films in the parlor time only works well in one direction back i control the past ill be damned if i know what to do with the present and to hell with the future im not going to be there dont want to go there and would hate you if you made me its a perfect life i looked at all the lit windows of her house and all the rooms behind the windows and then over at the abandoned limousine to one side of the mosque this made her nervous enough that suddenly she was gone and came running back with the white wine she poured it and muttered what the hell drink this ill quite suddenly as she handed me my glass of wine i began to laugh laugh hell i exploded i guffawed whats the joke she asked halftaking the wine back whats funny you i roared and the chauffeur and the maid the maid the chauffeur and you i pointed at the kitchen out at the limousine and back at her she knew she was trapped and joined my hilarity throwing her head back and giving a delicious yell jesus christ kid you caught on but i thought i was good you are i cried youre terrific but when you handed me my drink there was something in your wrist motion i saw the chauffeurs hands on the steering wheel i saw the maids fingers on the serving tray constance i mean miss rattigan constance you could have carried the masquerade on for days i said it was just the smallest thing about your hands and wrists she ran out of the room scampered back frisky as a lap dog wearing the chauffeurs cap took it off put on the maids cheeks pink eyes flashing you want to pinch the chauffeurs bum or the maids all three of you have terrific bums she refilled my glass tossed the two caps aside and said its the only fun i have no jobs in years so i make my own jobs drive around town nights incognito shop evenings as the maid ditto i also run the projection equipment here in the parlor and wash the limo im not a bad courtesan either if you like courtesans i used to make fifty bucks a night much moola in when a buck was a buck and two bits bought dinner we stopped laughing as we went back inside and sank into the pillows why all the mystery why those late nights i asked do you ever go out by day only to funerals you see constance sipped her coffee and lay back among the pillows which resembled a kennel of dogs i dont much like people i started turning cranky young i guess i have too many producers fingerprints on my skin anyway its not bad playing house alone what am i doing here i asked youre fannies friend one and two you look like a good kid bright but brainless i mean innocent those big blue eyes full of naivete life hasnt got to you yet i hope it never does you look safe to me and rather nice and fun no phys ed though as they say no phys ed which means im not going to tackle you into the bedroom your virginity is safe im no virgin no but you sure as hell look it i blushed furiously you still havent said why am i here constance rattigan put her coffee cup down and leaned forward to stare straight into my face fannie she said is frightened terrified spooked are you i wonder the one responsible for a little while i had forgotten the drive to the beach had blown the darkness out of my head being in this house standing by the pool watching this woman dive in the sea and return feeling the night wind on my face and the wine in my mouth had made the last fortyeight hours vanish i suddenly realized i hadnt laughed really hard in a good many weeks this strange ladys laughter had aged me back to where i should have been twentyseven years old not ninety the way i had felt getting up this morning are you the one responsible for scaring fannie she repeated and stopped my god said constance rattigan you look as if i had just run over your pet dog she grabbed my hand and squeezed did i just kick you in the kishkas kish meatballs sorry she let go of me i didnt fall off the cliff so she said its just im protective as hell about fannie i dont think you know how often ive been down to that ratty tenement to visit i never saw you there sure you did but didnt know one night a year ago cinco de mayo there was a mariachi mexican spanish pachuco conga lineup through the halls and down through the tenement gassed on wine and enchiladas i headed the conga line dolled up as rio rita nobody knew who i was which is the only way to have a good time you were at the far end of the line out of step we never met after an hour i had a small chat with fannie and vamoosed most of the time i arrive there at two in the morning because fannie and i go back to chicago opera and art institute days when i was painting and in the opera chorus free and fannie sang a few leads we knew caruso and were both skinny as rails can you believe that fannie skinny but what a voice god we were young well you know the rest i came a long way with mattress marks on my back when the marks got too numerous i retired to pump money here in my backyard she indicated at least four oilrig machineries heaving and sighing out back of the kitchen wonderful pets for a good life fannie she had a lousy love affair which cracked her permanently in half and blew her up to the size you see now no man not me not life could coax her back to beauty we all just gave up on that and stayed friends a good friend from the sound of your voice well it works both ways shes a talented dear eccentric lost lady i chihuahuacaper to her mammoth gavotte lots of good honest laughs at the fouroclockinthemorning world we dont kid each other about the facts of life we know well never come back out into it she for her reasons me for mine she saw one man too close i saw too many quickly retirement takes many forms as you can see by my disguises as you can see by fannies montgolfier balloon shape the way you talk about men i mean youre talking to a real live one here now i said youre not one of them i can tell you couldnt rape a chorus line or use your agents desk for a bed you couldnt knock your grandma downstairs to cadge the insurance maybe youre a sap i dont know or a fool but ive come to prefer saps and fools guys who dont raise tarantulas or yank wings off hummingbirds silly writers who dream about going to mars and never coming back to our stupid daytime world she stopped hearing herself christ i talk a lot lets get back to fannie she doesnt scare often been living in that old firetrap for twenty years now door open to one and all and the mayonnaise jar in hand but now somethings wrong she jumps when fleas sneeze so last night all we did was play opera and try to joke she didnt say maybe she didnt want to bother the martian thats one of the things she calls you right i know by the way her skin shakes you know horses at all ever see the skin on a horse twitch and jerk when flies land on it invisible flies are landing on fannie all the time now and she just firms her mouth and shakes her flesh seems her astrology chart is out of whack her hourglass is malfunctioning someone has put funeralurn ashes in it instead of sand there are odd whispers in her icebox door the ice falls inside the fridge at midnight and sounds like the wrong kind of laughter the toilet across the hall gargles all night the termites under her chair are going to gnaw through and drop her to hell the spiders in the wall are mending her shroud hows that for a list all intuition no facts would get thrown out of court fast you understand with nothing trembles i thought that but didnt say it instead i said you talked to henry about this henry thinks hes the worlds greatest blind man that dont catsup any beans for me he hints somethings up but he wont say can you help then i can write fannie or call her through the gutierrez lady or drop by tomorrow night and tell her everythings jake can do can i have some more wine please she poured never taking her eyes off me okay she said start lying something is going on but its too early to tell by the time you tell it may be too late constance rattigan jumped up and paced around the room turning at last to rifleshot me with a stare why wont you talk when you know fannies scared gutless because im tired of being afraid of every shadow myself because ive been a coward all of my life and im sick of me when i know more ill call you jesus constance rattigan snorted a laugh you got a loud voice ill move back and give you air i know you love fannie you think she should come live with me here for a few days a week to protect her i looked around at the grand pillows the bright elephant herd of satin surfaces with goosedown stuffings so much in shape and size like florianna i shook my head thats her nest ive tried to get her out to movies to plays even to operas forget it she hasnt been out on the street in over ten years to take her away from the tenement her big elephant boneyard well constance rattigan sighed and refilled my glass it wouldnt do any good anyway would it she was reading my profile i was reading the dark surf out beyond the french windows where the tidal sands turned in their sleep in their own good time its always too late isnt it constance rattigan went on theres no way to protect fannie or anyone not if someone wants to hurt or kill you who said anything about killing i protested youve got the kind of plain pink pumpkin face that shows everything when i told fortunes it wasnt tea leaves it was obvious eyes and vulnerable mouths fannies spooked and that spooks me for the first time in years when i swim at night i figure a big wave will take me so far out ill never make it back christ i hate to have my one really big enjoyment spoiled like this then she added swiftly you wouldnt be the spoiler would you what suddenly she sounded like crumley or fannie telling me not to bring anyone with i must have looked so startled that she barked a laugh hell no youre just one of those guys who kill people on paper sos not to kill for real sorry but i was on my feet now bursting to say something tell wild things but i wasnt sure what look i said its been a crazy month im beginning to notice things maybe i never noticed before i never read the obituaries ever now i do you ever have weeks or months when too many friends go mad or go away or drop dead at sixty constance rattigan laughed ironically there are whole years like that im afraid to go down any flight of stairs friend broke his neck that way afraid of eating two friends choked the ocean three friends drowned airplanes six friends smashed cars twenty sleeping hell yes ten friends died in their sleep said what the hell and quit drinking fourteen friends with cirrhosis list me some lists its only begun for you ive got a phone book here look she grabbed a small black book off the table near the door and tossed it to me book of the dead what i turned the pages saw the names there were little red crosses by fifty percent of the names on each page that personal phone book is thirtyfive years old so half the people in it have been gone quite a while and i dont have the guts to finally erase or yank out the names it would be like a final death so i guess im the same sort of custard you are son she took the book of the dead back from me i felt a cold wind from the window and heard the beach sand stir as if a great and invisible beast had put a huge paw down on it i didnt spook fannie i said at last im not typhoid mary i dont carry the disease if its anywhere tonight or here its on its own my stomachs been ruined for days people are dying or running away and theres no connection and i cant prove anything im around or near when it happens and i feel guilty i cant see know tell stop it i have this godawful feeling itll go on more days than i can bear everyone i look at now i think i wonder if he or she is next and know that if i wait long enough of course everyone goes they just seem to be going faster this week thats all im going to say now ill shut up she came and kissed the ends of her fingers and put the fingertips on my mouth i wont rile you again for a custard you snap back what now another drink want to run films midnight dip in my pool mercy sex with your film mother none of the above i ducked my head so as to avoid her mocking and fiery gaze films id like to see constance rattigan in lace curtains last time i saw it i was five you sure know how to make old folks feel great lace curtains stand back while i load the projector my pa worked a kansas city cinema when i was a girl taught me to run the machines still can i dont need anyone in this house yes you do me to watch the film damn she leaped across the pillows and started fiddling with the projector in the back of the parlor she yanked a can of film off a nearby shelf and deftly began to thread it through the machine youre right ill watch your face watching me while she was busy humming and adjusting i turned and stepped out on the low porch above the sands my eye traveled along from the south roving the shore past the front of constance rattigans property and on north until down by the tideline i saw something there was a man standing there motionless or something that looked like a man and how long he had been there and whether he had just come in from the surf i couldnt say i couldnt see if he was wet he looked naked i gasped and glanced quickly inside constance rattigan whistling between her teeth was still dickering away at the projector a wave fell like a gunshot i flicked my gaze back the man was still there hands at his side head up legs apart almost defiant go away i wanted to yell what are you doing here weve done nothing are you sure was my next thought no one deserves to be killed no a final wave came in behind the shape there on the shore it broke up into a series of cracked mirrors that fell and seemed to envelop the man he was erased when the wave pulled back out he was gone perhaps running away north along the sands back past the lion cage in the canal past the canary ladys empty windows back past my apartment with its windingsheet bed ready constance rattigan called from inside not really i thought inside constance said come see the old lady made young youre not old i said no by god she ran around turning off lights and fluffing pillows in the middle of the room this health nuts writing a book out next year underwater gymnastics sex at low tide what bicarbs to take after you eat the local football coach what my god youre blushing again what do you know about girls not much how many you had not many one she guessed and crowed when my head bobbed where is she tonight mexico city whens she coming back ten days miss her love her yes you want to telephone her and stay on the phone all night so her voice protects you from this dragon lady im not afraid of you like hell youre not you believe in body warmth body warmth sex without sex hugs you can give this old gila monster canned heat without losing virtue just hold and hug spoon fashion keep your eyes on the ceiling thats where the action is films all night until the dawn comes up like francis x bushmans erection sorry damn come on son lets hit the sack she sank into the pillows pulling me after at the same time stabbing some buttons on a control console imbedded in the floor the last lights went out the sixteenmillimeter projector started humming the ceiling filled with light and shadow look how dyou like that she pointed up with her beautiful nose constance rattigan twentyeight years back in time on the ceiling lit a cigarette down beside me the real lady blew smoke wasnt i a bitch she said i woke at dawn not believing where i was i woke incredibly happy as if something beautiful had happened in the night nothing had of course it was just sleeping among so many rich pillows by a woman who smelled like spice cabinets and fine parquetry she was a lovely chess game carved and set in a store window when you were a kid she was a freshly built girls gym with only the faintest scent of the noon tennis dust that clings to golden thighs i turned in the dawn light and she was gone i heard a wave come along the shore a cool wind blew in through the open french doors i sat up far out in the dusky waters i saw an arm flash up and down up and down her voice called i ran out and dove in and swam halfway to her before i was exhausted no athlete this i turned back and sat waiting for her on the shore she came in at last and stood over me stark naked this time christ she said you didnt even take off your underwear whats happened to modern youth i was staring at her body how you like it pretty good for an old empress huh good buzzum tight rump marceled pubic hairs but i had shut my eyes she giggled then she was gone laughing she ran up the beach half a mile and came back having startled only the gulls next thing i knew the smell of coffee blew along the shore with the scent of fresh toast when i dragged myself inside she was seated in the kitchen wearing only the mascara she had painted around her eyes a moment before blinking rapidly at me like some silent screen farm girl she handed me jam and toast and draped a napkin daintily over her lap so as not to offend while i stared and ate she got strawberry jam on the tip of her left breast i saw this she saw me seeing this and said hungry which made me butter my toast all the faster good grief go call mexico city i called where are you demanded pegs voice two thousand miles away in a phone booth in venice and its raining i said liar said peg and she was right and then quite suddenly it was over it was very late or very early i felt drunk on life just because this woman had taken time to play through the hours talk through the darkness until the sun way over in the east beyond the fogs and mists threatened to appear i looked out at the surf and shore not a sign of bodies drowned and no one on the sand to know or not know i didnt want to go but i had a full days work ahead writing my stories just three steps ahead of death a day without writing i often said and said it so many times my friends sighed and rolled their eyeballs a day without writing was a little death i did not intend to pitch me over the graveyard wall i would fight all the way with my underwood standard which shoots more squarely if you aim it right than any rifle ever invented ill drive you home said constance rattigan no thanks its just three hundred yards down the beach were neighbors like hell we are this place cost two hundred thousand to build in five million today whats your rent thirty bucks a month i nodded okay neighbor hit the sand come back some midnight often i said often she took my two hands in hers which is to say into the hands of the chauffeur and the maid and the movie queen she laughed reading my mind you think im nuts i wish the world were like you she shifted gears to avoid the compliment and fannie will she live forever my eyes wet i nodded she kissed me on both cheeks and pushed get outa here i jumped from her tiled porch into the sand ran a step turned and said good day princess shit she said pleased i ran away nothing much happened that day but that night i woke and glanced at my mickey mouse watch wondering what had pulled me up i shut my eyes tight and ached my ears listening rifle fire bang bong and again bang bong and again bang down the coast from the pier my god i thought the piers almost empty and the rifle gallery shut and who could be out there middle of the night yanking the trigger and belling the target bang and bang and the sound of the struck gong bang and bong again and again twelve shots at a time and then twelve more and then twelve more as if someone had lined up three and then six and then nine rifles and jumped from an empty one to a loaded one without a breath and aimed and fired and fired and fired madness it had to be whoever it was alone on the pier in the fog seizing the weapons firing at doom annie oakley the rifle lady herself i wondered bang take that you sonofabitch bang take that you bastard runaway lover bang take that you unholy womanizing freak bang wham and again wham far off but blowing in the wind so many bullets i thought to make something impossible die it went on for twenty minutes when it was over i could not sleep with three dozen wounds in my chest i groped over to my typewriter and eyes shut typed out all the rifle shots in the dark offisa pup hows that again offisa pup this is krazy kat jesus said crumley its you offisa pup eh its better than elmo crumley got me there and krazy kats right for you scribe how goes the great american epic how goes the conan doyle sequel this is embarrassing but ever since i met you son im doing four pages a night its like a war should be outa there

damn it to hell come outa that christawful tomb i laughed shall i finish the list let me grab my beer okay shoot i reeled off six more names including though i didnt really believe it shapeshades and maybe i finished and hesitated constance rattigan rattigan yelled crumley what the hell you know about rattigan she eats tigers balls on toast and can whipsaw sharks two falls out of three shed walk out of hiroshima with her earrings and eyelashes intact annie oakley now no to her too shed rifle someones butt off before he no only way is some night on her own she might toss all her guns off the pier and follow after thats in her face as for shapeshade dont make me laugh he doesnt even know the real world exists out here with us grotesque normals theyll bury him in his wurlitzer come got any more bright ideas i swallowed hard and finally decided to at last tell crumley about the mysterious disappearance of cal the barber mysterious hell said crumley where you been the mad butcher skedaddled piled his tin lizzie with dregs from his shop just the other day pulled out of the noparking zone in front of his place and headed east not west you notice toward lands end but east half the police force saw him make a big uturn out front the station and didnt arrest him because he yelled autumn leaves by god autumn leaves in the ozarks i gave a great trembling sigh of relief glad for cals survival i said nothing about scott joplins missing head which was probably what drove cal off and away forever but crumley was still talking you finished with your superbrandnew list of possible deads well lamely dip in ocean then dip in typewriter says zen master makes for full page and happy heart listen to the detective advising the genius the beer is on the ice so that the pee is in the pot later leave your list at home so long krazy kat offisa pup i said goodbye the forty dozen rifle shots from last night drew me their echoes would not stop and the sound of more of the pier being pounded and compacted and eaten away drew me as the sounds of war must draw some the rifle shots the pier i thought as i dipped in the ocean and then dipped in my typewriter like the good kat offisa pup wished me to be i wonder how many men or was it just one annie oakley killed last night i wonder also i thought placing six new pages of incredibly brilliant novel in my talking box what new books of drunken doom a l shrank has toadstoolfarmed on his catacomb library shelves the hardy boys invite ptomaine nancy drew and the weltschmerz kid the funeral directors of america frolic at atlantic city dont go look i thought i must i thought but dont laugh when you see the new titles shrank might run out and charge you rifle shots i thought dying pier a l shrank sigmund freuds munchkin son and now there up ahead of me hiking on the pier the beast or as i sometimes called him erwin rommel of the afrika korps or sometimes simply caligula the killer his real name was john wilkes hopwood i remember reading one of those devastating reviews about him in a small local hollywood theater some years before john wilkes hopwood the matinee assassin has done it again to another role not only has he torn a passion to tatters he has madness maddened stomped on it ravened it with his teeth and hurled it across the footlights at unsuspecting club ladies the damned fools ate it up i often saw him riding his bright orange raleigh eightspeed bike along the ocean walk from venice to ocean park and santa monica he was always dressed in a fine freshly pressed brown houndstooth english suit with a dark brown irish cap pulled over his snowwhite curls and shading his general erwin rommel or if you prefer killer hawks conradveidtabouttosmotherjoancrawfordorgreergarson face his cheeks were burned to a wonderful polished nutmeg color and i often wondered if the color stopped at his neckline for i had never seen him out on the sand stripped forever he cycled up and down between the ocean towns at liberty waiting to be summoned by the german general staff or the club ladies over at the hollywood assistance league whichever came first when there was a cycle of war films he worked constantly for it was rumored he had a full closet of afrika korps uniforms and a burial cape for the occasional vampire film as far as i could tell he had only one casual outfit that suit and one pair of shoes fine english oxblood brogues highly polished his bicycle clips brightly clasping his tweed cuffs looked to be pure silver from some shop in beverly hills his teeth were always so finely polished they seemed not his own his breath as he pedaled past was listerine just in case he had to take a fast call from hitler on his way to playa del rey i saw him most often motionless astride his bike sunday afternoons when muscle beach filled up with rippling deltoids and masculine laughter hopwood would stand up on the santa monica pier like a commander in the last days of the retreat from el alamein depressed at all that sand delighted with all that flesh he seemed so apart from all of us gliding by in his anglobyronicgerman daydreams i never thought to see him parking his raleigh bike outside a l shranks tarotcardlargebelfrywithplentyofbatsopenatallhours shed but park he did and hesitated outside the door dont go in i thought no one goes in a l shranks unless its for poison medici rings and tombstone phone numbers erwin rommel didnt mind neither did the beast or caligula shrank beckoned all three obeyed by the time i got there the door was shut on it for the first time though it had probably yellowed there for years was a list typed with a faded ribbon of all the folks who had passed through his portals to be psyched back to health h b warner warner oland warner baxter conrad nagel vilma banky rod la rocque bessie love james gleason it read like the actors directory for but constance rattigan was there i didnt believe that and john wilkes hopwood i knew i had to believe that for as i glanced through the dusty window where a shade was halfdrawn against prying eyes i saw that someone was indeed on that couch from which stuffing sprang in mad abandon from the burst seams and the man lying on the couch was the man in the brown tweed suit eyes shut doing lines no doubt from a revised and improved last act of hamlet jesus in the lilies as crumley had said christ fresh to the cross at that moment intent upon reciting his rosary innards hopwoods eyes flew open with actors intuition his eyes rolled then his head flicked swiftly to one side he stared at the window and saw me as did a l shrank seated nearby turned away pad and pencil in hand i stood back cursed quietly and walked quickly away in total embarrassment i walked all the way to the end of the ruined pier bought six nestles crunch bars and two clark bars and two power houses to devour on the way whenever i am very happy or very sad or very embarrassed i cram my mouth with sweets and litter the breezeway with discards it was there at the end of the pier in the golden light of late afternoon that caligula rommel caught up with me the destruction workers were gone the air was silent i heard his bicycle hum and glide just behind me he didnt speak at first he just arrived on foot the bright silver bike clips around his trim ankles the raleigh held in his firm grasp like an insect woman he stood at the one place on the pier where i had seen him like a statue of richard wagner watching one of his great choruses come in tides along the shore there were still half a dozen young men playing volleyball below the thump of the ball and the rifleshots of their laughs were somehow killing the day beyond two weightlifting finalists were lifting their own worlds into the sky in hopes of convincing eight or nine young women nearby that a fate worse than death wasnt so bad after all and could be had upstairs in the hotdog apartments just across the sand john wilkes hopwood surveyed the scene and did not look at me he was making me sweat and wait daring me to leave i had after all crossed an invisible sill of his life half an hour ago now i must pay are you following me i said at last and immediately felt a fool hopwood laughed that famous lastact maniac laugh of his dear boy youre much too young youre the sort i throw back in the sea god i thought what do i say now hopwood cricked his head stiffly back behind him pointing his eagles profile toward the santa monica pier a mile north from here along the coast but if you should ever decide to follow me he smiled that is where i live above the carousel above the horses i turned far off on that other still vibrant pier was the carousel that had been turning and grinding out its calliope music since i was a kid above the big horse race were the carousel apartments a grand eyrie for retired german generals failed actors or driven romantics i had heard that great poets who published small lived there novelists of many wits and no reviews lived there wellhung artists with unhung paintings lived there courtesans of famous film stars who were now prostitutes for spaghetti salesmen lived there old english matrons who had once thrived in brighton and missed the rocks lived there with stacks of antimacassars and stuffed pekingese now it seemed that bismarck thomas mann conrad veidt admiral doenitz erwin rommel and mad otto of bavaria lived there i looked at that magnificent eagle profile hopwood stiffened with pride at my glance he scowled at the golden sands and said quietly you think i am crazy allowing myself the tender mercies of one a l shrank well he is a very insightful man very holistic very special and as you know we actors are the worlds most unsettled people the future is always uncertain the phone should ring but never does we have much time on our hands so it is either numerology or the tarot cards or astrology or the eastern meditation up under the great tree at ojai with krishnamurti have you been fine or reverend violet greener at her agabeg temple on crenshaw norvell the futurist aimee semple mcpherson were you ever saved i was she laid on the hands then i laid her holy rollers the ecstasy or the hall johnson choir down in the first baptist church sunday nights dark angels such glory or it is the allnight bridge or the startatnoon playtilldusk bingo with all the ladies with heliotrope hair actors go everywhere if we knew a good eviscerator we would attend caesars gutreaders inc i could make a mint scalpeling doves and fishing out the innards like cardpips where the future lies stinking at noon i try it all to fill the time thats what all actors are time fillers ninety percent of our lives stagewaits meanwhile we lie down with a l shrank to get it up at muscle beach he had never taken his gaze from the pliant rubber greek gods who frolicked below washed by equal parts of salt wind and lust have you ever wondered he said at last a faint line of sweat on his upper lip a faint brim of perspiration along the hairline under his cap about vampires who do not appear in mirrors well now see those glorious young men down there they appear in all mirrors but no one else does only the minted gods show and when they stare at themselves do they ever see anyone else the girls that they ride like seahorses i have no such faith so now he went back to his starter subject do you understand why you saw me with the wee dark mole a l shrank i wait for phone calls myself i said anythings better than that you actually understand he stared at me with eyes that burned the clothes off my body i nodded come visit me sometime he nodded at the faraway carousel apartments where the calliope groaned and lamented over something vaguely resembling beautiful ohio ill tell you about iris tree sir beerbohm trees daughter who used to live in those apartments the halfsister of carol reed the british director aldous huxley sometimes drops up you might see him he saw my head jerk at that and knew i was on the hook you like to meet huxley well behave yourself he caressed the words and you just might i was filled with an inexpressible and insufferable need that i had to force myself to repress huxley was a madness in my life a terrible hunger i longed to be that bright that witty that toweringly supreme to think i might meet him come visit hopwoods hand had crept to his coat pocket and i will introduce you to the young man i love best in all the world i forced myself to glance away as i had often glanced off from something crumley or constance rattigan said well well murmured john wilkes hopwood his germanic mouth curling with delight the young man is embarrassed its not what you think look no stare he held out a crumpled glossy photograph i tried to take it but he held it gripped firmly his thumb placed over the head of the person in the photo the rest sticking out from under the thumb was the most beautiful body of a young man i had ever seen in my life it reminded me of photos i had once seen of the statue of antinous the lover of hadrian in the lobby of the vatican museum it reminded me of the boy david it reminded me of a thousand young mens bodies wrestling up and down the beach from my childhood to here sunburned and mindless wildly happy without true joy a thousand summers were compacted down into this one single photograph as john wilkes hopwood held it with his thumb hiding the face to protect it from revelations isnt it the single most incredible body in the history of the world it was a proclamation and its mine all mine mine to have and hold he said no no dont flinch here he took his thumb off the face of the incredibly lovely young man and the face of the old hawk the ancient german warrior the african tank general appeared my god i said its you me said john wilkes hopwood and threw his head back with that merciless grin that flashed sabers and promised steel he laughed silently in honor of the old days before films talked it is i rather he said i took off my glasses cleaned them and looked closer no no fake no trick photography it was like those contest picture puzzles they used to print in newspapers when i was a boy the faces of presidents cut in three sections and mixed here lincolns chin there washingtons nose and above roosevelts eyes mixed and remixed with thirty other presidents you had to recut and repaste to win a fast ten bucks but here a young mans greekstatue body was fused to the neck head and face of a hawkeaglevulture ascending into villainy madness or both triumph of the will was in john wilkes hopwoods eyes as he stared over my shoulder as if he had never seen this damned beauty before you think its a trick eh no but i stole a look at his woolen suit his fresh clean shirt his neatly tied oldschool tie his vest his cufflinks his bright belt buckle the silver bike clips around his ankles i thought of cal the barber and scott joplins missing head john wilkes hopwood stroked his vest and legs with rustfreckled fingers yes he laughed its covered up so youll never know unless you come visit will you whether the old halfgonetoseed richard hasbeen really is the keeper of the summer boy flame eh how can it be that a miracle of youngness is mated with an old seawolf why does apollo lie down with caligula i blurted and froze but hopwood didnt mind he laughed and nodded as he touched my elbow caligula yes will now speak while lovely apollo hides and waits will power is the answer will power health foods yes are the center of actors lives we must keep our bodies as well as our spirits up no white bread no nestles crunch bars i flinched and felt the last of the bars melting in my pockets no pies cakes no hard liquor not even too much sex in bed nights by ten up early a run along the beach two hours in the gym every day every day of your life all your friends gym instructors and two hours of bicycling a day every day for thirty years thirty years at the end of which time you stroll by gods guillotine he chops off your crazed old eagles head and plants it on a sunburned forever golden young mans body what a price i have paid but worth it beauty is mine sublime incest narcissus par excellence i need no one else i believe that i said your honesty will be your death he put his photo like a flower in his pocket you still dont believe let me see that again he handed it to me i stared and as i stared the surf rolled on the dark shore just last night from the surf a naked man suddenly appeared i winced and blinked was this the body this the man who had come out of the sea to frighten me when constance rattigans back was turned i wanted to know i could only say do you know constance rattigan he stiffened why do you ask i saw her name at shranks outside typed i thought maybe you were ships that passed in the night or bodies him coming out of the surf at three am some night soon as she plunged in his teutonic mouth shaped itself to merely haughty our film crossed sabers was the smash of across america our affair made headlines that summer i was the greatest love of her life were you i started to say were you the one i thought and not the director who drowned himself who cut her hamstrings with your sword so she couldnt walk for a year but then last night i hadnt really had a chance to look for the scars and the way constance ran it was all lies told a hundred years back you should go see a l shrank a concerned man pure zen all wise he said climbing back on his bike how so he told me to give you these he took from his other pocket a handful of candy wrappers twelve of them neatly paperclipped together mostly clark crunch and power house things i had mindlessly strewn in the beach winds and someone had picked up he knows all about you said mad otto of bavaria and laughed with the soundtrack off i took the candy wrappers shamefacedly and felt the extra ten pounds sag around my middle as i held these flags of defeat visit me he said come ride the carousel come see if innocent boy david is truly married to old evil caligula eh and he biked away a tweed suit under a tweed hat smiling and looking only ahead i walked back to a l shranks melancholy museum and squinted through the dusty window there was a toppling stack of bright orange lemon chocolatebrown candy wrappers filed on a small table near the sunken sofa those cant all be mine i thought they are i thought im plump but then hes nuts i went to find ice cream crumley i thought my name was offisa pup i think ive got a line on the murderer himself there was a long ocean silence while the policeman put down the phone tore his hair and picked the phone up again john wilkes hopwood i said you forget said the police lieutenant there have been no murders yet only suspicions and possibilities theres a thing called a courtroom and another thing called proof no proof no case and they throw you out on your butt so fast youre stopped up for weeks you ever seen john wilkes hopwood with his clothes off i asked that did it offisa pup hung up on me it was raining when i came out of the booth almost immediately the telephone rang as if knowing i was there i snatched at it and for some reason yelled peg but there was only a sound of rain and soft breathing miles away i wont ever answer this phone again i thought sonofabitch i yelled come get me you bastard i hung up my god i thought what if he heard and came over to visit idiot i thought and the phone rang for a last time i had to answer maybe to apologize to that breathing far away and tell it to ignore my insolence i lifted the receiver and heard a sad lady five miles off somewhere in los angeles fannie and she was crying fannie my god is that you yes oh yes lord god in heaven she wheezed she gasped she floundered coming upstairs almost killed me havent climbed stairs since where have you been the roofs caved in lifes over everybodys dead why didnt you tell me oh god god this is terrible can you come over jimmy sam pietro she did the litany and the pressure of my guilt crushed me against the side of the phone booth pietro jimmy sam why did you lie i didnt lie i just shut up i said and now henry she cried henry my god he isnt fell downstairs alive alive i yelled in his room yes thank god wouldnt go to the hospital i heard him fall ran out thats when i found out what you didnt say henry lying there swearing naming names jimmy sam pietro oh why did you bring death here i didnt fannie come prove it ive got three mayonnaise jars full of quarters take a cab send the driver up ill pay him out of the jars and when you get here how will i know when you knock at the door itll be you how do you know its me even now fannie on the phone i dont know she wailed isnt that awful i dont know los angeles i said to the taxi driver ten minutes later three mayonnaise jars worth hello constance im in a phone booth across from fannies weve got to get her out of here can you come shes really scared now for good reasons i stared across at the tenement and judged how many thousand shadows were crammed in it top to bottom this time for sure get over there stand guard ill be there in half an hour i wont come up you argue her down damn it and well get her away jump the way constance slammed down the phone shot me out of the booth and almost got me run down by a car racing across the street the way i knocked on her door she believed it was me she threw the door wide and i saw what was almost a crazed elephant eyes wild hair in disarray acting as if a rifle had just shot her through her head i launched her back into her chair and threw the icebox wide trying to decide whether mayonnaise or wine would help wine get that in you i commanded and suddenly realized my cab driver was in the door behind me having followed me upstairs thinking i was a deadbeat and trying to escape i grabbed and handed him one mayonnaise jar full of quarters that enough i said he did a quick estimate like someone guessing jelly beans in a vat in a store window sucked his teeth and ran off with the coins rattling fannie was busy emptying the wine glass i refilled it and sat down to wait at last she said someones been outside my door every night now for two nights they come and go go and come not like ever before they stop they breathe out and in my god what are they doing outside an old collapsed ruin of an opera singer fat ladys door at midnight it cant be rape can it they dont rape opound sopranos do they and here she began to laugh so long and so hard i couldnt tell if it was hysteria or an amazed and selfsurprising humor i had to beat her on the back to stop the laughs and change the color in her face and give her more wine oh my my my she gasped its good to laugh thank god youre here youll protect me wont you im sorry i said what i said you didnt bring that dreadful thing with you and leave it outside my door its just the hound of the baskervilles hungry come in on his own to scare fannie im sorry i didnt tell you about jimmy and pietro and sam fannie i said and gulped my wine i just didnt want to read obits to you all at once look here constance rattigan will be downstairs in a few minutes she wants you to come stay a few days and more secrets cried fannie eyes wide since when have you known her and anyway its no use this is my home if i left here id waste away just die i have my recordings well take them with my books ill carry them down my mayonnaise she wouldnt have the right brand ill buy it she wouldnt have room even for you fannie yes and then what about my new calico cat and so it went until i heard the limousine shrug in against the curb below so thats it is it fannie i feel fine now now that youre here just tell mrs gutierrez to come up and stay a while after you leave said fannie cheerily where does all this false optimism come from when an hour ago you were doomed dear boy fannies fine that dreadful beast isnt coming back i just know and anyway anyway with a terrible sense of timing the entire tenement shifted in its sleep the door to fannies room whispered on its hinges as if shot a final time fannie sat up and almost gagged on her terror i was across the room in an instant and threw the door wide to stare out into the long valley of the hall a mile in this direction a mile in that endless dark tunnels filled with jet streams of night i listened and heard the plaster crack in the ceiling the doors itch in their frames somewhere a toilet muttered incessantly to itself an old cold white porcelain vault in the night there was no one in the hall of course whoever had been there if he ever was had shut a door quickly or run toward the front or out the back where the night came in in an invisible flood a long winding river of wind bringing with it memories of things eaten and things discarded things desired things no longer wanted i wanted to shriek at the empty halls the things i had wanted to shout along the night shore outside constance rattigans arabian fort go let be we may look as if we deserve to but we dont want to die what i shouted to emptiness was all right you kids get back in your rooms go on now git thats it so there i waited for the nonexistent kids to retreat to their nonexistent rooms and turned back in to lean against the door and shut it with a fake smile it worked or fannie pretended it did youd make a good father she beamed no id be like all fathers out of mind and out of patience those kids should have been doped with beer and slugged into their cots hours ago feeling better fannie better she sighed and shut her eyes i went and circled her with my arms like lindbergh going around the earth and the crowds yelling it will work itself out she said you go now everythings all right like you said those kids have gone to bed the kids i almost said but stopped myself oh yes the kids so fannies safe and you go home poor baby tell constance thanks but no thanks and she can come visit yes mrs gutierrez has promised to come up and stay tonight on that bed i havent used in thirty years can you imagine i cant sleep on my back i cant breathe well mrs gutierrez is coming up and you were so kind to come visit dear child i see now how kind you are you only want to save me the sadness of our friends downstairs thats true fannie theres nothing unusual about their passing on is there no fannie i lied only foolishness and failed beauty and sadness god she said you talk like butterflys lieutenant thats why the guys at school beat me up i went to the door fannie took a deep breath and at last said if anything does happen to me not that it will but if it does look in the icebox look where icebox said fannie enigmatically dont but i had jerked the icebox open already i stared in at the light i saw lots of jams sauces jellies and mayonnaise i shut the door after a long moment you shouldnt have looked protested fannie i dont want to wait ive got to know now i wont tell you she said indignantly you shouldnt have peeked im just willing to admit maybe its my fault it came into the house it fannie it it all the bad things i thought you dragged in on your shoes but maybe fannie was responsible maybe im guilty maybe i called that thing off the streets well did you or didnt you i yelled leaning toward her dont you love me any more love you hell im trying to get you out of here and you wont come you accuse me of poisoning the toilets and now tell me to look in iceboxes jesus god fannie now the lieutenant is mad with butterfly but her eyes were starting to well over i couldnt stand any more of that i opened the door mrs gutierrez had been standing there a long while i was sure a plate of hot tacos in her hands always the diplomat waiting ill call you tomorrow fannie i said of course you will and fannie will be alive i wonder i thought if i shut my eyes and pretend to be blind can i find henrys room i tapped on henrys door who that henry said locked away who dat say who dat i said who dat say who dat say who dat he said and had to laugh then he remembered he was in pain its you henry let me in im okay just fell downstairs is all just almost got destroyed is all just let me rest here with the door locked ill be out tomorrow youre a good boy to worry what happened henry i asked the locked door henry came closer i felt he was leaning against it like someone talking through a confessional lattice he tripped me a rabbit ran around in my chest and turned into a big rat that kept right on running who henry him sonofabitch tripped me did he say anything you sure he was there how do i know the upstairs hall light is on me i feel heat the hall was terrible warm where he was and he was breathing of course i heard him sucking away at the air and blowing out nice and gentle where he hid he didnt say nothing as i went by but i heard his heart too wham wham or maybe it was mine i figured to sneak by so he cant see me blind man figures that if hes in the dark why not everyone else and next thing you know bam im at the bottom of the stairs and dont know how i got there i started yelling for jimmy and sam and pietro then i said damn fool to myself theyre gone and you too if you dont ask for someone else i started naming names top speed doors popped all around the house and while they was popping he popped out sounded almost barefoot out the door smelled his breath i swallowed and leaned on the door what was it like let me think and tell henrys going to bed now im sure glad im blind hate to have seen myself going down stairs like a bag of laundry night goodnight henry i said and turned just as the big steamboat of a tenement house rounded a bend of river wind in the dark i felt i was back at the surf in mr shapeshades movie house at one in the morning with the tide glutting and shaking the timbers under the seats and the big silverandblack images gliding on the screen the whole tenement shivered the cinema was one thing the trouble with this big old twilight place was the shadows had come off the screen and waited by stairwells and hid in bathrooms and unscrewed lightbulbs some nights so everyone groped blind as henry to find their way out i did just that at the top of the stairs i froze i heard breath churning the air ahead of me but it was only the echo of my own sucks and swallows hitting the wall and bouncing back to feel at my face for christs sake i thought dont trip yourself going down the chauffeurdriven duesenberg limousine was waiting for me when i came out of fannies when the door slammed we were off and halfway to venice when the chauffeur up front took off his cap and let his hair down and became rattigan the interrogator well she said coldly is she or isnt she upset she is damn well upset but i didnt upset her no no damn it now just pull up at the next corner and let me the damn hell out for a bashful boy from northern illinois you got some language mr hemingway well hell miss rattigan that did it i saw her shoulders slump a little she was losing me if she wasnt careful and knew it constance she suggested quieter constance i said its not my fault people drown in bathtubs and drink too much or fall downstairs or get taken away by the police why didnt you come inside just now youre fannies old old friend i was afraid that seeing you and me together would overload and the top of her head fly off and we would never be able to get it back on she let the limousine go from a rather hysterical seventy down to a nervous sixty or sixtytwo but she had her claws on the wheel as if it were my shoulders and she was shaking me i said youd better get her out of there once and for all she wont sleep for a week now and that might kill her just exhaustion you cant feed a soul on mayonnaise forever constance slowed the limo to fiftyfive she give you a rough time only called me deaths friend like you i seem to be everyones goat handing out bubonic fleas whatever is in the tenement is there all right but im not the carrier on top of which fannie has done something stupid what i dont know she wont tell me shes put out with herself maybe you can worm it out of her i got a terrible feeling fannie brought all this on herself how the limousine slowed to forty constance was watching me in the rearview mirror i licked my lips i can only guess something in her icebox she said if anything happened to her she said look in the icebox god how stupid maybe you can go back later tonight on your own and look in the damn icebox and figure out how and why and what it is that fannie has invited into the tenement that is scaring the hell out of her jesus at midnight murmured constance shutting her eyes mary at dawn constance i yelled for we had just gone through a red light blind luckily god was there and paved the way she parked in front of my apartment and she got out while i unlocked the door and she stuck her head in so this is where all the genius happens huh a little piece of mars on earth is that cals piano there i heard about the music critics who tried to burn it once then there were the customers who mobbed the shop one day yelling and showing their funny hair cals all right i said have you looked in a mirror lately he tried just on one side of you remind me next time youre over my dad did some barbering too taught me why are we standing here in the doorway afraid the neighbors will talk if you hell there you go again no matter what i say it seems to be the truth youre the genuine article arent you i havent seen a bashful man since i turned twelve she stuck her head further in god all the junk dont you ever pick up whats this reading ten books at a time half of them comics is that a buck rogers disintegrator there by your typewriter did you send away box tops yep i said what a dump she crowed and meant it for a compliment all that i have is yours that bed isnt even big enough for club sandwich sex one partner always has to stay on the floor jesus what year is that typewriter youre using underwood standard old but great just like me huh kid you going to invite the ancient celebrity in and unscrew her earrings youve got to go back and look in fannies icebox remember besides if you slept over tonight spoons plenty of cutlery but no fork no fork constance the memory of your mended underwear is devastating im no boy david hell youre not even ralph goodnight kid its me for fannies icebox thanks she gave me a kiss that burst my eardrums and drove away reeling with it i somehow made it to bed which i shouldnt have done because then i had the dream every night the small rainfall came outside my door stayed a moment whispered and went away i was afraid to go look afraid i might find crumley standing there drenched with fiery eyes or shapeshade flickering and moving in jerks like an old film seaweed hung from his eyebrows and nose every night i waited the rain stopped i slept and then came the dream i was a writer in a small green town in northern illinois and seated in a barber chair like cals chair in his empty shop then someone rushed in with a telegram that announced i had just made a movie sale for one hundred thousand dollars in the chair yelling with happiness waving the telegram i saw the faces of all the men and boys and the barber turn to glaciers turn to permafrost and when they did pretend at smiles of congratulation their teeth were icicles suddenly i was the outsider the wind from their mouths blew cold on me i had changed forever i could not be forgiven the barber finished my haircut much too quickly as if i were untouchable and i went home with my telegram gripped in my sweating hands late that night from the edge of the woods not far from my house in that small town i heard a monster crying beyond the forest i sat up in bed with crystals of cold frost skinning my body the monster roared coming nearer i opened my eyes to hear better i gaped my mouth to relax my ears the monster shrieked closer half through the forest now thrashing and plunging crushing the wildflowers frightening rabbits and clouds of birds that rose screaming to the stars i could not move or scream myself i felt the blood drain from my face i saw the celebratory telegram on the bureau nearby the monster shouted a terrible cry of death and plunged again as if chopping trees along the way with its horrible scimitar teeth i leaped from bed seized the telegram ran to the front door threw it wide the monster was almost out of the forest it brayed it shrieked it knocked the night winds with threats i tore the telegram into a dozen pieces and threw them out over the lawn and shouted after them the answer is no keep your money keep your fame im staying here i wont go no and again no and a final despairing no the last cry died in the monster dinosaurs throat there was a dreadful moment of silence the moon slid behind a cloud i waited with the sweat freezing over my face the monster sucked in a breath exhaled then turned and lumbered away back through the forest fading at last gone into oblivion the pieces of telegram blew like moth wings on the lawn i shut and locked the screen and went mourning with relief to bed just before dawn i slept now in bed in venice waked from that dream i went to my front door and looked out at the canals what could i shout to the dark water to the fog to the ocean on the shore who would hear what monster might recognize my mea culpa or my great refusal or my protest of innocence or my argument for my goodness and a genius as yet unspent go away could i cry i am guilty of nothing i must not die and let the others alone for gods sake could i say or shout that i opened my mouth to try but my mouth was caked with dust that had somehow gathered in the dark i could only put one hand out in a gesture a begging an empty pantomime please i thought please i whispered then shut the door at which point the telephone across the street in my special phone booth rang i wont answer i thought its him the ice man the phone rang its peg the phone rang its him shut up i shrieked the phone stopped my weight collapsed me into bed crumley stood in his door blinking for gods sake you know what time it is we stood there watching each other like boxers who have knocked each other silly and dont know where to lie down i couldnt think of what to say so i said i am most dreadfully attended thats the password shakespeare come he led me through the house to where coffee a lot of it in a big pot was cooking on the stove i been working late on my masterpiece crumley nodded toward his bedroom typewriter a long yellow page like the tongue of the muse was hanging out of it i use legal paper get more on it i suppose i figure if i come to the end of a regularsized page i wont go on jesus you look lousy bad dreams the worst i told him about the barber shop the hundredthousanddollar movie sale the monster in the night my shouts and the great beast moaning away gone and me alive forever jesus crumley poured two big cups of something so thick it was bubbling lava you even dream better than i do whats the dream mean we can never win ever if i stay poor and dont ever publish a book i lose but if i sell and publish and have money in the bank do i lose too do people hate you will friends forgive you youre older crumley tell me why does the beast in the dream come to kill me why do i have to give back the money whats it all about hell snorted crumley im no psychiatrist would a l shrank know with fingerpainting and stoolsmearing naw you going to write that dream you always advise others when i calm down walking over here a few minutes ago i remembered my doctor once offering to tour me through the autopsydissection rooms thank god i said no then i really would have been dreadfully attended im overworked now how do i clean out the lion cage in my head how do i smooth the old canary ladys bedsheets how do i coax cal the barber back from joplin how do i protect fannie across town tonight and no weapons drink your coffee advised crumley i grubbed in my pocket and took out the picture of cal with scott joplin except joplins head was still missing i told crumley where i had found it someone stole the head off this picture when cal saw that he knew someone was on to him the jig was up and got out of town thats not murder said crumley same as i said same as pigs flying and turkeys getting carbuncles tapdancing next case as they say in court someone gave sam too much booze and killed him someone turned jimmy over in the bathtub to drown someone called the police on pietro and he was hauled away and that will finish him someone stood over the canary lady and very simply scared her to death someone shoved that old man into the lion cage got some further coroners reports on him said crumley blood was full of gin right someone soused him knocked him on the head pulled him into the canal already dead shoved him behind bars came out and walked to his car or his apartment somewhere in venice all wet but who would notice a wet man no umbrella in a storm shoat no let me use a dirtier word shirt you couldnt buy a judge doughnuts and java with this garage sale of yours buster people die accidents happen motive damn it motive all you got is that rummy song last night i saw upon the stair a little man who wasnt there he wasnt there again today my god i wish hed go away think if this socalled killer exists theres only one person we know whos been around it all you me you dont think no and calm down avert those big pink rabbity eyes jesus let me go find something crumley walked over to a bookshelf on one side of his kitchen and grabbed down a thick volume he tossed shakespeares collected plays on the kitchen table meaningless malignity he said what shakespeares full of it youre full of it me everyone meaningless malignity dont that have a ring it means someone running around doing lousy things a bastard for no reason or none we can figure people dont run around being sonsofbitches for no reason god crumley snorted gently youre naive half the cases we handle over at the station are guys gunning red lights to kill pedestrians or beating up their wives or shooting friends for reasons they cant recall the motives are there sure but buried so deep it would take nitro to blast them out and if there is a guy like the one youre trying to find with your beer reason and whiskey logic theres no way to find him no motives no root systems no clues hes walking about scotfree and unencumbered unless you can connect the anklebone to the legbone to the kneebone to the thighbone crumley looking happy sat down poured more coffee ever stop to think he said there are no toilets in graveyards my jaw dropped boy i never thought of that no need for restrooms out among the tombstones unless unless youre writing an edgar allan poe tale and a corpse gets up at midnight and has to go you going to write that jesus here i am giving away ideas crumley here it comes he sighed pushing his chair back you believe in hypnotism mind regression youre already regressed please i gathered my spit im going nuts regress me shove me back holy moses crumley was on his feet emptying the coffee and grabbing beer out of the icebox outside the nut farm where do you want to be sent ive met the murderer crumley now i want to meet him again i tried to ignore him because he was drunk he was behind me on that last big red train to the sea that night i found the old man dead in the lion cage no proof something he said was proof but ive forgotten if you could ticket me back let me ride that train again in the storm and listen for his voice then id know who it is and the killings would stop dont you want them to sure and after i talk you back with a hypnotic dog act and you bark the results i go arrest the killer hmm come along now bad man my friend the writer heard your voice in a hypnotic seance and thats more than proof here are the handcuffs snap em on the hell with you i stood up and jarred my coffee cup down ill hypnotize myself thats what its all about anyway isnt it autosuggestion its always me that puts me under youre not trained you dont know how sit down for christs sake ill help you find a good hypnotist hey crumley laughed somewhat crazily what about a l shrank hypnotist god i shuddered dont even joke hed sink me down with schopenhauer and nietzsche and burtons anatomy of melancholy and id never surface again you got to do it elmo i got to get you out and me to bed he led me gently to the door he insisted on driving me home on the way looking straight ahead at the dark future he said dont worry kid nothing more is going to happen crumley was wrong but not immediately of course i awoke at six in the morning because i thought i heard three dozen rifle shots again but it was only the annihilators at the pier the workmen dentists yanking the big teeth why i thought do destroyers start so early to destroy and those rifle shots probably just their laughter i showered and ran out just in time to meet a fogbank rolling in from japan the old men from the trolley station were on the beach ahead of me it was the first time i had seen them since the day their friend mr smith who wrote his name on his bedroom wall had vanished i watched them watching the pier die and i could feel the timbers fall inside their bodies the only motion they made was a kind of chewing of their gums as if they might spit tobacco their hands hung down at their sides twitching with the pier gone i knew they knew it was only a matter of time before the asphalt machines droned along and tarred over the railroad tracks and someone nailed shut the ticket office and broomed away the last of the confetti if i had been them i would have headed for arizona or some bright place that afternoon but i wasnt them i was just me half a century younger and with no rust on my knuckles and no bones cracking every time the big pliers out there gave a yank and made an emptiness i went and stood between two of the old men wanting to say something that counted but all i did was let out a big sigh it was a language they understood hearing it they waited a long while and then they nodded well heres another fine mess you got me in my voice on its way to mexico city was oliver hardys voice ollie cried peg using stan laurels voice fly down here save me from the mummies of guanajuato stan and ollie ollie and stan from the start we had called ours the laurel and hardy romance because we had grown up madly in love with the team and did a fair job of imitating their voices why dont you do something to help me i cried like mr hardy and peg as laurel spluttered back oh ollie i i mean it seems i and there was silence as we breathed our despair need and loving grief back and forth mile on mile and dollar on pegs dear dollar you cant afford this stan i sighed at last and its beginning to hurt where aspirins cant reach stan dear stanley so long oll she wept dear ollie goodbye as i said crumley was wrong at exactly one minute after eleven that night i heard the funeral car pull up in front of my apartment i hadnt been asleep and i knew the sound of constance rattigans limousine by the gentle hiss of its arrival and then the bumbling under its breath waiting for me to stir i got up asked no questions of god or anyone and dressed automatically without seeing what i put on something had made me reach for my dark pants a black shirt and an old blue blazer only the chinese wear white for the dead i held on to the front doorknob for a full minute before i had strength enough to pull the door open and go out i didnt climb in the back seat i climbed up front where constance was staring straight ahead at the surf rolling white and cold on the shore tears were rolling down her cheeks she didnt say anything but moved the limousine quietly soon we were flying steadily down the middle of venice boulevard i was afraid to ask questions because i feared answers about halfway there constance said i had this premonition thats all she said i knew she hadnt called anyone she simply had to go see for herself as it turned out even if she had called someone it would have been too late we rolled up in front of the tenement at eleventhirty pm we sat there and constance still staring ahead the tears streaking down her cheeks said god i feel as though i weigh threeeighty i cant move but we had to at last inside the tenement halfway up the steps constance suddenly fell to her knees shut her eyes crossed herself and gasped oh please god please please let fannie be alive i helped her the rest of the way up the stairs drunk on sadness at the top of the stairs in the dark there was a vast insucked draft that pulled at us as we arrived a thousand miles off at the far end of night someone had opened and shut the door on the north side of the tenement going out for air going out to escape a shadow moved in a shadow the cannon bang of the door reached us an instant later constance rocked on her heels i grabbed her hand and pulled her along we moved through weather that got older and colder and darker as we went i began to run making strange noises incantations with my mouth to protect fannie its all right shell be there i thought making magic prayers with her phonograph records and caruso photos and astrology charts and mayonnaise jars and her singing and she was there all right the door hung open on its hinges she was there in the middle of the linoleum in the middle of the room lying on her back fannie we both shouted at once get up we wanted to say you cant breathe lying on your back you havent been to bed in thirty years you must always sit up fannie always she did not get up she did not speak she did not sing she did not even breathe we sank to our knees by her pleading in whispers or praying inside we kneeled there like two worshippers two penitents two healers and put out our hands as if that would do it just by touching we would bring her back to life but fannie lay there staring at the ceiling as if to say how curious what is the ceiling doing there and why dont i speak it was very simple and terrible fannie had fallen or been pushed and could not get up she had lain there in the middle of the night until her own weight crushed and smothered her it would not have taken much to keep her in position so she could not roll over you didnt have to use your hands on her around her neck nothing had to be forced you simply stood over her and made sure that she didnt roll to get leverage to gasp herself erect and you watched her for a minute two minutes until at last the sounds stopped and the eyes turned to glass oh fannie i groaned oh fannie i mourned what have you done to yourself there was the faintest whisper my head jerked i stared fannies crankup phonograph was still turning slowly slowly but it was still running which meant that just five minutes ago she had cranked it up put on a record and answered the door on darkness the phonograph turntable spun but there was no record under the needle tosca wasnt there i blinked and then there was a swift knocking sound constance was on her feet choking running she headed for the door leading out to the balcony overlooking the trashfilled empty lot with a view of bunker hill and the poolhall across the way where laughter came and went all night before i could stop her she was out the screen door and to the balcony rail constance no i yelled but she was out there only to be sick bending over and leaning down and letting it all come out as i much wanted to do i could only stand and watch and look from her to the great mountain where we foothills had stood a moment before at last constance stopped i turned for no reason i could imagine and went around fannie and across the room to open a small door a faint cold light played out over my face sweet christ cried constance in the door behind me whatre you doing fannie told me i said my mouth numb anything happened look in the icebox a cold tomb wind blew out around my cheeks so im looking there was nothing in the icebox of course or rather there was too much jellies jams varieties of mayonnaise salad dressing pickles hot peppers cheesecake rolls white bread butter cold cuts an arctic delicatessen the panorama of fannies flesh was there and how it had been planned and steadily built i stared and stared again trying to see what fannie wanted me to see oh christ i thought what am i looking for is the answer one of these i almost shoved in to hurl all the jams and jellies to the floor i had to stop my fist halfway in its not there or if it is i cant see it i gave a terrible death groan and slammed the door the phonograph with tosca gone gave up and quit someone call the police i thought someone constance was out on the balcony again me it was all over by three in the morning the police had come and everyone had been questioned and names taken and the whole tenement was awake as if someone had started a fire in the basement and when i came out the front of the tenement the morgue van was still parked there with the men trying to figure out how to get fannie out and down the stairs and away i hoped they wouldnt think of the piano box that fannie had joked about in the alley they never did but fannie had to stay in her room until dawn when they brought a bigger van and a larger carrier it was terrible leaving her up there alone in the night but the police wouldnt let me stay and after all it was a simple case of death from natural causes as i went down through the levels of the house the doors were beginning to close and the lights go out like those nights at the end of the war when the last conga line exhausted drained away into the rooms and down into the streets and there was the lonely walk for me up over bunker hill and down to the terminal where i would be taken home in thunders i found constance rattigan curled up in the back seat of her limousine lying quietly staring at nothing when she heard me open the back door she said get behind the wheel i climbed up front behind the steering wheel take me home she said quietly it took me a full moment of sitting there to say finally i cant why not i dont know how to drive i said what i never learned there was no reason anyway my tongue moved like lead between my lips since when can writers afford cars jesus constance managed to prop herself up and get out like someone with a hangover she got out and came around walking slowly and blindly and waved get over somehow she started the car this time we drove at about ten miles an hour as if there were a fog so you could only see ten feet ahead we made it as far as the ambassador hotel she turned in there and drove up just as the last of a saturday night party came out with balloons and funny hats the coconut grove was putting out its lights above us i saw some musicians hurrying away with their instruments everyone knew constance we signed in and had a bungalow on the side of the hotel in a few minutes we had no luggage but no one seemed to mind the bellboy who took us through the garden to our place kept looking at constance as if maybe he should carry her when we were in the room constance said would a fiftydollar tip find the key and unlock the gate to let us in the swimming pool around back it would go a long way toward finding the key the bellboy said but a swim this time of night its my hour said constance five minutes later the lights came on in the pool and i sat there and watched constance dive in and swim twenty laps on occasion swimming underwater from one end to the other without coming up for air when she came out ten minutes later she was gasping and redfaced and i cloaked her in a big towel and held her when do you start crying i said at last dummy she said i just did if you cant do it in the ocean a pools fine if you dont have a pool hit the shower you can scream and yell and sob all you want and it doesnt bother anyone the world never hears ever think of that i never thought said i in awe at four oclock in the morning constance found me in our bungalow bathroom standing and staring at the shower hit it she said gently go on give it a try i got in and turned the water on hard at eleven in the morning we motored through venice and looked at the canals with a thin layer of green slime on their surface and passed the halftorndown pier and looked at some gulls soaring in the fog up there and no sun yet and the surf so quiet it was like muffled black drums screw this said constance flip a nickel heads we go north to santa barbara tails south to tijuana i dont have a nickel i said christ constance grubbed in her purse and took out a quarter and tossed it in the air tails we were in laguna by noon no thanks to the highway patrol that somehow missed us we sat out in the open air on a cliff overlooking the beach at victor hugos and had double margaritas you ever see now voyager ten times i said this is where bette davis and paul henried sat having a love lunch early in the film this was the location back in the early forties youre sitting in the very chair where henried put his behind we were in san diego by three and outside the bullring in tijuana just at the hour of four think you can stand this asked constance i can only try i said we made it through the third bull and came out into the lateafternoon light and had two more margaritas and a good mexican dinner before we went north and drove out onto the island and sat in the sunset at the hotel del coronado we didnt say anything but just watched the sun go down lighting the old victorian towers and freshpainted white sidings of the hotel with pink color along the way home we swam in the surf at del mar wordless and from time to time hand in hand at midnight we were in front of crumleys jungle compound marry me said constance next time i live i said yeah well thats not bad tomorrow when she was gone i walked up the jungle path where have you been said crumley in the door uncle wiggily says go back three hops i said the skeezix and the pipsisewah say come in said crumley the something cold in my hand was a beer lord he said you look terrible come here he gave me a hug i didnt think a man like crumley ever hugged anyone not even a woman be careful i said im made out of glass i heard this morning friend of mind down in central im sorry kid i know she was a close friend you got that list with you we were out in the jungle with just the crickets sounding and segovia lost inside the house playing a lament for some day a long time past when the sun stayed up for fortyeight hours in seville i found my dumb list crumpled in my pocket and handed it over how come you want to see all of a sudden i dont know said crumley you made me curious he sat down and began to read old man in lion cage killed weapon unknown canariesforsale lady frightened pietro massinello in jail jimmy drowned in bathtub sam dead from alcohol given him by someone fannie with an addition made in the last few hours smothered other new and possible victims henry the blind man annie oakley the rifle lady a l shrank the fraudulent psychiatrist john wilkes hopwood constance rattigan mr shapeshade with an addition no cross him out myself crumley turned the list upside down and backward eyeing it rereading the names thats quite a menagerie you got there buster how come im not in your sideshow theres something broken about all those people you you got your own selfstarter just since i met you kid crumley stopped and turned red christ im getting soft how come you put yourself on the list im scared gutless sure but you got a selfstarter too and it works according to your logic that should protect you as for those others theyre so busy running away fast theyll run off cliffs crumley turned the list upside down again refusing to meet my gaze and read the names out loud i stopped him well well what he said its time i said hypnotize me crum elmo in the name of the sweet lord put me under jesus said crumley youve got to do it now tonight you owe it to me jesus okay okay sit down lie down do i turn out the lights god give me hard liquor i ran to fetch chairs and put them one behind the other this is the big train at night i said i sit here you sit behind i ran to the kitchen and brought crumley a slug of whiskey you got to smell like he smelled for this relief much thanks crumley belted it down and shut his eyes this is the dumbest damn thing i have ever done ever shut up and drink he finished a second one i sat then i remembered and jumped to put on crumleys african storm record it began to rain all through the house all around the big red train i turned down the lights there perfect shut your yap and shut your eyes said crumley god i dont know how to do this sh gently i said sh it is quiet okay kid go to sleep i listened closely and carefully easy does it drawled crumley behind me on the train in the night in the rain serenity quiet lazy easy around the curves softly through the rain quietly he was getting into the rhythm of it and i could tell from his voice beginning to enjoy easy slow quiet long after midnight rain soft rain whispered crumley where are you kid asleep i said drowsily asleep and traveling traveling and asleep he murmured are you on the train kid train i murmured train rain night thats it stay there move on the straightaway through culver city past the studios late no one on the train but you andsomeone someone i whispered someone whos been drinking drinking i mourned swaying swaying talking talking muttering whispering you hear him son hear talk murmur mutter talk i said quietly and the train moved down the night through dark storm and i was there a good subject well transported and asleep but hearing waiting swaying eyes shut head down hands numb on my knees you hear his voice son hear smell his breath smell raining harder now rain dark dark youre underwater on the train theres so much rain and someone swaying behind you behind you moaning speaking whispering yesssss can you hear what he says almost deeper slower going moving swaying hear his voice yes whats he say he says whats he say he deeper sleeping listen his breath fanned my neck warm with alcohol what what he says the train screamed around an iron bend in my head sparks flew there was a clap of thunder gah i shrieked and gah and a final gah i writhed in my chair in my panic to escape that maniac breath the flaming alcohol beast and something else i had forgotten but it was back now and it blasted my face my brow my nose a smell of opened graves abattoirs raw meat left too long in the sun eyes slammed tight i began to retch kid christ wake up god kid kid yelled crumley shaking me slapping my face massaging my neck now down on his knees yanking at my head and cheeks and arms not knowing where to grab or shake me now kid now for christs sake now gah i shrieked and flailed a final time and floundered straight up staring about falling into the grave with the terrible meat as the train ran over me and the rain showered into the tomb with crumley slapping me and a great gout of sour food jetting from my mouth crumley stood me outside in the garden air made sure i was breathing right cleaned me up then went inside to mop up and came back jesus he said it worked we got more than we wanted yes yes i said weakly i heard his voice and he said just what i thought he would say the title i put on your book but i heard his voice clearly and i almost know him now next time i meet him wherever it is ill know were close crum were close he wont escape now but now ill know him an even better way how he smells like a corpse i didnt notice that night or if i did i was so nervous i forgot but now its back hes dead or next to dead dogs killed in the street smell like him his shirt his pants his coat are moldy and old his flesh is worse so i wandered into the house and found myself at crumleys desk at last i have a new title for my own book i said i typed crumley watched the words came out on the paper we both read them downwind from death thats some title he said and went to shut off the sound of the dark rain there was a graveside service for fannie florianna the next afternoon crumley took an hour off and drove me over to the nice oldfashioned graveyard on a hill with a view of the santa monica mountains i was astonished to see the line of cars outside the place and more astonished to see the queue of flowers being carried in to be placed by the open grave there must have been two hundred people there and a few thousand flowers criminently said crumley look at the mob see who that is over there and just beyond king vidor vidor sure and thats salka viertel she wrote films for garbo a long time back and that other chap is mr fox louis b mayers lawyer and that one there is ben goetz who headed up mgms unit in london and why didnt you tell me your friend fannie knew so many big people why didnt fannie tell me i said fannie dear fan i thought how like you never to tell never to brag that so many of these came up and down the tenement stairs over the years for a chat and a remembrance and a song lord fannie why didnt you let me in on it i would have liked to have known i wouldnt have told anyone i looked at all the faces gathered near the flowers crumley did likewise think hes here kid he said quietly who the one you claim did this to fannie ill know him when i see him no ill know him when i hear him and then what said crumley have him arrested for being drunk on a train a couple of nights ago i must have shown a terrible frustration in my face just trying to ruin your day said crumley friends someone said and the crowd grew very quiet it was the best kind of graveside service if there is such a thing nobody asked me to speak why would they do that but a dozen others took a minute or three minutes and said things about chicago in or culver city in the midtwenties when there were meadows and fields and the false civilization of mgm was abuilding and ten or twelve nights a year the big red car pulled up on a siding behind the studio and louis b mayer and ben goetz and all the others piled on and played poker training out to san bernardino where they went to the movie house to see the latest gilbert or garbo or novarro and come home with fistfuls of preview cards lousy great terrible fine and sort out the cards along with the kings and queens and jacks and spades to figure out just what in hell kind of hand they had and pull in behind the studio at midnight still playing cards and get off smelling of prohibition whiskey with happy smiles or grim smiles of determination on their faces to watch louis b toddle to his limousine and go first home they were all there and they all spoke with great honesty and clarity there were no lies a true grief lay just beneath every word that was said in the midst of the hot afternoon someone touched my elbow i turned and was surprised henry howd you get here i sure didnt walk howd you find me in all this mob i whispered youre the only ivory soap the rest is chanel and old spice im sure glad im blind on a day like this dont mind listening but i surely do not want to see this the tributes continued mr fox louis b mayers lawyer was next a man who knew law but who rarely went to see any of the films they made right now he remembered early days in chicago when fannie a hummingbird darted among the bright colors a dragonfly hummed by soon after armpits said henry quietly startled i waited and whispered armpits on the street outside the tenement whispered henry staring at a sky he could not see speaking from the corner of his mouth inside the halls by my room by fannies room the smell him the one a pause a nod armpits my nose twitched my eyes began to run i stirred my feet wanting to get away go see find when was this henry i whispered the other night night fannie went away forever sh said someone nearby henry shut up when there was a change of speakers i whispered where crossing the street early on said henry that night powerful real powerful smell then later seemed to me the armpits came into the hall behind me i mean it was so strong it cleared my sinuses like having a grizzly bear breathe on you you ever smell that i froze halfacross the street like i been hit with a baseball bat thought anyone smells like thats got a grudge against god dogs mankind the world step on a cat rather than walk around badass mean armpits like i said armpits that help you any my whole body was frozen i could only nod henry said that smells been around the halls some few nights now but just got stronger is all maybe because that dumb sonofabitch was getting closer i was tripped up by mr smell i know that now i got it figured sh said someone an actor spoke and a priest and a rabbi and then the hall johnson choir from the first baptist church on central avenue filed through the tombstones and gathered to sing great day in the morning in the sweet bye and bye and dear god joy me when im gone and their voices were the voices i had heard in the late thirties chanting ronald colman over the snow peaks and down into shangrila or standing on white clouds in the fields of the lord in green pastures by the end of their radiant singing i was overflowed and joyed and death had had a new coat of sunlight and time and the hummingbird came back for nectar and the dragonfly sank down to scan my face and go away that said crumley on the way out of the graveyard with henry walking between us is the way i want to be sung out of the world god id love to be that whole damn choir who needs money when you can sing like that but i was staring at henry he felt my stare thing is said henry he keeps coming back armpits youd think hed had enough sure but hes hungrymean cant stop scaring people is like cracker jack to him hurts his byword pain is a living he figures to get old henry like he got the rest but i wont fall again crumley was listening with some seriousness if armpits comes again ill call you immediamente hes fiddling around the rooms caught him fiddling fannies locked door its padlocked and pasted over by the law right he was fiddling it and i yelled him off hes a coward for sure got no weapons just goes around putting his foot out so blind men take a whole flight of steps in one jump armpits i yelled scat call us said crumley can we give you a lift some of the ugly ladies from the tenement brought me thanks and will take me home henry i said i put out my hand he took it swiftly it was almost as if he had seen it coming how do i smell henry i said henry sniffed and laughed they dont make heroes like they used to but youll do driving back toward the beach with crumley i saw a big limousine pass us at seventy miles an hour putting a lot of space between it and the flowered graveyard i waved and yelled constance rattigan did not even glance over she had been at the graveside somewhere hidden away to one side and now she was roaring home angry at fannie for leaving us all and maybe angry with me for somehow bringing death to present a bill her limousine vanished in a great whitegray cloud of exhaust the harpies and the furies just screamed by observed crumley no i said only a lost lady running to hide i tried calling constance rattigan during the next three days but she wouldnt answer she was brooding and mad somehow in some dumb way i was in cahoots with the man who stood in halls and did terrible things to people i tried calling mexico city but peg was off lost forever i was sure i prowled around venice staring and listening and sniffing hoping for that dreadful voice searching for the terrible smell of something dying or long dead even crumley was gone i stared but he was nowhere up ahead following at the end of three days of failed phone calls unmet killers furious with fate and confounded by funerals i did what i had never done before around ten oclock at night i strode down the empty pier not knowing where i was going until i got there hey someone said i yanked a rifle up off the shelf and without checking to see if it was loaded or if anyone was in the way i fired it fired it fired it sixteen times wham wham and wham wham and wham wham and someone was yelling i didnt hit any of the targets i had never handled a rifle in my life i dont know what i was shooting at but yes i did take that you sonofabitch take that you bastard wham wham and wham wham the rifle was empty but i kept yanking the trigger i suddenly knew it was impotent someone took the rifle away from me annie oakley staring at me as if she had never seen me before you know what youre doing she asked no and i dont give a damn i glanced around how come youre open so late nothing else to do i cant sleep whats wrong with you mister everybody in the whole damn world is going to be dead by this time next week you dont believe that no but it feels like it give me another rifle you dont want to shoot any more yes i do and i havent money to pay youll have to trust me i cried she stared at me for a long time then she handed me a rifle sock em cowboy kill em bogie she said i fired sixteen times this time i hit two targets by mistake even though i couldnt see them my glasses were that fogged had enough asked annie oakley quietly behind me no i shouted then i said lower yes what are you doing outside the gallery on the boardwalk i was afraid id get shot in there some maniac just unloaded two rifles without aiming we looked at each other and i began to laugh she listened and said are you laughing or crying whats it sound like i got to do something tell me what she studied my face for a long time and then she went around shutting off the running ducks and the bobbing clowns and the lights a door opened in the back of the gallery she was silhouetted there she said if youve got to shoot at anything heres the target and she was gone it was a full half minute before i realized she expected me to follow do you behave this way often asked annie oakley sorry i said i was on one far side of her bed she on the other listening to me talk about mexico city and peg and peg and mexico city so far away it was a dreadful ache the story of my life said annie oakley is men in bed with me bored silly or talking about other women or lighting cigarettes or rushing off in their cars when i go to the bathroom you know what my real name is lucretia isabel clarisse annabelle maria monica brown my mom gave me all those so what do i choose annie oakley problem is im dumb men cant stand me after the first ten minutes dumb read a book an hour later its gone nothing

youre lying and that damn foghorn blowing out in the bay does it get to you some nights even with a jerk of a cluck in bed with me when that foghorn goes off i feel so alone and there he is checking his keys looking at the door her telephone rang she grabbed it listened said ill be damned she waved it at me for you impossible i said no one knows im here i took the phone what are you doing at her place said constance rattigan nothing how did you find me someone called just a voice told me to check on you and hung up oh my god i was turning cold get out of there said constance i need your help your strange friend has come to visit my friend the ocean roared under the rifle gallery shuddering the room and the bed down by the shore two nights in a row youve got to come scare him off oh god constance there was a long silence in which i could hear the surf outside constance rattigans windows then she said in a strange numb way hes there now dont let him see you the bastard is down on the shoreline just where he was last night he just stares up at the house like hes waiting for me the bastards naked what does he think the old lady is so crazy shell run out and jump him christ shut the windows constance turn off the lights no hes backing off maybe my voice carries maybe he thinks im calling the police call them gone constance took a deep breath get over here kid fast she didnt hang up she just let the phone drop and walked off i could hear her sandals slapping the tiled floor making typewriter sounds i didnt hang up either for some reason i just put the phone down as if it were an umbilical cord between me and constance rattigan as long as i didnt disconnect she couldnt die i could still hear the night tide moving on her end of the line just like all the other men there you go said a voice i turned annie oakley sat up in bed huddled in her sheets like an abandoned manatee dont hang up that telephone i said not until i reach the far end i thought and save a life dumb said annie oakley thats why youre going dumb it took a lot of guts to run the night shore toward constance rattigans i imagined some terrible dead man rushing the other way jesus i gasped what happens if i meet him gah i shrieked and ran fulltilt into a solid shadow thank god its you someone yelled no constance i said thank god its you whats so damn funny this i slapped the big bright pillows on all sides of me this is the second bed ive been in tonight hilarious said constance mind if i bust your nose constance pegs my girl i was just lonely you havent called in days annie asked me for pillow talk and thats all it was i cant lie it shows in my face look constance looked and laughed christ fresh apple pie okay okay she sank back i scare the hell out of you just now you shouldve yelled ahead as you ran i was glad to see you son sorry i havent phoned once i forgot funerals in a few hours now it takes days she touched a switch the lights dimmed and the sixteenmillimeter projector flashed on two cowboys knocked each other down on the white wall how can you watch films at a time like this i said to rev me up so i can go out and knock mr nakeds block off if he shows again tomorrow night dont even joke about it i looked out the french windows at the empty shore where only white waves sounded on the edge of night do you think he telephoned you to tell you where i was with annie and then walked up the beach to stand out there no his voice wasnt right its got to be two different guys christ i cant figure it but the one guy the one with no clothes hes got to be some sort of exhibitionist a flasher right or why doesnt he just run up in here and ruin the old lady or kill her or both its the other one the guy on the phone that gives me the willies i know i thought ive heard his breathing he sounds like a real monster said constance yes i thought a long way off i heard the big red trolley shriek around an iron curve in the rain with the voice behind me chanting the words of a title for crumleys book constance i said and stopped i was going to tell her i had seen the stranger on the shore many nights ago ive got some real estate south of here said constance im going to go check it tomorrow call me late yes and meantime you want to look into something for me anything well almost anything constance watched william farnum knock his brother dustin down pick him up knock him down again i think i know who mr naked on the shore is who she searched down along the surf as if his ghost was still there a sonofabitch from my past with a head like a mean german general she said and a body like all the boys of summer who ever lived the small motorbike pulled up outside the carousel building with a young man in swimshorts astride his body bronzed and oiled and beautiful he was wearing a heavy helmet with a dark visor down over his face to his chin so i couldnt see his face but the body was the most amazing i think i have ever seen it made me think of a day years before when i had seen a beautiful apollo walking along the shore with a surf of young boys walking after him drawn for they knew not what reasons but they walked in beauty with him loving but not knowing it was love never daring to name and trying not to think of this moment later in life there are beauties like that in this world and all men and all women and all children are pulled in their wake and it is all pure and wondrous and clean and there is no residue of guilt because nothing happened you just saw and followed and when the time on the shore was over he went away and you went off smiling the kind of smile that is such a surprise you put your hand up an hour later and find it still attached on a whole beach in an entire summer you only see bodies like that on some young man or some young woman once twice if the gods are snoozing and not jealous here was apollo astride the motorbike gazing through his dark featureless visor at me you come to see the old man the laugh behind the glass was rich and throaty good come on he propped the bike and was in and up the stairs ahead of me like a gazelle he took the steps three at a time and vanished into an upstairs room i followed one step at a time feeling old when i got to his room i heard the shower running a moment later he came out stripped and glistening with water the helmet still over his head he stood in the bathroom door looking into me as he might into a mirror and liking what he saw well he said inside his helmet how do you like the most beautiful boy the young man that i love i blushed furiously he laughed and shucked off his helmet my god i said it really is you the old man said john wilkes hopwood he glanced down at his body and smiled or the young which of us do you prefer i swallowed hard i had to force myself to speak quickly for i wanted to run back down the stairs before he closed and locked me in the room that all depends i said on which one of you has been standing on the beach late nights outside constance rattigans home with wondrous timing the calliope downstairs in the rotunda started up running the carousel it sounded like a dragon that had swallowed a corps of bagpipers and was now trying to throw them back up in no particular order to no particular tune like a cat that wants time to consider its next move oldyoung hopwood turned his tanned backside toward me a signal that was supposed to fascinate i shut my eyes to the golden sight that gave hopwood a moment to decide what he wanted to say what makes you think i would bother with an old horse like constance rattigan he said as he reached into the bathroom and dragged out a towel which he now used to swab his shoulders and chest you were the great love of her life she was yours that was the summer all america loved the lovers yes he turned to check on how much irony might show in my face to match my voice have you come here because she sent you to warn me off perhaps how many pushups can you do can you do sixty laps of a pool or bike forty miles in a day without sweating what weights can you lift and how many people i noticed he did not say women can you bed in one afternoon he asked no no no no and maybe two i said to answer all those questions then said helmut the hun turning to show me antinous magnificent facade something to match the golden hind you are in no position to threaten me ja his mouth was a razor slit from which bursts of bright shark teeth hissed and chewed i will come and go on the beach he said with the gestapo ahead and the summer boys soon after i thought i admit nothing perhaps i was there some nights he nodded up the coast perhaps not you could have cut your wrists with his smile he hurled the towel at me i caught it get my back for me will you i hurled the towel away it fell and hung over his head masking his face the horrible hun was for a moment gone only sun king apollo his rump as bright as the apples of the gods remained from under the towel his voice said quietly the interview is over did it ever really begin i said i went downstairs as the dragons sick calliope music was coming up there were no words at all on the venice cinema marquee all the letters were gone i read the emptiness half a dozen times feeling something roll over and die in my chest i went around trying all the doors which were locked and looked into the box office which was deserted and glanced at the big poster frames where barrymore and chancy and norma shearer had smiled just a few nights ago now nothing i backed off and read the emptiness a last time to myself quietly how do you like the double bill asked a voice from behind me i turned mr shapeshade was there beaming he handed over a big roll of theater posters i knew what it was my diplomas from nosferatu institute graduate school of quasimodo postgraduate in dartagnan and robin hood mr shapeshade you cant give these to me youre a romantic sap arent you sure but take take farewell goodbye but another farewell goodbye out beyond kummensei pier oudt he left the diplomas in my hands and trotted off i found him at the end of the pier pointing down and watching my face to see me crumple and seize the pier rail staring over the rifles were down there silent for the first time in years they lay on the sea bottom about fifteen feet under but the water was clear because the sun was coming out i counted maybe a dozen long cold blue metal weapons down there where the fish swam by some farewell huh shapeshade glanced where i was looking one by one one by one early this morning i came running up yelled whatre you doing what does it look like she said and one by one over and down theyre closing your place theyre closing mine this afternoon so what the hell she said and one by one she didnt i said and stopped i searched the waters under the pier and far out she didnt was she the last one in no no just stood here a long time with me watching the ocean they wont be here long she said week from now gone a bunch of stupid guys will dive and bring them up yes what could i say yes she leave any word when she went i could not take my eyes off the long rifles that shone in the flowing tide said she was going somewhere to milk cows but no bulls she said no bulls milk cows and churn butter was the last thing i heard i hope she will i said the rifles suddenly swarmed with fish who seemed to have come to see but there were no sounds of firing their silence said shapeshade is nice eh i nodded dont forget these said shapeshade they had fallen out of my hands he picked up and handed me my diplomas for all the years of my young life running up and down popcorn aisles in the dark with the phantom and the hunchback on the way back i passed a little boy who stood staring down at the remains of the rollercoaster lying like strewn bones on the shore whats that dinosaur doing lying there dead on the beach he said i had thought of it first i resented this boy who saw the collapsed rollercoaster as i saw it a beast dead in the tides no i wanted to yell at him but aloud i said gently oh lord son i wish i knew i turned and staggered away carrying an armload of invisible rifles down the pier i had two dreams that night in the first a l shranks sigmund freud schopenhauer tarot card shop was knocked to flinders by the great hungry steamshovel so off in the tide floated the marquis de sade and thomas de quincey and mark twains sick daughters and sartre on a truly bad day drowning in the dark waters over the shine of the shooting gallery rifles the second dream was a newsreel i had seen of the russian royal family lined up by their graves and shot so that they jerked and jumped like a silent film projection knocked blown away end over end like popped corks into the pit it made you gasp with horrid laughter inhuman hilarious bam there went sam jimmy pietro canary lady fannie cal old lioncage man constance shrank crumley peg and me bam i slammed awake sweating ice the telephone across the street in the gas station was ringing it stopped i held my breath it rang again once and stopped i waited it rang again once and stopped oh god i thought peg wouldnt do that crumley wouldnt do that ring once and stop the phone rang again once then silence its him mr lonely death calling to tell me things i dont want to know i sat up the hairs on my body fuzzed as if cal had run his bumblebee electric barber shears down my neck to strike a nerve i dressed and ran out to the shoreline i took a deep breath then stared south far away down the coast all of the windows in constance rattigans moorish fort were brightly lit constance i thought fannie wont like this fannie and then i really ran i came in from the surf like death himself every light in constances place was burning and every door stood wide open as if she had opened them all to let nature and the world and night and the wind in to clean her place while she was gone and she was gone i knew without even going in her place because there was a long line of her footprints coming down to the tideline where i stopped and looked to see where they went in the water but never came out i wasnt surprised i was surprised that i wasnt surprised i walked up to her wideopen front door and didnt call or almost called for her chauffeur and laughed to think i might have been so foolish and went in without touching anything the phonograph was playing in the arabian parlor dance music by ray noble from london in some noel coward tunes i let the music play the projector was on mindlessly whirling its reel the film done the white light of the bulb staring at the blank front wall i didnt think to turn it off a bottle of moet et chandon stood iced and waiting as if she had gone down to the sea expecting to bring some golden god of the deep back with her cheeses were laid out on a plate on a pillow along with a shaker of martinis getting watery the duesenberg was in the garage and the footprints still lay in the sand going only one way i telephoned crumley and congratulated myself on not crying just yet feeling numb crumley i said into the telephone crumley crum i said child of the night he said you bet on another wrong horse again i told him where i was i cant walk very well i sat down suddenly clenching the phone come get me crumley met me on the shore we stood looking up at that arabian fort all brightly lit like a festive tent in the middle of a desert of sand the door opening out on the shore was still wide and the music was playing inside a stack of records that seemed never to want to stop dropping it was lilac time then it was diane then it was aint she sweet followed by hear my song of the nile and then pagan love song i expected ramon novarro to show up at any moment run in and come out wild haired and mad of eye rushing down to the shore but theres just me and crumley unh i didnt know i was thinking out loud i apologized we trudged up the shore you touch anything only the phone when we reached the door i let him go in and prowl through the house and come out wheres the chauffeur thats something else i never told you there never was one what i told him about constance rattigan and her role playing she was her own allstar cast huh jesus louder and funnier as they say we went back out to stand on the windblown porch to look at the footprints that were beginning to blow away could be suicide said crumley constance wouldnt do that christ youre so godawful sure about people why dont you grow up just because you like someone doesnt mean they cant take the big jump without you there was someone on the shore waiting for her proof we followed constances single line of prints down to the surf he was standing over there i pointed two nights i saw him swell ankle deep in water so no prints for the killer what else you want to show me son someone called me an hour ago woke me up told me to come along the beach that someone knew her house was empty or soon going to be phone call huh swell again now youre ankle deep in water and no prints that the whole story my cheeks must have reddened he saw that i had been telling a halftruth i didnt want to admit i hadnt answered the phone the last time but ran down the beach on a terrible hunch at least you got integrity scribe crumley looked at the white waves combing in then at the footprints then at the house white cold and empty in the middle of the night you know what integrity means based on the word integers numbers integrity means to add up has nothing to do with virtue hitler had integrity zero plus zero plus zero makes zero no score phone calls and footprints underwater and blind hunches and dopey faith these latenight shootings are beginning to tell on me that about do it no damn it ive got a real live suspect constance recognized him i did too went to see him find out where he was tonight you got the killer you i lost control of my voice i had to take my glasses off and wipe the tiny wet saltmarks off so i could see crumley patted my cheek and said hey dont how do you know this guy whoever he is didnt take her in the water and drown her swim with her talk nice and they swam north one hundred yards and walked back to his place for all you know shell be dragging home at dawn with a funny smile on her face no i said what am i spoiling the mysterious romance of all this for you no but he could tell i was uncertain he touched my elbow what else havent you said constance mentioned she had some real estate not far from here down the coast you sure she didnt just go there tonight if what you says true what if she got spooked pulled up stakes her limousines still here people walk you know you do it all the time lady could walk a mile south spooked in an inch of water and us no wiser i looked south to see if i could see a beautiful lady escaped along the strand thing is said crumley we got nothing to go on empty house old records playing no suicide note no sign of violence we got to wait for her to come back and if she doesnt theres still no case no corpus delicti i bet you a bucket of beer shell let me take you to the upstairs apartment at the carousel tomorrow when you see that strange mans face god do you mean who i think you mean i nodded the airyfairy said crumley the fag there was a tremendous flop in the water just then we both jumped jesus what was that cried crumley peering out over the midnight waters constance i thought coming back i stared and at last said seals they do come and play out there there was a series of small flops and splashes which faded as some sea creature departed in darkness hell said crumley the projectors still running there in the parlor i said phonographs still playing ovens on in the kitchen something baking and all the lights in all the rooms lets shut some off before the damn place burns down we followed constance rattigans footprints back up to her fortress of white light hey whispered crumley he stared at the eastern horizon whats that there was a faint band of cold light there dawn i said i thought it would never come constance rattigans footprints blew away off the sand in the dawn wind and mr shapeshade came along the shore looking back over his shoulder cans of film under his arms far off there at this very moment his movie house was being trashed by huge steeltoothed monsters that had risen summoned by real estate speculators out of the sea when shapeshade saw me and crumley standing on constance rattigans front porch he blinked at our faces and then at the sand and then at the ocean we didnt have to tell him anything our faces were that pale shell be back he said again and again shell be back constance wouldnt go away my god who would i run films with who shell be back sure his eyes spilled over we left him in charge of the empty fort and drove back toward my place on the way detective lieutenant crumley in a burst of invective using harsh epithets like cowchappatis bull durham bushwah and watchoutyoullstepinit refused my offer to go ride on that damn carousel questioning field marshal erwin rommel or his pretty pal dressed up in rose petals nijinsky in one or two days maybe if that goony old woman doesnt swim back from catalina sure then i start asking questions but now i will not shovel horseflops to find the horse are you angry with me i asked angry angry why would i be angry angry christ you drive me out of my skull but angry heres a buck go buy ten rides on that calliope racetrack he dropped me running at my door and roared off inside i looked at cals old piano the sheet had fallen off the big white ivory teeth dont laugh i said three things happened that afternoon two were fine one was terrible a letter arrived from mexico in it was a photo of peg she had colored her eyes with a blend of brown and green ink to help me remember what they looked like then there was a postcard from cal postmarked gila bend son it said you keeping my piano tuned im torturing folks parttime in the local beer joint this town is full of bald men me being here they dont know how lucky they are cut the sheriffs hair yesterday he gave me twentyfour hours to leave town will gas up for sedalia tomorrow be happy yours cal i turned the card over there was a photo of a gila monster with black and white patterns on its back cal had drawn a bad portrait of himself seated there as if the creature were a musical instrument and him playing only the dark keys i laughed and walked north toward the santa monica pier wondering what i might say to that odd man who lived a double life above the moaning carousel field marshal rommel i shouted how and why did you set out to kill constance rattigan but no one was there to hear the carousel ran in silence the calliope was turned on but the music was at the end of its roll and the slots flapped around and around the carousel owner was not dead in his ticket booth only dead drunk he was awake but seemed not to hear the silence or know that the horses were galloping to the slap of the swiss cheese roll in the mouth of the big machine i surveyed it all with disquiet and was about to trudge upstairs when i noticed a fineblowing litter on the floor of the circling horse race i waited for the carousel to turn twice more then grabbed a brass pole and hopped on moving drunkenly among the poles pieces of torn paper blew in the wind made by the horses jumping up and down and the passage of the carousel itself going nowhere i found a thumbtack on the circular floor under the ripped paper someone had perhaps tacked the message to the forelock of one of the wooden horses someone had found it read it torn it run away john wilkes hopwood i spent a good three minutes picking up the pieces feeling as hopeless as the carousels journey then hopped off and tried piecing it together it took another fifteen minutes of finding a terrible word here an awful word there and a damning word further on but finally there was a death and a doom anyone reading this anyone that is with the wrong old skeleton hung inside his young bright flesh might wither at these strikes to the groin i could not put it all together there were missing pieces but the essence was that the reader was an old man ugly man truly ugly he made love to that body because with that face who would want him nobody for years it recalled how the studios threw him out in attacked the fake kraut voice and broken wrists and strange boyfriends and old sick women in bars late at night they say your name and laugh at you when you go away full of cheap gin and now you have caused death i saw you on the beach last night when she swam out and did not come back people will say murder goodnight sweet prince that was it a dreadful weapon posted and found i gathered the pieces and went upstairs about ninety years older than i had been a few days before the door to hopwoods room whispered open under my hand there were clothes all over the place on the floor and by several suitcases as if he had tried to pack panicked and gone off traveling light i looked out the apartment window down on the pier his bike was still padlocked against a lamppost but his motorbike was gone proving nothing he might have driven rather than walked into the sea christ i thought what if he catches up with annie oakley and then the two of them catch up with cal i dumped a small wastebasket out on a flimsy desk by his bed and found some torn bits of fine bright yellow beverly hillstype stationery with cr for constance rattigan along the top there was typewriting on the paper midnights wait six nights running on the shoreline maybe just maybe like old times and the typed initials cr the typeface looked like the machine i had seen open on a desk in her arabian parlor i touched the fragments thinking had constance written hopwood no she would have told me someone else must have sent this to hopwood a week ago and he had jogged up the shore like a stallion to wait in the surf for constance to come laughing down had he gotten tired of waiting and dragged her in the water and drowned her no no he must have seen her dive in and never come out scared he ran home to find what the last note the one with the terrible words and awful degradations that shot him below the belt so he had two reasons to leave town fright and the insults i glanced at the telephone and sighed no use calling crumley no corpus delicti just torn paper which i shoved in my jacket pockets they felt like mothwings fragile but poisonous melt all the guns i thought break the knives burn the guillotines and the malicious will still write letters that kill i saw a small bottle of cologne near the phone and took it remembering blind henry and his memory and his nose downstairs the carousel still turned in silence the horses still leaped over invisible barriers toward finish lines that never arrived i glanced at the drunken ticketman in his coffin booth shivered and to absolutely no music whatsoever got the hell out of there the miracle came just after lunch a specialdelivery letter arrived from the american mercury offering to buy a short story if i wouldnt mind their sending a check for three hundred dollars mind i shrieked mind good grief they must be nuts i stuck my head out into the empty street and yelled at the houses the sky and the shore i just sold to the american mercury three hundred bucks im rich i lurched over to shove the mercury letter under the bright glass eyes in the small shop window look i cried how about that see rich i muttered and gasped as i ran to the liquor store to flap the letter in the owners face look i waved it around in the venice train ticket office hey i jolted to a halt for i discovered i had jumped into the bank thinking i had the actual check with me and was about to deposit the damn letter rich i blushed and backed off at my apartment i suddenly remembered the nightmare that dire beast rising to seize and eat me idiot fool you shouted good rice when it should have been bad that night for the first night in a long while the small rainstorm did not drench my doormat there was no visitor no seaweed on my sidewalk at dawn somehow my truth my blundering yells had scared it away curiouser i thought and curiouser there was nobody and so no funeral the next day just a memorial service for constance rattigan that seemed to have been organized by a rat pack of autograph and filmphoto fans so there was a mob of milling extras stomping the sand out front of constance rattigans arabian fort on the shore i stood a long way off from the stampede and watched some aging lifeguards sweat a portable organ across the sands to where someone had forgotten the stool so the lady who played it badly played it standing up beads of salt on her brow bobbing her head to conduct the lugubrious choir as the gulls flew down to investigate a scene without food so they flew away and a fake minister barked and yipped like a poodle and the sandpipers rushed away frightened as the sandcrabs dug deeper to hide and i gritted my teeth halfway between outrage and demon laughter as one by one the various grotesques come down off the night screen at mr shapeshades or out from under the midnight piers staggered down to the surf and hurled withered flower garlands at the tide damn it constance i thought swim in now stop this damn freakshow but my magic thinking failed the only thing that came in was the wreaths upchucked by a tide that didnt want them a few people tried to throw them back again but the damn things simply returned and it began to rain there was a frantic search for newspapers to protect their heads and the lifeguards grunted the damn organ back across the sand and i was left alone in the rain with a newspaper draped over my skull and the headlines upside down over my eyes famed silent star vanishes i went down to kick the floral wreaths into the surf this time they stayed stripped down to my swimsuit i grabbed an armload of flowers and swam out as far as i could before i let go coming back i almost drowned when my feet caught tangled in one of the wreaths crumley i whispered and did not know if his name on my lips was a curse or a prayer crumley opened his door his face was bright and shining but not with beer something else had happened hey cried the detective where you been i been calling and calling you christ come see what the old mans got he ran ahead to his workroom and pointed dramatically at his desk where a pile of manuscript half an inch high lay filled with words why you old sob i said and whistled thats me s o b crumley crumley s o b boy howdy he ripped a page out of the typewriter wanta read i dont have to i laughed its good right git outa the way he laughed back the dam has broke i sat down snorting with happiness at the sun in his face when did all this happen two nights ago midnight one two i dunno i was just lying here with my teeth in my mouth staring at the ceiling not reading a book not listening to any radio not drinking beer and the wind blew outside and the trees shook and all of a sudden the damn ideas seethed like maggots on a hotplate and i just got the hell up and walked over and sat down and next thing i know im typing and typing like hell and cant stop and by dawn theres a big mountain or molehill of stuff and im laughing and crying all the time lookit that and come six in the morning i go to bed and just lie there looking at all this paper and i laugh and laugh and im as happy as if i just had a brandnew love affair with the greatest lady in the world you had i said softly funny thing is said crumley what started it maybe the wind outside the house somebody leaving seaweed calling cards on the porch but did the old detective rush out firing guns yelling freeze hell no no yells no shots just me banging my typewriter making lots of noise like on new years or halloween and you know what happened next guess my body was cold a whole population of frosted bumps had come up on my neck the wind went away i said the footsteps outside your house stopped what said crumley amazed and theres been no seaweed ever again and he whoever he was has not come back since howd you know that gasped crumley i just did is all you did the right thing without knowing just like me i shouted and he went away from me too oh god god i told crumley about my sale to the mercury my running around town like a fool my yelling to the sky and the rain not raining on my threeoclockinthemorning door any more maybe forever crumley sat down as if i had handed him an anvil were getting close elmo i said weve scared him off without meaning to the further away he gets the more we know about him well maybe anyway at least we know hes put off by loud fools and laughing detectives doing maniac things to typewriters at five in the morning keep typing crumley then youll be safe horseradish said crumley but he laughed when he said it his smile made me brave i dug in my pockets and brought out the poisonpen letter that had scared hopwood plus the warm loveletter on sunyellow paper that had lured him down the coast in the first place crumley toyed with the bits and pieces and sank halfway back into his old bathrobe of cynicism each typed on a different typewriter neither signed hell anyone could have typed both and if old hopwood was the sex freak we took him for he read that one on yellow paper and really believed rattigan wrote it hell he raced up the shore and waited like a good boy for her to come down and grab his behind but you know and i know rattigan never wrote a note like that in her life she had an ego like a tenton truck she never begged in the big hollywood houses on the streets or on the shore so what does that leave us with she swam at strange hours id run along the beach my workout and see that night after night anyone even me could have snuck in while she was two hundred yards out in the bay playing with the sharks anyone could have sat in her parlor used her typewriter and stationery and snuck back out mailed this foreplay sexnote to that hopwood sonofabitch and waited for the fireworks and i said and said crumley maybe the whole thing backfired rattigan bugged by the flasher panicked swam out to escape him got caught in a riptide then hopwood on the shore watching waiting turned chicken when she didnt swim back in and fled the next day he gets the second note the real doomsday attack he knows someone saw him on the beach and can finger him as rattigans socalled killer so hes left town already i said it figures which leaves us still ten miles up from tampico in cleopatras barge with no paddles what in hell do we have to go on a guy who makes phone calls and steals scott joplins head off cal the barbers old photo and scares cal out of town check a guy who stands in halls and gets an old man drunk and stuffs him in a lion cage and maybe saves some ticketpunch confetti stolen from the old mans pockets check a guy who scares the old canary lady to death and steals the newspaper headlines from the bottom of her birdcages and after fannie stops breathing the same guy steals her record of tosca as a keepsake and then he writes letters to old actor hopwood and frightens him away forever probably stole something from hopwoods apartment too but well never know and if you checked probably swiped a bottle of champagne from constance rattigans wine racks just before i got there the other night the guy cant stop himself hes a real collector crumleys telephone rang he picked it up listened handed it to me armpits said a mellow voice henry crumley put his ear to the receiver with me armpits is back messing around hour two hours ago said henry off in that other country the tenement far across los angeles in a rapidly dying past someone got to stop him who henry hung up armpits i took hopwoods springtime cologne out of my pocket and placed it on crumleys desk nope said crumley whoever that bad ass is in the tenement aint hopwood the old actor always smelled like a bed of marigolds and an acre of stardust you want me to go sniff around your friend henrys door no i said by the time you got there mr armpitsd be back out here waiting to snuffle around your door or mine not if we type and shout shout and type you forget that hey what was it you shouted i told crumley more about my american mercury story sale and the billion dollars that came with it jesus said crumley i feel like a pa whose boy has just made it through harvard tell me again kid how do you do it what should i do throw up in your typewriter every morning yeah clean up every noon yeah the foghorn out in the bay started blowing saying over and over in a long gray voice constance rattigan would never come back crumley started typing and i drank my beer that night at ten minutes after one someone came and stood outside my door oh jesus i thought awake please not again there was a fierce bang and a hard bang and then a terrible bang on my door someone out there was asking to get in god coward i thought get it over with now at last i jumped up to fling the door wide you look great in those lousy torn jockey shorts said constance rattigan i grabbed and yelled constance who in hell would it be butbut i went to your funeral so did i hell its tom sawyer time all those bimbos on the beach and the crappy organ shove your ass in your pants we gotta get out of here jump gunning the engine of an old beatup ford v constance made me fastzip my fly driving south along the sea i kept mourning youre alive hold the funeral and wipe your nose she laughed at the empty road ahead jesus god i fooled everyone but why why well crud honey that bastard kept combing the surf line night after night you didnt write i mean invite him to invite jesus you got no taste she braked the car in behind her shut arabian fort lit a cigarette puffed smoke out the window glared all clear hes never coming back constance good he looked better every night when youre one hundred ten years old its not the man its the pants besides i thought i knew who he was you were right so i decided to fix things for good i stashed groceries in a bungalow south of here and parked this ford there then i came back she jumped out of the old ford and led me to the back door of her house i turned on all the lights music fixed food that night opened every door and window and when he showed up ran down yelled beat you to catalina and dove in he was so stunned he didnt follow or he might have part way and given up i swam out two hundred yards and lay easy i saw him on the shore the next halfhour waiting for me to come in then he ran like hell i had really spooked him i swam south and surfed in by my old el cheapo bungalow near playa del rey i had a ham sandwich and champagne on the porch feeling great hid there ever since sorry to worry you kid you okay give me a kiss but no phys ed she kissed me and unlocked the door and we walked through to open the beachfront door and let the wind haunt the curtains and sift sand on the tiles jesus who the hell lived here she wondered im my own ghost come home i dont own this any more you ever feel back from vacation all the furniture books radio seem like neglected cats resentful they cut you dead feel its a morgue we walked through the rooms the furniture white sheeted in the dust and wind moved restlessly perturbed constance leaned out the front door and yelled okay sonofabitch gotcha she turned back find some more champagne lock up place gives me the creeps out only the empty shore and the empty house saw us drive away how about this yelled constance rattigan against the wind she had put the top of her ford down and we drove in a warmcold flood of night our hair blowing and we pulled up in a great sluice of sand next to a little bungalow by a halftumbled wharf and constance was out shucking clothes down to her bra and pants the embers of a small fire burned in the frontyard sands she stoked it with kindling and paper and when it flared shoved some forked hotdogs into it and sat knocking my knees like a teenage ape drinking the champagne and tousling my hair see that hunk of driftwood there all thats left of the diamond dance pier charlie chaplin sat at a table there d w griffith beyond me and desmond taylor at the far end wally beery well why go on burn your mouth eat she stopped suddenly and looked north along the sands they wont follow will they he or they or them or whatever they didnt see us did they were safe forever forever i said the salt wind stirred the fire sparks flew up to shine in constance rattigans green eyes i looked away theres just one last thing i have to do what tomorrow around five go in and clean out fannies icebox constance stopped drinking and frowned why would you want to do that i had to think of something so as not to spoil the champagne night friend of mine streeter blair the artist used to win blue ribbons at the county fair every autumn with his baked bread after he died they found six loaves of his bread in his home freezer his wife gave me one i had it around for a week and ate a slice with real butter once in the morning once at night god it was swell what a great way to say goodbye to a wonderful man when i buttered the last slice he was gone for good maybe thats why i want fannies jellies and jams okay constance was disquieted yes she said at last i popped another cork what do we drink to my nose i said at last my damn head cold is over six boxes of kleenex later to my nose your lovely big nose she said and drank we slept out on the sand that night feeling safe two miles south of those funeral flowers touching the shore by the late constance rattigans former arabian leanto and three miles south of an apartment where cals piano smile and my battered underwood waited for me to come save earth from martians on one page and mars from earthmen on the next in the middle of the night i awoke the place next to me on the sand was empty but still warm from where constance had lain cuddling the poor writer i got up to hear her thrashing and chortling with sealbark commotions out in the waves when she ran in we finished the champagne and slept until almost noon that day was one of those noexcusesneededforlivingweather days when you just lie and let the juices flow and drip but finally i had to say i didnt want to ruin last night god it was good to find you alive but the truth is its one down one to go mr devilintheflesh on the beach ran away because he thought he had caused you to drown he never intended anything but skin diving anyway and midnight frolics like what he got was you drowned it seemed so hes gone but theres still the one who sent him jesus whispered constance her eyelids flinched like two spiders over her shut eyes at last she sighed exhausted so its not over after all i clenched her sandgritty hand in mine after a long silent time of thinking she said her eyes still shut about fannies icebox i never made it back that night five centuries ago to look in you looked saw nothing thats why ive got to go look again trouble is the law has padlocked her apartment you want me to go jimmy the lock constance ill go in clear the halls chase out the spooks you hit em with a club then we both crack the padlock spoon fannies mayonnaise and at the bottom of the third jar we find the answer the solution if its still there if it hasnt spoiled or been taken away a fly buzzed touched my brow an old notion stirred reminds me that story years ago in some magazine girl fell and froze in a glacier two hundred years later the ice melts and there she is beautiful young as the day she was frozen thats no beautiful girl in fannies fridge no its something terrible and when and if you find and take whatever it is out do you kill it nine times i guess yeah nine should do it how said constance her face pale under her tan does that damn first aria from tosca go i got out of her car in front of the tenement just at dusk the night looked even darker just inside the waiting hall i stared at it for a long moment my hands trembled on the door of constance rattigans roadster want old ma to come in with you she said good grief constance sorry kid she patted my cheek gave me a kiss that made my eyelids fly up like windowshades handed me a piece of paper and shoved thats my bungalow phone listed under the name trixie friganza the idontcare girl remember her no nuts if someone kicks your bung downstairs yell if you find the bastard form a conga line and throw him off the secondfloor porch you want me to wait here constance i moaned down the hill she found a red light and went through it i came up the stairs to a hall that was dark forever the lightbulbs had been stolen years ago i heard someone run it was a very light tread like a childs i froze listening the footsteps diminished and ran down the steps at the rear of the tenement the wind blew down the hall and brought the smell with it it was the scent that henry had told me about of clothes that had hung in an attic for a hundred years and shirts that had been worn for a hundred days it was like standing in a midnight alley where a pack of hounds had gone to lift their legs with mindless panting smiles the smell pulled me into a jumping run i made it to fannies door and braked myself heart pounding i gagged because the smell was so strong he had been here only a few moments ago i should have run after but the door itself stopped me i put out my hand the door scraped softly inward on unoiled hinges someone had broken the lock on fannies door someone had wanted something someone had gone in to search now it was my turn i stepped forward into a dark remembrance of food the air was pure delicatessen a warm nest where a great kind strange elephant had browsed and sung and eaten for twenty years how long i wondered before the scent of dill and cold cuts and mayonnaise would blow away lost down the tenement stairwells but now the room was a ramshackle mess he had come in and tumbled the shelves and closets and bureaus everything was flung to the linoleum floor all of fannies opera scores were strewn among the broken phonograph records that had been kicked against the wall or toppled in his search jesus fannie i whispered im glad you cant see this everything that could have been searched and wrecked was wrecked even the great throne chair where fannie had queened it for half a generation or more was tossed down on its back as she had been tossed down to stay but the one place he had not looked the last place i looked now stumbling on the shambles i grabbed the icebox door and pulled the cool air sighed out around my face i stared as i had stared many nights ago aching to see what was right there before me what was the thing the stander in the hall the stranger on the night train had come to find but left behind for me everything was just as it had always been jams jellies salad dressings wilted lettuce a rich cold shrine of colors and scents where fannie had worshipped but suddenly i sucked my breath i reached out and shoved the jars and bottles and cheese boxes way to the back they had been placed all this while on a thin folded paper of some size which until now i had simply taken as a sheet to catch drippings i pulled it out and read by the icebox light janus the green envy weekly i left the box door wide and staggered over to put fannies old chair upright and collapse in it to wait for my heart to slow i turned the greentinted newspaper pages on the back were obits and personals i ran my eye down found nothing ran it down again and saw a small box circled faintly with red ink and this was what he had searched for to take away forever how could i know here were the words where have you been all these years my heart cries out does yours why dont you write or call i can be happy if only youd remember me as i remember you we had so much and lost it all now before its too late to remember find your way back call and it was signed someone who loved you long ago and in the margin were these words scrawled by someone someone who loved you with a full heart long ago jesus at midnight mary in the morn i read it six times in disbelief i let the paper fall walked on it stood in the icebox draft to cool off then i went back to read the damn message for a seventh time what a piece of work it was what a beaut what a comeon what a baited trap what a rorschach test what a piece of palmistry what a numbers game that anyone could sum and win with men women old young dark light tall thin listen look this means you it applied to anyone who had ever loved and lost meaning every single soul in the whole damned city state and universe who reading it would not be tempted to lift a phone dial wait and whisper at last late at night here i am please come find me i stood in the middle of the linoleum floor of fannies apartment and tried to imagine her here the ships deck creaking underfoot as her weight shifted this way and that as tosca lamented from the phonograph and the icebox door stood wide with its enshrined condiments her eyes moving her heart beating like a hummingbird trapped in a vast aviary christ the fifth horseman of the apocalypse had to be the editor of a paper like this i checked all the other advertisements the telephone number was the same in each you had to call one number to get referrals to all the ads and that phone number belonged to the publishers of damn them to hell forever janus the green envy weekly fannie had never in her life bought a paper like this someone had given it to her or i stopped and glanced at the door no someone had left it for her to find with the red ink circling this one ad so she would be sure to see someone who loved you with a full heart long ago fannie i cried in dismay oh you damn damn fool i waded through broken shards of la boheme and butterfly then remembered and stumbled back to slam the icebox door things were no better on the third floor henrys door was wide open i had never seen it open before henry believed in shut doors he didnt want anyone having a sighted advantage on him but now henry i stepped through and the small apartment was neat incredibly neat and clean and filed everything in place everything fresh but empty henry his cane lay in the middle of the floor and by it a dark string a black twine with knots in it it all looked scattered and impromptu as if henry had lost these in a fight or left behind when he ran where henry i handled the twine and looked at the knots in a line two knots a space three knots a long space then a series of three six four and nine knots henry louder i ran to knock on mrs gutierrezs door when she opened it and saw me she welled over tears dropped from her eyes as she saw my face she put her tortillascented hand out to touch my cheeks aw poor poor come in oh poor sit down sit you wanta eat i bring something sit no no sit coffee yes she brought me coffee and wiped her eyes poor fannie poor man what i unfolded the newspaper and held it out for her to see no read inglese she said backing off dont have to read i said did fannie ever come up to phone and bring this paper with her no no her face changed color with memory estupido si she came but i dont know who she call did she talk a long while a long time long time she had to translate my words for a few seconds then she nodded vigorously si long long she laugh oh how she laugh and talk talk and laugh while she was inviting mr night and time and eternity to come over i thought and she had this paper with her mrs gutierrez turned the paper over like it was a chinese puzzle maybe si maybe no this one some other i dunno fannie is with god i turned weighing pounds and leaned toward the door the folded newspaper in my hands i wish i were i said please may i use your phone on a hunch i did not dial the green envy number instead counting the knots i dialed the numbers of blind henrys twine janus publications said a nasal voice green envy hold the phone was dropped to the floor i heard heavy feet shuffling through wintry mounds of crumpled paper it fits i yelled and scared mrs gutierrez who jumped back the number fits i yelled at the green envy paper in my hand for some reason henry had knotted the janus publications number onto his remembrance twine hello hello i shouted far off in the green envy office i could hear some maniac shrieking because he was trapped and electrocuted by a bin of wildly berserk guitars a rhinoceros and two hippos were dancing a fandango in the latrine to rebut the music someone typed during the cataclysm someone else was playing a harmonica to a different drummer i waited four minutes then jammed the phone down and stormed out of mrs gutierrezs raving mister said mrs gutierrez why you so upset upset upset whos upset i cried christ people dont come back to phones i got no money to get out to that damn place wherever it is in hollywood and theres no use calling back the damn phones off the hook and times running out and where the hell is henry hes dead damn it not dead mrs gutierrez should have said merely sleeping but she didnt say and i thanked her for her silence and stormed down the hallway not knowing what to do i didnt even have money for the stupid red trolley car to hollywood i henry i shouted down the stairwell yes said a voice behind me i whirled around i yelled there was nothing but darkness there henry is that me said henry and stepped out into what little light there was when henry decides to hide he truly hides holy moses armpits was here i think he knows that we know what he knows about this mess i just skedaddled out my apartment door when i heard him prowl the porch outside my view window i just dropped and jumped left stuff i dont care on the floor you find it yes your cane and the string with knots for numbers you want to know about them knots that number yes i heard crying in the hall day before fannies gone forever there she is at my door i open it to let all that sadness in not often i see her upstairs it kills her to climb i shouldntve done it no shouldnt have done it she says all my fault she says over and over watch this junk henry take this junk here what a fool i am she says and she gave me some old phonograph records and some newspapers special she said and i thanked her and thought what the hell and she went down the hall crying for herself being a fool and i just put the old newspapers by and the records and didnt think a long while till after fannie was tributed and sung after and gone and then this morning i ran my hand over those fool papers and thought what is this and i called mrs gutierrez and said what and in mexican and english she looked over the paper and saw the words you see em circled in ink the same words in five different issues of the paper and the same number and i got to thinking why was fannie crying so hard and whats this number so i knotted the knots and called you call yes henry i said i found the same paper in fannies place now why didnt you tell me you had them what for sounded foolish woman stuff i mean did you read it mrs gutierrez read it bad but read it out loud i laughed god i thought thats trash real trash only now i think different who would read and believe junk like that fannie i said at last tell me this now when you called that number some dumb sonofabitch come on talk and not come back again ever some sonofabitch henry started steering me back toward the open door of his apartment as if i were the blind one i let him how they run a business like that he wondered we were at his door i said i guess when you dont give a damn people throw money at you yeah that was always my trouble i cared too much so nobody ever threw nothing hell i got plenty cash anyway uh he stopped for he had heard me suck my breath that he said with a quiet nod and smile is the sound of someone wants to borrow my lifes savings only if you come with henry to help me find the guy who hurt fannie armpits armpits this nose is yours lead on we need money for a taxicab to save time henry i never been in a taxi in my life why would i take one now we got to get out to that newspaper before it closes the sooner we find out what we need to know the safer itll be i dont want to spend one more night worrying about you here in this tenement or me at the beach armpits has teeth huh youd better believe it come on he circled his room smiling lets find where a blind man hides his money all over the place you want eighty bucks hell no sixty forty twenty thirty will do well hell then henry snorted stopped laughed and yanked a great wad of bills out of his hip pocket he began to peel the lettuce heres forty itll take awhile to pay it back if we get whoever pushed fannie over you dont owe nothing grab the money find my cane shut the door cmon lets go find that dumb bunny who answers phones and goes off on vacation in the taxicab henry beamed around at sources of scent and odor he could not see this is dandy i never smelled a cab before this ones new and going fast i couldnt resist henry howd you save up so much i dont see em touch em even smell em but i play the horses got friends at the track they listen and lay on the lettuce i bet more and lose less than most sighted fools it mounts up when it gets too big i trot along to one of those ugly ladies so they tell me in the bungalows out front near the tenement they say ugly but i dont mind blind is blind andwell now where are we here i said we had pulled into an alley behind a building in a rundown block in hollywood south of the boulevard henry snuffed a deep breath it aint armpits but its his first cousin watch out ill be right back i got out henry stayed in the back seat his cane in his lap eyes restfully shut ill just listen to the meter he said and make sure it dont run fast the dusk was long since gone and it was full night as i picked my way along the alley looking up at a halflit neon sign on the backstairs of a building with the great god janus painted facing two ways above it half of one face had flaked off in the rains the rest would be soon gone even the gods i thought are having a bad year i dodged upstairs among various young men and women with old faces hunched like beaten dogs smoking begging their pardon excusing myself but nobody seemed to mind i stepped in at the top the offices looked as if they hadnt been cleaned since the civil war there was paper balled wadded tossed over every inch foot and yard of the floor there were hundreds of old newspapers crumpled and yellowing in the windows on the desktops three wastebaskets stood empty whoever had thrown the paper wads had missed ten thousand times i waded in through a tide that reached my ankles i walked on dried cigars cigarette stubs and by the crackling sound of their small thoraxes cockroaches i found the abandoned phone under a snowpiled desk picked it up listened i thought i could hear the traffic going by under mrs gutierrezs window crazy she must have hung up long ago thanks for waiting i said hey man what gives said someone i hung up and turned a tall skinny man with a clear drop of water on the end of his thin nose came wading through the paper tide he sized me up with nicotinestained eyes i called about half an hour ago i nodded at the phone i just hung up on me he gazed at the phone scratched his head and finally got it he managed a feeble smile and said sheeit those are my very thoughts i had a feeling he was proud of never coming back to the phone it was better to make up your own news hey man he said getting another idea to replace the first he was the sort of thinker who has to move out the furniture before he can bring in the cows you you wouldnt happen to be the fuzz no just the goofer feathers unh remember the two black crows huh nineteen twentysix two white men in blackface talked about goofer feathers the fuzz from peaches forget it did you write this i held out the janus green envy page with the terribly sad advertisement at the bottom he blinked at it hell no its legit it was sent in you ever stop to think what youre doing with an ad like that hey man like we dont read we just print em its a free country right lemme see that he grabbed the ad and peered at it moving his lips oh sure that one funny huh you realize someone just might look up that geek and believe in him thems the breaks hey look why dont you fall downstairs outa my life he thrust the paper back at me i dont leave without the home phone number of this weirdo he blinked at me stunned then laughed thats qt information like no one knows you want to write him sure we pass mail on or he comes picks it up this is an emergency someones dead someone i ran out of gas and looked around at the ocean of paper on the floor and without thinking about it took out a box of small stick matches looks like a fire hazard here i said what fire hazard he glanced around at the years growth of paper wadding empty beer cans dropped paper cups and old hamburger wrappings a look of immense pride overcame him his eyes almost danced when he saw the fiveorsixquart wax milk cartons busy manufacturing penicillin on the window sills next to some tossed mens jockey shorts that gave the place its real touch of class i struck a match to get his attention hey he said i blew out the first match to show what a good sport i was and when he made no further offer of help lit a second what if i dropped this on the floor he gave the floor a second look around the paper junk seethed and lapped at his ankles if i had dropped the match the flames would have reached him in about five seconds you aint going to drop that he said no i blew it out and lit a third you got the goddamnedest sense of humor dont you i dropped the match he yelled and jumped i stepped on the flame before it could spread he took a deep breath and let it blast now you get the hell outa here you wait i lit a final match and crouched guarding the flame close down to a halfton of wadded rewrites old calling cards torn envelopes i touched the flame here and there and the paper started burning what in hell you want just a phone number thats all i still wont have an address so i cant get at the guy trace him but i do damn it to hell want that phone or the whole place burns i realized my own voice had gone up about ten decibels to maniac fannie was fighting in my blood a lot of other dead people were screaming in my breath wanting out give it here i shouted the flames were spreading shit man stomp out the fire youll get the goddamn dumb number shit hold on jump i jumped on the fire dancing around smoke rose and the fire was out by the time mr janus the editor who faced two ways at once found the number on his rolodex here goddamn it heres the crapping number vermont fourfivefivefive got that fourfivefivefive i struck a final final match until he shoved the rolodex card under my nose someone who loved you it read and the telephone okay shrieked the editor i blew out the match my shoulders sank with sudden relief fannie i thought well get him now i must have said it out loud for the editor his face purple sprayed me with his saliva what you going to get myself killed i said going downstairs i hope so i heard him yell i opened the door of the taxicab meters ticking like crazy said henry in the back seat thank god im rich be right with you i beckoned the taxi driver to follow me out to a corner where there was an outdoor phone booth i hesitated for a long while afraid to call the number afraid someone might really answer what i wondered do you say to a murderer during suppertime i dialed the number someone who loved you long ago who would answer a dumb ad like that all of us on the right night the voice from the past making you remember a familiar touch a warm breath in the ear a seizure of passion like a strike of lightning which of us is not vulnerable i thought when it comes to that threeinthemorning voice or when you wake after midnight to find someone crying and its you and tears on the chin and you didnt even know that during the night you had had a bad dream someone who loved you where is she now where is he still alive somewhere it cant be too much time is gone the one who loves me cant still be in the world somewhere and yet why not as i was doing call i called three times and went back to sit with henry in the back seat of the taxi listening to the meter tick dont worry he said that meter dont bother me theres plenty of horses waiting and lots of lettuce up ahead go dial the number again child the child went to dial this time a long way off in another country it seemed a selfappointed funeral director picked up the phone yes said a voice at last i gasped whos this for that matter whos this said the guarded voice what took you so long to get to the phone i could hear cars going by on the other end it was a phone booth in an alley somewhere in the city christ i thought he does as i do hes using the nearest pay booth for his office well if youre not going to say anything said the voice on the other end wait i said i almost know your voice i thought let me hear more i saw your ad in janus can you help me the voice on the other end relaxed pleased by my panic i can help anyone anywhere anytime he said easily you one of the lonelies what i cried you one of the lonelies he had said and that did it i was back at crumleys back in time back on the big train in the cold rain rounding a curve the voice on the phone was that voice in the night storm half a lifetime ago saying its say about death and lonely lonely and death first the memory of a voice then the session with crumley knocking my head and now this real sound on the phone there was only one missing piece i still couldnt put a name on the voice close familiar i almost had it but speak up i practically shouted there was an interval of suspicion on the other end in that moment i heard the most beautiful sounds of half a lifetime the wind blowing at the far end of the line but more than that surf rolling in louder and louder closer and closer until i almost felt it roll under my feet oh jesus i know where you are i cried no way said the phone voice and broke the connection but not soon enough i stared wildly at the empty phone in my hand and squeezed it in my fist henry i yelled henry leaned out of the taxicab staring at nothing i fell getting in the cab you still with me if i aint said henry where am i speak to the driver i spoke we went the taxicab rolled to a stop with its windows down henry leaned forward his face like the prow of a dark ship he sniffed aint been here since childhood that smells the ocean that other smell rotten the pier this where you live scribe the great american novelist sure i hope your novels smell better than this if i live maybe can we keep the cab waiting henry henry licked his thumb peeled off three twentydollar bills held them over the front seat of the cab that keep you from being nervous son that the cab driver took the money will buy you midnight itll all be over by then said henry child you know what youre doing before i could answer a wave came in under the pier sounds like the new york subway said henry dont let it run over you we left the cab waiting at the foot of the venice pier i tried to steer henry along in the night dont need no steering said henry just warn me on wires ropes or loose bricks is all but i got a nervous elbow dont like touching i let him walk proudly on wait here i said step back about three feet there you cant be seen when i come back ill just say one word henry and then you tell me what you smell okay and then just turn and go to the cab i can still hear the motor running sure tell the taxi to take you to the venice police station ask for elmo crumley if hes not there have them call his home hes to come here with you fast as possible once we get the whole thing rolling that is if it rolls maybe we wont use your nose tonight after all i hope i do i brought my cane to hit that guy you let me hit him once i hesitated once i said you okay henry brer fox he lie low feeling like brer rabbit i walked away it was the elephants graveyard the pier at night all dark bones and a lid of fog over it and the sea rushing in to bury reveal and bury again i picked my way along past the shops and shoebox apartments and shut poker parlors noting on my way various phones here or there standing in their unlit caskets waiting to be taken away tomorrow or next week i walked out along the plankings over the sighs and rustles and stirs of moist and dry wood the whole structure creaked and heaved like a sinking ship as i passed red warning flags and signs which read danger as i stepped over strung chains and found myself as far as i could go at the edge of the pier looking back at all the nailedshut doors and rolleddownandpinned canvas fronts i slid into the last phone booth rummaged my pockets cursing until i found the nickels henry had given me i dropped one in the phone slot and dialed the number given me by the janus editor four five five five i whispered and waited at this moment the frayed strap on my mickey mouse wristwatch broke the watch fell to the booth floor cursing i picked it up and shoved it on the shelf under the phone then listened far off i could hear the phone ringing at the other end i let my receiver drop and hang i stepped out of the booth and stood listening eyes shut at first there was only one great roll of surf traveling under my feet shaking the timbers it passed at last straining i could hear far down at the halfway point on the pier a phone rang coincidence i thought phones ring everywhere all the time but this phone a hundred yards away now had i dialed its number half in half out of the booth i grabbed the receiver and planted it back on its hook far off in the windy darkness that other phone stopped ringing which still proved nothing i dropped my nickel back in and redialed a deep breath and that telephone in its glass coffin half a lightyear away started ringing again it made me jump and hurt in my chest i felt my eyes widen and my breath suck in cold i let the phone ring i stood out of my booth waiting for someone off there in the night to run from the alleys or out of the damp canvas or from behind the old knock the milk bottles game someone like me would have to answer someone who like myself jumped up at two in the morning to run in the rain and talk to the sunlight in mexico city where life still walked and lived and seemed never to die someone the whole pier stayed dark no shack windows lit no canvasses whispered the phone rang the surf wandered under the boards looking for someone anyone to answer the phone rang it rang i wanted to run answer the damn thing myself just to shut it up jesus i thought get your nickel back get then it happened a crack of light appeared swiftly and went out something stirred down there across from that telephone the phone rang the phone rang and someone stood in the shadows listening to it tentatively i saw a whiteness turn and knew that whoever it was was looking along the pier fearful careful searching i froze the phone rang at last the shadow moved the face turned back listening the phone rang the shadow suddenly ran i leaped back into my booth and grabbed the receiver just in time click on the far end i heard breathing then at last a mans voice said yes oh my god i thought its the same the voice i heard an hour ago in hollywood someone who loved you long ago i must have said it aloud there was a long pause a wait an insucked gasp from the far end of the line yes it shot me through the ear then the heart i know that voice now i thought oh christ i said hoarsely its you that must have shot him through the head i heard him seize in a great storm of breath and blast it out damn you he cried damn you to hell he didnt hang up he just let the redhot telephone drop bang dance on its hangmans noose i heard his footsteps rush away by the time i got out of the booth the pier was empty in all directions where the brief light had been was dark only bits of old newspaper blew along the plankings as i forced myself to walk not run the hundred long yards to that other phone i found it dangling and tapping the cold glass of the booth i picked it up and listened i could hear my tendollar mickey mouse watch ticking at the other end back in that other phone booth a hundred miles away if i was lucky and alive id go save the mouse i hung up this telephone and turned staring at all the little buildings shacks shop fronts shutdown games wondering if i would do something crazy now i did i walked about seventy feet to a small shop front and stood in front of it listening someone was in there moving around perhaps shoving himself into street clothes in the dark i heard rustles and someone whispering angrily to himself someone talking under his breath telling him where to find socks where shoes and where where the damn tie or maybe it was just the tide under the pier making up lies no one could ever check the muttering stopped he must have felt me outside the door i heard footsteps move i fell backward clumsily realizing my hands were empty i hadnt even thought to bring henrys cane as weapon the door opened with savage swiftness i stared crazily i saw two things at once beyond on a small table in halflight a stack of yellow and brown and red clark bar and nestles crunch and power house wrappers and then the small shadow the little man himself staring out at me with stunned eyes as if wakened from a fortyyear sleep a l shrank in person tarot card reader phrenologist dimestore psychiatrist day and nighttime psychologist astrologer zen freudian jungian numerologist and full life failure stood there buttoning his shirt with mindless fingers trying to see me with eyes that were either fixed by some drug or shocked numb by my inept bravado damn you to hell he said quietly again and then added with some quick sort of impromptu quiver of a smile come in no i whispered then i said it louder no you come out the wind was blowing the wrong way or perhaps the right way this time my god i thought cringing back then holding my ground all those other days how did the wind blow how could i not have noticed because i thought oh damn simple fact i had had a head cold for a solid ten days no nose at all no nose oh henry i thought you and your always lifted always curious beak connected to all that bright awareness within oh smart henry crossing an unseen street at nine of an evening and sniffing the unwashed shirt and the unlaundered underclothes as death marched by the other way i looked at shrank and felt my nostrils wince sweat the first smell of defeat urine the next smell of hatred then what mixtures onion sandwiches unbrushed teeth the scent of selfdestruction it came like a storm cloud full flood from the man i might have been standing on an empty shore with a ninetyfoot tidal wave poised to crush me for the sick fear i suddenly knew my mouth baked dry even as sweat broke on my body come in said a l shrank again uncertainly there was a moment when i thought he might suck backward like a crayfish but then he saw my glance at the phone booth directly across from his shop and my second glance down the pier to the phone at the far end where my mickey mouse watch ticked and he knew before he could speak again i called into the shadows henry dark stirred in dark i felt henrys shoes scrape as his voice called back warm and easy yes shranks eyes jerked from me to where henrys voice stirred the shadows at last i was able to say armpits henry took a deep breath and let it out armpits he said i nodded you know what to do i hear the meter running said henry from the corners of my eyes i saw him walking away then stop and throw his hand up shrank flinched so did i henrys cane sailed through the air to land with a sharp clatter on the planks you might need that said henry shrank and i stood staring at the weapon on the pier the sound of the taxi driving off jerked me forward i grabbed the cane and held it to my chest as if it might really work against knives or guns shrank looked at the vanishing lights of the taxi far off what in hell was that all about he said behind him schopenhauer and nietzsche and spengler and kafka all leaned on their mad elbows sank in their dusts and whispered yes what was that all about waitll i get my shoes he vanished dont get anything else i cried that made him laugh a choking laugh what would i get he called unseen rummaging around in the door he showed me a shoe in each hand no guns no knives he shoved them on but didnt lace them i couldnt believe what happened next the clouds over venice decided to pull back revealing a full moon both of us looked up at it trying to decide if it was bad or good and for which of us shranks gaze wandered to the shoreline and along the pier he wept like anything to see such quantities of sand he said then hearing himself he snorted softly come oysters said the carpenter and took them close in hand a pleasant walk a pleasant talk along the golden strand he began to walk i stayed arent you going to lock your door shrank gave the merest nodding glance over his shoulder at the books clustered like vultures with their black feathers and dusty golden stares waiting on shelves for the touch that gave life in invisible choirs they sang forth wild tunes i should have heard long days ago my eye ran and reran the stacks my god why hadnt i truly seen that dreadful escarpment inhabited by dooms that lineup of failures that literary apocalypse of wars squalors diseases pestilences depressions that downfall of nightmares that pit of deliriums and mazes from which mad mice and insane rats never found light or made exit that police lineup of degenerates and epileptics dancing the rims of shelved library cliffs with teams replacing teams of nausea and revulsion waiting in the higher darkness single authors single books fine a poe here or a sade there is a spice but this was no library it was an abattoir a dungeon a tower where ten dozen men in iron masks were penned silently raving forever why hadnt i seriously seen and known because rumpelstiltskin was in charge staring at shrank even now i thought at any moment hell grab his foot and rip himself straight up in half and fall in two pieces he was hilarious which made him all the more terrible those books said shrank at last breaking the spell not looking at them staring up at the moon they dont care for me why should i care for them but besides said shrank would anyone really want to steal decline of the wat i thought you loved your collection loved he blinked once my god dont you see i hate everything name it theres nothing in the world i like he strode off in the direction henry had taken with his taxicab now he said coming or not coming i said is that a weapon we walked slowly feeling each other out i was amazed to find henrys cane in my hands no an antenna i think i said of a very large insect a very blind one can he find his way without it and wheres he going this time of night running errands back immediately i lied shrank was a lie detector he almost writhed with delight at my voice he quickened his pace then stopped to examine me i take it he steers by his nose i heard what you asked and what he answered back armpits i said shrank shriveled inside his old clothes his eyes darted first to his left then to his right underarm and down along a vast history of stains and times discolorings armpits i said again it was a bullet in the heart shrank staggered then firmed himself why and where are we walking he gasped i could sense the rabbit palpitation under his greasy tie i thought you were leading the way i only know one thing i moved this time half a step ahead of him blind henry was searching for some unwashed shirts dirty underclothes bad breath he found and named them for me i did not repeat the dread epithet but shrank with each word was diminished why would a blind man want me said shrank at last i didnt want to give it all away at once i had to test and try because of janus the green envy weekly i said ive seen copies in your place through your window that was pure lie but it struck midriff yes yes said shrank but a blind man and you because i took a deep breath and let it out youre mr fixit shrank shut his eyes spun his thoughts chose a reaction laughed fixit fixit ridiculous why would you think because i walked on making him dogtrot to follow i talked to the mist which gathered ahead henry smelled someone crossing the street many nights ago the same smell was in his tenement hall and here now tonight and the smell is you the rabbit palpitation shook the little man again but he knew he was still clear nothing was proven why he gasped would i prowl some downtown lousy tenement i wouldnt dream to live in why because i said you were looking for lonelies and damn fool stupid dumb me blinder than henry helped you find them fannie was right constance was right i was the death goat after all christ i was typhoid mary i carried the disease you everywhere or at least you followed to find lonelies a drumbeat of breath lonelies almost as i said it both shrank and i were seized with what were almost paroxysms i had spoken a truth that was like a furnace lid thrown back so the heat scorched out to sear my face my tongue my heart my soul and shrank i was describing his unguessed life his need all yet to be revealed and admitted but i knew i had at last yanked the asbestos up and the fire was in the open what was that word asked shrank some ten yards off and motionless as a statue lonelies you said the word you described them last month lonelies and it was true a funeral march of souls went by in a breath on soundless feet in drifts of fog fannie and sam and jimmy and cal and all the rest i had never put a proper label on them i had never seen the carryover that tied them all and made them one youre raving said shrank guessing making up lying none of this has to do with me but he was looking down at the way his coat was run up on his skinny wrists and the weathermarks of latenight sweats down his coat his suit seemed to be diminishing even as i watched he writhed in his own pale skin underneath i decided to attack christ youre rotting even as you stand there youre an affront you hate everything all anything in the world you told me that just now so you attack it with your dirt your breath your underwear is your true flag so you run it up a pole to ruin the wind a l shrank proprietor of the apocalypse he was smiling he was overjoyed i had complimented him with insults i was paying attention his ego roused without knowing it i had made and baited a trap what now i thought what what for gods sake do i say now now how draw him out how finish him but he was walking ahead again now all inflated with insults all magnificent with the medals of ruin and despair i had pinned to his greasy tie we walked we walked we walked my god i thought how long do we walk how long do we talk how long does this go on this is a movie i thought one of those unbelievable scenes that continue and continue when people explain and others talk back and people say again it cant be it is hes not sure what i know and im not sure that i know either and both of us wonder if the other is armed and both of us are cowards said shrank and both are afraid to test the other the carpenter went on the oyster followed we walked and it was not a scene from a good or bad film where people talked too much it was a scene growing late at night and the moon vanishing to reappear as the fog thickened and i was having a dialogue with hamlets fathers idiot psychiatrists friends ghost shrank i thought what a name shrink from this shrink from that you wind up shrunk how had it started out of college on top of the world hang a shingle then the great earthquake of some year did he recall the year his legs and mind broke and there was the long slide without a toboggan just on his skinny backside and no women between him and the downfall pit to ease the concussion lubricate the nightmare stop his crying at midnight and hatred at dawn and one morning he got out of bed and found himself where venice california and the last gondola long since departed and the lights going out and the canals filling with oil and old circus wagons with only the tide roaring behind the bars i have a little list i said what said shrank the mikado i told him one song explains you your object all sublime you will achieve in time to make the punishment fit the crime the lonelies all of them you put them on your list in the words of the song they never will be missed their crime was giving up or never having tried it was mediocrity or failure or lostness and their punishment my god was you he was puffed now with a peacock stride well he said walking ahead well i loaded my tongue and took aim and fired a round i imagine i said that somewhere nearby is the decapitated head of scott joplin he could not help the impulse that moved his right hand to his greasy coat pocket he pretended to pat it in place found himself staring with pleasure at that hand glanced away and went on walking one shot one hit i glowed detective lieutenant crumley i thought wish you were here i fired a second round canaries for sale i said in a tiny voice like the faded leadpencil lettering on the cardboard in the old ladys window hirohito ascends throne addis ababa mussolini his left hand twitched with secret pride toward his left coat pocket christ i thought hes carrying her old bottomofthebirdcage headlines with him bullseye he strode i followed target three aim three fire three lion cage old man ticket office his chin dropped toward his breast pocket there by god would be found punchout ticket confetti from a train never taken shrank plowed on through the mist absolutely oblivious of the fact that i was butterflynetting his crimes he was a happy child in the fields of the antichrist his tiny shoes flinted on the planks he beamed what next my mind swarmed ah yes i saw jimmy in the tenement hall with his new choppers all grin jimmy in the bathtub turned over and six fathoms deep false teeth i said uppers lowers thank god shrank did not pat his pockets again i might have shouted a terrible laugh of dread to think he carried a dead grin about his glance over his shoulder told me it was back in his hut target five aim fire dancing chihuahuas preening parakeets shranks shoes did a dogdance on the pier his eyes jumped to his left shoulder there were birdclaw marks and droppings there one of pietro massinellos birds was back there in the hut target six moroccan fort by an arabian sea shranks little lizard tongue made a tiny whiplash along his thirsty lips one bottle of rattigans champagne shelved behind us leaning on de quincey in his dope hardy in his gloom a wind rose i shuddered for suddenly i sensed that ten dozen candy wrappers all mine were blowing along after shrank and me ghost rodent hungers from other days rustling along the night pier and at last i had to say and could not say but finally made myself say the terrible final sad words that broke my tongue even as something burst in my chest midnight tenement full icebox tosca like a black discus hurled across the town the first side of tosca struck rolled and slid under a l shranks midnight door the list had been long i was poised on the near rim of hysteria panic terror delight at my own perception my own revulsion my own sadness i might dance strike or shriek at any moment but shrank spoke first eyes dreaming the whispered arias of puccini turning and turning in his head the fat womans at peace now she needed peace i gave it to her i hardly remember what happened next somebody yelled me someone else yelled him my arm thrust up henrys cane in it murder i thought kill shrank fell back only in time as the cane chopped down instead of him it struck the pier and was shocked from my grip it fell rattled and was kicked by shrank so it sailed over the edge of the pier and down into the sand now i could only lunge at the little man with empty fists and lurch to a halt as he stepped aside because a final thing had broken in me i gagged i wept days ago the crying in the shower was only a start now the full flood came my bones began to crumble i stood weeping and shrank astounded almost reached out to touch me and murmur there there its all right he said at last shes at peace you should thank me for that the moon went behind a great bank of fog and gave me time to recover i was all slow motion now my tongue dragged and i could hardly see what you mean is i said at last underwater theyre all gone and i should thank you for all of them yes it must have been a terrible relief for him having waited all these months or years to tell someone no matter who no matter where no matter how the moon came out again his lips trembled with the renewed light and the need for release yes i helped them all my god i gasped helped helped i had to sit down he helped me to do that and stood over me astonished at my weakness in charge of me and the nights future the man who could bless people with murder keep them from suffering put off their loneliness sleep them from their private dooms save them from life benefit them with sunsets but you helped too he said reasonably youre a writer curious all i had to do was follow collecting your candy wrappers as you went do you know how easy it is to follow people they never look back never you never did oh dear you never knew you were my good dog of death for more times than you guess over a year you showed me the people you were collecting for your books all the gravel on the path chaff in the wind empty shells on the shore dice with no spots cards with no pips no past no present so i gave them no future i looked up at him my strength was coming back the sadness was just about over for now my anger built a slew pressure you admit it all do you why not its all sour breath on the wind if when we finish here and i actually walk you to the police station which i will you have no proof of what ive said its all lost hot air not quite i said you couldnt resist taking one thing from each victim your godawful place is full of phonograph records champagne and old newspapers sonofabitch said shrank and stopped he barked a laugh and then made a grin pretty smart got it out of me eh he rocked on his heels thinking about it now he said ill just have to kill you i jumped up i was a foot taller and not brave but he jumped back no i said you cant do that why not because i said you cant lay hands on me you didnt lay hands on them it was all hands off i see it now your logic was to get people to do things to themselves or destroy them indirectly right right his pride was involved again he forgot me standing there and looked off at his bright and glorious past train ticket office old man all you did was get him drunk knock his head on the edge of the canal maybe then jump in and make sure he got in the lion cage right canariesforsale old lady all you did was stand over her bed and make faces right sam gave him enough hard liquor to put him in the hospital right jimmy made sure he had three times too much booze you didnt even have to turn him over in the bathtub rolled over himself gone right pietro massinello you wrote the city government to come get him and his ten dozen dogs cats and birds if he isnt dead now soon will be right gal the barber of course i stole scott joplins head said shrank so cal scared left town john wilkes hopwood him and his immense ego wrote him using constance rattigans stationery got him to come naked on the beach every night scaring constance out to drown herself indeed then got rid of hopwood by letting him know you had seen him on the beach the night constance vanished you added a really terrible dirty letter calling him everything vile everything he was and fannie florianna left your ad by her door and when she called and you made an appointment all you did was come over burst in same as with the old canary lady frighten fannie so she ran backward yes fell and couldnt get up and all you had to do was stand over her to make sure she didnt yes he knew better than to say yes to this to say anything for i was furious now still shaky but getting strength from my own madness you made only one mistake all along the way over the weeks sending the papers to fannie leaving them marked when you remembered this and went back and broke in you couldnt find them the one place you didnt think to look was the icebox your newspaper notice put under the jars to catch drips i found it there thats why im here and not about to be the next on your list or do you have other plans yes no and do you know why not for two reasons one im not a lonely im not a failure im not lost im going to make it im going to be happy im going to marry and have a good wife and children im going to write damned fine books and be loved that doesnt fit your pattern you cant kill me you damn stupid jerk because im okay you see im going to live forever secondly you cant lay a finger on me no one else has been touched by you if you touch me it spoils your record you got all your other deaths by fear or intimidation but now if you try to prevent my going to the police youll have to commit real murder you sick bastard i plowed off with him running after in utter confusion almost tugging at my elbows for attention right right i almost killed you a year ago but then you made those sales to magazines and then you met that woman and i decided to just follow you and collect people yes that was it and it really began that night on the venice train in the storm and me drunk you were so close to me that night on the train i could have reached out and touched and the rain came down and if you had just turned but you didnt you would have seen me and known me but you didnt and we were off the pier and in the dark street by the canal now and moving swiftly over the bridge the boulevard was empty i saw no cars no lights i rushed in the middle of the bridge over the canal by the lion cages shrank stopped and caught hold of the railing why dont you understand me help me he wailed i wanted to kill you i did but it would have been like killing hope and there has to be some of that in the world doesnt there even for people like me i stared at him not after tonight why he gasped why looking at the cold oily water because youre utterly and completely insane i said ill kill you now no i said with immense sadness theres only one person left to kill one last lonely the empty one you me shrieked the little man you me he screamed damn damn damn you he spun he grabbed the rails he leaped his body went down in darkness he sank in waters as oiled and scummy as his coat as terrible and dark as his soul to be covered and lost shrank i yelled he did not rise come back i wanted to yell but then suddenly i was afraid he would shrank i whispered shrank i bent over the bridge staring at the green scum and the gaseous tide i know youre there it just couldnt be over it was too simple he was somewhere out of the light brooding like a dark toad under the bridge maybe eyes up waiting face green sucking air very quietly i listened not a drip not a ripple not a sigh shrank i whispered shrank echoed the timbers under the bridge off along the shore the great oil beasts lifted their heads up at my summons sank them down again in time to a long sighing roll of water on the coast dont wait i thought i heard shrank murmuring its nice down here quiet at last i think ill stay liar i thought youll come up when i least expect it the bridge creaked i whirled nothing nothing but fog sifting across the empty boulevard run i thought run telephone call crumley why isnt he here run but no if i did shrank might go free far away two miles off the big red trolley bucketed along whistling wailing sounding like the terrible beast in my dream come to take my time my life my future away heading for a tar pit at the end of the line i found a small pebble and dropped it in shrank it hit and sank silence hes escaped me i wanted to pay him back for fannie then peg i thought call her but no she would have to wait too my heart pounded so loudly that i feared the waters would stir below and the dead rise i feared that my very breathing would knock down the oil derricks i held onto my heart and breath and made them slow eyes shut shrank i thought come out fannies here waiting the canary ladys here waiting the old man from the ticket office is beside me pietros here and wants his pets come out im here along with the rest waiting shrank this time he must have heard he came to get me he shot out of the black water like a cannonball off a springboard christ i thought fool why did you call to him he was ten feet tall a dragon yeasted up from a dwarf grendel who was once a jockey he snatched up like a fury talons out he hit me like a balloon full of scalding water with thrash and yell and shriek he had long since forgotten his good intentions his plans his myth his murderous integrity shrank i yelled there was something slowmotion and terrible about it as if frame by frame i might stop him along the way and examine his astonishing arc and growth and how his eyes blazed and his mouth ached with hate and hands gripped with rage as he seized my coat my shirt my neck in iron grapples his mouth was blooded with my name as he heaved back the tar waters waited christ not there i thought the lion cages waited with doors flung wide no the slow motion stopped the swift fall followed fused by his rage we fell down sucking air in flight we struck like two concrete statues and sank loving each other with a mindless frenzy of passion climbing each other to keep each other down making ladders to air and light on the way down i thought i heard him whining wailing get in there get in there get in like a boy at some rude game without rules and i was playing wrong get in but now under we went from sight we whirled around like two crocodiles at each others necks from up top we must have seemed like a moil and welter of piranhas selffeasting or a great propeller off center and amok in rainbow oils and tars and at center of the drowning there was a small pinpoint flash of hope which burst but to fire again behind my eyes this is his first real murder i must have thought or was there time but i am flesh and will not behave i fear dark more than he fears life he must know that i must win not proven we rolled and struck something that knocked most of the air from my lungs the lion cage he was shoving and kicking me through the open door i thrashed we whirled and in the surge and white water i suddenly thought god im inside the cage the whole thing ends as it began crumley comes to find me beckoning behind the bars at dawn christ my lungs ballooned with fire i tried to whirl and knock free i wanted to shout him off with my last breath i wanted to it was over shrank relaxed his grip what i thought what what he almost let go i seized him to push but it was like grabbing a dummy that had suddenly lost its ability to gesticulate it was like handling a corpse that had leaped out of the grave and now wanted back hes quit i thought he knows he must be the last one he knows he cant kill me it doesnt fit he had indeed made up his mind and as i held him i could see his face the merest pale ghost and the shrug that said i was to at last go free and move up toward night and air and life in the dark water i saw his eyes accept his own dread as he opened his mouth flexed his nostrils and let out a terrible gaseous illumination whereupon he took a deep breath of black water and sank away a lost man seeking his final loss he was a cold marionette i left behind in the cage as blindly i thrashed for the door pushed out and pushed up wildly praying to live forever to seek the fog to find peg wherever she was in all the dread damned world i broke up and out into a mist that had begun to rain as my head burst out i gave a great cry of relief and sorrow all the souls of all the people lost and not wanting to be lost in the last month wailed out of me i gagged threw up almost sank again but made it to the bank and dragged myself out to sit and wait on the rim of the canal somewhere in the world i heard a car pull up a door slam running feet out of the rain one long arm reached and a big hand clutched to shake my shoulder crumleys face like a frogs under glass came to view in a movie closeup he looked like a father in shock bending to his drowned son you okay you all right you okay i nodded gasping henry came up behind sniffing the rain alert for dread smells and finding none he okay said henry alive i said and truly meant it oh god alive wheres armpits i got to give him one for fannie i already did henry i said i nodded down at the lion cage where a new ghost drifted like pale gelatin behind the bars crumley i said hes got a whole shack full of stuff evidence ill check it where the hell have you guys been i wondered damnfool taxi drivers blinder than me henry felt his way to the canal rim and sat down on one side of me crumley sat on the other all of us letting our feet dangle over almost into the dark water couldnt even find the police station wheres he at ill give him a hit too i snorted a laugh water flew out of my nostrils crumley leaned close to look me over you hurt nowhere anyone could ever see i thought ten years from now some night itll all surface i hope peg wont mind a few screams just to get a little mothering in a moment i thought got to go phone peg ill say marry me come tonight come home well starve together but by god well live marry me at last peg and protect me from the lonelies peg and she would answer yes and come home not hurt i answered crumley good said crumley cause who in hell would read my novel if not you i barked with laughter sorry crumley ducked his head with embarrassment at his own honesty hell i grabbed his hand and put it on the back of my neck showing him where to massage i love you crum i love you henry damn said crumley gently bless you boy said the blind man another car arrived the rain was stopping henry took a deep sniff i know that limo smell jesus god said constance rattigan leaning out what a sight worlds champion martian worlds greatest blind man and sherlock holmess bastard son we all responded one way or another to this too tired to keep it up constance got out and stood behind me looking down is it all over is that him we all nodded like an audience at a midnight theater not able to take our eyes away from the canal waters and the lion cage and the ghost behind the bars that rose and fell and beckoned god youre drenched youll catch your death lets get the kid stripped and warm all right if i take him to my place crumley nodded i put my hand on his shoulder and held tight champagne now beer later i said see you said crumley at my jungle compound henry said constance come along couldnt keep me away said henry and more cars arrived and police were getting ready to dive in to get whatever that was out of the cage and crumley was walking over toward shranks hut and i stood there trembling as constance and henry peeled off my wet jacket and helped me into the limousine and we drove along the middle of the night coast among the big sighing derricks leaving behind a strange small apartment where i worked and leaving behind the dark small leanto where spengler and genghis khan and hitler and nietzsche and a few dozen old candy wrappers waited and leaving behind the shut trolley station where tomorrow some lost old men would sit again waiting for the last trains of the century along the way i thought i saw myself passing on a bike twelve years old delivering papers in the dark morn further on my older self nineteen wandered home bumping into poles lipstick on his cheek drunk with love just before we turned in at constances arabian fort another limousine came roaring the other way along the shore highway it passed like thunder is that me too i wondered some year soon and peg in an evening gown with me coming back from a dance but the other limousine vanished the future would have to wait as we pulled in to constances sandlot backyard i knew a simple present and the best kind of alive happiness with the limo parked and constance and me waiting for him to move with a grandiose wave henry raised his arm one side or a leg off we stood aside let the blind man show you the way he did we gladly followed
