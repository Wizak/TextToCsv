first mass market printing december printed in the united states of america one his huge workroughened hands shaking with excitement young valdemar turned up the sleeves of his farmers shirt squatting on the earth floor of his solitary hut peering intently by firelight and fading daylight he reached for the long heavy bundle that lay near the fire and began very gradually to undo its wrappings of gray cloth the bundle was neatly made tied with strong cord as valdemar worked to undo the knots he did his best to keep himself from thinking of what he might expect to find within he told himself he had no right to expect anything at all but it was as if he wished to shield himself from an enormous disappointment the wrappings loosened and began to fall away as soon as an area of unrelieved blackness came into view unmistakably part of the hilt of an edged weapon the young mans fingers ceased to move like many other people he had a sensitivity to the presence of powerful magic and he was already beginning to realize just what kind of weapon he had been given valdemar thought that he could feel the blood drain from his face leaning his enormous weight back on his heels he did his unpracticed best to formulate a prayer to beneficent ardneh whatever prayer he at last managed to say went up in silence outside spring wind howled fiercely shoving against the rough stone walls of his lonely hut rattling the crude illfitting door spattering rain through the hole in the roof that served as chimney so that the small fire fueled mostly by last years dried vines hissed as if in pain he had a serious mystery to contemplate an unknown visitor working alone in pursuit of some unguessable purpose who had come and gone before valdemar had been able to catch more than a glimpse of him or her had just made the young grapegrower a present of one of the twelve swords the recipient felt overwhelmed by the discovery and yet even in this tremendous moment when valdemar first glimpsed the ebon hilt he found himself thinking that he ought to be more surprised at the nature of this gift than he really was he had the strange feeling that he had always known had never doubted that something like this something truly great was fated to happen to him sooner or later well here it was and whatever unconscious anticipation might be keeping him from being properly astonished he was certainly beginning to be afraid scant minutes ago the unexpected shadow and the silent form of the mysterious caller had moved almost simultaneously and with a swiftness almost magical past the door of valdemars isolated dwelling interrupting the young man in the midst of preparing his evening meal the door had been left slightly ajar for more light and to let the smokehole draw until that moment valdemar had had no suspicion that any other human being was anywhere within a couple of kilometers by the time he had jumped up and run outdoors the figure of his anonymous visitor was already almost out of sight in mist and rain valdemar had caught only a single glimpse of a human shape so muffled in gray garments that it might have been either man or woman the gigantic youth had started in pursuit swiftly bounding up one two three of the narrow cultivated terraces that rose above his hut but by the time he had reached the third terrace his caller had already disappeared into the wet twilight shrouding the domesticated vines the scant wild bushes and the granite outcroppings of the lonely mountainside shouting for his vanished visitor to stop valdemar had continued the chase a little farther almost to the boundary of his cultivated land but without success returning to his hut a couple of minutes later the young man had picked up the bundle which had been so mysteriously deposited at his door he had paused to reassure himself that at least it was not alive and carried it in by the fire after closing the illfitting door again and shaking his garments dry as best he could valdemar had hesitantly begun to unwrap his present a process which came moments later to a shocked halt though he was scarcely past the age of twenty and for most of the past year had dwelt in this lonely place valdemar could not claim complete innocence or ignorance regarding the affairs of the great world like every other thinking person he knew something of the history of the twelve swords magical weapons created almost forty years ago by the gods themselves valdemar knew also that two of the swords had been destroyed not long after they were made this black hilt partially visible before him if it were genuine might belong to any of the remaining ten and though like most people he had never seen much less handled any of the twelve valdemar could not doubt the authenticity of this one a heavy elegance of magic flowed into his fingertips the instant they brushed against it and to magic he was not a total stranger it was common knowledge in the world that four swords shieldbreaker dragonslicer stonecutter and sightblinder had for some years been gathered in the royal armory of tasavalta under control of that realms powerful and unfortunate prince mark among the six others now lost to public knowledge were the two valdemar considered the most abominable of the godforged weapons soulcutter and the mindsword no one as he understood the case could ever be sure of the whereabouts of coinspinner a tricky blade given to randomly moving itself about nor was there any way to guess the whereabouts of farslayer wayfinder or woundhealer that last was the only one of the surviving ten that valdemar would have rejoiced to find in his own possession crouching near the fire alone with his mysterious gift the youth hesitated for a long time before continuing the process of unwrapping his irresolution was grounded in the fact that he feared certain of the gods swords more than others and at this point it was still at least theoretically possible for him to refuse the knowledge of which one he had been given at this point he would still be able if he chose to tie up the gray cloth again carry the whole stillmysterious bundle back out into the rain and drop it lose it deep in some rocky crevice among the nearby crags hoping that no one else would ever discover the presence of the thing of power or be able to come near it for what seemed to valdemar a long time he sat there on his heels the wind battering at his door seemed to mock his fearful hesitancy while outside the clouded daylight slowly faded still enough light remained inside the hut around his dying fire for him to see whatever white mark might be emblazoned on the swords hilt when his next tug at the gray cloth should reveal it of course one sword had no white symbol at all if that was what he found it would mean fate had put into his hands soulcutter the tyrants blade the young giants eyes closed briefly his strong almosthandsome face was troubled awkwardly he uttered words aloud ardneh let it not be that one i do not want the responsibility of trying to hide that demons blade or of trying to destroy it he understood full well that breaking any sword or otherwise rendering it ineffective would be far beyond his powers therefore let it be any of them except soulcutter or valdemars prayer stumbled to a halt as he realized that for him the second most fearful of the blades would probably not after all be that called the mindsword given that one he could simply refrain from drawing it for him he thought the power to bend others to his will would pose no great temptation farslayer would be far more likely to be his downfall there were certain people in the world oppressors of humanity for whom though he had never met them the youth felt a dislike that threatened always to spill over into personal hatred and if the life of one of those persons wherever they might be should be so helplessly delivered into his hands valdemar feared his own latent capacity for violence yes it would be better if he got rid of this unknown sword at once not tempting himself by looking for the symbol which it must bear upon the hilt valdemars hands quivered because he might for all he knew be holding woundhealer the sword of mercy that glorious possibility was enough to eliminate any thought of plunging the mysterious gift into a crevasse before he had identified it after minutes of immobility the youth with a sudden jerk stripped back the gray cloth completely from the black hilt a small white arrowsymbol pointing upward to the pommel leapt into view neither the best nor the worst of possibilities had been realized the weapon in valdemars hands was wayfinder the sword of wisdom it was also called ardneh grant it bring him that valdemar breathed somewhat more easily toward wayfinder he felt timidity and awe but no overwhelming fear gently he peeled away the remaining wrappings exposing a plain leather sheath without pausing for further thought he clasped the hilt and drew forth a full meter of incomparable doubleedged blade the faint light of fading day and dying fire gleamed softly on steel smoother and sharper than any human armorer had ever crafted at least since the lost civilization of the old world beneath the surface of the metal a lovely mottled pattern was perceptible valdemar ran a tremulous finger along the flat side of the tremendous blade no despite his youth he was no stranger to the touch of magic but he had never in his life felt anything the like of this a happy thought struck suddenly some of the new strain and worry vanished from his youthful face powers who rule this sword he said selfconsciously then paused for a deep breath and started over powers of this sword whoever or whatever you may be i understand that giving guidance is your function guide me therefore guide me to the person to her to the woman i have i have almost despaired of ever finding the one who is most fit most suitable to share my life though he was utterly alone the young man could feel his cheeks warming frowning suddenly he quickly amended let all be done in accordance with the will of ardneh having concluded this awkward speech valdemar arose gripping the black hilt firmly in both of his great hands fingers overlapping tentatively he moved the great blade in a horizontal circle one direction alone almost straight east set the swords tip quivering at the surge of magic he cried out wordlessly for just a moment the movement had become so violent that the weapon had almost leaped free of his grip on a warm spring afternoon seven days after the day when valdemar had unwrapped the sword and more than a hundred kilometers distant from his hut two pilgrims were making their way across a heavily wooded hillside that formed one flank of a deep ravine the first of these grayclad travelers was a woman apparently about sixty years of age but still vigorous and hearty there was nothing feeble in the way she moved across the steep slope among the thicklyspaced narrow trunks her silver hair was long but bound up closely the strains of a long life showed in the womans face but no burden that seemed too much for her present determination like many other female pilgrims or travelers she wore boots trousers and a loose jacket and was armed for selfdefense with a short sword the crowded tree trunks made it all but impossible for two to travel side by side the womans companion who walked three or four paces behind her and carried a similarly serviceable but somewhat more impressive weapon at his belt was a man in his early twenties sturdily built of average size the young mans appearance like the womans suggested both the weariness of long travel and a remaining capacity to deal with formidable difficulties the woman halted suddenly she frowned and squinted at the sun which shone brightly from beyond the canopy of the tall trees small spring leaves then she inspected the terrain as well as she could in the midst of a forest this hill curves round she announced to her fellow traveler at last and i see no end to the curve ahead it carries us farther and farther to the east and that my lady is not the direction in which we want to go the young man responded well then shall we try climbing to the top of the ridge again or going down into the ravine the lady sighed zoltan we are well and truly lost no reason to think the bottom of this ravine will be more hospitable than any of the others weve struggled through during the past two days in those dark gorges the ubiquitous thintrunked trees had grown more closely and ever more closely together until it became impossible for adult humans to force a passage anywhere between them an army of men with axes would have earned their pay clearing a road and no reason either replied zoltan to suppose that the leatherwings are going to let us alone this time if we come out of the trees up on the hilltop he rubbed at his left arm which was still bandaged though fortunately not disabled from their last encounter with flying reptiles two days ago i suppose we might risk trying the hilltop just before sunset the woman said thoughtfully if we were able to see far enough to get our bearings she broke off abruptly holding herself motionless above the high canopy of leaves a silent broadwinged form drifted a halfintelligent enemy cruelclawed and implacably hostile when the windborne reptile had drifted out of sight and hearing zoltan spoke again his voice cautiously low anyway were soon going to need water each was carrying a single small canteen well have to go down into the ravines for that of course this one may be dry but the next he fell silent at the womans imperious gesture her face had abruptly turned away from him and she was listening intently for the repetition of a small sound just detected from ahead in a moment zoltan looking over his companions shoulder could see a tall human shape garbed in dull colors moving among the duncolored trunks still fifty meters off approaching along the hillside both travelers watched in ready silence hands on swordhilts the single figure approaching seemed to be making no effort at stealth the towering broadshouldered man was clad in what appeared to be a farmers rough shirt and trousers and woolen vest in both hands he gripped a longbladed sword with which he steadily swept the air before him zoltan watching felt the hair stir on the back of his neck this could be a sword indeed the stranger continued moving along the slope directly toward the pilgrim pair though as yet he had given no indication that he was aware of their presence zoltan staring at the approaching figure with intense frowning concentration whispered is that shh well see amid the dun trunks the seeker so superbly armed had approached within ten meters of the two motionless travelers in dull gray before he saw them when he did he stopped in his tracks startled continuing to hold the sword leveled in their direction then looking somewhat flustered he grounded the bright point for a long moment all three remained silent at last the young farmer for so his clothing made him appear to be said greetings his voice was soft but the pair who heard him got the impression that only a conscious effort made it so greetings in ardnehs name he was peering closely at the lady and appeared to be trying to conceal growing disappointment and confusion and to you replied the lady may you find peace and truth zoltan at her elbow murmured similar sentiments my object is entirely peaceful the other assured them gesturing with an enormous hand he seemed now to be recovering from his initial shock whatever might have been its cause he was a head taller than most men and of massive build his body carrying a minimum of fat his clothing particularly his boots gave evidence of an extended journey he carried pack and canteen as any traveler most likely would a long plain leather sheath belted at his waist of a size to hold his sword looked vaguely as if it should belong to someone else he added i am called valdemar i am yambu the woman told him simply this is zoltan who has chosen to travel with me we are both pilgrims of a sort the young farmer nodded and smiled acknowledging the information his hair was dark and curly his blue eyes mild flanking an interestingly bent nose the more one looked at him the bigger and stronger he appeared yambu he repeated yes maam his eyes moved on and you are zoltan then some memory visibly caught at valdemar so that his gaze went back to the silverhaired woman an unusual name maam he remarked mine oh yes and an unusual weapon that you are carrying today young sir perhaps valdemar flushed slightly in his weathered face it was hard to be sure lady in my hands i hope this sword is something other than a weapon it has guided me here to you your pardon lady if i aim the blade at you again i promise you i mean no harm taking care to remain at a distance well out of thrusting range valdemar lifted his swords point again all three could see distinctly how the fine blade quivered when it was leveled straight toward yambu the lady did not seem much surprised and what desire of yours she asked does wayfinder expect me to satisfy this time there was no doubt that valdemar was blushing i see you know this swords name so i suppose you know what it is that should that ought to make it easier for me to explain as i said my goal is peaceful i yes i am a farmer lady actually i have a vineyard which i have left untended and i am looking for a wife there was a pause ah said yambu at last a thin smile curved her lips and you confided this wish to the sword of wisdom yes maam and the sword has brought you to me yes maam and i am not quite the bride you have been imagining well rest easy in your mind young man were you to make me a proposal of marriage i would not accept it yes maam repeated valdemar he looked partly relieved and partly chagrined we must discuss this said the lady but just now my companion and i face problems of greater urgency have you experienced any particular difficulty along the way in the last day or two of your journey valdemar blinked at her difficulty no what sort of difficulty oh do you mean bandits the young giant smiled faintly i never worry much about that sort of thing and if there were any who saw me no doubt they kept clear when they saw how i was armed zoltan cleared his throat no trouble in finding your way through this forest perhaps or in dealing with flying reptiles valdemar looked up concerned at the moment the sky was free of drifting shadows no trouble finding my way i simply walked the way wayfinder told me to go and no reptiles of any kind ive never seen one that could fly any kind of trouble none well several times for no good cause that i could see the sword counseled me to change direction and once when i saw no reason not to move on it kept me walking in a tight circle for an hour so in effect i was held in one location but nothing that i would call trouble why then would you now ask your sword put in yambu gently to put aside for the moment the matter of your bridetobe and lead us all three safely out of this damned wildwood openmouthed valdemar gazed at her for a long moment then he nodded less than an hour later all three travelers were resting comfortably at the bottom of another ravine where a spring of clear water bubbled gently out of a crevice between rocks and the trees grew just closely enough together to keep all sizable airborne creatures at a safe distance yambu and zoltan had already satisfied their thirst at the spring and were now refilling their canteens valdemar meanwhile had sheathed his elegant weapon and was bringing out generous portions of dried meat and hard bread from his pack far upslope too far to be of immediate concern an ominous silent shadow drifted overhead above the canopy of leaves drifted and came back and went away again as if it were no longer certain of where its prey might be those creatures hunt us young man said yambu almost in a whisper leatherwings and sometimes worse than that you say you have never seen them before i know them only by reputation the youthful giant looked vaguely horrified and at the same time fascinated but not particularly afraid why do they hunt you i believe they are in the service of some much more formidable enemy serving as his scouts then too it is my belief that any of the twelve swords tends to draw trouble to itself and that one you are carrying in particular and yet i have asked this sword only to help me find a bride and now to guide all three of us to safety valdemar seemed more disappointed and gently puzzled than alarmed by yambus reading of their situation youve heard the song of swords you remember how the verse about this one goes zoltan asked him and without waiting for an answer proceeded to recite in a low voice who holds wayfinder finds good roads its masters step is brisk the sword of wisdom lightens loads but adds unto their risk valdemar concluded yes ive heard that song since i was a child never thinking the gigantic youth let the matter drop then he looked at the silverhaired woman again his gaze was timid but resolute i can remember hearing long ago he remarked of a lady named yambu who was once known as the silver queen she who bore that name ignored the invitation to discuss her past having finished filling her canteen she sat at ease on the mossy bank beside the spring zoltan and i thank you for your help young man she said graciously where will you ask your sword to point you next and may i ask you just where and how wayfinder came into your possession valdemar looked up at the treetops i still seek a wife he declared stubbornly why this sword has led me to you lady i confess i do not understand there may be an easy explanation when the object sought is otherwise impossible or very difficult to obtain directly wayfinder leads its master first to the necessary means to bring the goal within reach you may be sure the sword of wisdom is not suggesting that you propose marriage to me who could be your grandmother at least let us hope not sword or no that would be far from wise besides i have no wish to spend my last years growing grapes why then has wayfinder brought me to you yambu shook her head it would seem that somehow i do not know how i can help you to achieve your goal valdemar sighed more to himself than to the others he murmured i will now repeat my first request i want this sword to lead me to the woman of all the women on earth who will be the perfect the ideal wife for me nothing more and nothing less and he drew wayfinder from its sheath and held it out again in his great hands once more the point reacted quivering only when it was aimed precisely at the lady without comment the young giant resheathed the sword of wisdom at his waist giving up the puzzle for the moment he recounted to his new companions the story of his enigmatic visitor seven days past he concluded with a question has either of you any idea who my strange caller might have been it was someone who wore gray even as you do thats all i could really see zoltan and yambu looked at each other zoltan shrugged the lady said a number of ideas but no reason to take any of them seriously her young companion nodded certainly it was neither of us if you are thinking that a week ago we were nowhere near the region where you say you live as for wearing gray uncountable thousands of folk do that your own garments have acquired something of that tinge from travel the bigger young man nodded ruefully then can either of you guess why this sword should have led me to you zoltan only shook his head i think yambu told valdemar you will have to be patient if you want an answer to that question it may be that the answer will never become clear even if you do find your wife valdemar took thought running long fingers through his dark curly hair a sparse beard was beginning to sprout on his youthful cheeks then almost shyly he inquired might it have anything to do with the fact that as i said before a lady with your name was once the silver queen but i had thought yambu nodded impatiently very well my history is no great secret that was once my title but i dont know why my past good or bad should have anything much to do with a young man who raises grapes and seeks a bride you would have expected the silver queen to be a somewhat younger woman hold soulcutter in your hands my friend throughout a day of battle and you will be fortunate indeed if you do not look worse than i do now young valdemar indeed looked awed i apologize my lady for what must seem unwarranted curiosity no apology is necessary the peasantlooking youth frowned for a while at the weapon hanging from his belt then he said perhaps i must take the swords bringing me to you to mean that i should stay with you until it tells me otherwise perhaps it even means that i should turn over wayfinder and its powers to you yambu was frowning too impulsively valdemar said let us try that in a moment he had unbelted his sword and was gallantly proffering the black hilt in her direction the sheathed blade balanced flat across his forearm quietly she responded i do not know that you have hit on the right interpretation young man but on the other hand why should i fear this sword her lips moved again almost silently only zoltan who was close beside her could hear her very low whisper yet i do a moment later she was reaching out to firmly grasp wayfinders hilt having accepted the weapon and drawn it from its sheath yambu stood up straight her voice becoming a little louder it is a long time since i have felt the power of any sword in my hands well sword of wisdom here you are and here am i if you can read my heart show me the way which i must go to satisfy it the silver queen held out the blade in a strong twohanded grip then swept it around the horizon in unconscious imitation of valdemars first gesticulation with the weapon seven days ago in her hands wayfinders keen point quivered at one point of the compass only almost straight east yambu let the tip of the heavy blade sag to the earth she said to valdemar i am favored with a definite reply now do you want me to give you this weapon back to the surprise of both the others the giant youth put both his hands behind him as if to make things difficult for anyone who meant to thrust the black hilt back into his possession he said my lady i wonder yes might the swords response to me mean that i am to stay with you at least for a time travel with you yambu thought about it it brought you all this way to me i suppose it might mean something of the sort she conceded at length as if reluctantly and just now in your hands wayfinder pointed east do you know what lies in that direction yambu smiled half of the world she said zoltan with his head tipped back was leaning alternately to right and left trying to peer upward through the canopy of leaves he said some days ago we two were discussing the question of our destination the true object of our pilgrimage in philosophical terms then we began to be hunted being hunted limits ones time for philosophical discussion in the process of trying to escape from the reptiles we became lost valdemar youve helped us now to temporary safety but as a practical matter i must say that our next goal whether east or west ought to be some place of greater security somewhere completely out of the ken of those whose creatures stalk and harry us valdemar looked from one to the other of his new companions trying to assess the situation there was no doubting the reality of those drifting shadows that kept reappearing no very great distance up the hill and who might your enemies be he asked with concern there are a number of possibilities said yambu drily again she took up the sword in both hands but let us not become obsessed with safety we are going east two hurled to the ends of the earth you say astride a demon the speaker a startlingly handsome and apparently very youthful man gave every indication that he found the prospect hugely amusing yes to the ends of the earth or farther for all i know that was months ago of course and neither the dark king nor his demonic steed have been heard from since the youthfullooking mans informant a short blond woman or girl who appeared even younger than he flashed a bright grin of her own is it not entertaining master wood the two who spoke with such apparent carelessness of sorcerers and demons fate were standing casually just outside the massive outer wall of the world headquarters of the blue temple the man was actually leaning against the buildings stones squat granite columns each thicker than the length of a mans body and broad stone steps leading up to doors worthy of a fortress made the establishment an archetype of the substantial or perhaps even a parody of such the two appeared to be waiting for something but what that might be or why they had chosen this spot to hold their talk was not immediately obvious the handsome young man nodded his large athletic looking body was well dressed in tunic and cloak of rich fabric though of no outstanding elegance he might have been a prosperous merchant or perhaps a physician surely not a warrior for no trace of any material weapon was visible about his person he said entertaining yes the demon was hurled away i suppose by the emperors name in the mouth of the emperors bastard and that poor pretender of a magician who likes to ride on demons was whisked away helplessly with his mount the young man laughed again louder than before and this time his companion laughed with him she was garbed in a tightfitting outfit of silver and blue that showed off her fine figure to advantage the clothing suggested an expensive courtesan the heads of passersby turned in their direction such merriment was uncommon here in the blue temple precincts both parties to the conversation ignored the passersby even as they appeared to be ignoring the blue temple itself but he who had been addressed as master wood soon sobered from his laughter he stroked his chin in thought almost wistfully he said and yet tigris an alliance with vilkata might well have been to our benefit tigris had already assumed a more thoughtful expression too she responded he may be able to return master sooner or later or if he cannot come back unaided we might help him that may still be possible yet i fear that the dark king was or is something of a bungler considerable skill in handling demons one must admit that considerable but finally insufficient amended the other yes master as i say finally insufficient the shapely young woman nodded soberly and one of the swords went with vilkata yes master the mindsword as you well know wood allowed his displeasure at that accident to show he had particularly coveted that weapon for his own then he brightened slightly well none of that can be helped now today we face other problems quite sufficient to claim our full attention for a tune as you so accurately say my lord in the bustle of the populous city even a pair of such striking appearance did not draw a great deal of attention once or twice a beggar started to approach them then as if warned by some instinct veered away once a sedan chair guarded on both sides by a file of mounted men passed very close to them entering the blue temple headquarters through a nearby gate the man called wood appeared equally indifferent to potentate and mendicants so he mused our erstwhile rival vilkata the dark king is probably not going to be available in the foreseeable future to discuss alliances nor is the demon who bore him away into ought we to say into eternity nor i suppose can we hope to recruit any other demons from the dark kings retinue woods voice became abstracted thats all right though i can summon powers enough of my own whenever theres a need yes master certainly you can impish little tigris nodded violently squinting at her her master thought to himself that she was almost certain to prove something of a distraction in the staid blue temple offices into which he planned to bring her very soon very likely wood considered he would have to dismiss tigris or else effect a drastic though temporary change in her appearance before the conference got very far but that decision did not have to be made now the girl began to fidget as if rendered uncomfortable by an overabundance of energy she moved a step away and with a dancing glide came back again if it is permitted to ask master why are we waiting are those moneybags in the blue temple expecting us at a particular time the young man grinned he was not really a young man for even now his eyes looked very old my dear tigris they are not expecting us at all i expect that an unannounced arrival will produce a more cooperative attitude on their part once they have recovered from their initial yes this last word was not addressed to tigris but to a sudden blurring of the atmosphere approximately a meter above her blond head out of this miniature aerial vortex proceeded a tiny inhuman voice speaking to wood in squeaky deferential tones the man hyrcanus is now alone master inside his private office do you wish me to accompany you inside the building yes but see that you remain invisible and impalpable in there unless of course you hear me suggest otherwise wood was standing erect now the air of indolence having fallen from him like a shed cloak tigris the disturbance was already gone from the air above her head ready as always master wood gestured and their two human bodies instantaneously disappeared the locus of their reappearance a moment later was a tall narrow dimly lighted chamber deep in the bowels of blue temple headquarters though the room was obviously only an anteroom of some sort the visitors found it elegantly furnished with a thick carpet underfoot the walls were paneled in exotic wood subtly lighted by old world lamps that burned inside their glassy shells with a cold and practically inexhaustible secret fire wood and tigris came into existence standing side by side and almost hand in hand before a cluttered desk behind which a male clerk or secretary looked up in petrifaction at their unanticipated presence the thin man in a tunic of blue and gold stared at them uncomprehendingly his eyes watering as if from long perusal of crabbed handwriting and columned numbers even now in what must have been a state of shock the words that fell from his lips were trite perhaps it had been a long long time since he had spoken any words that were not clearing his throat the clerk said in a cracked voice er you have an appointment wood smiled impishly i have just made one yes er the name sir er madam im hardly that and tigris giggled the assured undeniable presence of the pair seemed to place them beyond the scope of any fundamental challenge i will see i will er almost choking in confusion the clerk bowed himself away through a door leading to an inner office the two visitors exchanged looks of amusement a few moments later the thin man was back ushering wood and tigris into the next room there they confronted the chairman of the blue temple himself a man known to the world by the single name of hyrcanus here in the inner sanctum of power the furnishings were more sumptuous though still restrained their every detail tastefully thought out wood had expected nothing more or less but tigris was somewhat surprised i thought to see more gold and jewels she murmured wood shook his head slightly he understood that splendor here would have been out of place the finest appointments could have done no more than hint at the immensity of the temples wealth the chairman was small rubicund and bald with a round ageless face and a jovial expression belied by his iceblue eyes he was seated flanked by ivory statues of midas and croesus behind an enormous desk engaged in counting up some kind of tiles or tokens a large abacus of colored wood in several shades stood at the chairmans elbow the walls of the chamber were lined with account books and other records some of them visibly dusty spiders had established themselves in at least two of the rooms upper corners the windows were barred and were so high and dark that it was impossible for ordinary human eyes to see outside raising his gaze from his desk hyrcanus stared at wood in utter blankness for a long moment his eyebrows rose when he looked at tigris then he snapped irritably at his visitors who are you what are you doing here i have made no appointment for this hour but i wood retorted have made one to see you such a response from an utter stranger evidently could not be made to fit into the chairmans view of lifes possibilities hyrcanus fixed a stern gaze upon his shaken underling the thin clerk who still hovered near what possessed you to schedule an appointment at this time the mans fingers fumbled with imaginary knots in the air before him sir i i have scheduled no appointment i thought perhaps that you had done so privately i have no idea who these people are my name is wood said the male visitor in a languid voice speaking directly to hyrcanus i should think it almost impossible that you have not heard of me the name took a moment to sink in then with a slight movement of one foot beneath his desk a gesture quite imperceptible to ordinary visitors the chairman sent a signal wood made a generous openhanded gesture by all means he encouraged with a slight nod summon whatever help will make you feel secure tigris at her masters elbow giggled it was a small sound almost shy in response to the chairmans urgent signal there ensued a subtle interplay of powers within the chambers dusty air much of it beyond the reach of the chairmans senses or those of his secretary powers charged with the magical defense of this room and edifice clashed briefly trying immaterial lances with the invisible escort of the two human visitors the trial was brief but quite conclusive the defenders of the temple retreated cowed moments later came sounds of hurried human movement in an adjoining room a door not the one through which the callers had come in opened quietly and another bald man this one obviously elderly looked in with a wary expression i assume tigris said to him smiling brightly that you must be the director of security she almost curtsied the newcomer glanced at her frowned and kept silent looking to his chief for orders i would like to know hyrcanus grated at him how these two got in here the man in the doorway cleared his throat sir i recognize this man as the wellknown wizard wood the woman with him he has already told me his name hyrcanus interrupted what i want to know is how and someday perhaps i will tell you how we got in said wood interrupting the interrupter but there are other matters i wish to discuss first the director of security seemingly unimpressed stared at his fellow magician i know your name and i warn you that you had better leave at once you warn me the elder nodded impressively his face had become lugubrious i am indeed the director of security here we here do not fear your powers woods eyes were twinkling dangerously only because you do not comprehend them i believe the director remarked drily that you are the same wood who about two years ago visited shas casino a red temple establishment in the city of bihari and so on that occasion correct me sir if i am wrong you encountered certain enemies and were forced to make a swift retreat it has further come to my attention that you entered shas casino armed with the sword shieldbreaker and that you left without that weapon and lacking any compensation for it the elderly man in the doorway smirked faintly tigris looking at her master paled a trifle wood put his fists on his hips his voice was ice on that occasion my man i was opposed by forces well beyond your ability let alone that of your moneygrubbing masters here to understand much less to deal with a moment of silence followed it was plain from their expressions that woods current hearers except for tigris of course remained unconvinced the wizard nodded briskly very well then i see that a demonstration will be necessary the directors expression became uncertain hyrcanus behind his desk started to say something then remained quiet silence held for a long moment woods eyes closed his left hand extended slightly in front of him palm upward the long ringers quivered then the hand moved and the forearm slowly made a gentle lifting gesture near the high ceiling an almost imperceptible turmoil in the air grew briefly lightly sharper in moments this gentle disturbance was answered by a much heavier vibration an inhuman groaning and thudding seemed to start in the roots of the huge building and progress slowly upward soon distant frightened yells could be heard rising from somewhere below the thickly carpeted office floor tigris was smiling faintly now watching the blue temple men for their reaction neither of them had moved though the eyes of the chairman seemed about to pop woods face his eyes still closed had hardened into an implacable mask the door to the secretarys anteroom burst open to frame the large form of an armed guard officer sir the gold the man had trouble finishing his sentence hyrcanus snapped what of the gold the guard turned halfway round gesturing over one beefy shoulder its coming up the stairs the chairman leapt up from his chair trying to see out past him the deepest rumbling which had begun down around the massive vaulted foundations of this mother temple was now gradually shaping itself into a heavy metallic rhythm it sounded like a company perhaps a regiment of heavy infantry clad in armor marching upstairs in close formation there were continued cries of alarm and more security people came pressing up behind the officer in the doorway hyrcanus started to come around from behind his desk and then went back the guards now crowding the doorway were pushed aside but not by human force bursting past them into the chairmans private office came moving gold coins and bars and works of art all moving as if alive the yellow treasure had somehow been conglomerated magically held together into the shape of a huge and heavy manylegged creature a gigantic centipede at intervals this animation broke apart into separate marching figures all headless some in the shape of men and some of beasts whether in the form of many bodies or only one the gold tramped upward and forward the several shapes enlivened by woods magic all glowing dull yellow in this chambers parsimonious light the director of security jabbering incantations avoided the score of trampling golden legs gesturing he intensified his magical efforts to undo what wood was doing but it was obvious to all that the directors attempted counterspells were failing miserably losing his temper he rushed at his rival that was a serious mistake halfway toward the object of his wrath the director slowed then staggered to a halt it was as if he had forgotten where he was going worse than that it was as if he had almost forgotten how to walk turning now to hyrcanus and then to all the others in the room a smile of infantile imbecility the director of security sank slowly into the nearest chair simpering vacuously at nothing he appeared ready to be entertained by whatever might happen next his eyes lighted on the inexorably marching metal gold the old man whispered obviously delighted pretty pretty meanwhile wood his arms folded had turned away from the director and sat down on the edge of hyrcanuss desk he was watching the proceedings with an abstracted look as if he were not personally very much involved tigris taking her cue from her master was now seated also in a leather chair from a purse that had appeared as if from nowhere she had actually brought out some knitting with which she appeared to be fully occupied with the intrusion of the marching gold and the ruthless disabling of his first assistant hyrcanus abandoned all pretense of calm control he jumped up onto his desk with screams he rebuked his security forces then he turned to wood pleading put the gold back send it back at once and you will listen to me if i do of course of course and this fool here the chairman indicated his chief aide now smiling as he counted up his fingers can you restore him to what ordinarily serves him as his right mind if you will listen i will i swear it by croesus and midas what was it you wanted to discuss accepting this surrender graciously wood slid off the desk and with a few gestures quickly restored blue temple headquarters more or less to normality the weird upward progress of longhidden treasure ceased the marching golden centipede and all its fragments immediately obedient to woods most subtle command reversed direction and headed docilely downstairs and at the same time the director lost his carefree interest in his own fingers his eyes closed and his head sank slumberously upon his chest within moments after the tramping treasure had retreated the building ceased to vibrate inside the chairmans office only the shouts of guards somewhere in the middle distance remained as evidence that something remarkable had occurred slowly shakily chairman hyrcanus resumed his seat behind his desk he wiped his brow with a gesture and a few muttered words he offered wood and tigris chairs the three were now alone with the opposition satisfactorily crushed wood was calm and reassuring he glanced at the director who was snoring faintly he will regain his wits such as they were then wood focused an intense look on the chairman hyrcanus understand me your wealth is safe for the time being safe from me at least every coin is now back where it was i do not crave blue temple gold or any other treasure you may possess hyrcanus smiling glassily murmured an excuse then turning away momentarily he beckoned the clerk to him from the next room and dispatched the man with orders to take a complete inventory of the wealth down below wood shook his head impatiently at this interruption depend upon it hyrcanus not a gram of your metal will be missing i am not your enemy rather we have enemies in common and therefore should be allies the chairman brightened a trifle yes enemies in common certainly we do tigris had put aside her knitting and was now sitting with folded hands paying close attention to the men her master said to hyrcanus i am thinking in particular of prince mark of tasavalta i suppose you may rejoice almost as much as i do over his recent misfortunes the chairman relaxing just a little nodded heartily his formidable visitor said i am told that mark is making every possible effort so far to no avail to heal his wife of the injuries she sustained last year a pity said hyrcanus and uttered a dry sound intended for a laugh indeed my agents assure me that princess kristin is hopelessly crippled and in continual pain the only real hope of ever helping her lies in the sword woundhealer mention of the sword concentrated the attention of the redfaced man behind the desk ah and where is woundhealer now woods eyes twinkled again your question brings us to the very point of my visit the best hope of anyones getting woundhealer in hand lies in the sword wayfinder would you not agree hyrcanus responded cautiously it is said that wayfinder can guide its holder to any goal he wishes even as has happened at least once in the past into the deepest blue temple vaults of all but i have no wish to remind you and your associates of past sufferings and embarrassments hyrcanus i have come here to offer you a partnership what sort of partnership the details can be worked out later if you will agree with me now in principle you were already chairman of the blue temple nineteen years ago at the time of the great robbery i believe i am correct in thinking that you and other insiders still consider that the worst disaster that your temple has ever suffered the chairmans face grew somewhat redder let us say for the sake of argument that you are right what then wood put on a sympathetic expression and ben of purkinje the wretch who was chiefly responsible for that calamity still lives and prospers as the righthand man of our mutual enemy mark of tasavalta the chairman nodded gloomily ever since mark had become prince of that generally prosperous domain there had been no new blue temple installations at all in tasavalta the organization maintained in that land only a single banking facility relatively unprofitable in the capital city of sarykam tigris so far had been maintaining a demure demeanor so it had not become necessary for wood to banish her or take any steps to alter her appearance brightly and alertly she continued to pay attention to everything that was said and done between her master and their reluctant hosts genialsounding wood now inquired after the health of legendary old benambra founder an age ago of the blue temple hyrcanus assured his guests that the founder was still very much alive more or less alive by most peoples standards since he was now turned completely into a whitehands and lived underground somewhere jealously counting up the bulk of his remaining treasure then the current chairman supremely stingy unless he made an effort not to be belatedly ordered some refreshment to be served presently while the director of security by stirrings and mumblings gave indications that he might soon awaken wood smoothly returned to the subject of the sword of wisdom you the blue temple authorities have certainly known for a long time that wayfinder was used by those daring thieves to despoil your hoard well yes for years you have been keeping a jealous watch for that sword in every quarter of the world ready to try to seize it as soon as it should appear again the director of security had by now risen and stretched and finally resettled himself in a chair at a little distance much chastened in his manner whether he was aware of what had just happened to him or not he was evidently grimly determined to keep an eye on wood as long as the intruder remained now the director said wayfinders vanishing as you probably know was utterly mysterious the only report we have admittedly unconfirmed says that the sword of wisdom was stolen by some unknown agent from the belt of the god hermes after he had been struck down by farslayer everyone in the room was silent for a moment no doubt meditating on that unlikelysounding but undeniable event yes i know wood answered patiently though he had not been personally present at the fall of hermes he stood ready to accept that story as confirmed the slight jowls of the chairman of the blue temple were quivering the treasure we lost at that time including three swords has never been recovered i know that too the handsome youthfullooking wood was now doing his best to soothe his hosts tigris looked sympathetic too wood continued how unjust how odious that the robbers should have been able to prosper as they have odious is an inadequate word said hyrcanus fervently but let us get down to business wood with a smile and gesture indicated that he was perfectly ready to do just that the official inquired what exactly do you want from the blue temple that you have taken these uh drastic steps to bring about this conference wood smiled his answer was straightforward or at least it seemed to be i want no more than i have already indicated a chance to use wayfinder for my own purposes which will in no way conflict with yours a league of mutual assistance against tasavalta and against the emperor blank looks on the faces of the blue temple functionaries greeted woods last assertion he was silently contemptuous of their ignorance but not really surprised the blue temple evidently knew little about the emperor and seemed to care less or perhaps their lack of interest was only feigned like the ancient one himself they must be aware of certain recurrent rumors concerning the enormous treasure that potentate was reported to have stashed away but the problems posed by the emperor could wait spelling out his proposal in a straightforward way the wizard confirmed that he wanted to be informed as soon as any of the blue temple people had any knowledge or even a clue concerning the whereabouts of the sword of wisdom i am aware that you have had your people on the alert everywhere around the world or at least across this continent for years now for any evidence concerning that sword no matter what kind of defences you devise for your vast remaining treasure wayfinder can probably find a way to let another bold and clever robber in hyrcanus groaned audibly less than half an hour later the meeting concluded with wood and hyrcanus shaking hands while their respective aides looked on watchfully both leaders pronounced their satisfaction with the agreement they had reached outside blue temple headquarters again their removal having been effected without the use of any mundane door wood and tigris strolled the streets in silence until they were rejoined by the demon dactylartha noble masters hissed the tiny voice coming out of the barely visible disturbance in the air was my performance satisfactory at least you will not be punished for it wood spoke abstractedly his main thought already elsewhere madam tigris dactylartha pleaded softly did i not do well as our master has said she responded curtly did your old rulers recognize you do you suppose dactylartha this terrible creature she remembered had once been blue temple property involved in the famous robbery on which occasion the demon had failed as dismally as all the other layers of defense of the main hoard that did not mean of course that dactylartha was weak or ineffective against any one of the swords only failure could generally be expected unless of course one was armed with another sword a dangerous being to recruit tigris though her own skills in enchantment were great was not sure she could have controlled the thing without her masters help wood now giving the thing its new orders curtly dismissed it and in a moment it was gone what are you thinking about my dear the ancient one inquired you look pensive about demons master ah yes demons well as a rule one kills them or has some firm means of control or is as nice to them as possible that is about all there is to know on the subject and wood laughed a hissing sound that might have come from the throat of one of the very creatures he was contemplating tigris changed the subject which of the twelve swords would you most like to possess master ah now that that is indeed a question the ancient one mused in silence for a few paces then he said to tigris theres soulcutter of course i certainly wouldnt want to draw that little toy with my own hands having heard what has happened to others the trick of course would be to get someone else to draw it under the proper circumstances i understand perfectly my lord do you good as for the sword of wisdom i confess to you my dear that i nourish a certain hope that on coming into possession of that weapon i will be able to use it to lead me to the emperor tigris wondered briefly whether she ought to pretend to be surprised in the end she decided not to do so she asked instead what swords does the emperor have none that i can determine with any certainty tigris flattering then of the two greatest magicians in the world neither now has any sword it was true that her master wood at the moment had not a single sword to call his own while prince mark of tasavalta gallingly had no less than four tigris was taking great care not to remind her master directly of this latter fact he grunted something for the moment sounding completely human a mode of existence he did not always appear to favor where to now master to a place where i trust we will not be interrupted tigris we have work to do three morning had arrived and ben of purkinje was enduring an enormous headache he sat up slowly further tormented by a fierce itching particles of the hay in which he had been sleeping had worked their way into his clothing according to the feeling in his head the hour ought not to be much past midnight but the exterior world ruthlessly assured him that a new day had indeed begun the cavernous interior of the barn in which he had sought shelter was now becoming faintly visible venerable roughhewn beams and gray wall planks bathed in an illumination that could only be that of dawn intermittent crowing noises now issuing from the adjacent barnyard offered confirming evidence the noises were there but ben was reasonably sure that they had not awakened him they were completely routine and he had been too deeply asleep to be roused by anything so ordinary too deeply asleep indeed unconscious he thought would be a better word for it recalling some of last nights adventures in the local tavern he wondered if the second or third girl to sit on his lap might have put something unfriendly in his ale the first as ben recalled had been almost unconscious herself at the time and he thought he could exclude her from the list of suspects he doubted that any of last nights girls would have played a dirty trick like that on her own accord someone would have put her up to it ben clenched his eyelids shut again his memories of last night were somewhat hazed he went prowling through that fog in search of his newlymet drinking companions they had been three or four youngish men who had had the look of bandits or if not bandits of people who had no higher moral standard than they found absolutely necessary for survival a couple of them perhaps not realizing what a formidable opponent they had encountered had challenged ben to a drinking contest before that had been carried to a conclusion the tavern girls had taken a notion to sit on his lap first in sequence then together or had that been his own suggestion but of course nothing could be done about any of that now if in fact someone had tried to drug his drink he had survived the effort this was morning and at least it wasnt raining he would have heard that on the barn roof trouble was the first subtle indications of this fine spring morning were that things were not going to go well today for ben of purkinje known in recent years as ben of sarykam right now he feared that his headache might be the least of todays problems because certain sounds outside this borrowed barn were like those of no ordinary farmyard in the early morning these were the noises he now felt sure which had awakened him these ominous mutterings and footfalls evoked for ben the presence of a number of men maybe half a dozen or even more clumsily exchanging lowvoiced words with undertones of urgency muttering and then separating spreading out moving quickly but quietly as if they meant to get the barn surrounded that was not at all a reassuring image getting off to a bad start as he seemed to be this morning ben hoped that no one today was going to call him by any name that mentioned either purkinje or sarykam as soon as anyone did that he would know that the false identity under which he was currently traveling had been penetrated not that he had much hope for the false identity anyway it had been a resort of desperation conceived on the spur of the moment several days ago when other plans had at last gone desperately and completely wrong a man who weighed close to a hundred and forty kilos and looked capable and was of twisting a ridingbeasts iron shoe into scrap with his bare hands tended to attract attention for such a man ordinary disguises were seldom of much avail bens worst suspicions were presently nourished by new evidence if he had been in the least danger of drifting back to sleep and with a start he realized that he just might have been that peril was destroyed by a loud call in a hoarse male voice coming from somewhere not far outside the barn the words were meant for him the man outside was threatening to fire the wooden structure if he didnt immediately come out and surrender the bass roar was almost instantly repeated ben of purkinje we know yer in there despite the beseiged mans huge size he came up to his feet softly and promptly amid the hay the wooden floor of the hayloft creaking under the shift of weight at the same time he took a quick inventory of assets through recent misfortunes his personal weaponry apart from his own mind and body had been reduced to one middlesized dagger leaving the dagger at his belt he caught sight of a pitchfork not far away and swiftly and softly took possession of it a certain urgency within his bladder next demanded his attention all the more so with impending combat probable relieving himself quietly into the hay regretting the lack of heroic capacity that might have served to put out a fire ben listened for more shouts but for the moment could hear only the throbbing of his aching head doing his best to give the situation careful thought he decided that allowing or encouraging the barn to burn down around him would be a waste of time for all concerned and a waste of some perhaps innocent farmers property as well ben had no real idea how many of last nights companions and their friends might be outside what sounded like the clumsy muttering of six or eight might instead be a much cleverer attempt by two or three men to suggest greater numbers well he would soon find out how many men were outside and whether they were bluffing he would go out and see but he would do so without announcing his real intention first ready for action now he bellowed a defiant challenge to the effect that if they wanted him they were going to have to come in and get him then as quietly as possible he slid down the ladder from the hayloft to the dirt floor of the barn and then pitchfork in hand he came out fighting bens youth was behind him but he could still run faster than anyone would be likely to expect from a man of his size he went out moving fast and hard through a small door in what he would have called the rear of the barn the suggestion of numbers he saw with a sinking feeling had been no bluff at least five armed men were waiting for him among the manure piles the back but at first they recoiled from him and his pitchfork yelling the bass voice that had commanded ben to give up now shouted orders meant for other ears screaming hoarsely that if they wanted to survive this day themselves they had better take this fellow alive these commands and threats were issuing from a squat oaken hogshead of a man somewhat shorter than ben himself but apparently little if any lighter not one of last nights tavern companions ben would have remembered this one ben now had his back against the barn wall hemmed in by a semicircle of lesser men most of them fiercelooking enough to inspire some measure of respect they kept him at bay turning this way and that while feints came at ben from right and left at the same time one of them got almost behind him with a clever rope a moment later bens pitchfork had been lassoed and a few moments after that several strong hands had fastened on him and his dagger was plucked from his belt we got him sarge but in the next instant ben proved to those who grasped his arms and legs that they really hadnt not quite not yet he used his arms to crack a pair of heads together with great energy the blade of a very keenlooking knife coming up under his throat stopped this effort one of the sarges wrists prodigiously thick and hairy came into bens field of vision the enemy leader striking out at his own knifewielding man seemed to have suddenly become bens ally alive i says hes the one blue temple wants that name made ben redouble his efforts to break loose it was useless though he might have been able to fight off two or three of the illclad illequipped bandits at a time and the remainder of them might have been poorly coordinated or plain cowardly enough to stay at a safe distance but when the sarge himself jumped in and grabbed him using the biggest hands that ben had ever seen or felt while two of his more stubborn minions still clung on ben no longer had any chance of wrestling free this time he was down flat on his back raising his head as well as he was able he peered through a drifting haze of dust and barnyard chaff to take a count there were six or eight of them altogether and two of them at least the ones whose heads hed banged were just as flat as he was he hadnt done so badly at that now though four or five held ben more or less in position and another was commencing operations with a coil of thin rope brought from the barn tying his wrists skillfully behind his back ben looking at the world through a reddish haze of exhaustion his chest heaving his pulse thudding in his ears had the sudden notion that at fortytwo give or take a year or so he was definitely getting too old for this kind of thing now bens arms immobilized a couple of his stronger captors took him by the arms and heaved him to his feet it seemed there were going to be formal introductions sergeant brod growled the walking hogshead standing directly in front of ben and extending one enormous hand as if ben ought to be able to snap free of his bonds and shake it better known to some of me own followers as the sarge i am the leader of this small but efficient band pleased to meet you said ben squinting at brod and the men who surrounded him ben decided that brods men all appeared to be more or less afraid of him and with some cause brods coloring was fair right now still redfaced from his recent efforts his features were fairly regular except for a nose that approached the size to qualify as a disfiguring defect fancy tattoos adorned the sarges massive shoulders which bulged out of a sleeveless leather vest his dirty hair some indeterminate shade between blond and red was tied in long pigtails from inside his vault of a chest his bass voice rasped out what sounded like an accusation youre ben of purkinje ben blew a tickle of straw free of his upper lip trying to get his breathing back to normal he replied as nonchalantly as he could you have the wrong man my name is charles and im a blacksmith the sarge had a good laugh he really enjoyed that one aye and my names really buttercup and i sell cobwebs for a living fists on hips he sized up his prisoners size and shape and appeared delighted with what he saw he clouted ben a friendly buffet on the shoulder rocking him on his planted feet in another minute the little gang was on the march away from barn and farmyard ben arms bound marched in the middle of the group no one bothered to grip his arms now he wasnt going to run away from snatches of conversation between sergeant brod and his followers he gathered that he was being held for delivery to certain representatives of the blue temple who had a standing offer of a great reward for the live body of ben of purkinje or some lesser amount for that body dead to ben the proposed transaction sounded all too convincing that the blue temple wanted him was easy to believe but that those notorious skinflints would consider paying any reward at all was frightening it showed how badly they craved getting their hands on him the little band of freebooters ben still with his arms tied in their midst were angling downhill approaching the goodsized river which ran only a couple of hundred meters from the barn on the near bank ben saw a flatboat tied up it was a crudely constructed craft a score of paces long half that distance wide fashioned mostly of unpeeled logs as soon as it became obvious that he was being escorted right to the boat ben stumbled then he dug in his feet or gave the impression of trying to do so where are we going he demanded just a little cruise roughly he was pushed along on being taken aboard the flatboat the prisoner gave every indication of trying to disguise a deep distrust of water edging reflexively toward the center of the crude plank deck one of the gang watching him with shrewd malice probing for a weakness smiling slyly asked him dont care for the water ben a nervous expression on his ugly face turned to his questioner not much of a swimmer he admitted they were willing to let him sit down approximately amidships there was a little freight on board as well a couple of barrowloads of unidentifiable cargo tied down under a tarpaulin from where ben was sitting he could see one small rowboat stowed bottomup on the broad deck it looked serviceable he couldnt see any oars ben considered making a serious effort to break his bonds having got a look at the old rope before they used it he thought that doing so would not be completely beyond the bounds of possibility but any such effort would have to wait until he was unwatched while the men began what seemed an unfamiliar process of casting off the sarge as if he wanted to talk came to sit on a small box facing ben any effort at breaking ropes would have to be postponed ben ready to try a different tactic announced if i were this fellow from purkinje or wherever why my friends might pay a better price for me even than my enemies maybe brod sounded doubtful of that proposition to say the least did you ever try to get money for anything out of the blue temple the other looked at his prisoner thoughtfully i know what you mean friend but theyll pay this time in advance or they wont get you sides weve contracted to do another little job for them whats that the answer had to be postponed brod rose to supervise his unskilled crews efforts to get the boat free of the shore by dint of much poling and the blaspheming of many gods along with energetic sweeps of the four long steering oars the flatboat was at last dislodged from the riverbank and under way downstream ben was no great expert in these matters but in his judgment the men manning the sweeps and poles were being pretty clumsy about it the difficulty wasnt entirely their fault though obviously this craft had been designed for use somewhere upriver maybe for ferrying livestock about and had somehow been taken over by these goons who were riding it downriver into waters somewhat rougher than those for which it had been built at about this time ben noticed a distracting presence one he certainly didnt need just now maneuvering on the outskirts of the scene this was a large grayfeathered bird and with a sinking feeling he recognized it as a winged messenger from sarykam at any other time he would have been pleased to get some word from home and to have an opportunity to send word back just now though the hovering presence of the courier threatened the last faint credibility of his pose as charles the smith perhaps the creature was bright enough to understand this in some dim way as if unable to make up its small mind whether or not to communicate with ben the bird came no nearer than the bottom of the upended rowboat where it perched uncertainly and cocked its smallbrained head at him presently one of the bandits threw a chip of wood at it causing it to take wing for the shore but after being driven from the boat the messenger just flew along the shore from tree to tree at a little distance brod had noted the birds presence and was evidently shrewd enough to understand what it signified reckon maybe it wants some blacksmithin done new shoes maybe so it can run like a ridingbeast the sarge enjoyed another laugh ben did his best to pretend he didnt know what bird brod was talking about several hours passed in uneventful voyaging with the current bearing the clumsy craft downstream at a good pace a tributary came in on the east bank and the river ben had never learned its name broadened appreciably rocky hills on the horizon ahead suggested that the water might get rougher there when this river became narrower and swifter forcing itself between them still the grayfeathered messenger effortlessly kept pace darting from tree to tree along the shore trying to put that problem out of his thoughts for the time being ben considered sergeant brod the brawny sergeant was still smiling at his prisoner from time to time nodding appraising him he seemed to have a more than commercial interest in the famous well semifamous ben of purkinje as well ben was vaguely aware that he enjoyed an almost legendary reputation for strength among people who were interested in keeping track of such things the sarge came to stand in front of ben this time he put his foot on the box at length he remarked they say youre a pretty good wrestler me no this ben of purkinje maybe is i dont bother with that kind of thing dont bother with it brod screwed his eyes almost shut in puzzlement no ben shook his head whats there to know about wrestling it all comes down to who is stronger and there i always have the edge nothing like blacksmithing to build the muscles lucky for you you had six men to help you tie me up the redness of the sarges face seemed to be deepening lucky for me what by all the gods elbows can you mean ben shrugged by now a couple of brods followers were starting to take an interest obviously they were fascinated by the prospect of watching a wrestling match between these two titans afterward ben was never quite sure just how the first specific proposal had been made or by whom think you could take him sarge gwan sure our sarge could take im could take anyone wrestling on a boat ben glancing nervously at the surface of the river so perilously near at hand displayed apprehension at the mere idea either brod was supremely confident in his own strength and skill or he was shrewd enough to realize that his authority might be adversely affected if he failed to meet this adversary fairly for whatever reason he made no objection when someone started to untie the old rope with which bens arms were bound someone else suggested they tie a rope around ben before the bout so they could pull back their valuable prisoner in case he tried to swim away ben for a moment considered seconding the request for such a safety measure confident that it would be denied and sure enough the scheme was hooted down no one could wrestle with a rope tied round them could they the rocky hills ahead were somewhat closer now and the river was gradually becoming swifter and rougher here with traces of white water ahead just a few such traces along both banks which were growing steeper so that the passage between increasingly rocky shores ben thought might at some point require careful steering better steering than even skilled boatmen could manage with these sweeps the ropes were off brod was considerably younger than ben ben sizing his opponent up was struck for the first time by the fact that this fellow was young enough to be his son but he couldnt really be could he ben found that an ugly suggestion but not one that was going to cause him a whole lot of worry besides bulk and apparent strength there was very little resemblance ben moved out to the middle of the crude plank deck rubbing his arms stamping his feet to get the circulation going actually the blood was flowing pretty well already but he wanted another chance to look around getting a good view now of the stern of the boat which had been behind him when he was tied brod doing his own muscleflexing was grinning at him you were really a good wrestler once hey pop did a lot better after i got my full growth ben considered you probably will too there was really no problem about room a central space was quickly cleared of a litter of odd personal possessions and miscellaneous garbage basically the arena was a deck of rough planks covering the central twothirds of the craft the crew grinning and making almostsecret wagers no one wanted to offend the chief by betting openly against him arranged themselves around the rectangle while with a minimum of preparation the two contestants moved to diagonally opposite corners of the space there rose a minor chorus of cheers incoherent enough that ben could not tell who they were meant to encourage the two contestants began circling stalking each other ben noted from the corners of his eyes that two of the gang who were currently supposed to be on watch manning a couple of the large sweep oars had abandoned their duties preferring to keep an eye on the contest the drifting raft was turning this way and that brod growled shuffled his feet and flexed his muscles both feet and muscles were really enormous ben stood in one place swaying slightly with the motion of the planks underfoot doing his best to appear hesitant and uncertain yet gamely determined this was a clumsy blacksmith wondering what to do he looked wideeyed innocent in an ugly sort of way brod quicker than he looked lunged at him the two men grappled grunting and straining coming to no immediate conclusion each testing the others strength and skill the watchers yelled incoherently ben felt sure that some of them at least were cheering for him not that he gave a damn ben and brod broke apart each backing up a step or two dont know no wrestling huh the sarge shook his pigtails in what might have been admiration bens fingers had left red and white imprints on his hairy arms ben seemed to be wondering what all the excitement was about anybody can do this the sarges face stiffened he charged again at the impact a cheer went up from the onlookers ben bracing his booted feet took the charge without being driven back dont like the water huh spect me to believe that brod gasped between exertions ben said nothing saving his breath he had the feeling he was going to need as much of it as he could get the sarge was just about as strong as he looked after the pair of them had made the round of the little arena a couple of times struggling from fore to aft and port to starboard ben nodded to himself he thought he now had his opponent pretty well figured out unfortunately a real win in this situation was going to require more than putting brod down on his back before ben could plan his next move brod took the initiative again coming in a screaming allornothing charge ben trying his best to sidestep could get only partially out of the way the two big men arms momentarily linked like those of whirling dancers spun out of the arranged arena toward the edge of the raftlike deck almost under one of the stern sweeps the watchers were screaming themselves hoarse the long unwieldy steering oars were bouncing in their locks unmanned the two wrestlers had come to a stop only a step from the water brods wide astonished eyes half a dozen centimeters from bens stared at the unmanned oars the little crowd of onlookers was sending up a greater roar than ever there came a crash a great shuddering impact the raftlike craft had struck a glancing blow against a rock feet planted solidly ben kept his balance he gulped his lungs full of air held his breath and strained his muscles lifting his opponent clean off his feet he took him overboard brods scream had something in it of the tones of a delighted child cold water smote them both the fierce current twisting their bodies even as they sank the sarges grip loosened immediately as they hit the water ben pushed his opponent away and let himself plummet as deep as the river would take him trying to swim upstream he rejoiced to find that right here at least the cold torrent was deep enough to offer concealment and protection when he had to come up for air ben looked back in the direction of the boat and was glad to see that half the people aboard had been knocked off their feet no one at the moment was even thinking about pursuing ben right beside him as in several other places in the vicinity some rocks rose well above the surface offering the fugitive a solid refuge while he caught his breath many of the raftsmen looked terrified maybe they couldnt swim they clung desperately to whatever portion of the boat they could get their hands on some shrieking and cursing went sliding helplessly overboard ben couldnt wait around all day watching the fun orienting himself toward the west bank which looked to him a little more hospitable he plunged under water again and started swimming swimming with boots on was difficult indeed but there hadnt been time to take them off besides he expected that he was going to need footgear when he came ashore though the river was perhaps a hundred meters broad at this point most of its depth was concentrated in a single narrow channel striking for the west bank trying to angle upstream to put more distance between himself and the flatboat ben soon found he could once more plant his feet on the bottom and still get his face high enough to breathe fortunately the majority of his former captors still had their hands full with other problems but a few had recovered a few missiles one arrow a slung stone or two hurtled inaccurately after him ben saw the arrow pierce only the current the rocks go banging and breaking on bigger rocks if he lingered in the neighborhood the next step would probably be a determined swimmer or two bladearmed coming after him ben decided not to wait a couple of additional missiles landed in the general neighborhood he thought he could hear brod surfaced and clinging to another rock or back on the boat bellowing in rage gulping a breath ben went under water again striking once more for the west bank swimming powerfully staying under as long as he could briefly he worried that the bandits might find oars for the rowboat and launch it successfully but in the continuing confusion that threat now looked increasingly unlikely currents and rocks grew tricky and he endured a struggle in rough water to reach shore but being an excellent swimmer he made it safely definitely he was ready for a rest but now was not the time stamping and squishing he moved inland getting brod and all his people thoroughly out of sight and sound four getting away from the river as expeditiously as possible ben struggled to put distance and obstacles between himself and the bandits their angry yells concerned more he was sure with their own plight than with his escape were drowned by the water raging at the rocks and then all sounds coming from the river faded altogether unfortunately the messengerbird from sarykam had now disappeared as well for the next half hour he concentrated on making strides inland staying on the hardest ground he could find just in case anyone should attempt to trail him no doubt the blue temple had promised a good reward after half an hour it was necessary to pause for a brief rest once he had squeezed some residual water from his clothing he continued west at a steady pace the landscape ahead of ben spread itself out in a rugged arid and uninviting prospect in several places he could observe distant hills approaching the size of mountains there were no roads fences or houses to be seen in another half hour his steady pace became hesitant then he began to angle to the north lacking anything in the way of food or even a canteen he was reluctant to go straight out into what looked like utter desolation ben spent the night in the open having encountered no one and seen few signs of settlement he lay down in the chill of early night grateful that at least by now his clothing had dried completely and wishing for last nights itchy hay he breakfasted on a couple of juicy roots and kept on going a full day after his escape from the flatboat now walking almost straight north he caught sight of three people on foot in the distance they were approaching him from the northwest on a course that seemed calculated to intercept his own ben halted squinting with a hand raised to shade his eyes even at a distance it was obvious that these three were not members of brods cutthroat gang shrugging his shoulders he resumed his advance as the distance between them diminished he observed that there was something familiar about two of the approaching figures and one of those two was holding in both hands a gleaming thing like a long sword or rather like a very different kind of weapon something much more than any ordinary sword a minute after making that discovery ben was exchanging enthusiastic greetings with two of the travelers he had so fortunately as he thought encountered one of these two old acquaintances she who had once been the silver queen was saying to ben so you are my gate to peace and truth you man of blood it seems unlikely and yet the sword of wisdom has fastened me upon your trail ben looked at the sword and at the woman who held it he said i think i must hear some explanation as soon as the greetings between old friends had been concluded valdemar and ben were introduced valdemar was certainly the taller of the two gigantic men but zoltan watching thought it hard to judge which was the more massive the two clasped hands and sized each other up with quick appraising glances presently ben heard what valdemars request to the sword of wisdom had been to be guided to some woman who would match his image of an ideal wife the older man sighed wearily maybe i should have asked that oracle the same question years ago the day had been gray ever since sunrise and now a threat of rain was materializing casting about for a place of safety and reasonable comfort the party of four took shelter from a shower under an overhang of cliff from here it was possible to look back in the direction ben had come from the river so any bandits who might be after him ought to become visible in time to be avoided the three old friends naturally had much to talk about zoltan demanded of ben tell us how things are going back in sarykam how long ago did you leave there some of the cheerfulness so recently restored now faded swiftly from bens eyes he said softly they are not going well yambu like zoltan was strongly interested in what news of tasavalta ben might provide then tell us she urged ben drew a deep breath ill try to put the worst of it in a nutshell there was an attack on the palace last year all of the royal family survived but princess kristin was badly crippled in a fall from the roof for a time everyone feared that she would die now some say death is the happiest result that can be expected all of them were quick with more questions bens answers offered them little or no comfort the stones of a palace courtyard had badly damaged kristins spine had broken other bones and crushed internal organs her mind spirit and body had all been badly damaged zoltan who was prince marks nephew muttered blasphemies in a low voice yambu frowned in silence valdemar who knew next to nothing of tasavalta or its rulers still expressed his indignation and his loathing of villains who could cause such pain he then demanded to know who was guilty of launching the attack ben shrugged chiefly vilkata and his demons along with a certain culmian prince were rid of them all now good riddance but too late to help our princess yambu was looking closely at her old associate and you ben how are you apart from this evil that has befallen those you love how are your own wife and daughter barbara and beth are their names are they not as far as i know my daughter and my wife are well enough in body ben answered shortly let me put it this way my life at home has recently been such that i do not mind spending most of my days and nights away from home yambu was sympathetic how old is the girl seventeen that can be an age of difficulty ben made a sound somewhere between a grunt and a laugh when i myself arrive at some age that fails to bring its troubles lady i will make a note of it zoltan gave ben one sympathetic look but then the young mans thoughts quickly turned to the difficulties his aunt and uncle and all their realm must be experiencing he asked tell us of my uncle mark ben seemed glad to leave the talk of his personal affairs your uncle is unhappy he answered shortly as one might expect at that point he fell silent staring past the ladys head when the others turned to see what he was looking at they saw and yambu and zoltan recognized one of the halfintelligent messenger birds of tasavalta sitting on a branch of the only sizable tree in the immediate vicinity getting to his feet ben addressed the bird i had given you up messenger well now i am here free to talk with you what word have you for ben spreading soft wings gliding from its branch to a nearby rock the creature chirped in its inhuman voice ben the prince asks you for news the prince asks you for news well when you reach the prince again tell him the news could be a lot worse because here i am still alive and i have met friends who are armed with a sword but it could be better because i am no closer to finding the sword we want say message again say message again i will messenger i will but later theres no hurry about this one ben spoke slowly and distinctly as if to a child rest now message later rest now the bird flew back to its higher perch where it settled itself as if to rest the prince is at home then zoltan commented ben nodded since kristins crippling hes spent more time in sarykam than he did in the past two or three years put together no more roaming the world trying to look out for the emperors business and what of their sons yambu wanted to know how old are the two princelings now ben considered stephen must be twelve he has a temper hell be a dangerous man in a few years and prince adrian two years older secluded somewhere well away from home i dont know where perfecting his wizardry i expect well not see much of him for a year or two to come it was common for serious apprentices in the arts of magic to withdraw from the mundane world for a time of preparation and nothing can be done for kristin in the ordinary ways of healing and of magic nothing there is only one real hope of course ben concluded shortly the sword woundhealer yambu nodded and sighed ben nodded too of course we had the keeping of it there in sarykam for years but theres no use worrying over that now mark nowadays thinks of little else but somehow getting woundhealer back he stays in sarykam himself but he sees to it that every clue every hint we can obtain whether reasonable or not i sometimes think is followed to the end that is why i am here now there was one rumor one hint about woundhealer that we thought especially promising it put the sword somewhere in this area and you came alone to track down this hint asked valdemar who until now had been largely silent thunder grumbled overhead and more rain was starting to come down ben looked at his questioner i was not alone when i set out six other people and three of the great birds came with me i can give you the unpleasant details later but at this point only i out of seven humans am still alive as for the birds they no longer travel with me but one of them finds me from time to time as you have seen thus i am kept somewhat in touch with sarykam ben related to yambu zoltan and valdemar additional details of his struggle with the band of river bandits and his escape zoltan asked are they seeking the sword of mercy too perhaps they had something going with the blue temple besides selling me to them or they thought they did in turn the silver queen and zoltan told ben the tale of their recent harassment by the leatherwings of their fortunate encounter with valdemar and the sword he had been so strangely given and how during the last few days the three of them with wayfinders help had managed to avoid the flying reptiles ben gestured toward the sword of wisdom speaking of your treasure there i suppose youll have no objection to my borrowing its powers for a while yambu smiled faintly i have been expecting you to ask let me see if i can guess for what purpose no doubt a single guess will be all youll need i want first to locate the sword of healing and then to get my hands on it have you no more selfish wants than that big man that will do for the time being in unconsciously queenly fashion yambu raised wayfinder in her own hands and apostrophized the sword i asked you sword for peace and you have led me to this man of blood zoltan saw ben frown slightly at that yambu continued i see my own quest must give way to one of greater urgency but before i hand you over to him sword what else do you have to tell me is it possible that by following him i will discover the peace that has eluded me for so long the other three watching closely could see plainly how the sword tugged slowly twisting in her hands until it bent her wrists aiming itself at the huge man without further comment the silver queen reversed her grip on the black hilt and handed wayfinder over to ben reaching for the weapon eagerly he murmured thanks once wayfinder was in his grasp he wasted no time but at once demanded of it bluntly sword lead me where i want to go the sword of wisdom in his hands at once twisted around sharply zoltan though no stranger to the swords and their powers felt his scalp prickle the weapon reminded him of some intelligent animal responding differently as soon as it came under the control of a different master perhaps a warbeast roused from sleep and scenting blood zoltan thought that this time he saw the blade actually bend until the tip pointed somewhere to the northeast that direction he thought was close to though it did not exactly coincide with the bearing of sarykam still holding the sword leveled ben shuffled his feet as if getting his weary legs ready to move again he asked his companions are all of you ready to move it did not appear to have entered his thoughts that any of the three might choose not to accompany him valdemar stood up towering over everyone else he said slowly i began my journey holding in my hands that sword you now have and with my own goal not yours in mind and so now i have my doubts about going with you at that zoltan turned on him sharply i suppose you think your quest is more important than this one valdemar raised his eyebrows he said mildly it is important to me the two young men were of the same age or very nearly so but valdemar only partially because of his size generally gave the impression of being older well perhaps you can manage to locate a wife without the help of wayfinder said zoltan or who knows if you come with us you might discover one to your liking in sarykam the other shrugged perhaps friend zoltan anyway you should remember that i am not ready to abandon my purpose but i have already given the sword to lady yambu given it freely and so i have no claim on it any longer you are welcome to take it back long enough to ask a question the lady assured him ben nodded just dont be all day about it the lady paused in the act of handing wayfinder back to valdemar frowning she said to him you are something of a magician are you not the tall youth blinked at her as if the question had surprised him i have a certain knack for doing tricks with light and mirrors and sand and water he admitted no more than that depending on the company in which i find myself i sometimes claim to know a little magic but how did you know i have known another magician or two in my time the art is wont to leave its traces yambu shrugged in this company you may freely claim competence she told valdemar i doubt that any of us are able to surpass you in whatever it is you do with light and mirrors valdemar received the sword from her and held it steadily i ask he began firmly then hesitated looking at the others i suppose there is no preferred formula of words none i know of said ben impatiently just ask your question the rain was falling harder now though so far the the overhang of cliff had kept them almost dry then i ask said valdemar with perhaps a hint of embarrassment in his voice the same question as before when i spoke to this sword in my own house wayfinder pointed straight in the direction of the silver queen the rain slackened somewhat ben though tired was eager to get moving and none of the others insisted on a chance to rest all four set out together in the direction indicated by wayfinder ben who walked with zoltan in the lead now wore the sword of wisdom at his belt drawing and using it occasionally to confirm that they remained on the proper course while lady yambu walked at valdemars side they had been hiking for a quarter of an hour when valdemar asked what lies ahead of us not much but desert ben returned shortly and somewhere in it i suppose the river i went boating on yesterday a wasteland said yambu one that will take us days to cross five once wood decided to depart the city where he and tigris had visited the blue temple headquarters he summoned up his preferred form of rapid transportation he and his young lieutenant were soon mounted upon a griffin riding the wind a kilometer above the land the ancient ones chosen destination was one of his remoter strongholds he and tigris were bringing with them only a few assistants chosen from those of his people he least mistrusted who rode clinging for their lives on the backs of similar steeds as soon as the ancient one and his party had reached their goal all of his helpers including tigris were promptly assigned their tasks of magic and set to work some hours later laboring inside a stonevaulted chamber enclosed by many barriers of matter and of magic the master of the establishment raised his head over a massive wooden workbench lighted by old world globes and marked with an intricacy of carven diagrams he asked tigris are we completely secure against unfriendly observation master across the room the young woman startled looked up from her own work i mean observation from outside are there spies human or otherwise anywhere in sight of our walls do you make sure that there are none i would attend to the matter myself but i am otherwise engaged at the moment now master now suffering in silence the interruption of her own work the young woman methodically disengaged herself from her current task then she employed her considerable powers to satisfy her masters latest wish sending her perception outwards while her body remained standing beside the bench outside the stronghold not many meters distant and yet a world away behind grim walls of heavy rock and curtains of dark magic some trees and other vegetation grew naturally there a handful of birds were singing not messengers these these birds were wild and small and totally unintelligent of unfriendly observation there was not a trace unless the small birds could be counted as unfriendly to the master and his cause for another moment a moment longer than was really necessary tigris barkened carefully her body standing indoors did not move except that her red lips parted well the young woman returned fully to her body nothing master nothing and no one out there now you sense nothing again tigris employed the full range of her trained perceptions again she came back only songbirds the ancient one grunted something a sound of grudging satisfaction and returned to his powerful ritual whose goal his assistant knew was the discovery of information about certain of woods enemies notably the emperor and the emperors son mark of tasavalta tigris aware of a strange reluctance to do so firmly put from her thoughts her memory of the outside world she also returned but more slowly to her tasks at odd moments during the next few hours she pondered her own reactions she had been somewhat surprised though not entirely to find herself prolonging the reconnaissance unnecessarily simply to harken to the songbirds for one moment more the hours passed lesser aides bringing messages were intercepted by tigris so that her master should not be disturbed the great magician had been isolated at his workbench for some time with certain halfmaterial semianimate powers and his own thoughts at length when it seemed a safe moment to interrupt her lord tigris approached him his eyes coming back from a great distance at length focused on hers well master a reptile scout has just arrived at the stronghold carrying intelligence she named a region that was many kilometers away so what word then sire some blue temple people in that area have very recently acquired the sword of mercy now the mans beautiful blue eyes were truly focused woundhealer he breathed the name in a hoarse whisper we know just where it is there is no mistake the location is only approximate but i believe the report in excitement he seized her arm his grip for some reason felt icy cold tigris my plans bear fruit master we all expected nothing less wood paused in thought clasping his hands in front of him smiling and nodding with satisfaction woundhealer my dear he remarked to his young associate is perhaps the only sword that i would be willing to trust in the hands of a subordinate therefore i am not rushing out into the field to take it away from those blue temple fools i may decide to send you when you have completed your present tasks the blond head bowed deeply i will of course be honored master we shall see as usual i have other important tasks to perform though i must admit that in a way there is no other sword that i am more anxious to possess tigris allowed herself a display of mild surprise master the sword of mercy is certainly a tool of great value we are any and all of us subject to injury sooner or later obviously but i think you miss my point master certainly when one is badly hurt healing is priceless but surely you cannot fail to see that woundhealer will also be of exquisite value in the torture chamber ah yes ah indeed just consider the possibilities when the occupant of the rack or of the boot can be revived over and over times without number when one is entertaining ones enemy under such favorable conditions one always hates to say a permanent goodbye imagine the guest just as final unconsciousness is about to overtake him or her being restored to perfect physical health and strength every nerve and every blood vessel intact again and restored quickly almost instantly no need even to remove him or her from the rack for a period of recuperation wood sighed faintly i tell you tigris i would give a great deal to be able to take the sword of love and a few wellchosen guests of course and retire to one of my fortresses for a few years of wellearned rest and entertainment my master i look forward to making such a retreat with you what pleasures could we not devise the blond young woman giggled a delicious sound yes wood stroked her hair and his features softened momentarily you are a beautiful creature thank you and loyal to me naturally master naturally the stroking hand moved on really beautiful and of course still really young that is a rare quality among my close associates and one i value yes my dear you are precious to me the head of yellow curls bowed humbly but woods expression was hardening again his fondling hand fell to his side unfortunately we can spare no time for any prolonged diversion now no master standing with hands braced on his workbench issuing brisk commands the ancient one dictated the reply he wanted sent back to his people in the field the necessary materials were readily at hand tigris wrote what she was ordered to write the message was short and to the point the written words glowed briefly then disappeared from the thin parchment not to regain their visibility until the proper spell should be recited over them now the wizard paced as he completed the dictation tell my people that they are graciously granted permission to use woundhealer to cure whatever wounds they may have suffered yes master as for healing anyone else if the question should come up i think not the handsome man smiled his youthful smile a few minutes later standing on the battlements to make sure that the winged messenger was properly dispatched she gazed upon the open sky and heard birdsong again this time as she listened the faint crease of a frown appeared above her eyes there was something she did not understand something that bothered her something those cheerful voices not only symbolized but actively conveyed a plea or a warning that she ought to but still did not understand the singers of course were only birds nothing more than they seemed to be she was very sure of that and that point perhaps had meaning small and mindless and meaningless animals perhaps though simplicity an absence of trickery was not altogether meaningless tigris had the irrational feeling that years ago when she was only a child she might have been able to comprehend the birds though the child she had been of course had not begun to understand the world as it really was yet recently today was not the first experience she had been nagged by the notion that in childhood she must have known something of great importance something essential which she had since utterly forgotten recently there came moments when it seemed to her that the thing forgotten had once been might still be of overriding importance in her life it was unsettling tigris closed her eyes long enough to draw a breath and let it go for no longer than that did she allow herself to waste the masters time here in the stronghold of the ancient one one had to guard ones very thoughts with extreme care at that same hour the sword of wisdom gripped in the huge right hand of ben of sarykam was guiding four people across an extensive wasteland they were making good time for travelers on foot and zoltan the most impetuous of the four if not precisely the youngest did a good job of restraining his impatience with the comparative slowness of his elders but he kept wanting to hurry them along as soon as zoltan had heard of his aunt kristins horrible injury and desperate need he had become wholeheartedly committed perhaps even more than ben to the search for woundhealer their march across what was basically an uninhabited plain had gone on for two days now in the afternoons the spring sun grew uncomfortably warm shade was scarce in this wasteland and the walkers were all thankful that summer was yet to come now and then ben grumbled that if they kept on much longer in this direction they were bound to come back to the river on which he had left the bandit boat though at a point considerably downstream from that where he had made his escape you are reluctant to reach a river valdemar asked him i think it would be a refreshing change this one has bandits on it ill tell them youre the real ben of purkinje as the day drew toward its close the four led to water by the sight of thriving vegetation came upon a small stream that issued from a spring at the root of a rocky outcrop ben consulted with the lady and by agreement they called a halt for food and rest shrugging out of his small pack valdemar remarked i have no doubt that we are being led toward woundhealer but i wonder how far we have to go zoltan shedding his own pack answered no telling we may not even be going straight toward the sword itself ah it has already been explained to me that i may not be going directly toward my bride whoever she may be right ben grunted abstractedly my purpose then may well be twice delayed for the first time since he had joined the others the young vineyardist sounded faintly discouraged as the simple process of making camp got under way ben began to reminisce about another journey once taken under the guidance of the sword of wisdom that had been nineteen years ago and wayfinder had been then in the hands of the vengeful baron doon who had used the powers of the sword to guide himself and his band of plunderers to the main hoard of the blue temples treasure you speak as if you were there commented valdemar i was ben answered shortly i have heard some version of the story would you like to hear the truth of course maybe one of these nights when we are resting the four had pooled their food supplies but the total was quickly becoming ominously low zoltan expressed a hope of being able to find game in this country despite its barrenness he had with him a sling a weapon with which he had gained some proficiency over the last few years zoltan went away to hunt at least two kinds of wild spring berries were ripening in this otherwise harsh land and edible mushrooms were also coming up after recent heavy showers yambu and valdemar were able to gather a useful amount of food within a short distance of the camp meanwhile ben was building a fire of dried brush and twigs in anticipation of making a stew of small game and vegetables he also cut a large gourd from a last years groundvine this receptacle he hollowed out with a skillful knife to serve as a cooking pot a couple of hot stones dropped in would boil the water nicely once darkness had fallen and the rabbit stew had been cooked and consumed ben and yambu drifted into serious talk beside the small campfire their conversation acquired an earnest tone when ben began to reminisce about that last time nineteen years ago he had taken part in an expedition guided by wayfinder oh i trust our guide all right he patted the black hilt as if it might have been a favorite ridingbeast as some of you well know this is not the first time i have held this sword and followed it zoltan and yambu nodded ben was coming to the point now he turned his ugly face toward yambu ariane too was a member of that party she returned his meaningful gaze with an intent look of her own i know that valdemar looking from one of the two older people to the other asked innocently and idly who is ariane there was not much hope in his voice doubtless he thought it unlikely that any woman who had been robbing the blue temple nineteen years ago would qualify now as a good wife for a man of twenty yambu answered without looking at him she was my daughter and the emperors and she died nineteen years ago in that damned blue temple treasuredungeon i am sorry to hear it said valdemar after a moment he sounded as if he truly was keeping his gaze fixed on arianes mother ben said four years ago you and i had a chance to discuss what happened in that treasuredungeon as you aptly call it four years ago we started to talk of ariane but it seems to me that for whatever reason we said nothing important now i want to talk with you about her whom we both loved and about the emperor silence held yambu was not looking at ben but no one doubted that she was listening because there is something i did not tell you when we met four years ago ben continued frowning yes yambus tone was noncommittal she tossed a handful of fresh fuel on the fire a few years before our last meeting i encountered arianes father the emperor told me that she was still alive that she had been living with him bens words hung in the air meanwhile the small campfire went on about its business snapping with brisk hunger at its latest allotment of twigs in the infinite darkness beyond the firelight wild creatures prowled not always silent yambu was looking at ben now she stared at him in silence for what seemed a long time at last she asked where under what circumstances did you have this conversation with the emperor on the shore of lake alkmaar i was pretending to be a carnival strongman he was pretending to be a clown you as i recall were not far away nor was zoltan you must both remember our situation zoltan nodded thoughtfully ben went on understand at the time my mind was on other things entirely i was afraid mark might be dead and i said something about that he said no mark was alive it was hard to kill one of his the emperors children and then he said to me something i have never forgotten my daughter ariane lives also you may see her one day at the time i could not even begin to think about ariane again but her fathers words have kept coming back to me though ive never allowed myself to believe them how strange yambu was staring into some distance where none of her companions thoughts or even imaginations were able to follow bens eyes remained fixed on the silver queen his voice was urgent you know him better than i do you tell me how likely he is to be truthful in such a matter i know him the silver queen shaking her head gave a kind of laugh ive shared his bed and borne his child but i dont even know his true name assuming that he has one know him youll have to seek out someone else for that but does he tell the truth the grayhaired woman was silent for what seemed to ben a long time at last she said more than anyone else ive ever known i think one reason perhaps why hes so impossible to live with no one said anything for a time then valdemar yawning announced that he intended to get some sleep conversation immediately turned to the practical business of standing guard whoever was standing watch would of course be armed for the job with the sword of wisdom zoltan having by lot been given the honor of standing the first watch paced in random fashion for a time his worn boots making little sound in the sandy soil slowly he looped round the stillsmoldering fire in an irregular pattern remaining at a considerate distance from the three blanketwrapped forms of his companions now and again the young man his face vaguely troubled stopped to gaze at the naked weapon he was carrying then he silently and deliberately paced on during one of these pauses as zoltan stared at the sword of wisdom his lips moved as if he might be silently formulating a new question even in the nights nearsilence the words were far too soft for anyone else to hear if i were if i like valdemar were seeking the right woman for myself which way would i go if the sword reacted at all to this hypothetical new command the turning of its point the twisting of its black hilt in zoltans grasp must surely have been very subtle a movement right at the limit of his perception but probably he thought the sword would not answer such a conditional question at all ought he to make the query definite no that part of his life he ought to be able to manage for himself but it did cross zoltans mind that perhaps it would be wise for him to ask now when the lady yambu could not hear him whether he should remain with the lady yambu any longer or not in response to this question if it was indeed a real question the reactions of wayfinder in zoltans hands were very tentative indicating first one direction and then another or was he only imagining now that the sword responded at all frowning with dissatisfaction zoltan sat down for a time his back to the dying fire the weight of the drawn sword resting on the sand in front of him faint stars and sparks of firelight reflecting in the blade when the stars in their turning informed the young man that his watch had passed he crawled softly to valdemars side and woke him with a gentle shaking all quiet all quiet moments later zoltan was wrapped in his own blanket and snoring faintly now valdemar was the one holding wayfinder and pacing presently like zoltan he sat down for a time and like the smaller youth he found another question to whisper to the oracle sword how soon will you bring me to the goal i have asked for another day a month a year there was no reply softly he pounded his great fist on the ground he breathed but of course how can you answer such a question it is only where that you must tell never when or why or how or who so where must be enough for me bens turn on watch followed in due course the older man did little pacing his legs felt that they had accomplished quite enough of that during the day just past but he moved around enough to be an effective sentry and he stayed creditably alert ben too found some serious personal thoughts and questions that he wished to put to the sword but none of these queries were voiced loudly enough for anyone else to hear he did not fail to keep track of time or neglect to wake the lady yambu when her turn came around well before the sky had begun seriously to lighten in the east yambu took advantage of the opportunity to have a word or two with ben what do you think of him she whispered nodding in the direction of the sleeping valdemar ben shrugged nothing in particular i doubt hes much more than he seems to be what i do wonder yes how it is that the sword will satisfy his wish and yours and mine by leading us all together in the same direction if the silver queen nursed private thoughts during the hours she spent alone with wayfinder she was not inclined to share them even with the sword her watch passed uneventfully when the sun was up the party of four adventurers broke camp and moved on following the guidance of the sword of wisdom once more in the hands of ben for another day or two the sword continued to lead them steadily northeast foraging and hunting kept them tolerably well fed at night they camped by water when it was available and made dry camps when it was not and in either case stood watch in turn in turn armed with the sword of wisdom still there was no sign of the river ben said they must inevitably encounter evidently its winding course was carrying it also farther to the east progressively the country surrounding the four seekers became more and more a desert and then one day the river of which ben had been so wary was again in sight six the course of the rediscovered river as indicated by the vegetation growing thickly along its banks ran ahead of the travelers and somewhat to the east a kilometer or so after slicing its way into view between hills to the north the watercourse emerged from a rocky gorge onto relatively flat land becoming visible at approximately the same time was a faint road or track the first sign of human endeavor the travelers had seen for days this came gently curving toward the river from the west with a directness suggesting that the point of intersection would provide a ford shortly after this road came into their view the sight of half a dozen scavenger birds circling low in several places above the near bank of the river alerted the four travelers to the presence of death the number and position of the gliding birds suggested that destruction of animal or human life might recently have occurred on a substantial scale less than an hour after first sighting the birds the four seekers advancing steadily but cautiously their afternoon shadows now gliding far ahead of them reached the place where the sketchy road descended a shallow bank to ford the river mounting a slight rise ben who was a little ahead of the others came to a stop grunting the bandits flatboat had survived substantially intact its encounter with the rapids it now lay run aground several hundred meters away a little downstream from the ford ben pointed and said to his three companions thats the boat i swam away from the flatboats sweeps and poles or most of them were missing as was the covered cargo whatever that had been there was no human presence living or dead on the boat or near it some small fourlegged scavengers whose presence had evidently been keeping the hungry birds aloft slunk away along the shoreline as the four humans approached one of the scampering little beasts turned to bare its fangs until zoltan slung a stone at it scoring only a near miss the missile kicking up a spurt of sand i think i see a dead man said valdemar in a strained voice standing as tall as he could and squinting ahead from his great height there just upstream from the ford the four advanced still cautiously the three who were armed with hands on weapons it was soon possible to confirm valdemars sighting then almost at once they came in sight of another fallen body lying nearer to them motionless beside a slaughtered ridingbeast and then a third man this one obviously dead his skull crushed in no more than a day ago zoltan muttered looking closely at the handiest corpse and sniffing soon the total of human dead discovered had reached approximately a dozen all within a stones throw of the ford ben peering closely now at the bodies announced that he could recognize some of the bandits from whom he had so recently escaped he confirmed that this definitely was or had been brods band though the sarge himself had not yet been found some of them are wearing blue and gold valdemar commented in a subdued voice that has to mean blue temple doesnt it ben nodded brod kept his rendezvous with them he mused cant say im surprised that a fight started but over what he drew wayfinder which he had momentarily put away muttered over the sword turned it this way and that signs on the ground indicated that ridingbeasts and perhaps loadbeasts too had galloped here had run in panicked circles on the flat land where the stream widened and smoothed into the ford all this could be read according to the tracks which were quite plain in the moist sand of the riverbank the imprints were a day old or not much more than that drying and crumbling around the edges but no running animals were now in evidence whatever mounts and loadbeasts might have survived the fight had evidently scattered zoltan darting about on the field of combat more energetically than any of his companions was seeking among bushes and boulders bending over bodies examining one after another in rapid succession the four exchanging comments reached a consensus one side either blue temple or bandits had tried to cheat the other or perhaps both had simultaneously attempted some kind of treachery then they had efficiently killed each other off ben was still leveling his sword turning it this way and that frowning trying to interpret what the bright blade told him now wayfinders point was twitching violent death was nothing new to any of the travelers except perhaps to valdemar have you seen this kind of thing before the silver queen inquired of him the towering youth replied with a shake of his head he appeared to be repelled and somewhat upset by the unpleasant sights he muttered foolishness foolishness why are folk determined to kill each other its as if they looked forward to their own dying i have no doubt some do yambu assured him now zoltan who with a veterans callous practicality had begun rifling the packs of the fallen announced with a cheerful cry the discovery of food the provisions were mostly dried meat and hard biscuit he began to share them out with his companions he came upon spare clothing too and announced the welcome find zoltan compared his own right foot with that of a corpse i think this ones shoes may fit me just in time mine are wearing through there was a cry really more a grunt of excitement from ben not long distracted from his quest by a mere battlefield he had been guided by wayfinder to a wounded loadbeast the others saw him pointing the sword at the animal where it stood amid some scrubby bushes which until now had screened it from their observation the loadbeasts harness was marked with the blue temple insignia of gold and blue and it carried a full load on its back the beast was favoring its right foreleg streaked with dried blood there was water here and some good grazing along the river so the animal must have been disinclined to wander far no doubt thought zoltan the scavengers had so far let the loadbeast live because there was easier meat on hand for the taking in bens hands the sword of wisdom was pointing straight at the trembling braying animal valdemar said put the poor creature out of its misery at least but ben had already sheathed the sword of wisdom seized the animal by its bridle and pulled it out of the bushes so he could get at its burdens more easily in another moment ben was unfastening panniers from the loadbeasts back and dumping their contents on the ground his companions alerted now scarcely breathing were all watching him in silence of all the bundles that had been strapped to the back of the burdened animal only one was long and narrow enough when the coverings of this package were ripped away by bens powerful hands it proved indeed to contain a sword blackhilted and elegantly sheathed wait before you draw that could be soulcutter valdemar fell silent ben was holding the sheathed and belted sword up for the others to see a single look at the white symbol on the hilt depicting an open human hand allayed whatever fears they might have had here was woundhealer the very sword they had come looking for ben with grim satisfaction strapped on the sword of mercy then he turned his eyes sweeping the horizon warily ready for someone to challenge him for his prize valdemar studied him for a moment then turned away once more examining the fallen on the field what are you looking for asked yambu i want to see if any of them are still alive indeed one of the fallen and only one still breathed evidently he had managed to drag himself under a bush and so lay relatively protected from the sun the scavengers and discovery ben on getting a look at the fallen man at once recognized sergeant brod this is the very one i wrestled with the squat leader of the bandits his chest rising and falling laboriously under his leather vest lay in a welter of his own dried blood dagger still clutched in his right hand not many meters from the treasure the two armed factions must have been struggling to possess either he had not known woundhealer was there or he had been too badly hurt to reach it valdemar cried out suddenly his voice for no apparent reason argumentative ben if thats really the sword of healing youd better use it ben faintly puzzled looked at the young giant in wary silence use it i say valdemar sounded angry the man is dying even if he was your enemy did you think i wouldnt use it ben asked mildly stooping he grabbed sergeant brod by both ankles and pulled his inert weight roughly straight out from under the bush evoking a noisy breath that might have been a gasp of pain had the victim been fully conscious valdemar looked slightly surprised and vaguely disappointed as if he had been ready for a confrontation with ben bending over the fallen man once more ben pulled the dagger from brods hand and took the added precaution of kicking out of his reach another weapon which had fallen nearby just in case he muttered actually i look forward to speaking with an eyewitness of this skirmish might be a help even if we cant believe much of what he says once more ben delayed briefly this time to search the pockets of the fallen man and his belt pouch evidently the search turned up nothing of any particular interest then ben who was no stranger to the sword of mercy and its powers postponed the act no longer but employed woundhealer boldly thrusting the broad blade squarely and deeply into the victims chest valdemar flinched involuntarily at the sight zoltan and yambu more experienced observers of swords powers watched calmly the bright swords entry into flesh was bloodless though it cut a broad hole in the sarges leather vest which ben had not bothered to open and the application of healing power was accompanied by a sound like soft human breath recovery as usual when accomplished through the agency of woundhealer was miraculously speedy and complete the man his color and energy restored sat up a moment after the sword had been withdrawn from his body he looked down at his pierced and bloodied garments then thrust a huge hand inside his vest and shirt and felt of his own skin whole again a moment later brod now staring suspiciously at ben got his legs under him and sprang to his feet with an oath what in all the hells do ye think yer doing ben stared at him with distaste what am i doing he rumbled i may have just made a serious mistake the sarge was scowling now at the sword in the others hand reckon you know thats my proppity you got there no one answered him ben slowly resheathed woundhealer at his belt he grunted you might express your thanks brod turned slowly confronting each of his four rescuers in turn when he found himself facing the lady he introduced himself to her using some extravagant gestures and words yambu was neither much impressed nor much amused i am not the one who healed you fellow brod finally reluctantly awkwardly thanked ben i had a reason ben gestured at the field of death by which they were surrounded now entertain us with a story about your little skirmish here and you might as well tell the truth for once you think id lie the possibility had crossed my mind protesting his invariable truthfulness brod began to talk he told his rescuers that his worst problem had been surviving the scavengers having half a dozen times come close he thought to being eaten alive he said that whenever he had regained consciousness he had waved his dagger at the predators and by that means managed to keep them at bay moving about a little surveying the field he grimaced at the sight of his fallen comrades their bodies stabbed by blue temple blades and gnawed by scavengers but the sarge was able to be philosophical about their loss the magic hasnt been made yet thatll do any of these a bit of good meanwhile zoltan had quietly borrowed the sword of mercy from ben approached the injured loadbeast and tried woundhealer on the leg which it kept favoring listening meanwhile to bens ongoing interrogation of sergeant brod it did not sound like ben was managing to learn anything of importance almost at the swords first touch the animals braying ceased and the wound disappeared from its leg it looked at zoltan in mild satisfaction accepting with inhuman complacency its miraculous return to health the young man rubbed its head before it turned aside to graze along the riverbank by now the sarge in response to insistent probing questions from ben and the silver queen had launched upon a rambling and at least generally plausible explanation of just how the fight for woundhealer had come about between his gang and the blue temple people the latter brod said had been in the process of escorting the sword of healing back to their headquarters and had hoped to engage the bandits at a ridiculously low fee according to brod as additional guards he complained bitterly about blue temple stinginess which he said he was sure lay at the root of their treacherous behavior zoltan his cynical amusement growing as he listened thought that this sarge was not so much a dedicated enemy of truth and tasavalta as a complete opportunist brod his imagination now warmed by the fact that his audience so far seemed to believe him began to stretch his story now it seemed the sarge had been trying for some time to get the sword of healing for the noble prince mark of tasavalta ben and zoltan exchanged glances in which amusement and outrage were mingled yambu appeared to share their sentiments but by now she had moved a little apart from the others and sitting on a rock in deep thought did not seem to be giving much thought to the sarge and his tall tales valdemar now was looking with distrust and disgust at the man whose rescue he had insisted upon brod returned valdemars gaze with some curiosity and demanded to know this young giants name when he had been told his next question was ever do any wrestling some ah aha maybe you and i should try a fall or two one day i dont know why valdemar did not appear at all interested in the challenge brod shrugged have it your way he squinted once more at ben and zoltan atmospheres a little chilly in these parts guess maybe ill be on my way an excellent idea said ben shortly standing with his powerful arms folded brod made a casual move to rearm himself bending as if to pick up a fallen weapon or two from the field but this action was cut short by a sharp no from ben brod straightened what dont pick up any tools just start walking zoltan too was watching brod closely and zoltans hand was on the hilt of his own serviceable sword the bandit leader all injured innocence loudly protested youd send me away as nekkid as a babe mans got a right to protect himself dont he theres wild animals in these parts he paused as if gathering breath to deliver the ultimate argument then spat theres bandits get walking said ben quietly before i change my mind brod turned lady yambu a highborn lady like you wouldnt his voice died withered by the expression on yambus face ben his right hand on the hilt of one of his two belted swords the one devoid of healing power continued to consider the sergeant thoughtfully brod fidgeted uncomfortably under this inspection he glowered but then with an obvious effort he smiled achieving at least a pretense of gratitude and cooperation all right all right maybe youre right im going just the way you want the others remaining more or less suspicious watched him walk a semicircle first as if completely undecided as to which way he wanted to go then the sarge moved in the direction of the ford and went downstream along the near bank of the river on reaching the grounded flatboat a hundred meters or so from where his watchers stood brod waded to it and climbed aboard there he helped himself to the small boat that still was lashed to the deck loosing the lashings and manhandling the small craft into the water zoltan idly pulling the long thongs of his hunting sling through his free hand commented might be some weapons there ben shrugged let him help himself as long as he keeps moving away from us now that ben had the sword of healing securely at his belt he had only one thought to be done with worrying about brod and other unimportant matters and convey his new treasure quickly back to sarykam another gray tasavaltan messengerbird arrived at this point as if it had been waiting for the sarge antagonistic as he was to ben to take himself away ben made welcome use of the opportunity to dispatch a written note to mark informing the prince that his friends had now acquired the longdesired sword then ben valdemar yambu and zoltan all availed themselves of woundhealer clearing up all of their own hurts old and new the most recent of these being a couple of minor injuries sustained by ben in the course of his wrestling bout and subsequent escape from the flatboat accepting the sword of mercy yambu murmured this knee is wont to give me problems and with a surgeons steady hand she pulled up one leg of her gray trousers and thrust the hurtless blade straight into the pale skin there was no pain and of course she had not thought there would be any but the shock was unexpected and tremendous far greater than she had anticipated in the instant when woundhealer entered yambus body the world changed subtly but powerfully her chronically sore knee was healed but the nagging pain and its relief were alike forgotten in the simultaneous curing of a greater deeper anguish so long endured that the silver queen had ceased to be consciously aware of it at all so long endured ever since that day of evil memory almost a score of years ago when she had overcome the dark kings army with soulcutter in her hands ah said she who had once been the silver queen and let the black hilt of this far different blade slide from her grip the sword of love fell to the earth she stood for a moment with head thrown back a woman overtaken by some sudden fundamental pain or ecstasy no human watching could have said in that first moment which the paroxysm shook her for no more than a handful of heartbeats then yambu could move again there were no mirrors at hand and for long moments she could only marvel silently at the way her companions openmouthed were staring at her now and even more strongly did the silver queen wonder at her own internal sensations when she paused to savor them this this she could remember now was what it felt like to be fully alive at last she demanded what is it why do you all stare at me but in her heart she thought that she already knew the important part of the answer my lady this was zoltan her traveling companion for several years now suddenly hushed and reverent my lady you have grown young again ben his ugly countenance a study in awe was nodding soberly valdemar stood gaping young again nonsense and to confirm that it was nonsense the silver queen could see strands of her own long hair still gray drifting before her eyes she could clearly see her own hands weathered and worn not at all the hands of a young girl yet even as yambu contradicted zoltan she felt that he must be speaking some fundamental truth you are all looking at me so has anyone a mirror what had seemed almost a spell was broken zoltans thought was that there might possibly be a mirror in one of the blue temple or bandit packs that now lay scattered about he went to look ben agreed and joined the search but he failed to prosecute this effort vigorously stopping every few seconds to turn and look back at the silver queen valdemar was in this case the most practical of the four he said nothing but went a little apart to squat on the very shoreline of the river where he scooped up sand with his huge hands and splashed and puddled water into a concave excavation muttering the while when his efforts at magic had born fruit he lifted from the bank a kind of reflective glass as broad as a human countenance formed by the solidification of warm river water the object he handed to yambu was as heavy as liquid water but no heavier or colder flat and mirrorsmooth on one face rough as stone on its round edge and convex back my lady be assured that the glass as i give it to you is completely honest accepting the gift lady yambu stared into the brilliant surface there was no denying it she now looked forty again or even slightly younger instead of the sixty she had appeared to be before woundhealer touched her or her true age of fiftyone her hair was still white or nearly so but this alteration in color now appeared premature lines of tension and weariness so longengraved she had forgotten they were there had been expunged from the face which now looked back at her in which a longvanished light and beauty had now been reestablished this was the countenance of no mere girl but neither was it any longer old zoltan who had been her fellow pilgrim for several years continued to stare at yambu in timid awe as if she were a stranger it was time now for the others to enjoy their turns at gaining what benefit they might from the sword of mercys power none of the three underwent any visible transformation ben stretched and groaned with the enjoyment of having several minor aches and pains removed as a tired man might luxuriate in a massage valdemar was silent and thoughtful as woundhealers blade searched his flesh for damage the youth had evidently not accumulated much when zoltan had had his turn it was time to make camp for the night even freshly healed they were tired enough to camp where they were right by the ford with water readily available but the dozen dead still held that field and none of the four were minded to spend their own time and energy as a burial or cremation detail another problem with this location lay in the fact that brod would be able to find them easily should he return with some mischief in mind but these were minor considerations beside the counsel of the sword of wisdom it was yambu who at last put the question directly to wayfinder where is our safest place to camp tonight and the sword promptly pointed them across the ford away from the field of death before leaving the battlefield valdemar did as brod had been forbidden to do he armed himself with two of the many weapons now ownerless that lay about for the taking from one fallen soldier valdemar chose a battlehatchet and from another one a dagger with its sheath he had to unbuckle this last tool from its owners stiffened corpse the business was unpleasant but still he did it without hesitating he muttered to himself if i am to be a warrior i am going to need a warriors tools zoltan asked him have you any skill with those not with weapons but knives and hatchets are familiar implements enough then i suppose youve chosen well having forded the river the four headed northeast by north still following the sword of wisdom in bens hands following them for a short distance only came the healed loadbeast the creature paused watching them depart then it shook its head and went back to where grass grew along the river seven atop the highest tower of the sprawling white stone palace in sarykam standing on a paved rooftop that overlooked the redroofed city the placid harbor and the eastern sea redrimmed with dawn prince mark of tasavalta wearing nightshirt and slippers wrapped in a robe against the morning chill was leaning on a railing gazing to the south and west waiting and hoping for the arrival of one of his numerous winged messengers or scouts dawn was a good time the most likely time in all the day for certain birds the nightflying class of owllike scouts and messengers to come home the prince of tasavalta was a tall man strongly built his face worn by weather and by care his age just under forty his hair and eyes brown his manner distracted the semiintelligent creature whose arrival mark was anticipating presently became visible in the dawn sky as a faraway dot that in time grew into a pair of laboring wings twelveyearold stephen marks younger son already fully dressed joined his father on the rooftop as he did on many mornings to see whether any messengers might arrive the boy was sturdily built his hair darkening to the mediumbrown of his fathers the facial resemblance between father and son was growing stronger year by year the beastmaster attending the eyrie this morning was a man of exceptionally keen vision he was the first to confirm the distant wings now laboring in from the southwest as those of a particular messengerbird whose arrival had been expected for more than a day the beastmaster climbed up on a perch to meet and care for the animal which on landing turned out to have suffered some slight injury from the claws of a leatherwing the prince and his son climbing also were first to touch the large owllike creature mark gently took from around its neck the small flat pouch of thin leather the great bird its huge eyes narrowed to slits against the early daylight hooted and whistled out a few words indicating that it had been delayed for some hours by storms as well as reptiles leaving the bird to the beastmasters professional care mark carried the pouch down from the perch after hastily performing a magical test for safety he snapped open the container and extracted the single piece of paper which lay inside unfolding the note mark read silently the first time through the message had been sent by ben of purkinje is it from ben father yes hes several days away from sarykam or he was when he wrote this the prince read on skimming bad news not wishing to contemplate any more of that than absolutely necessary bens coming home marks face altered he stared at the note his mind almost numbed by the two code words that leapt out at him from near the end almost he feared to allow himself to hope let alone to triumph putting down the paper for the moment he looked around to make sure that no one but his son was close enough to hear him ben mentions an earlier message he announced softly and repeats it here to the effect that he has found wayfinder we never got that message some are bound to go astray dad that means if weve got wayfinder that means we can use it to find woundhealer doesnt it mark held up the note we could but theres more he already has woundhealer too dad he also says here that hes encountered old friends your cousin zoltan and the lady yambu i dont know if you remember her what are we going to do mark grinned what would you do if you were in command go get those swords at once not a very difficult decision hey but there was a considerably harder choice to be made immediately whether to let the news of bens evident success spread through the palace and thence inevitably before long into the ears of enemy agents the boost in home morale that this news should produce would be welcome but if the effort to bring woundhealer home came to nothing a corresponding letdown would ensue stephen was staring anxiously at his father mark commanded the boy to tell no one else the content of bens message for the time being the sword was not yet safely home when stephen had been given a chance to read the note for himself father and son teasing and challenging each other like two twelveyearolds went skipping and jumping down a set of ladders to the next lowest level of the tower and thence down several levels to the broader roof of the keep below there moving decisively the prince quietly began to set in motion preparations for an expedition to reclaim woundhealer stephen as his father had expected wanted to come along father will you be leaving right away within a few hours can i come with you mark made quick calculations no youll be needed here the refusal sent stephen into a silent rage he asked no questions said nothing at all but his face reddened and his jaw set mark sighed knowing his son he was not surprised he had no reason to expect or hope that this boy might be sheltered from danger all his life and every reason to believe that the lad had better be hardened to it the prince would probably have acceded to his sons request to join the expedition but for one fact stephen seemed to be the only person capable of brightening his mothers countenance or manner in the least mark explained this point then he repeated his refusal couching it this time in terms of military orders which made the pill somewhat easier to swallow when stephen choked on another protest his father ordered briskly get control of yourself and speak coherently yes father and the boy managed he was learning now this is an order with stephen under control for the time being at least the princes next impulse was to rush to kristin with the good news but then on thinking the matter over he was not sure how much he ought to tell his wife catching sight of a junior officer going about some other errand mark hailed the man and dispatched him to find general rostov proceeding in the direction of his wifes room mark encountered the chief physician of the palace a tall woman with a dark forbidding ageless face and kindly voice this lady inquired good news highness yes or the possibility of good news at least i will be making an announcement presently yet mark hesitated it would be terrible he thought again to raise hopes that might in a few days be dashed since kristins fall neither physicians nor wizards had ever been sanguine about her prospects for recovery none of the experts saw any real hope unless the sword of healing could somehow be obtained the physician said i have just come from her highnesss room what word today she bowed slightly your highness i have no good words to say to you mark interrupted the doctor at that point and dispatched stephen to look for uncle karel and when you have found him i expect it will be time you are about your regular morning tasks yes father when prince and physician were alone the healer went on gloomily to explain that she had quietly alerted the attendants to maintain a watch against a possible suicide attempt on the part of the longsuffering patient as bad as that mark was not really surprised but no mental preparation could shield him from the chill brought by those words i fear so prince well well he could still force his voice to be calm carry on we will do what we can the doctor bowed again and moved away mark had not progressed a dozen paces farther in the direction of his wifes room before he encountered general rostov who seemed already to have learned somehow that important matters were to be decided rostov was as tall as mark but the generals barrelchested frame was even broader he had black skin with an old scar on the right cheek his curly hair had once been black but was now almost entirely gray drawing rostov aside mark quietly outlined for him the expedition he wanted to lead out to gain possession of both swords karel will be going with you rostov asked he will mark considered that kristins uncle the chief wizard of the royal family and of the nation would be indispensable on such an expedition therefore you will be left in charge here at the palace after providing the prince with requested advice on several points and receiving a few detailed orders rostov saluted and moved away going about his business with his usual efficiency the prince at last reached his wifes room and entered the princess was occupying the same chamber as before her injury though now the room was even more brightly decorated cheerful paintings some of kristins favorites in her days of health hung on the walls and her favorite flowers stood in vases or grew in pots everything about the place was joyous airy lightsome and pleasant everything except for its occupant who lay garbed in a plain white gown her countenance like a mask of clay originally the nurses and other attendants assigned to care for the crippled princess had been chosen as much for their cheerful attitude as for their professional ability but those people had been replaced when kristin complaining bitterly to her husband had said she could not stand having such laughing fools around her this morning kristin was in her bed as usual she was capable of leaving it only seldom and briefly her body always slender was twisted now by broken bones that had healed only poorly and by spasmed muscles her face once beautiful had been eroded from within by pain and loss of weight indoor pallor had replaced her tan other than to utter an occasional grim comment on her own future or lack of one kristin now rarely spoke pulling a chair close to the bed mark sat down and gave his wife a partial report on the information that had just arrived by courier mark said only that there was new hope now and that he would soon be leaving town in search of woundhealer the prince took this precaution against raising hopes that might be dashed though in the bleak silence of his own thoughts he felt sure that the problem with kristin was really the absence of any hope at all mark took his wifes hand but then let it go when the touch seemed to cause her some new discomfort kristin appeared to listen to what her husband had to say but she made no comment obviously her attitude regarding the news was one of bitter pessimism her husband was saddened but not surprised by this reaction that he had learned was consistently the disposition of his wifes mind whatever news he brought or when as was more usual he had none to bring after leaving the sickroom mark found the old wizard karel waiting for him a fat old man with puffing breath and a rich soft voice karel on learning of the mornings message was in a hopeful mood i might suggest prince that you send a strong flying squadron to pick up the prize and carry it back to us as we ride south if this plan is successful it would speed up your gaining possession of the sword by a day or two at least mark was impressed favorably by the old mans suggestion but he postponed making a final decision on it if he were eventually to decide in favor of such a maneuver there would be no need to tell ben about it in advance so the prince omitted any mention of the scheme in the message he now began drafting to be carried back to ben as mark considered it strong arguments took shape in his mind against sending such a flying squad chief among these was the fact that any such halfintelligent flying force would run the risk of being detected and then ambushed by enemy magic flying reptiles or griffins no birds were strong enough to stand against such an attack wood himself who mark loathed as one of his great antagonists was known to travel airborne on a griffin or sometimes even on a demons back the danger presented by the possibility of ambush eventually came to seem too great by the time he had dispatched the message to ben mark had all but finally decided not to take the risk shortly after sunset the lady yambu her new reserves of energy not fully depleted by a long days hike was pacing restlessly about the simple camp she shared with her three companions the conversation that had begun a quarter of an hour ago had gradually died out and the three were now all watching her in vague apprehension suddenly she stopped her pacing and declared i think i must consult our sword again i grow doubtful that the road i must follow to the truth lies through tasavalta ben looked at her grunted then wordlessly detached wayfinder in its sheath from his belt and held the weapon out to her valdemars expression suggested that he was surprised he said to yambu if you are having doubts then i must have doubts also for several days now the four had been slogging steadily northeast in the general direction of tasavalta the land through which they traveled had gradually grown more rugged and their progress had become correspondingly slower now and then the sword they followed decreed some slight variation in their course toward sarykam when this happened the four travelers sometimes speculated about the possible cause of this deflection but none of the three who had considerable experience with the awesome power of swords suggested doing anything but going along with wayfinder and the detours whatever their cause had proven short at the moment the four were once more as nearly as they could estimate in this almost roadless waste on or near a straightline path toward the tasavaltan capital over the last few days and hours yambu had started several tunes to ask ben more about what the emperor had said to him regarding ariane but ben who had suggested such a conversation no longer seemed to know what else he wanted to say or hear on that subject the lady was about to raise the matter with ben again but before she could do so the travelers were excited by the arrival of a winged messenger eagerly ben unfastened the pouch from the great bird and fumbled it open intently he scanned the note inside zoltan read it over his shoulder nothing of importance the young man complained better than it looks ben assured him there are a couple of code words first congratulations thatll be for our getting woundhealer and second help is on the way their spirits considerably lightened the four pushed on within an hour they had became aware that someone was following them maintaining a careful distance your old friend brod zoltan decided squinting at the distant barely visible man who doubtless thought himself adequately concealed we should have finished him when we had the chance i suppose he went off in the little boat just to be deceptive why should he be following us valdemar wondered ben shrugged his gangs been wiped out and hes going to have to find some other way to make a living the silver queen had no comment her thoughts were evidently elsewhere that evening she spoke confidingly to her old friends ben and zoltan and her new follower valdemar i am almost a girl again no i dont mean that what foolishness i am fiftyone years old and healing will not turn back the years age in itself is not an illness or an injury but in a way i feel like a girl the horrible burden that soulcutter put on me so many years ago has at last been lifted can you understand what that means no there is no way you could understand and in her emotion the lady laughed and cried in a mixture of joy and confusion the emotional reaction which had come upon her when she was healed was now repeated even more strongly than before can you understand i can no longer be certain what my purpose in life is or ought to be i think i can understand my lady bens large hand pulled the sword she had given them out of its sheath he held the black hilt out toward her zoltan nodded it was a slow uncertain gesture as if he had trouble comprehending the ladys difficulty but considered that wayfinders powerful medicine ought to be worth a try in any case once more gripping wayfinder lady yambu posed a new question blade once more i seek your guidance was i speaking only foolishness when i asked you to find eternal truth for me you answered me i know but i am no longer sure what i was thinking two days ago it is almost as if i have been reborn the sword of wisdom hung inert in her grasp of course the question she had just asked as yambu understood full well was not the kind wayfinder could be expected to answer take your time my lady ben was respectfully concerned the trouble yambu was discovering was that she now found herself unable to formulate any inquiry to her own satisfaction indecisively she raised the sword and lowered it and raised it up again at last words burst forth was my healing the only truth i needed i have been granted the touch of the sword of mercy but again that is not the kind of question any sword can answer for me is it even as she spoke yambu was wishing that she had gone off by herself to so apostrophize wayfinder certainly the others were watching and listening with intense interest but now as if he were embarrassed ben motioned to the two younger men and all of them moved away leaving the lady alone with wayfinder the mute sword only quivered uncertainly in response to the questioners uncertainty changeable are you at least you are a silent counselor and theres wisdom to be found in that rejoining the others she sought out valdemar and held out the black hilt of the sheathed sword yambu said i am having but poor success will you try it for yourself once more the young man in farmers clothing hesitated then shook his head doggedly no i have already used wayfinder more than once and each time it has led me to you my purpose has not changed so for now let me continue as i am even if i have changed if i no longer know where i am going the young man smiled faintly very well then let me try the sword once more as steadily as ever the sword of wisdom with its black hilt once more in the huge hands of valdemar pointed straight toward the silver queen he returned the weapon to her hiltfirst making an almost courtly flourish he said i am content to follow lady whatever you decide to do she sighed then let your fate be on your own head eight this night it was valdemars turn to stand the last watch the hours just before dawn at the proper time ben woke him and silently held out to him the black hilt of the sword of wisdom with which his comrades were to be protected as they slept the young man sat up the folds of his blanket falling from around his massive shoulders and held both hands to his head for a long moment before he accepted wayfinder bad dreams ben inquired in a low voice no yes i think so but i dont remember valdemar shook his head i keep worrying about my vineyard once upon a time said ben when i was very young all i wanted out of life was to be a minstrel i really thought that i could be one too carried a lute around with me everywhere can you believe that yes i can said the other after a moments thought were you any good he asked with interest ben appeared to consider the question seriously no he said at last and turned away me for my own blanket valdemar began his watch in routine fashion by asking the sword of wisdom a question concerning the safety of the camp testing the limits on the kind of question the sword would answer he tended to keep trying new variations tonights first variant was will we be safer if we move to this query the sword in valdemars hands returned him no detectable answer he presumed that wayfinder would have pointed in the proper direction had its powers decided that the camp would indeed be more secure somewhere else the general safety assured for the moment at least to the sentrys satisfaction he asked his second question of this watch this one was whispered so softly that he could not hear his own words where is the nearest person present whose advice i should be following the sword of wisdom indicated yambu who appeared to be fast asleep valdemar nodded carrying wayfinder drawn and ready he paced the vicinity of the small camp applying the good sentrys technique he had learned from his new friends he varied his route and pace turning sharply at irregular intervals eyes and ears alert to the surrounding darkness he kept his eyes averted from the small fires brightness to preserve their sensitivity in the dark meanwhile his routine worries returned counting the days he had already been away from home confirming his estimate of the advancing season by the current phase of the moon valdemar knew with certainty that his vines would soon be leafing out and would need care he had done all he could for the plants before he left but they would soon be growing wild and insects would attack them he lacked the skills of magic necessary to do anything effective about these problems at a distance though of course he could try valdemar doubted whether he could project any potent spells against insects at least not over more than a few meters hed make the effort of course but not now right now he had to concentrate upon his duties as a guard once more he put a safety question to the sword on the chance that circumstances had changed adversely in the past few minutes once more wayfinder seemed to assure him that all was well time continued to pass uneventfully ben had hardly hit the ground before falling fast asleep as a faint rumble of snoring testified the night wind ghosted past valdemars ears and the moon and the familiar stars though only intermittently visible through a patchwork of clouds moved in their familiar paths above his head where he wondered suddenly was woundhealer resting at this moment he tried to remember who had been carrying the sword of mercy then in the course of his next sharp turn as he patrolled the young man peering intently by the vague light of stars and moon caught a glimpse of the black hilt the sword was currently in zoltans custody its shape unmistakable within its wrappings lying in contact with his sleeping body all was well then valdemar relaxed though he reminded himself sternly to remain alert but as his watch dragged on he strayed into asking wayfinder one private question after another only to realize guiltily once more that long moments had passed in which the sword of wisdom was no longer really charged with protecting the camp tonight he was not only worried about his vineyard but also bothered by particular concerns about his bridetobe as pictured in his imagination she was a creature of unsurpassed loveliness but her existence as anything but a creation of his own imagination he had begun to doubt lost intermittently in these problems valdemar continued his pacing circling the small campfire on an irregular path the sword of wisdom naked in his right hand a battlehatchet belonging to some fallen warrior stuck in his farmers belt at the moment his halfdistracted mind presented wayfinder with a new inquiry for the benefit of himself and the sleeping three which way to go to foil our enemies which way to go this time the sword returned him a firm answer generally northeast the direction of their daytime travel then valdemar stopped listening to himself actually of course neither he nor any of his three companions wanted to go anywhere at the moment right now they all wanted to get some rest but how hard it was thought valdemar as he paced on again for a man to know consistently what beyond the physical necessities of the moment he really wanted to do to achieve the world held so many kinds of things to want anticipating the first rays of dawn the young man found it impossible to keep his mind with absolute consistency upon the camps defense then he would silently upbraid himself and once more stalk about in his random pattern holding the sword and murmur i seek the safety of this camp i seek the safety of this receiving no answer to what was not really a question he would shake his head and mutter no need to keep repeating things like that no need to keep repeating things an hour passed all continued quiet and nothing untoward occurred and as nothing in particular seemed to be happening other questions other urges drifted as subtly as growing vines into control of valdemars mind thus it was that the pacing dreaming sentry was granted no warning whatsoever one moment he and his sleeping companions were as far as he knew all safe all at peace save for the faint animal noises of the nocturnal wasteland sounds more reassuring than disturbing and in the next moment they were being overwhelmed the onslaught as valdemar came later to understand was wellcoordinated and consisted of an airborne magical component as well as a force of more mundane attackers on the ground somewhere over the young mans head there came a beating of great unseen wings sounding far larger than those of any flying creature valdemar had ever seen or heard before simultaneously he heard a prosaic thunder of approaching hoofbeats on the ground letting out a hoarse cry valdemar whirled about brandishing his sword unable for the first moment of the attack to see anything out of the ordinary at all then suddenly the sentry found himself confronted by a live man standing where a moment earlier there had been no one at all the figure was that of a warrior sword upraised garbed in the same blue temple colors worn by half of yesterdays fallen for just a moment valdemar was frozen by his own imagination by the terrible image of all those bodies he had helped to rob of food and shoes and weapons of those dead risen now to claim some kind of vengeance for a moment only then a second swordsman and a third materialized behind the first out of darkness and the desert and the young man understood that his attackers were only too full of mundane life he let out a hoarse shout of alarm realizing even as he did so that his warning must now be too late but his companions were reacting very quickly around him friends and foes were scrambling in the darkness the first attacker recoiled from the camps sentry out of respect for the sword that valdemar was holding if not for his gigantic figure but now others were coming at him from the sides and now a gossamer net more magic than material came dropping softly toward him from a great blurred form in the softly moonlit sky barely in time he twisted out from under the net sensing its enchantment drawn steel valdemar had heard was the most effective countermeasure an ordinary man could take against a wizards onslaught and perhaps the sword in his right hand the battlehatchet now drawn in his left exerted some measure of protection the lady yambu who had been the closest of the other three to valdemar when the enemy appeared now rose up at his side hands spread in a magicians gesture joining him in his hopeless though spirited defense of the camp part of his mind noted that the lady did not have woundhealer of course that sword had been with zoltan fight she snapped at valdemar we must not let ourselves be taken alive not by these valdemar with no time to think only grunted something in return brandishing the battlehatchet in one hand and wayfinder in the other and confident in his own strength though mindful of his lack of skill he faced the enemy soldiers as what looked like a crowd of them came at him the young giant wielded both hatchet and sword with ferocious energy and by sheer strength he succeeded in chopping down at least one of his attackers to his surprise the others fell back momentarily the silver queen had become a shadow gliding at valdemars side and afforded him some unexpected but very welcome magical assistance still the odds in favor of the enemy were overwhelming and they were returning to the attack zoltan had come wide awake alerted by some subliminal perception two or three heartbeats before the attack actually fell on the camp he was fully conscious and active in an instant and aware of ben beside him also springing to his feet both were veterans who needed only a momentary glimpse of the assailants surrounding yambu and valdemar the latter fighting with the sword of wisdom to convince them that the odds were hopeless but so far zoltan and ben were not surrounded rather they were at one side of the struggle and escape appeared to be still possible getting the sword of mercy back to tasavalta came ahead of everything else zoltan with woundhealer already in his hands unsheathed the blade and without hesitation plunged it deep into his own body holding himself transfixed with a hand on the black hilt with his other hand he pulled his own short sword from its scabbard and used it to run through the first enemy trooper to come at him in the dimness of the fading night the troopers dying counterstroke cut down on zoltans left shoulder and might have nearly taken off his arm had not woundhealers overwhelmingly benign force prevailed the enemys sword fell free zoltans wound closing behind it so quickly that he lost no blood ben who had been unarmed except for a short knife and wayfinder grabbed up the fallen weapon and killed two men with it in the next few moments of confusion zoltan was running now with ben beside him away from the beleaguered yambu and her young ally zoltan struck down another attacker receiving another harmless swordslash in the process and ben smashed another foe aside both of them kept on running their backs to the noise and turmoil surrounding valdemar and the silver queen a flying reptile came lowering out of the sky at zoltan talons biting harmlessly almost painlessly into his head and face which were still protected by the magic of the gods one claw bit through his eye and did no harm his vision clearing once more with a blink he could hear below the harsh gasping of his own lungs the softly breathing sound made by the sword of mercy mending this new damage to his body as quickly as it happened even as his eyesight cleared zoltans killing sword bit into the airborne reptiles guts he heard the beast scream and then fall heavily to earth behind him as he ran on ben kept pounding along beside him so far managing to keep up but now a net of magic fell about them both a gossamer interference with thought and movement that would have stretched them both out on the ground had not zoltan been protected from all injury his senses and his thought remained clear and he felt the evil magic only as he might have felt a cobweb tear across his face beside him ben staggered and stumbled in his run and would have fallen headlong had not zoltan managed to sheath his own killing blade and catch the huge man under one arm pulling and hauling him through torn cobwebs grunting with the effort zoltan kept ben on his feet until the last shreds of the magic net had been left behind them still the young man had trouble believing that the two of them were really going to get away glancing back when they had run another fifty meters he decided that he and ben were being greatly helped in their escape by the fact that the attackers were concentrating so thoroughly on getting the sword of wisdom into their hands valdemar kept hearing someone in command of the blue temple forces shouting orders to take that man alive he knew the order referred to him there was nothing to do but fight on yambus warning fresh in his mind and the sword in his hands making it substantially harder for the enemy to do what they wanted if only valdemar prayed fervently this sword were shieldbreaker a rough ring of enemies kept forming around him and yambu but he kept muttering rapidly at wayfinder asking the sword of wisdom to show him the best way to escape then keeping up as best he could with the swords rapidly changing instructions he charged bravely at one blue temple weak point after another the trouble was that soon there were no weak points in the rapidly closing ring yambu meanwhile stayed on her feet moving with agility to remain at valdemars back she kept doing magical things things he could not comprehend but that must be serving to keep the attackers at least temporarily off balance but the odds were too great their resistance could not last the enemy magic was stronger than the silver queens if not than wayfinders at last valdemar the sword in his hands notwithstanding felt himself overwhelmed by swirling powers by rampaging physical forms gold and blue faintly visible in moonlight were everywhere around him whether the force that finally overcame him was material or occult he could not have said and anyway it seemed to make no difference dimly aware that the lady yambu was still nearby and shared his fate he was knocked down disarmed made prisoner then with her limp and evidently unconscious body being dragged beside valdemar both of them were removed a short distance from their place of capture to a place where a strange bright light was shone on their faces and their captors puzzled in mumbling voices over their identity that question having been answered to the winners satisfaction or else determined to be not quickly answerable valdemar could not tell which the pair were moved another short distance there they were left on the ground seemingly temporarily abandoned quickly valdemar discovered that his arms and legs had been efficiently paralyzed by magic but within moments after those who threw him down had turned away he managed to shake free of some kind of cover evidently a material one which had been thrown over his head his first use of this limited power of movement was to look for zoltan and ben wondering if they were still alive and what had happened to woundhealer three or four meters away lay the dim inert form of the silver queen the young man spoke to the lady quietly but received no answer the attack as valdemar saw when he once more began to obtain a clear view of his surroundings had been carried out by a small but powerful force of blue temple troops magicians and inhuman creatures a few reptiles had already come down out of the clouded slowly brightening sky larger forms were looming there even as he watched a pair of the giant wings he had earlier sensed overhead came closer a creature landed valdemar harking back to stories heard in childhood realized that it must be a griffin he could only gaze in wonder this was a large creature much bigger than a ridingbeast with eagles head and beak and wings and legs and talons of a gigantic lion across its back was strapped a kind of saddle flanked on each side by a kind of hanging woven basket a sidecar or howdah one or two men valdemar could not get a clear look at first were riding on the beast there would have been room for three with a driver in the central saddle on the ground the fourlegged monster knelt then crouched the first of the passengers to disembark was a welldressed man short redfaced and bald who made an awkward dismount from one of the sidecars moments later a second elderly blue temple official came into valdemars field of vision he was older and less ruddy of countenance than the first valdemar could not be sure whether this man had disembarked from the same mount or from a slightly smaller griffin which had landed close behind the first it was soon evident that the attacking force was commanded by the rather short redfaced man valdemar now heard this individual addressed as chairman hyrcanus the elder obviously second in importance was called the director valdemar with some difficulty raising his head a little farther against the bonds of magic that still held him down was able to watch and listen as the chairman expressed his satisfaction at having the solid ground under his feet again now from among the mixed group of blue temple military and irregulars who had gathered there emerged a face and a voice that valdemar to his surprise could recognize chairman hyrcanus was greeted by sergeant brod who came pushing forward from amidst the latest detachment of cavalry to reach the scene at least the sarge having somehow attached himself to the attackers made an attempt to offer the chairman such a greeting but the official scowling at this interloper would not listen whore you hyrcanus demanded and then before the man could possibly have answered turned irritably to his cavalry officer whos this the officer seemed to shrink under his leaders glare the man is a local guide we have signed on your opulence hes been useful another expense i suppose the chairman turned away with an impatient gesture get my pavilion up thus brusquely rebuffed brod looked about catching sight of valdemar and lady yambu he came to stand over them an expression of satisfaction gradually replacing the scowl on his ugly face reckon ive met you folks before good mornin to ye good morning said valdemar thinking he had nothing to lose thereby yambu did not answer the ladys eyes were closed her face relaxed as if in sleep while brod hovered nearby evidently wondering what to do next valdemar saw and heard the officer in command of the small blue temple cavalry force standing at attention before hyrcanus respectfully ask the chairman if there were any further orders if not his men had been riding all night and were in need of rest hyrcanus abstractedly seeing to the careful unloading of a trunk from one of the griffins cargo baskets gave the troops permission to rest once camp was properly established and a guard posted then hyrcanus stretching and twisting his body as if he might be cramped from a long ride exchanged some words with his director of security both men complained about the weariness and nervous strain brought on by this regrettably necessary means of travel the chairman also congratulated his director of security on the fact that that gentlemans wits such as they were seemed to have been fully restored the director chuckled dutifully and drily at the little joke if such it was then both of the blue temple executives the chairman in the lead came to gaze sourly at their prisoners staring at the supine youth hyrcanus demanded who are you fellow my name is valdemar that means nothing to me you are chairman of the whole blue temple valdemar didnt know much about how such great organizations were managed or really what he would have expected their managers to be like but certainly he would have anticipated someone more impressive than this dumpy commonplace figure brod evidently still determined to gain points with the greatest celebrity he had probably ever encountered had edged his way forward and now took the opportunity to kick valdemar energetically in the ribs show some respect to chairman hyrcanus the sarge barked someone else in the middle distance called we have the property ready for your inspection sir hyrcanus readily allowing both kicker and victim to drop below the horizon of his attention turned away valdemar got the impression that this man cared little for anyones respect the property whatever that might be was of much greater interest valdemar supposed that the interesting property ready for inspection was the sword of wisdom he stretched his neck but couldnt quite make out the object on the ground that hyrcanus and the others gathered round to look at whatever it was after a short conference hyrcanus was back looming over valdemar fellow they tell me that you were standing watch sentry duty at the time of our arrival the chairman had the look of a man who was perpetually suspicious yes i was valdemars bitterness at having failed in that duty came through what of it brod having moved into the background again was not in sight at the moment it was an ordinary soldier who kicked valdemar this time though valdemar really hadnt been trying to be insolent these people he thought were really difficult to deal with hyrcanus asked him impatiently and you were holding the sword called wayfinder as you stood guard the youth saw no reason not to admit that fact the redfaced man nodded no doubt it looked an excellent weapon and it is but perhaps you did not understand its real value perhaps i did not to valdemar it seemed no more than a reasonable answer but there must have been something wrong with his tone of voice for he was awarded another kick soon his ribs were going to get sore perhaps you were not using the sword properly not engaging its full powers perhaps i was not chairman and director turned away and walked a little distance to put their heads together for some more mumbling then the latter emerged from the huddle to announce well question him more thoroughly later what about the woman soon both officials were bending over yambu magical assistance was called for and provided soon the director admitted she seems to have put herself into some kind of trance well soon have her out of it when were ready to talk hyrcanus squinting and frowning taking a closer look at the woman ordered someone to bring him a better light when a magicallyenhanced torch so bright it almost hurt to look at it was held over the sleeping face hyrcanus said in a low voice that she reminded him of the silver queen but that seemed improbable and in any case this woman appeared too young another subordinate approached the chairman deferentially to inquire of him exactly where he wanted his pavilion put up some soldiers and a minor magician were ready to get to work on that task now hyrcanus considered and told him then he and his director continued their discussions with valdemar still able to hear most of what was said one of the soldiers had pointed out that curiously three or four of his comrades had been killed at some little distance from the spot where the two prisoners were taken killed by whom thats it sir we dont know the director of security demanded are we sure there were four of these people on the scene before we attacked yes sir then it is obvious that two have somehow managed to get away you should not have allowed that the military officers only defense was that orders had been to make sure the sword was captured no matter what else happened the two high officials moved a little farther off from what valdemar could overhear they were remarking how strange it seemed that the sword of wisdom had not only failed to save the camp but failed to guide its wielder to some means of avoiding death or capture the chairman was coming back i wonder if this could be in fact the lady yambu sergeant brod presented at last with a chance to be useful did not allow it to go to waste sir master chairman it is in fact the lady herself that we are looking at i have seen her before and i can swear to it you again hyrcanus frowning looked around at his subordinates appealing silently for someone to take this fellow away a small squad of soldiers moved to do the job valdemar hearing only a mutter and a scuffle thought philosophically that he would not be surprised to see brod back again if she is yambu hyrcanus was brooding to himself gazing once more upon that silent face if she is then she at least would have realized the value of the sword with which her little group was traveling that is certainly the case your opulence agreed the director then he raised his eyes to meet valdemars well fellow who do you say she is nine until zoltan was sure that he and ben had left the enemy behind he continued running with woundhealer transfixing his own body his left hand gripping the hilt to hold the sword in place so far he and ben were managing to stay together though this required zoltan to slow down the young man calculated that bens presence would be a mighty advantage toward their goal of getting woundhealer home the continued presence of the sword of healing inside his rib cage engendered in zoltan a very strange sensation neither pleasure nor pain but rather a sense that some tremendous experience whether good or bad must be about to overwhelm him the feeling was mentally though not physically uncomfortable both men ran on without speaking under the gradually brightening sky of early morning as soon as zoltan could be reasonably sure that no enemies were in close pursuit or ahead of them he paused and released woundhealers hilt there was no need to pull in order to extract the blade instead it slid itself smoothly and gently out of his heart and lungs away from his torso once more a sighing sound came from the sword then it was once more inert zoltan felt physically fine taking a quick inventory of his body he could discover no residual harm or damage at all from the several deadly blows he had recently sustained his giant comrade swaying and groaning at his side was in considerably worse shape and in need of woundhealers immediate help ben completely out of breath indicated with a silent gesture that he wanted zoltan to hand over the sword to him the younger man complied a quick application of woundhealer abolished bens injuries as if they had never been now the voice of the older man was clear and strong ah thats better much better with ben retaining the sword of mercy the men moved on together at the best pace the older man could manage their running flight had already put several low rolling almost barren hills between them and the site where the blue temple attack had fallen zoltan beginning to chafe and fret with the need to accommodate his slower partner now suggested i might take it and run on ahead no the answer was definite though made brief to conserve breath making himself be patient zoltan allowed his more experienced companion to set their course the sky continued brightening but only gradually and sullenly more spring rain appeared to be on the way ben was not heading directly toward sarykam but somewhat to the west where a few trees grew along a ravine that held a trickle of muddy water at its bottom trudging toward the ravine ben and zoltan made plans as best they could both were eagerly anticipating the help promised from mark but neither could see any way to guess when such assistance might be expected to arrive no hope for the lady back there or the young man either said ben pausing momentarily to look over his shoulder toward the place where their camp had been all was silent in that direction but zoltan thought he could see beyond a series of intervening hills the glow of bright unnatural lights contending against the slowly brightening sky of morning no it seems a miracle that we got away zoltan shook his head they looked like blue temple ben grunted so they did that means its probably not a miracle whatever a job may be if its nothing to do with counting money theyre as like as not to botch it up i take it were pushing straight on to tasavalta more or less straight i mean to get there ben said grimly with woundhealer daylight was coming on in earnest now the sky continued overcast now and then dropping a spatter of rain or lowering patches of drifting fog the fugitives welcomed this weather certain to render more difficult the task of any airborne searchers we have to assume therell be more reptiles of course and maybe worse than that the few trees along the ravine offered only scanty cover on a sunny day the tasavaltans might have been forced to look for somewhere to remain hidden during the day clouds rain and fog offered some hope but weather was subject to change continuing their conversation as they hiked zoltan and ben discussed the question of whether or not the blue temple attackers would know that they had got away it seemed almost certain that they would we hacked down a few people as we left zoltan nodded and if they know weve got this sword theyll certainly be after us unless theyre so distracted by having wayfinder and yambu and valdemar perhaps alive that theyre not interested in us depends what they do with wayfinder if theyre going to use the sword of wisdom to hunt us down or hunt this sword were carrying weve got no chance ben grunted stoically all we can do is move ahead keep trying but the day wore on and still no pursuit appeared in the air or overland pleasantly surprised at their luck zoltan and ben could only pray that it would hold they must have discovered some better use for wayfinder than tracking us better than hunting down another sword it sounds strange but the truth must be that they dont realize that we have woundhealer possibly they dont even know that it was in our camp the day passed in hiking scanning the skies which fortunately remained clouded and foraging for berries when dusk came on ben changed course now leading the way generally north and east in the direction from which they could expect the approach of prince mark and his people half an hour after the blue temple attack morning was brightening slowly and sullenly as chairman hyrcanus was establishing himself in an organized field office in intervals between his other tasks hyrcanus kept coming back to look at the supine figure of the captive woman each time he looked and shook his head and went away again he said if this is indeed the silver queen it would seem that she has somehow grown young again magic offered the director succinctly another blue temple wizard evidently some kind of specialist brought in for a consultation sighed uncertainly no mere ordinary youthspell i can vouch for that he glanced toward valdemar still lying under magical paralysis what does her companion say he says that she might be anyone for all he knows well conduct some serious questioning presently but hyrcanus and his aides were giving the silver queen and valdemar only a small part of their attention much more of their time was spent in gloating over their captured sword and getting the field office organized a swarm of hustling soldiers heaving poles and fabric aided by some minor magic had needed only a few minutes to complete the task of erecting the chairmans pavilion this large tent was put up very near the place where valdemar still lay with a light rain falling on his face from the moment when the pavilion started to take form he had a good view in through its open doorway new lights even stranger than the magically augmented torch were somehow kindled inside it to augment the mornings feeble daylight valdemar kept looking toward yambu he could see her face rather more clearly now still unconscious or submerged in some kind of selfinflicted trance a bustle of blue and gold activity continued around the pavilion and inside it gradually the movements became more orderly as soon as the work was finished the director ordered that the two captives be brought into the big tent with a view to beginning their formal questioning valdemar was hauled roughly to his feet and words muttered over him giving him movement in his legs and some degree of control then he was marched in through the fabric doorway chairman hyrcanus himself redfaced and puffing as if the labor of erecting the tent had fallen to him personally still garbed in heavy winter garments despite the relative warmth of spring was seated behind a folding table near the center of the pavilion still grumbling in an almost despairing tone about the sacrifices he had had to make to venture personally into the field on this operation so vital for the blue temples future the director seated at the chairmans side tried to soothe him with expressions of sympathy standing before the central table valdemar heard once more somewhere behind him the voice of sergeant brod turning his head he saw that the sarge had reappeared evidently still trying to make himself useful to the chairman and his people but brod had been forced to remain outside the tent hyrcanus himself was wasting no time but not hurrying particularly either shuffling papers about in front of him methodically getting ready to undertake in his own good time whatever business might be required behind the chairman piled inconspicuously in the shadows toward the rear of the tent valdemar could see what appeared to be certain metal tools looking too complicated to be simple weapons vaguely he wondered what they were the chairman cleared his throat he made an announcement something to the effect that this session was going to be only preliminary looking sternly at his clerks seated at another table along one wall he added the fact that we must conduct in the field operations more properly performed at headquarters is no excuse for inefficiency everything must be done in a businesslike fashion yambu having somehow been restored to at least partial consciousness was now being brought into the pavilion too and made to stand beside valdemar they exchanged looks neither said anything valdemar thought that probably there were no useful words to be said at the moment rain and wind surged against the blue and gold tent as if in a fruitless endeavor to get at the papers inside several folding chairs enough as valdemar thought he heard someone remark for the absolute necessary minimum of meetings were disposed about within the tent two or three of the strange old world lights had been placed on the tables and another mounted on a folding metal stand valdemar got the impression that there was some kind of heating device as well old world or magical giving off a gentle invisible glow of warmth around the chairmans feet hyrcanus mumbling almost inaudibly to himself was busily extracting more sheaves of paperwork from a dispatch case of dull leather and laying the stuff out upon his table under the bright efficient light valdemar watching assumed that this array of written records must be intended to serve some magical purpose he could not picture any mundane necessity for it at a nod from the chairman one of his subordinates gave the order for the prisoners to be moved one at a time somewhat closer to the central table before getting down to serious questioning the chairman acting in the tradition of his organization saw to it that his captives names and descriptions were noted down and that they were methodically robbed hands went dipping into valdemars pockets and his clothing was patted and probed by means both physical and magical valdemar realized to his surprise that these people were more concerned with him than with the silver queen the only reason he could imagine for this was that he had happened to be holding the sword when they arrived an exact inventory was taken of all valuables confiscated from the two prisoners actually these were very few and of disappointingly little value valdemar noted that the high officials of the temple took very seriously this business of accounting for items of trivial financial value money practically none sir but the clerk under the chairmans cold stare went on to itemize the few small coins which had been taken from valdemar and yambu this painstaking listing accomplished in the meticulous blue temple fashion occupied what seemed to valdemar an inordinate amount of time though valdemar had never before had any direct dealings with the blue temple he like everyone else had heard a thousand stories exemplifying its legendary greed and stinginess while the young man had no liking for the picture painted by those stories the tales inspired in him not terror so much as contempt and wariness he was now waiting impatiently for a chance to argue that he should be considered a noncombatant here and allowed to go on about his business but the chairman was in no hurry nor were his clerks who evidently understood exactly the attitude toward work that was required of them while hyrcanus sat shuffling and rearranging his papers at one folding table they were busy writing and calculating at another among their other tasks valdemar gathered as he listened to their clerkly murmurs was that of keeping a precise expense account how much was this mission costing the corporation in the background two or three meters behind and above the droning clerks a small window high in the rear wall of the pavilion afforded valdemar an occasional sight of one of the griffins or perhaps two he could not be sure whether it was really the same huge nightmarish head and neck that now and then loomed up in the mornings gloom as if the beast were curious about what was happening inside the tent the griffin or griffins had evidently been tethered close behind the pavilion the griffin or griffins valdemar realized at a second look were eating something out there lionjaws dripped with a dark liquid in the uncertain cloudy light suddenly he had the horrible feeling that the creatures were tearing some animal or human body to pieces for a snack the chairman coughed drily but then just when valdemar thought hyrcanus might at last be ready to get down to business the chairman delayed again turning to his director of security to lament the cost to the temple in time and money of this journey he had spent some days in getting here traveling from the unnamed city of his headquarters and he considered the expense of shipping his necessary equipment to have been almost ruinous talking to his director of headquarters security upon whose bald head the old world light gleamed brightly and who here in the bright light looked even older than he had outside now and then looking up to glare at his new prisoner or prisoners as if he considered them to blame the chairman deigned to give them all several reasons why he had felt it necessary to take charge personally of this expedition one because i feared that master wood on once getting the sword of wisdom into his hands would never relinquish it hyrcanus paused thoughtfully of course i suppose woundhealer is one sword wood might be induced to give up for a price the director to no ones surprise expressed agreement now a long strongbox was carried into the tent by a couple of soldiers in blue and gold who handled the prize warily after depositing the strongbox at the chairmans feet they opened it lifted out the sword of wisdom and placed it carefully in front of hyrcanus upon the table after a blue satin cloth had been meticulously folded and positioned for a cushion one of the clerks moving fussily and nervously slightly adjusted the old world lights to provide hyrcanus with the best illumination only at this point was valdemar struck by the conspicuous absence of the sword of mercy since he had been taken prisoner no one in his hearing had even mentioned woundhealer that could only mean he thought that either ben or zoltan had managed to get away with the sword of healing at this thought valdemar shot the lady yambu a sharp glance and she as if she somehow knew just what idea had just occurred to him responded with a glance urging caution yes valdemar thought it must be true hyrcanus and his people gave no indication of realizing how close they had come to capturing the sword of healing had they been aware of how narrowly that prize had just escaped them they would already have launched an intensive search for it and not be dawdling through this leisurely preparation for an interrogation of course wayfinder by itself was treasure indeed treasure enough as valdemar was beginning to realize to dazzle at least slightly even the chairman of the blue temple himself when the soldiers put the sword of wisdom down in front of hyrcanus his eyes came alight he touched the black hilt with a tentative forefinger then stroked it greedily confronted with the reality of wayfinder chairman and director both appeared to speedily lose interest in their prisoners evidently any serious questioning would be allowed to wait the director of security rubbed his bald head nervously as he stared at the sword he said sir we must get this property to a place of safety as soon as possible of course hyrcanus leaned forward on the table but surely we would be at fault derelict in our duty to the temple stockholders if we did not find one other duty even more pressing and perform that one first sir we must delay carrying this treasure away to safety just long enough to make our first use of it the director hesitated may i ask what use your opulence has in mind you may ask though i suppose it should be obvious the chairman his face displaying a look of satisfaction paused as if for emphasis i intend to require this sword to indicate to us the location of the greatest treasure in the world for a moment there was silence in the pavilion valdemar was suddenly struck by what he considered an ominous indication neither chairman nor director was displaying the least concern about the fact that their prisoners were listening to this discussion it was the young man thought as if the blue temple officials considered their captives already dead at last hyrcanus standing up moving carefully drew wayfinder from its sheath the blade caught bright gleams from the old world lights as the chairman gripped the hilt in his two soft hands making the swords powers for the moment his own now how shall i phrase this request exactly this preliminary question seemed to be addressed more to himself than to anyone else or to the sword itself the worried director answered with a murmured suggestion that the first care be for safety but hyrcanus stubbornly shook his head we have he said had direct assurances regarding our present security from our cavalry commander and also from your powers magician true true your opulence but tell me do you believe that our encampment here is now secure or is it not at the moment sir it is secure enough the other murmured unhappily then there you are would breaking camp right now make the sword any safer besides our men and beasts are tired they are all in need of rest before we undertake another march true enough your opulence while they rest we at the executive level can best make use of our time by pursuing our further duties to the stockholders now for the first time hyrcanus addressed the sword directly in his dry voice he phrased a simple demand where is the greatest treasure in the world valdemar watching with a dozen others thought that the sword did not react or it reacted only slightly and in an uncertain way what in the world now the chairman demanded suddenly querulous obviously he had been expecting a more dramatic response of some kind letting the blade rest on the table he rubbed his left hand the one free of the swords hilt over his bald head after a little silence the director cleared his throat do you think chairman there might possibly have been some ambiguity in your phrasing of the question ambiguity you mean some uncertainty as to which of the worlds treasures is actually the greatest ah the question of determining the best measure of determined value authorities do disagree on that its true hyrcanus cleared his throat again perhaps i should rephrase my inquiry valdemar hoped that if hyrcanus did receive from the sword a plain unequivocal answer to any of his urgent questions regarding treasure the chairman would not feel it necessary to break camp at once tired men and beasts or not and follow the direction indicated because what might he do with his prisoners then hyrcanus was now interrupting himself to raise another point i wonder whether we ought not to approach prince mark or any successful monarch might do i suppose with the idea of making some kind of trade for this lovely piece of magic or offering it for sale after of course we have used it to the best advantage for the temple prince mark mused the director in a noncommittal tone i am assuming mark can raise sufficient treasure to make such a purchase indeed such a powerful prince ought to be able to do so a brief debate on this point followed between hyrcanus and his director of security finally the latter brought the discussion back to considerations of safety valdemar listening attentively gathered that neither the chairman nor the director believed mark had been able to retain any appreciable amount of booty from the fabulous infamous great raid both officials seemed to be saying that comparatively little blue temple wealth had actually been lost on that occasion but neither of the blue temple leaders seemed able to believe that mark had not spent his years in power in tasavalta amassing more wealth for himself eventually they came back to the business at hand getting the best possible quick advantage from wayfinder the more i think about it director the more it seems to me that you are right to assure that we obtain an unequivocal useful answer we must be clear in our own minds about the nature of the specific treasure we are seeking hyrcanus toyed meditatively with the sword the director said i should think your opulence that the most likely site for a truly unsurpassable treasure might well be in one of the blue temples own vaults what do you say i wonder sir if we will know whether this sword is pointing at our own gold do you personally know the locations and certified values of each and every one of our own hoards their bearings from this spot hyrcanus hesitated fractionally before insisting of course i do dont you of course sir valdemar listening marveled at the indications suggesting that neither of these men was really sure of the matter the young man could see the fires of cupidity beginning to burn out of control in the eyes of the new masters of the sword of wisdom as they huddled close over their prize it looked as if the director was beginning to be won over from his concerns of safety by his masters allpowerful greed they were both staring at wayfinder obsessively now perhaps valdemar thought they were coming to terms with the condition all users of this weapon had to face that the socalled sword of wisdom would never tell anyone why or what or how or when or whether regarding any thing but only with seeming infallibility exactly where hyrcanus murmured you are right if our own treasure be not the greatest then whose hyrcanuss chief aide said to him possibly some old world trove that for all our searching we have never been able to discover possibly the chairman sank back into his chair or possibly it is some property of the emperors to which access is restricted by some tremendous enchantment the director who had risen when his leader did was not really listening instead he now waved his arms in the excitement of an inspiration of his own wait i have it the swords answer to your original question was hard to interpret ambiguous for a very good reason because it was selfreferential aha yes your opulence the swords themselves are the worlds greatest treasure and this sword in particular must be valued above all the others way finder itself may be no must be the greatest treasure in the world and why because it is the key to all the rest ahh hyrcanus his eyes suddenly gone wide let out a breath of satisfaction he had no need to ponder the directors claim for very long before giving it his approval this very weapon before us my good director yes what could be more valuable i will see to it that you receive a bonus of shares perhaps even a seat on the board valdemar was thinking that it made sense very possibly they were right from their point of view the sword of wisdom had a transcendent value because it was capable of leading them to all the other swords or to any other treasure that they cared to specify having made that identification the director remarked are we any further in deciding how best to use our greatest treasure i think said the chairman that we must be somewhat more specific and somewhat more modest in our next inquiry indeed yes very well then he addressed wayfinder again sword i adjure you to show us to show me the way to the emperors most magnificent treasure hyrcanus hesitated then gave a little nod of satisfaction and plunged on i mean to that thing or collection of things that i would consider most magnificent were i to see them all valdemar and yambu standing beside him watched and listened the young man at least hardly daring to breathe but he was somewhat puzzled the emperor the name evoked only the vague image of a hapless clown of a legendary figure out of childhood fables who even if he really lived would be far less real and less important than any of the nowvanished gods wayfinder twitched visibly in the chairmans hands but that was all evidently it was still giving only an ambiguous indication at best hyrcanus evidently found this behavior unacceptable surely you can respond more definitely sword if i said i wanted to find the emperor how would you answer me this question was so obviously hypothetical that hyrcanus scarcely paused before recasting it with firm blue temple legalism sword i bid you guide me to meet the emperor but again the sword only demonstrated uncertainty the chairman set his treasure gently down upon the table and drummed his fingers next to it well director how are we to interpret this that we are only to wait here to meet the emperor that does not seem to make much sense unless he is coming to call upon us he added drily an unprecedented event surely i agree your opulence in the following silence yambus voice sounded quite unexpectedly so that everyone turned to look at her perhaps the emperor is on his way here to meet you her face wore what valdemar thought an odd expression even considering her situation her statement was received with mixed reactions by the men in power these were knowledgeable worldly leaders they were constitutionally wary of the unknown in all its aspects and whatever knowledge they possessed about the great clown beyond what ordinary people knew they did not particularly fear him hyrcanus looked with interest at yambu you know him then i am indeed the silver queen i suppose i know him if anyone does i have borne his child if he is coming here now said the elderly director after a time do you suppose he will be bringing his greatest treasure with him the silver queen said i do not know hyrcanus letting wayfinder lie on the table but rubbing the hilt as if for luck stood up pushing back his chair as if he wished to stretch he raised his eyes to find his male prisoner watching him intently well fellow had you any experience similar to this when wayfinder was yours valdemar nodded slowly i admit it puzzled me a time or two if that is what you mean no one asked him to elaborate and he did not try standing awkwardly beside him yambu was gradually growing more perturbed as if she found the prospect of an imperial visit somehow unsettling time passed very slowly in valdemars perception outside the pavilion the blue temples military people were stolidly going about their routine business of guard duty and camp making nothing of consequence seemed to be happening not that the two high officials were going to be content simply to wait for the emperor no people kept coming to the door of their tent with practical questions matters that required answers the commander of the cavalry still awake himself though most of his troops who had evidently ridden all night were probably asleep came in respectfully asking to be informed would they be breaking camp first thing the next morning would they spend the remainder of the day and night interrogating their freshcaught prisoners hyrcanus had excused himself valdemar supposed probably for a latrine break and the question was left to his secondincommand to answer oh i doubt that the director stretching allowed himself a smothered yawn you might as well haul that stuff away and pack it up again he gestured toward the rear of the tent and only now did valdemar realize what the piled instruments of torture were as a pair of soldiers packed them up again and bore them out when the chairman returned a few minutes later rubbing his hands together the director questioned him about the prisoners too was there really any point in dragging the wretches all the way back to headquarters perhaps perhaps not how can we know at this stage let us see if my question brings any result within the next few hours the morning hours dragged on hyrcanus and his director were as they thought being their usual practical businesslike selves when the clouded sky outside the tent seemed to split in half and the gold and blue pavilion was torn away from above their heads valdemar closed his eyes and yelled momentarily certain that the last instant of his life had come ten it was still morning on that cloudy rainy day when the young woman commonly known as tigris accompanied by ferocious supporting forces including one demon of more than ordinary power and riding her own griffin came crashing in with a murderous assault upon the newly established blue temple camp the blue temple griffins being the cowardly creatures that they were rose into the air breaking their tethers and took flight immediately at the moment of the attack hyrcanuss people were doing their best to be alert but they were simply overmatched and the attack was a complete success valdemar had never seen tigris before nor had he any means of identifying any of woods other people or creatures the result was that while the fighting raged around him the young man had not the faintest idea of the true nature of this fresh batch of invaders on finding himself unhurt after the first few moments of the attack valdemar began to hope that he might after all be able to survive by this time a heartening explanation had suggested itself namely that these conquerors were the friendly tasavaltans of whom he had heard so much from his traveling companions valdemars spirits rose sharply with the prospect had the youth been aware that a demon was among the attacking force this would have dashed his risen hopes but although the proximity of the foul thing soon began to make him physically ill the young man was unable to either see or identify the source of his symptoms valdemars companion in captivity the silver queen was considerably more experienced and knowledgeable quickly recognizing the nature of the latest onslaught yambu felt her heart sink almost instantly she was able to recognize tigris and the presence of a demon as well the silver queen would have made some effort to enlighten her fellow prisoner but she could neither talk to him effectively nor help him at the moment as had been the case in the previous assault the struggle in magical and physical terms was intense but brief too late one after another the pair of high blue temple officials tried to grab up the sword of wisdom but the neat tables full of paperwork had already been knocked over and the top of the pavilion ripped away before either of the executives could get his hands on wayfinder the sword fell to the ground and was covered in folds of collapsing fabric the clerks ran in panic or writhed in pain as enemy weapons struck them down at this point the magical bonds constricting valdemars movements began to slacken and the youth enjoyed a few moments hope that he would be able to escape as he looked hyrcanus himself was slain valdemar watching could not have named the cause of death one moment the chairman was grimacing in alarm and the next he was slumping inertly to the earth a moment later valdemar himself was buried under the folds of collapsed fabric struggling ineffectually the youth could tell by the sounds reaching his ears that more swordfighting was taking place he could see nothing of the conflict with some strength and feeling coming back into his tingling limbs valdemar struggled against the enveloping folds that were keeping him a prisoner he could only hope that yambu luckier or more skillful in the arts of magic or perhaps both might be able to get free in the confusion during the few moments in which the director and the blue temple troops continued to make a fight of it all local blue temple spells were shattered and yambu given such an opportunity did what she could to make the best of it valdemar at last managed to crawl partially out from under the folds of the collapsed pavilion before him the latest attackers as they came slicing their way in led by a woman concentrated their efforts on getting control of the sword of wisdom and these attackers in blue and silver livery were ruthlessly successful in a few minutes at the most the female leader and their forces had stunned scattered or killed all blue temple opposition the warrior woman had fairly got wayfinder into her pretty white little hands at the last moment the director of security emerging from some obscure hiding place attempted to escape valdemar saw him first scuttling on all fours then slowly trying to crawl away and finally trying to play dead but he was discovered and pounced on captured alive and what of the silver queen valdemar looking in all directions realized with a faint dawning of hope that he could no longer see yambu anywhere the young woman who had led the attack took a moment to examine the chairmans body she then complained to some of her subordinates evidently she was dismayed to find this eminent person dead her anger flared at those who had killed him and valdemar thought she would have been angrier had she not been distracted by the discovery of wayfinder someone asked her whether the body of such a leader could be put to any use magically no she said that it was worthless perhaps she did not want to divert her time and effort from a greater opportunity might as well feed him to my griffin and now tigris annoyed at having been forced to waste even a few moments on other problems was picking up wayfinder claiming the great sword for herself she looked at the sword of wisdom with great satisfaction and thought valdemar considerable surprise it seemed to him as if this lady warrior had not been expecting this sword at all again he wondered about zoltan and ben and prayed to ardneh that one of them at least might be able to keep woundhealer safely away the director somewhat dazed was being brought before his conqueror he managed a slight bow lady tigris was all he said she was still absorbed in the contemplation of her new treasure the prisoner being held before her would have fallen had not the grips on his arms held him up now he looked about him as if uncertain of where he was at last giving him some attention tigris remarked youre not looking well my friend the director only stared at her wanly she added speculatively you know sometimes people never completely get over the kind of treatment that you received from my master in your temple the elderly man smiled as if that idea pleased him the smile in the circumstances made him look like the village idiot but now valdemars opportunity of leisurely observation was coming to a sudden end a soldier had discovered him and in moments he had been disentangled from the wreckage of the pavilion soldiers in mixed dress looking like a gang of peasants were dragging him before the lady tigris gesturing for the director to be taken away she frowned at valdemar her free hand moved in a subtle gesture and her blue eyes narrowed as she stared at the gigantic young man you are not blue temple tigris said it was not a question no maam i was their prisoner tigris adjusted the swordbelt she had so recently fastened around her slender waist meanwhile her gaze at valdemar did not waver in its intensity i more or less expected to take a few prisoners she murmured to herself one can always find good use for prisoners but she raised the sword she was still holding in her right hand so that for a moment valdemar thought she was going to kill him right away with wayfinder then to his immeasurable relief he realized that she was only going to ask the sword a question sword she whispered again where am i to turn to win that which i most desire valdemar at the moment was physically closer to the enchantress than any other person no one else perhaps except the stolid soldiers who were holding his arms was near enough to have heard the question no one else perhaps observed the look of sheer surprise in her eyes when wayfinder in response swung up in the enchantresss grip to point directly at valdemar he was at least as astonished as the young woman holding the sword of wisdom this one she muttered in slightly louder tones and what am i supposed to do with him sacrifice him but that kind of question as the questioner herself appeared to understand full well was not the kind to which wayfinder could be expected to reply meanwhile other matters began intruding frustrating her evident wish to concentrate on the sword the blue and gold pavilion had been thoroughly wrecked in the skirmishing and one of the young womans aides was wondering what to do about it she commanded him to see that the wreckage was got out of the way and searched for whatever of value it might contain and are we to camp here lady tigris the soldier asked the lady seemingly indifferent to the rain which darkened and plastered her blond hair muttered some kind of an answer that valdemar did not really hear in valdemars eyes the young womans face was so hard and ruthless that he felt morally certain she could not really be as young as she appeared now she came a few steps closer pointing wayfinder deliberately at his midsection so that momentarily he once more felt in danger of being skewered from the steady way she held the heavy sword it was apparent that her slender wrists must be stronger than they looked fiercely she demanded of valdemar you very well what is important about you there must be something what are you good for what use am i to make of you the only response that came to the lips of the dazed youth was well you are certainly not the emperor one of the ladys eyebrows rose i should hope not it was a wary calculating answer were you expecting him she sounded as if she thought the emperors arrival not a totally ridiculous idea why valdemar wondered were all these knowledgeable people apparently taking the great clown so seriously to his captor he replied someone just moments ago i mean the chairman was asking that sword about the location of the emperors treasure i see again what he said was being taken seriously meanwhile tigris was evaluating her young captive as impressively arrogant at first glance he was only a peasant but of course there had to be something special about him for the sword of wisdom to pick him out as her ticket to freedom he was continuing to stare at her in what she considered to be a very insolent way allowing for the fact that men did tend to stare at her the look had some fear in it as might be expected of anyone but a madman in his situation but it contained a measure of haughty defiance too just as tigris was about to speak again a small bird unperturbed by drizzling rain and sullen cloud began singing somewhere nearby her reaction the way she turned to get a look at the bird made valdemar turn his head too yes there was the little feathered thing looking quite ordinary perched in the branches of a tree not far from the destroyed pavilion the diminutive songster seemingly indifferent to the affairs of humans and the weapons of the gods produced a few more notes then flew away as if suddenly frightened by something beyond the range of valdemars senses tigris turned her attention to her prisoner again valdemar felt a sudden return of the physical sickness still he was unable to assign a cause the lovely young woman regarded him in silence a little longer then she said i am still trying to fathom why the sword of wisdom should have pointed you out to me have you any idea why before valdemar could attempt a reply one of the ladys human subordinates came up to request orders interrupting her train of thought turning aside she commanded this man to dispatch a message to master wood inform the master that we have had great success shall i tell him my lady that the sword we have taken here is not the one we were expecting to find no fool the master will know of that already use just the words i have just spoken great success nothing more and nothing less yes my lady the soldier bowed himself away tigris returned her full attention to valdemar where is the sword of healing she demanded abruptly i dont know tigris stared at him if she was really determined to find woundhealer he thought all she had to do was put to work the sword she had just captured but he was sure that she had had some other goal in mind when she put her first question to wayfinder and she had been quite as surprised as he was at wayfinders answer in another moment tigris still with the sword of wisdom in hand was giving orders that the camp be guarded well she herself she proclaimed to her subordinates was about to go apart from them because she needed solitude to work a certain special spell with that accomplished a new word and a gesture from the sorceress sufficed to grant valdemar another degree of freedom from the magical restrictions on his movement suddenly he felt he could walk normally he wondered what would happen should he attempt to run brusquely ordering him to follow her eyes on wayfinder which she held in front of her tigris led the way out of what had been the blue temple camp stiffly valdemar followed his legs still moved only slowly his powerful arms hung almost useless at his sides maybe he thought he could use both arms and legs effectively if he really tried but probably that thought was delusion the confident small woman who had just turned her back on him did not seem to be worried about anything that he might do she continued to carry the sword extended horizontally ahead of her and he thought she was muttering to it again though he could not make out her words as if she might be asking wayfinder for the best place to take valdemar for what purpose he supposed that he was going to find out soon as they paced on across the sandy wasteland lady tigris still in the lead the rain continued a sullen dripping from a lowering overcast sky the birds were silent now or absent having taken flight from the ominous presence of the demon this stalwart healthylooking youth as far as tigris could tell was a damned unlikely candidate to be of any magical or political prowess or importance whatsoever physically of course he was impressive it occurred to her to wonder whether he might have been someones personal bodyguard not hyrcanuss or the directors because he was not blue temple but then who who are you fellow she demanded turning to stare at him again but almost as if asking the question of herself he shook his shaggy head perhaps to rid his eyes of rain looking down at her from his great height he answered simply my name is valdemar lady that tells me almost nothing i am a grower of vines and grapes for a moment tigris regarded this reply as brave mockery indeed and was on the brink of administering punishment then reconsidering the tone of the answer she came to the belief that it had been sincere she shook her own wet blond curls impatient but wary pondering ready to kill or to bless as might be required i can smell some kind of magic about you i believe though not i think any impressive power of your own what have you to do with the swords again the towering youth shook his head nothing at all except that the one you now hold lady was once given to me that surprised her given to you why the young giant sighed i wish someone could tell me why who gave it i dont know that either tigris made a disgusted sound i fear that getting at the truth about you is going to take time and my time just now is in extremely short supply if i thought you were being willfully stubborn but of course that may not be the case at all you may in fact know nothing and still be vitally important somehow when valdemars feet slowed and his shoulders moved as if he wanted to wave his arms and argue tigris with a gesture of her own increased the paralytic restriction on the movement of his arms keep moving and be quiet then she once more consulted the sword murmuring guide us to the safest place within a hundred meters following wayfinders indication she continued to march her prisoner quickly along until after another forty meters or so they reached a place where the sword indicated that they should stop here valdemar thought at first that the two of them were now entirely alone but when he looked and listened carefully calling into play such sense of magic as he did possess he became aware of a faint disturbance in the air just at the limit of his perception they were in fact being attended by certain immaterial powers of which his human captor evidently was well aware and in another moment these magical attendants were gone dismissed by a wave of a small white hand their mistress looked steadily at valdemar when hyrcanus had this sword she asked what question or questions did he put to it as i have already mentioned lady he spoke chiefly of the emperor and the emperors treasure why the chairman of the blue temple should do that i do not know i have always thought that the emperor if he really existed was no more than a clown the lady was not interested in valdemars opinions and what exactly did hyrcanus ask of this sword i dont remember the exact words he wanted to be shown the way to the emperors greatest treasure and what answer was he given nothing very definite the chairman discussed this with his colleague the man you were just talking to back there and they thought the ambiguity might mean the emperor was actually approaching but you arrived instead the red lips smiled faintly perhaps the real answer was that the great clown has no treasure the smile vanished but you and i grapegrower we have no time to worry about that now what are we to worry about instead tigris did not reply her one overriding worry was wood escape from whose domination was the single thing in the world which she most desired now she caught herself instinctively looking over her shoulder a useless gesture of course and she was irritated to catch herself doing it more than once valdemar took note of this quirk of behavior and of the expression on the young womans face when she looked back toward the encampment where her troops were busy with the tasks she had assigned them he wondered silently who or what it was that this mighty sorceress feared so much he asked you are very powerful in magic also you have just won a victory and captured one of the gods own weapons which you now hold in your hands what are you afraid of she raised the sword a little as if she wanted to pretend that she would strike him with it yes this is indeed one of the gods own weapons but remember that the gods are dead or did you know that grapegrower i think the gods are not all dead my lady i still pray to ardneh ardneh of the white temple who never allowed himself to be caught up with the other deities in their games ah yes well grapegrower it may surprise you but i could wish sometimes that ardneh still lived and still ruled the world not that i believe he ever really did why should such a wish surprise me i could share it i was once continued valdemar not really knowing why he chose this moment for his revelation a novice monk in a white temple so and did those fat brothers in their temple warn you when you abandoned safety for the great world that you should choose to stay instead without waiting for an answer tigris once more raised the sword of wisdom careless of the fact that valdemar watched and listened she couched her next question in clear terms hear me sword show me the way to gain freedom from the one i fear above all others i do not mean my own death that road to freedom i could find without your help i want a long life in safety from any harm that he may try to do to me and again wayfinder pointed immediately and steadily straight at valdemar just who he asked the enchantress is this one you fear above all others she ignored him she gave the impression of a woman fighting back panic trying to remain patient there was a faint tremor in her voice very well sword i now have firmly under my control this great clod of farmyard mud that you keep pointing at you are able to perceive that i suppose well what do you expect me to do with him next sacrifice him eat him alive lie with him you will have to give me some further sign the sword of course was not to be commanded thus and it said nothing in reply it still pointed where it had been pointing straight at valdemar and that was all valdemar cleared his throat i have noticed that this swords way of conveying meaning can sometimes be rather hard to interpret though his voice was calm enough he could feel how his ears had reddened oh so foolishly with the echoing in them of those three words lie with him odd that now with his very life at stake he should be so affected by that suggestion tigris did not notice valdemars reaction she cared nothing for her captives ears or for his whole head come to that her trained senses contemplating the sword whose hilt she gripped so hard in both her hands could perceive the intricate knots of magic interpenetrating the hard steel strands invisible to ordinary vision stretching forth and fading away in all directions becoming lost in bewildering complexities of power even she long accustomed to the tremendous capabilities of wood was awfully impressed by this forced to an attitude that had in it much of reverence and this enigmatic sword each time she questioned it only kept reinforcing the importance of her captive this otherwise inconsequential youth who called himself valdemar letting wayfinders point sag to the ground looking keenly at the bold and ignorant fellow tigris was totally convinced that there must be something more to him than he admitted whether he himself realized what his peculiarity was or not haughtily she insisted who are you fellow what are you holding back i must somehow determine your importance to me the giant shrugged i have told you my name and who i am tell me who you are perhaps a meaningful connection can be established maybe i have heard of you you have a kind of serene insolence about you unusual in a peasant very well my name is tigris that much he had already heard he blinked rain from his eyes the name means nothing to me i dont suppose you are from tasavalta i am not are you no i have never been near the place and have you tigris asked her captive any connection with prince mark of that land valdemar answered as usual with the truth no he had never seen prince mark and knew very little about him he volunteered no information about having made contact recently with prince marks friends tigris next asked him if he knew anything of a magician called wood he has other names as well i have heard said valdemar that that one is a powerful and evil man tigris muttered under her breath this is getting me nowhere she tried another tack in her interrogation when i arrived you were a prisoner of the blue temple yes maam i certainly did spend an uncomfortable hour or two in that condition it seemed like days i thank you for putting an end to that i believe they would have killed me how polite he is thats good yes certainly the late hyrcanus and his associates would have killed you if they thought there was any profit to be made that way making your hide into parchment perhaps but they did not what did they actually want of you actually it was only the sword wayfinder they wanted and when they got it they were so busy worrying about what to do with it that they never got around to wanting anything much from me except to ask me where i had got wayfinder and from whom and what did you tell them lady lady tigris i could give them only the same poor answers i have given you with every heartbeat of time that fled she could feel her brief allotment of opportunity rapidly running out every moment tigris spent asking questions puzzling over the answers and yearning to rend this poor fool to bloody ribbons with her nails the inevitable end was drawing steadily nearer her end would come when wood learned that she had taken the sword of wisdom and was keeping the discovery from him at that moment her gamble for freedom would turn out to have been a catastrophic blunder valdemar in the moments when her attention faltered had begun to tell her the story of his life the existence of a grapegrower sounded extremely dull still she forced herself to listen patiently hoping to gain the clue she needed even though the timekeeper in her head was running as regularly as her speeding pulse now the first real suspicion has been born in his mind now he is considering sending out a demon to check up on me cease babbling about grapes she shrieked at her captive why are you here why were you in the camp of hyrcanus valdemar with an effort maintaining his own calm revealed to his questioner his purpose in setting out on the journey which had brought him first in contact with the silver queen and then afoul of the blue temple he did not say anything to tigris about the sword of healing and she did not raise the subject all this seemed to tigris to be bringing her no closer to understanding what she ought to do next it was maddening to think that the sword on which she had abruptly decided to risk her life was giving her the answer she had to have but she was unable to interpret it her anger flared at this babbling fool of a peasant at the sword at the whole world and her life in it and then her rage began to settle to congeal into a deadly calm that tasted bitterly of despair she said all very fine for a grower of grapes but i dont see how any of that helps me she raised the sword of wisdom again glaring at it all right powers of the sword i have accepted that for some reason you want me to make this grower of grapes my own whatever happens i intend to keep him until you deign to show me what his usefulness may be and when are you going to get around to that valdemar shook his head he offered mildly wayfinder will never answer a question of that type but it occurs to me that being a sorceress yourself no offense intended you may be making too much of the idea of sacrifice and magic what do you mean i mean the sword might simply be indicating that you are to take me with you somewhere her blue eyes widened is that it sword am i now to travel to another place taking this peasant along at once to the young womans immense relief the sword responded strongly the tip moved away from valdemar and now pointed almost straight west you do know something fellow after all her spirits rising abruptly tigris halfjokingly remarked perhaps your function is going to be that of counselor interpreter of swords for me valdemar shrugged his enormous shoulders it is only that i have had that sword and tried to use it longer than you have and you appear somewhat distracted at the moment as if something were preventing you from thinking clearly but his companion was no longer listening once more addressing wayfinder tigris demanded and where are we to go how far but no never mind of course you cannot tell me that i have been given a direction the real question is should we walk or run or will we need a griffin again valdemar shrugged of course the sword was not going to tell them how far away the goal whatever it was might be the young man saw little future in trying to do anything but cooperate with this woman for the time being she was evidently a practitioner of evil magic but she had also rescued him from death and perhaps worse once shown a clear course of action tigris was decisive already she was giving a magical command together with a shrill whistle calling her own griffin from the camp a hundred meters distant in another moment it was valdemars turn to be distracted he was awed and frightened watching the griffin approach and land beside them getting aboard the hideous winged beast required some courage of valdemar it was not of course that he really had any choice his huge frame was cramped in the small space available in the left side pannier but the extra weight seemed to make little difference to the griffin the young man had heard that these creatures powers of flight depended far more on magic than on any physical strength of wing his captor was already aboard straddling the central saddle glaring down at valdemar in his lower seat with imperious impatience in a moment they were breathtakingly airborne tigris steered the beast sometimes by kicks sometimes by silken reins or murmured words or all of these means in combination steered so that the sword always pointed straight past the creatures leonine and frightful head they were heading approximately west tigris soon resumed her conversation with valdemar demanding help from him impatiently listening to his replies revealing more than she intended about her desperate situation she was trying every approach she could think of in an attempt to fathom this youths mysterious importance perhaps absolute necessity to the success of her effort to escape woods dominance suddenly she demanded what do you know about me grapegrower not much lady only the very little you have just told me and one thing more what its plain enough isnt it when i had the chance to hold wayfinder in my own hands and demand guidance from it that very sword that you are now depending on it guided me to you what patiently valdemar explained what his question had been and concluded the sword must have directed me to you i asked my question of wayfinder and followed its directions consistently and here you are the enchantress almost laughed but not quite though inexperienced with wayfinder her theoretical knowledge of the swords was substantial she realized that this ones devious indications like the powers of any sword had to be taken very seriously indeed she said you mean you think i am somehow going to help you find your bridetobe i hardly think that you are meant to be my bride so i suppose it must be that valdemar added after a pause first i was led to another woman who was not the one i wanted to marry but i suppose somehow brought me closer to her and now i have been brought to you tigris allowed a sneering comment to die unsaid she supposed that in a way the swords were all quite democratic to wayfinder the status of its wielder or the gravity of the quest would not matter in the least vinegrower or duke king or swineherd princess of magic or homeless beggar all would be on an equal footing to the gods weapons and so would the goals they sought wayfinder still pointed straight ahead the griffin still bore on untiringly a good thing tigris congratulated herself that she had not decided to try walking it could be worse grapegrower had this mount not been available we might be riding dactylarthas back even as tigris spoke she looked round warily once more is that the name of another griffin no creature so mild and friendly as that the youth looked back too seeing nothing but the clouded sky was this mysterious dactylartha the being that she feared he inquired this creature as you call it follows us it does right closely but at my own orders then your fear the young man thought must be for someone or something else valdemar gritted his teeth and continued to endure the journey at moments when because of weather or an unexplained lurching of the beast beneath him things got particularly bad he tried closing his eyes but being deprived of sight only made things worse once or twice he asked where do you expect the sword to guide us to a place where i can find what i need from time to time tigris spoke again to wayfinder questioned it in a language valdemar did not know he inquired is it too much to ask i couldnt hear you clearly exactly what query you have just put to our guide tigris ignored the question her face was grim the great wings beat on marking out slices of time and space with every fleeting moment tigris felt an incremental growth of fear an increase of the driving nagging growing terror that she would not be able to reach her goal before her ancient master caught wind of her treacherous intention the goal to which the sword was guiding her for all she knew might still be halfway around the world she had not asked the sword of wisdom for safety and wayfinder upon which her life now depended was forcing her to bring this peasant clod along and still she had no inkling why eleven on having wayfinder fall so unexpectedly into her hands tigris had needed only a moment to make her great decision she would strike for freedom gambling impulsively on the sword of wisdoms tremendous power after all there was no telling when if ever an equal opportunity would arise she had expected quick meaningful answers from this weapon of the gods affording her a fighting chance of success in her revolt against her swordless master but so far to her growing terror and rage things were not working out as she had hoped in her anger she lashed out at the grapegrowing peasant valdemar he was the handiest target and besides there was something intrinsically irritating in the very nature of this young man with whose presence the sword had saddled her for some indeterminate time to come bridling her impatience and fury concentrating her attention straining to be logical she resumed her questioning as they flew she dared not harm this oaf seriously until she could determine just what his purpose in her life might be the peasant answered her questions with an irritating lack of fear as if he were confident in being indispensable to her but she had practically no success in extracting useful information from him in something like despair she demanded so what am i to do with you when i reach the end of this flight you will let me go my way i hope perhaps my bride will be there tigris told him what he could do with his bride then as the griffin bore them over a lifeless wilderness of splintered rock an idea struck her with the force of inspiration i wonder if i have now carried you far enough she mused aloud perhaps the sword will be satisfied if i leave you in safekeeping here while i go on unencumbered to solve the next step of the puzzle whatever it may be safekeeping valdemar not knowing what she had in mind or whether to be pleased or worried clung to his seat in silence decisively the young enchantress reined her griffin around in a horizontal loop and caused the beast to land on a rocky pinnacle perhaps twenty or thirty meters high the small flat space that formed this spires top was totally inaccessible from the ground now get off she commanded maam you heard me insolent fool get out get off if this mode of transportation bothers you you may be free of it for a time at least i will be back for you i suppose when i have performed the next step required by the sword silently somewhat awkwardly valdemar climbed out of his basket planting one foot after the other carefully on the one square meter or so of flat rock not occupied by the crouching body of the griffin itself he stood there carefully not saying anything he was thinking that the sword had brought him to this pass and there must be some benefit in it for him at least in potential tigris settled herself in the central saddle and flicked the reins her mount sprang back into the air but then when she would have urged on her steed again she found the damned sword in her right hand pointing inexorably straight back to the abandoned man muttering abuse and imprecations she steered the animal back to land on the spire again a process that made valdemar crouch and cling in fear ducking under one of the great wings to keep from being knocked into a deadly fall get on his persecutor commanded the youth needed no second invitation in a moment they were airborne again the satisfied sword once more pointing almost due west valdemar settling himself more comfortably in his basket remarked against the rush of air so it seems that wayfinder insists that our fates are somehow bound together tigris did not answer do you know where we are going he asked patiently eyes of blue fire burned at him plague me with one more question and ill slice out your tongue no you wont the griffin urged on by its mistress was swiftly gaming speed far beyond anything attained in the first leg of their flight the terrible wind of their accelerating passage whipped valdemars words away and tore them to shreds now tigris made a magical adjustment to screen the wind somewhat and managed to hear what her captive had said when he bravely repeated it but she said nothing in reply valdemar fighting to keep calm continued as i see it you cant afford to do me any serious harm because the sword insists that you need me for something but you dont know what it is id like to know the answer too and it might help me figure it out if i knew exactly what you are trying to get the sword to do for you tigris resisting the urge to commit magical violence upon this fool stubbornly remained silent still she had no more idea than did her reluctant passenger of where they were going and under her controlled calm the terror of her own ignorance her fear of wood was threatening to overwhelm her her imagination could readily supply a hundred destinations objectives to which wayfinder could be sending her but she had no real reason to credit any of them hours passed tempting tigris to despair while their great steed still hurtled toward the west now angling somewhat to the south at mindnumbing velocity valdemar was stunned to see how the suns normal westward passage slowed then stopped for them then began to reverse itself the griffins wings had long ago become an almost invisible blur great masses of cloud above below and near them churned past tigris almost lost in her own thoughts became chillingly certain that wood had by now had more than enough opportunity in which to suspect if not actually prove her treachery and it was not the ancient ones habit to delay punishment until he was presented with airtight proof and then just when the enchantress had begun to wonder if her masters magic had already found her and begun to destroy her life and the terrible flight was going to endure forever the sword of wisdom suddenly swung its sharp point downwards tigris hastily moved to instruct her magic steed directing it carefully toward the indicated goal obediently the griffin descended through layers of cloud and slanting sunlight to the waiting earth they emerged from the clouds at no more than mountaintop altitude valdemar reviving from a kind of trance brought on by cold and monotony observed in a dull voice that the object of their journey appeared to be nothing but an extensive desert he had no idea how far they were from the wasteland where their flight had started tigris moved by some impulse toward human feeling to engage in conversation agreed thinking aloud she speculated that wayfinder might have brought them here in search of the sword of vengeance farslayer how would that help you a dullwitted question a bright young man like you must know the virtue of that sword within a minute or two the griffin brought its riders safely to a gentle landing on the earth muttering words of control into the nearest ear of the huge leonine head before her tigris climbed lithely from her saddle with drawn sword to stand confronting a harsh lifelesslooking landscape under a midday sun valdemar promptly joined her without waiting to be commanded all was quiet except for a faint whine of wind moving a drizzle of sand around their feet the sword in the young womans hand was pointing now in the direction of a barren hillock nearby together valdemar and tigris began to walk that way as they drew near the hillock he raised a hand to point toward its top up there the cruciform outline of a black hilt showed against the distant sky as if the point of a sword were embedded in the ground or in something that lay on the earth silently keeping their discovery in view the pair trudged toward the modest summit what at a distance had appeared to be a sword was one indeed at close range the weapon was identifiable as farslayer the sword of vengeance was stuck through the ribcage of a halfarmored skeleton nearly buried in the sand so tigris breathed i was right it is to be his death that is my only chance to escape from him so be it then valdemar noted that the garments adorning the anonymous skeleton had once been rich and gold rings still adorned some of the bony fingers tigris murmuring some words of her art in an exultant tone stretched out her hand to take hold of the black hilt but scarcely had she possessed farslayer when there sounded a deep dry whispering out of the low clouds above valdemar looking up sharply could see them stirring in turmoil what is it the young man asked in a hushed voice at the same time he unconsciously took a step nearer his companion as if some instinct told him that he needed her protection before tigris could reply there emerged from the lowering cover of clouds a churning gray vortex a looming threat the size of a griffin but barely visible to valdemar he found the silent onrush of this phenomenon all the more frightening because his eyes were almost willing to believe that nothing at all was there it is dactylartha tigris said in a low calm voice just stand where you are valdemar nodded meanwhile though his eyes had little to report wind shrieked and roared about his ears and those of the woman standing beside him on the hill that was only the beginning the wind soon quieted but valdemars stomach was literally sickened by the presence of the creature that now appeared now he realized that this entity in the air above him or something like it must be what had sickened him before but tigris was speaking to the thing then boldly challenging it with the businesslike air of a woman long inured to facing things this bad and even worse valdemar stood swaying slightly averting his eyes from what was almost impossible to see anyway he did not need his companion to tell him that for the first time in his life he was having a direct encounter with a demon tigris facing the thing boldly appeared to be perfectly comfortable and in control she spoke to the demon sharply calling it by the name of dactylartha valdemar retching helplessly despite his empty stomach his knees shaky had all he could do to keep from collapsing to the ground instead he forced himself to stand almost upright to his relief the great demon was paying him no heed dimly valdemar could hear the voice of dactylartha a sound that reminded him of dry bones breaking the demon was speaking only to tigris saying something to the effect that it would join her in rebellion or at least refrain from reporting her to the master provided she immediately loaned it the sword of wisdom never then will the gracious lady consent to ask the oracle of the gods one question on my behalf tigris sounded as if she might have the wit and nerve to be able to win an argument with the creature why do you want that i wish to locate my own life great lady muttered the ghastly voice of dactylartha where it has been hidden i do not know but only by finding it again shall i be able to free myself of the power that the ancient one now has over me valdemar trying to remain sane and to understand remembered with a shudder what little he had ever heard of the man who was sometimes called the ancient one valdemar could also recall hearing somewhere that the only way to truly punish or control a demon or to kill one was to get at its life which was almost invariably hidden sometimes a long way from where the creature appeared and acted whether dactylartha was telling her the truth or not tigris did not would not believe him she was thinking that she dared not trust any of his kind this one perhaps least of all valdemar watched her as she balanced the sword of vengeance in her hands such was farslayers power he knew that tigris or anyone else armed with it would be able to cut down wood himself or any other foe at any distance only one other sword only shieldbreaker itself could provide a defense what then was holding her back only the ominous presence of dactylartha it would seem will you ask the question i want asked of the sword of wisdom the dry bones snapped after i have won my own struggle support me in my fight first they were shrieking at each other now the woman and her demonic antagonist valdemar reeled and shuddered he put his hands over his eyes then brought them down and stared to his horror the demon had now assumed the form of a giant manlike shape in black armor standing frighteningly close will you fight for him then tigris her voice become unrecognizable demanded of the thing you had better revolt with me it may not be great sorceress it may not be when his life ends so does mine the aerial blur of dactylarthas presence seemed to intensify a crushing weight seemed to be descending upon the stomach and the soul of valdemar the woman was ready for combat she had sheathed farslayer and her hands one holding wayfinder rose in the subtle gesture of a great magician if i must slay you first i will the struggle was closed between tigris and dactylartha to valdemars limited perception the outcome appeared horribly uncertain made more desperately ill than ever by the increased activity of the monstrous demon the young man thought he might be dying but suddenly he found himself completely free of illness for the moment as the magical powers of the two contestants strained and nullified each other terror of the demon overrode all other fears valdemar lunged desperately for the sword still sheathed at the slender waist of tigris in a moment he had seized the black hilt of farslayer pulled it from its scabbard and was hurling it with all his strength at dactylarthas overwhelming presence it was a crude effort such as any unskilled fighter might make in desperation throwing any sharp object at a foe the sword of vengeance relentlessly indifferent to its users skill or lack thereof shot straight through the demons flickering halfsubstantial image and in a moment had vanished over the distant horizon valdemar had forgotten for the moment that the demons life must be hidden elsewhere dactylartha frozen in position stared for a long moment at his two human foes glaring with eyes that were no longer eyes out of a face no longer even a passable imitation of humanity and in the next moment the demon died shrieking a great shriek his image exploding in spectacular fashion and yet so quickly that he was able to do no harm to tigris or valdemar nor carry any reports back to the ancient one his guts hollow with fear but his eyes and mind once more clear valdemar discovered tigris down on one knee struggling with the aftereffects of the contest stumbling closer he seized her by the arm its gone i think it must be dead dead and gone tigris confirmed in a dull voice moving slowly also stumbling at first she regained her feet then some energy returned shaking herself free of valdemars grip she cursed him for a peasant coward i could have managed that demon without wasting farslayer on it but nothing else will give me a chance to kill my master or to break free i will be helpless without it damn you damn you grower of poisoned grapes i might have coped with the fiend by my own strength you have cost me my chance for freedom and damned me to hell the youth recoiled shaken we might get it back there will be no time valdemar asked humbly what do we do now for a moment tigris brandished wayfinder as if she meant to cut him down with it then in a voice bleak with depression close to despair she admitted still i dare not hurt you valdemar could find nothing helpful to say the woman cried out sword what am i to do how am i to survive wayfinder displaying the infinite patience of the gods silently indicated valdemar tigris glared speculatively at her silent counselor then a gleam of hope appeared in her eyes is it possible that the sword of wisdom has allowed for your idiocy in wasting farslayer in that case peasant it appears there may still be hope i suppose we are to travel again is that it sword yes ill drag him with me again wherever you command but which way promptly wayfinder directed her to the griffin which had been cowering like a beaten puppy in the demons presence now with dactylartha gone tigris was quickly able to reinstill in the lesser creature something like a sense of duty as soon as she and valdemar were airborne wayfinder aimed them back eastward in approximately the same direction from which they had come tigris accepted the command without comment once more they went hurtling above the clouds their speed soon filled valdemar with awe by bringing on a premature sunset behind them both of the griffins passengers drew the obvious conclusion from their direction that wayfinder was guiding them back to somewhere near perhaps very near their original point of departure at the overrun blue temple camp tigris said little as they flew her thoughts were dominated by the notion that the pair were getting closer to wood with every passing moment once her companion was able to hear her questioning herself or fate am i to go to him try to lie to him defend my actions that cannot be as well plead with him for mercy the young man despite his own desperate situation felt a stirring of something like sympathy the enchantress muttered several somewhat amended forms of her wish for survival and for freedom asking the sword for some means of protection against the ancient one rather than the ability to destroy him sword save me from him save me somehow from the very beginning of her contemplated escape tigris had been aware of the extreme danger involved in defying a wizard as powerful as the ancient one and tigris knew far better than most people how powerful he was even so she now feared that she had almost certainly underestimated the truth what am i to do she breathed she was looking at valdemar as she spoke though perhaps not really seeing him he glared at her sourly do you now want my willing cooperation the sorceress snarled back from the first moment i saw you i have suspected that you could not be as innocent as you appeared very well if you have any revelations that you have been holding in reserve lets have them now or else she continued a moment later speaking now as if valdemar were not there as if she were talking to her griffin some other power may be cleverly using this peasant as a catspaw suddenly she faced her prisoner again what say you to that grapegrower he shook his head as calmly as he could why is it necessary for me to be something other than what i am the eyes of tigris filled with pain and fear seemed to be boring into him when one has lived with master wood for any length of time as i have nothing can any longer be considered simply what it is it is necessary to approach every question in those terms why did you choose to serve him then this it appeared was an unanswerable question tigris faced forward again and the griffin flew on magically tireless valdemar wondered if it would ever have to stop and rest or feed when tigriss attack had fallen on the blue temple encampment sergeant brod had been close enough to observe the results and to be shaken by the experience but by good fortune he had also been distant enough to survive unnoticed by the attackers in brods estimation the new conqueror even if she did appear to be hardly more than a girl was obviously powerful enough to be a worthy patron he wanted to attach himself to her somehow if that were possible without taking too much risk torn between fear and ambition the sarge considered approaching the camp and representing himself to its new masters as a victim of the blue temple but soon caution prevailed there were events in progress here that he could not begin to understand later perhaps when he had learned more for the time being he decided to sneak away instead ben hiking industriously toward home warily scanning the skies ahead was just saying that in his opinion they might be going to get away with woundhealer after all at that instant he heard zoltan scream behind him spinning round ben was almost knocked off his feet by a swooping griffin the thing must have come down at them from behind and was now rapidly gaining altitude again with both zoltan and the sword of mercy in its claws while ben stared openmouthed and helpless the great beast swung round in the air and rapidly departed in the direction of the blue temple camp on the ground ben ran hopelessly shouting curses after the rapidly receding griffin drop the sword he screamed at his hapless comrade drop but zoltan either could not hear him or was powerless to obey meanwhile the ancient ones most malignant suspicions of tigris were in the process of being inflamed by a whispered report from a certain lesser junior demon this creature had just arrived at woods headquarters with the report that dactylartha had been slain and even that was not the worst news to the surprise of the attackers the sword of wisdom had been in the blue temple camp and tigris had seized that mighty weapon for herself and taken it away with her wood seated now on a plain chair in a small room near his laboratory did not move a muscle he said quietly she sent me no report of any such discovery the bearer of bad news offered no comment on that fact her official report the great magician continued was very vague something about great success and that was all i suppose there is no doubt of any of these disquieting things you tell me the creature made no attempt to conceal its unholy glee absolutely none my master and no doubt of this fact either great lord dactylartha was slain by tigris herself so with the sword of vengeance wood sat listening carefully to the few additional details that he was told his eyes were closed his face a mask he tended to believe the allegations against tigris yet he could not be absolutely sure that his most favored aide has in fact turned traitor this report might be a mistake or a lie the result of some inhouse intrigue but with at least one and perhaps more of the ten surviving swords at stake he was certainly not about to take any chances one thing that the ancient one did secretly fear intensely without trying to deceive himself about the fact was farslayer though he betrayed no sign of this externally in his imagination he could feel the great cold of that steel as it slid between his ribs or split his breastbone but the sword of vengeance had evidently gone to finish dactylartha wood actually did not know where that demons life had been hidden except that he thought it had been at a reassuringly great distance well there was nothing to be done about that problem just now but tigris if she was indeed now armed with the sword of wisdom she would be very dangerous he could not afford to put off action for a moment as night fell and the stars came out above her speeding griffin tigris still mounted in the saddle with her prisoner valdemar huddled beside her in his basket felt increasingly certain that her treachery must now be known to wood she knew a foretaste of the terrible punishment that it would no longer be possible to avoid her worst fears were coming true in an abyss of terror feeling her mental defenses crumbling tigris realized that nothing could keep her master from trying to wreak terrible vengeance upon her valdemar stared at his companion helplessly he could see by tigriss behavior that she thought something terrible was happening or about to happen to her and he was afraid of what this would mean to him at this point tigris in her panic redoubled the urgency of her demands on wayfinder she stormed and pleaded with the sword that it must show her a way to escape help me save me the sword still pointed straight ahead along the griffins rippling neck then staring holloweyed at the sword the blond sorceress almost despaired or is it she whispered that even the gods weapons cannot help me that you can only guide me straight back to him that he is too strong even for you a moment later with her passenger watching and listening in frozen horror the terrified young woman was retracting that statement fearful that she had offended the mighty powers ruling wayfinder valdemar hesitant to speak gaped at his companion in this raging cursing pleading woman there remained no visible trace of a figure he thought he had once glimpsed a wistful girl who had once paused to listen to a robin sing suddenly some part of her terrible rage was directed at valdemar she glared at him and snarled turning in the central saddle she raised the sword of wisdom in both hands to strike this madwoman was on the brink of killing him there was no way to dodge the stroke he was trying to straighten his cramped legs in the basket for a hopeless effort to seize the deadly sword when a sudden and violent change transformed the finely modeled face above him suddenly and unexpectedly the last curse died in the throat of tigris her body lurched in the saddle her eyelids closed wayfinder which she had been brandishing for a deathstroke at valdemar slipped from her hands and fell twelve zoltan was gone and woundhealer with him and there was nothing ben could do about either loss doggedly the huge man had resumed his trudge into the north from that direction as the birdmessengers had told him the prince of tasavalta and his force were now advancing and if all went well he ought to meet mark soon but ben was unable to make much headway time and again flying reptiles appeared in the sky forcing him to lie low waiting in such shelter as he could find until the searchers were out of sight again at night great owls dispatched by mark as forerunners of the advancing tasavaltan power came to bring ben words of counsel and encouragement they kept him moving in the right direction and helped him to remain hidden successfully through the hours of darkness freighted with tokens of karels shielding power the owls drifted and perched protectively near ben while some of woods lesser demons prowled through the clouded skies above yambu lay in another selfimposed trance placed by her captors in a newly erected tent in what had once been the blue temple camp the silver queens condition was the subject of cautious probing by minor wizards who had been part of tigriss attacking force these folk were prudently waiting for orders from their vanished mistress or from wood himself before they took any more direct action regarding this important prisoner only partially intermittently aware of the world around her yambu lay drifting mentally her dreams were often pleasant rarely horrible on occasion only puzzling most of the dreams in the latter category concerned the emperor as often as not yambus recent nearrejuvenation now seemed to her only part of the same continuing dream at the moment when woods vengeance fell upon tigris a thunderbolt no less startling for having been expected her last coherent thought was that the sword of wisdom had somehow failed her the crushing spell aimed at her mind permitted her a final moment of mental clarity in which she gasped out some curse against the sword after that she was aware of crying out in desperation for her mother and then a great darkness briefly overcame her tigris or she who had been tigris was still in the griffins saddle when an altered awareness returned and her eyes cleared but when her lids opened they gazed upon a world that she no longer knew when valdemar saw the hands of stricken tigris relax their grip upon wayfinders hilt he lunged upward and forward from his basket he was making a desperate almost unthinking effort to catch the sword of wisdom as it fell the hilt eluded his frantic grab the blade did not cold metal struck and stung his hands his try at capturing the sword succeeded but the keen edges gashed two of his fingers before he could control its weight for a long moment he was in danger of falling out of the swaying basket at last he recovered his balance now gripping the swords hilt firmly in hands slippery with his own blood valdemar glared at the dazed woman whose face hovered a little above his own in a tone somewhere near the top of his voice he demanded what happened whats wrong with you the young woman was slumped down in the saddle the reins sagging in her grip she swayed so that he grabbed her arm in fear that she might fall but still she appeared to be fully conscious her only reply to valdemars question was a wideeyed smile and a girlish giggle meanwhile the griffin evidently sensing that something well out of the ordinary had occurred was twisting round its leonine head on its grotesque long neck trying to see what was happening on its own back tigris giggled again fly valdemar yelled at the curious beast fly on straight ahead for now the hybrid monster presented with these commands by an unaccustomed voice kept its head turned back for a long disturbing moment fixing the youth with a calculating and evil gaze as if to estimate this new masters strengths and weaknesses after that long moment to valdemars considerable relief it faced forward again and went on flying the reins lay along the creatures neck where tigris had let them drop the evening sky was rapidly darkening around them demonlike masses of shadow and cloud went swirling by with the great speed of their flight the young woman raised her head and spoke in a tiny childish voice what did you say he asked she blinked at valdemar i just wondered where are we going her smile as she asked the question was sweet and tentative she looked somewhat dazed but not particularly frightened she seemed really innocently uncertain of where she was the dropped sword the cut fingers the sudden change were briefly all too much for valdemar he felt and gave voice to an outburst of anger he threw down the sword making sure it landed safely in his basket and raved giving voice to anger at his situation and at the people all of them by his standards crazy most of them bloodthirsty among whom the precious sword had plunged him meanwhile the strange young woman who was mounted just above him recoiled slightly leaning away from valdemar her blue eyes rounded and blinking red mouth open what was wrong with this crazy woman now but even that question had to wait the first imperative was to establish some real control over the griffin now the beasts unfriendly eyes looked back again the course of their flight was turning into a great slow spiral the first step in dealing with this difficulty obviously was to use the sword valdemar did so while tigris looked on wideeyed but without comment the young man asked to be guided to a safe place to land wayfinder promptly obliged the indication was toward an area not directly below therefore valdemar was required to head the griffin there strong language and loud tones accomplished the job though only with some difficulty when he thought the creature slow to turn he even cuffed it on the back of the neck as a farmers son he had had some practice in driving stubborn loadbeasts and saw no reason why the same techniques might not work in this situation at least for a little while presently they were over a goodsized lake with a single island of substantial size visible near the middle a dark blob in a great reflection of the last of the sunset soon valdemar managed to guide the creature to a successful landing on the island tigris her face arms and lower legs pale blurs in the deep dusk remained in her saddle until her companion told her to dismount at the same moment valdemar began to climb out of his own basket then hesitated worried lest the griffin fly away once they both got off but he could not very well remain permanently on board tigris had already leapt from her saddle to the ground and in a moment he followed the griffin turned its head and snarled the young man spoke harshly and gripped his sword wondering if the great beast might be going to attack them well that was simply another danger they would have to accept for the time being still carrying wayfinder and keeping an eye on the griffin the youth went over to where tigris was standing uncertainly angrily he began to question the woman who an incredibly short time ago had taken him prisoner truly the change had been drastic whatever its cause valdemar was now confronted by a stricken girl who looked back at him anxiously feeling angry all over again he demanded what is this some kind of joke some kind of pretense recoiling from him the young woman abruptly burst into sobs there was a convincingness about this sudden relapse into childishness that caused valdemar to feel the hair rise on the back of his neck an unpleasant sensation that even the demon had not managed to produce this was no game or trick but something completely out of her control she mumbled something through her tears whats that you said im afraid she choked out tears were making some kind of cosmetic run on her eyelids blotching her cheeks another moment and she was clinging innocently to valdemar as if for protection automatically he put his arms around her comforting paradoxically valdemar found himself even angrier than before at tigris angry at her and at his general situation not only angry at her but still afraid of her in a way what if she were to recover from this fit or whatever it was as abruptly as she had fallen into it he didnt know whether he wanted her to recover or not whatever magic might still have been binding valdemar at the moment the sorceress had been stricken obviously there had not been enough to keep him from lunging for the sword was now undone he had felt the last remnants of that enchantment passing falling from him like spiders webs dissolving in morning sunlight where are we she was asking him again now in what sounded like tearful trust she wiped at her eyes who are you she added with more curiosity than fright who am i a good question i ask that of myself sometimes here sit down rest and let me think seating his oddly transformed companion upon a mossy lump of earth she obeyed directions like a willing child valdemar paced about wondering what question he ought now to ask the sword his cut fingers still slowly dripping blood kept him from concentrating and he used the peerless edge of wayfinder to cut a strip from the edge of his own shirt thinking to make a bandage the crouching griffin kept turning its head watchfully from time to time as if estimating its chances of successful escape or rebellion valdemar thought that the beasts eyes glowed faintly with their own fire in the deepening night tigris sitting obediently where he had put her had ceased to weep and was slowly recovering something like equanimity now when he got close enough in the gloom to see her face he could tell that she was smiling at him it was a vastly transformed smile displaying simple joy and anxious friendliness a child waiting to be told what was going to happen next as valdemar stared at the metamorphosed tigris a new suspicion really hit him for the first time the suspicion that this impossible dangerous young woman could be in fact his swordintended bride to be going to her he unbuckled the empty swordbelt from her slender waist and while she watched trustingly fastened it around his own then he sheathed wayfinder waving the little bloodstained rag of cloth which he had been trying to tie up his hand he asked i dont suppose you could help me with this what its just that trying to bandage my own fingers working with one hand is rather awkward and when he held out the cloth to tigris she made a tentative effort to help him but the sight or touch of blood at close range evidently upset her and the bandaging was only marginally successful gripping the black hilt of the sword of wisdom in his now precariously bandaged hand valdemar drew it and asked safety for myself and for my intended bride whoever she may be the sword promptly gave him a direction generally south again he decided that since this island had been certified safe for the time being further travel would have to wait till morning the next question of course was whether the griffin was going to get restless and fly away before sunrise or grow hungry perhaps and decide to eat its erstwhile passengers valdemar sighed and decided they would take their chances here for the night the remaining hours of darkness were spent uncomfortably with each passenger sleeping or trying to sleep in one of the sidebaskets which were still fastened to the griffins flanks some cargo in the right basket the most interesting items were food and blankets was unloaded to make room for tigris valdemar thought it would be hard for the magical beast to attack them while they were on its back and if the thing felt moved to fly during the night it could hardly leave its passengers behind as matters worked out the griffin remained so still during most of the night that valdemar wondered from time to time whether the beast had died but he definitely felt more secure staying in the basket as if his current crop of problems were not quite enough valdemar continued to be nagged by worries about his untended vines back home and about his lack of a wife the images rose before him of several of the women with whom he had had temporary arrangements all of them for various reasons had proven unsatisfactory at last he slept but fitfully in the morning when it seemed that no more sleep was going to be possible valdemar stretched and took stock of the situation tigris as he could see by peering across the empty saddle was still sleeping like a babe she actually had one finger in her mouth the griffin on feeling its heavier passenger stir looked round lazily but at least it had done nothing yet in the way of a serious rebellion valdemar had the sword of wisdom still gripped in his right hand raising it again he bluntly demanded where is the woman i should marry his wrist was twisted by an overwhelming force remorselessly the weapon continued to point out tigris dismounting with a grunt straightening stiffened limbs valdemar walked around to the animals right flank and awakened his companion who rewarded him with a cheerful vacant smile then chewing on some of the food they had removed from that cargo basket he attempted to nail down the swords meaning beyond any doubt addressing wayfinder he demanded are you trying to tell me that this this one with me now is the very woman that this creature is not simply meant to be a help of some kind to finding my rightful bride the sword without a tremor still indicated tigris oh by all the gods the young man roared such was his disgust that he felt a serious impulse to throw this sword away he did in fact make an abortive gesture toward that end but such was his practical nature that the sword went no farther than necessary to stick the sharp point in a nearby tree a moment later and valdemar had hastened to retrieve the weapon of the gods wayfinder might produce some unpleasant surprises but still it seemed to be the only hope he had a few minutes later they were preparing to fly again this time valdemar occupied the saddle and tigris went indifferently into the left basket where he had ridden as her prisoner time for the orders of the day valdemar put some thought into his request sword i want to go home to my own hut and my own vineyard i want to reach the place safely and i want the world to leave me in peace once i am there also i want to have there with me someday somehow the woman who should be my wife whoever she may be pausing valdemar eyed tigris sitting obediently in the basket where he had put her she returned his gaze with an eager trustful look that he at the moment found absolutely sickening he returned his concentration to the sharp blade in his hands with all those goals in mind great sword give me a direction the response was quick and firm very well thank you griffin fly he gave the last command with as much confidence as possible if the griffin only turned its head and looked at him he was going to be forced into some act of desperation fortunately things had not yet come to that gathering its mighty limbs beneath it the creature sprang into the air this mornings flight lasted for about an hour and during its entire course controlling the griffin continued to be something of a problem tigris giggling and babbling what valdemar considered irrelevancies distracted him and made his job no easier wayfinder at least was predictably reliable in response to vals continuing requests for safety for both passengers the sword guided them through several aerial zigzags that had no purpose valdemar could see and then point tugging sharply downward it indicated a place to land at that same hour a great many kilometers away the ancient one found himself able to spare a little time and thought to contemplate the treachery of tigris and to decide upon the most satisfactory method of revenge another of woods inhuman secret agents had just brought confirmation that he wood had been able from a distance to inflict a severe loss of memory upon his most faithless subordinate and not only that master but a complete regression to nearchildhood the foul bitch is deliciously perfectly helpless it is a rather powerful spell wood nodded somewhat complacently i am not surprised at its success if the director of security for the blue temple could not resist it our dear tigris had no chance of course in her case this treatment is meant as no more than a preliminary penalty one might say it is not really a punishment at all only a form of restraint i want to neutralize the little wretch until i can spare the time and thought to deal with her as she truly deserves he frowned at his informant now who is this companion you say she has no one i trust who is likely to kill her outright only a man master dont know why she brought him along not much magic to his credit youthful physically large a lusty fellow by the look of him so i dont think hell want to kill her very soon he has of course taken over the sword wayfinder now and i suppose he has been making use of it but to what end i wonder no doubt i can find out great lord indeed you have only to give the word and i will step in and take the sword away from him i of course unlike the faithless tigris would bring the prize directly to you without you will not touch that sword or any other wood commanded firmly from now on that privilege is mine alone of course master the demon bowed a swirling movement of a halfmaterial image i the ancient one continued am presently going to take the field myself there yet remained in the old magicians mind some nagging doubt that his lovely young assistant had really turned against him his ego really found it difficult to accept that perhaps it would be possible to learn the truth from her before she died at first she had been somewhat frightened coming awake out of that awful dream or sleep or whatever it had been to find herself straddling the back of a flying griffin a griffin was an unfamiliar creature certainly there had been nothing like it on the farm home of her childhood scene of most of her remaining clear memories but it was not completely strange she remembered from somewhere certain things about the species thus it proved to be with many other components of this strange new world by now the young woman who had been tigris had just about decided that this world in which she found herself the world that had in it such an interesting young man as her companion was taken all in all a sweet wonderful place she who had been tigris her sophistication obliterated and her knowledge very drastically reduced by the magical removal of most of the memories of the later half of her life continued to be very confused about her situation but in her restored innocence the young woman was mainly unafraid from her place in the passengers basket she gazed thoughtfully at valdemar looked at him for the thousandth time since since the world had changed since whatever it was exactly that had happened since perhaps she had awakened from a long sleep of troubled dreams and oh it was good to be awake again she found herself still gazing at the strong young man and she found him pleasant indeed to look upon it was something of a shock it was almost frightening to realize abruptly that she did not know his name in a loud clear voice she asked him who are you turning a startled face the youth in the saddle stared at her it is now something like a full day my lady since we met i have told you almost as much as i can tell about myself have you no memory she who had been tigris did her best to consider no or i have some memory i suppose but i dont remember who you are tell me again the young man continued to stare at her for the moment he said nothing only shaking his head slightly gently she persisted but who are you where are we when valdemar did not answer she began to be a little afraid of him she saw him as a very formidable person even apart from his obviously gigantic physical strength he had an air of confidence and reliability after a while she told him as much in simple words he gazed at her with returning suspicion so i am to believe that you are only a child now and easily impressed is that it she laughed girlishly she could not really remain afraid of this young man for long he was too too ah lady tigris if only could be sure but how can i determine what you are really but you have let me have the sword havent you oh truly you are changed the lady was frowning what did you call me tigris lady tigris but why do you call me that are you playing some game no game no game at all not for me certainly by what name should i call you then why by my own and that is how can a friend of mine not know my name she paused thinking her red lips parted but then i didnt know yours did i my name is delia and now i remember that you did tell me your name before valdemar that has a strange sound but i like it he looked at her for what felt like a long time what else do you remember about me why that you are my friend you have been helping me to do something gradually with an effort delia was able to remember a few other things that he had told her about himself before before the world had changed valdemar asked and what do you remember about the sword of wisdom she blinked at him what is that he stared at her the wind of flight whipping his long dark hair well talk about it later he said at last the longer the flight went on the longer she looked at him the more definitely she who had been tigris began to flirt with valdemar innocently and sensuously at the same time valdemar at first took no real notice of her smiles and subtle eyelidflutters and occasional voluptuous stretches he was watching the griffin grimly and from time to time he repeated his latest question to wayfinder point me point both of us the way to safety under his inexpert piloting the great winged creature continuing to change course on demand at frequent irregular intervals carried the couple back to some place that was half familiarlooking val who as a rule had a fairly good sense of direction had the feeling they were not far from the armed camp from which tigris had marched him it seemed like a terribly long time ago obviously wayfinder was not guiding them directly toward his vineyard well having once decided to trust his life to the swords guidance he supposed he had better trust it all the way and anyway he wouldnt want to arrive home with a griffin they landed in the middle of a small patch of forest wood once having made his decision to take the field in person had not delayed within a few minutes he was airborne flying on his own griffin on his arrival at the camp which had been taken by tigris he took charge at once and ruthlessly by dint of seriously terrorizing her former subordinates he was soon able to confirm if any confirmation was still needed that tigris had indeed captured the sword wayfinder and had deliberately failed to notify him all of tigriss people who remained in or about the camp automatically fell under grave suspicion in the eyes of the ancient one those who wood thought should have prevented her defection were placed in the hands of interrogation experts wood had been in personal command of the camp for less than an hour when an alarm was sounded but this time the news was good another griffin bringing in the sword woundhealer along with a prisoner after gloating briefly over the sword no hands but his own took it from the semiintelligent beast wood turned his attention to the prisoner at the moment the wretch looked more dead than alive thinking he recognized the fellow as prince marks nephew the ancient one employed the sword of mercy to heal his injuries quite likely he would be worth something in the way of ransom in a moment as soon as zoltans eyes were clearly open wood asked him gently where is she now tigris on recognizing where he was and who was speaking to him the youth looked gratifyingly sick with terror i dont know he whispered hopelessly no well i suppose theres really no reason why you should but im sure there are interesting things you do know young man things that i shall be pleased to hear you and i must have a long chat that was postponed more news arrived yet another new prisoner had just been picked up in the vicinity of the camp upon which he appeared to have been spying wood turned his attention to this man brod dragged in and supported by several guards tremblingly assured the wizard he had only been watching the camp because he had long wanted to devote himself to the service of the mighty magician wood as a patron he had been trying to find the best means of approach when he was taken the ancient one stared at him nothing pleased him so much as a proper attitude of respect in those he spoke to brod who thought he could feel that gaze probing his bone marrow clutched at the only hopeful thought which he could find at least he had not been trying to tell a lie tell me brod yes sire what would you ask if you were given the chance from the sword called wayfinder i take it you know what i am talking about oh yes sir yes sir i know that sword the sarge swallowed with a great gulp well sir id ask a way a direction that would let me fill my ambition of getting into your service lord wood sir and continuing in your service successfully for a long long time the sarge stopped there because the great wizard called wood was laughing it was a silent and horrible display thirteen prince mark was heading south he rode astride a great black cantering ridingbeast with the bulky form of the old wizard karel similarly mounted at his side they were long out of sight of home days ago the prince had ridden forth from the great gate of sarykam at the head of a hundred cavalry supported by magicians beastkeepers a couple of supply wagons and semiintelligent winged scouts and messengers ever since their departure the prince and his expeditionary force had been riding hard to reach the region where his friends and enemies were still contending for a pair of priceless swords the prince was wearing two swordbelts each supporting one sheathed sword so that a black hilt showed on each side of his waist during most of the day mark had little to say his gaze was usually fixed straight ahead and his countenance grim he was ready for a fight armed to the teeth coming to the struggle with both sightblinder and shieldbreaker in his possession the swords stonecutter and dragonslicer considered unlikely to be of much use in the current situation had been left in the armory in sarykam the swiftmoving tasavaltan column kept moving generally south in the direction of the region from which ben had last reported his position scouts both winged and human ranged ahead continually mark as he rode was nagged by the feeling that he ought to have brought stephen with him but he knew it was better that he had not he felt comforted by the idea that the boy would be with his mother and perhaps afford her some relief from her endless gloom at sunset the prince and his troops reached the fringe of the barren country lying to the southwest of the tasavaltan border mark ordered a halt this would be a dry camp tomorrow would be time enough to look for water several times during the past few hours winged scouts had returned from the southwest to meet the column on the march now yet another of these great birds speeding from the same direction across the twilight sky arrived at the encampment this scout reported the ominous presence of griffins in the area the prince cursed at the indications that the enemy was now in the field too in force mark ordered the beastmaster to dispatch more birds to investigate dayflyers sir or night mark ordered some of each sent into the air in the light of a lowering sun mark glanced at the three or four specially trained loadbeasts accompanying the column which appeared to be bearing hooded human riders actually the figures on the loadbeasts backs were the swathed forms of giant owls whose heads and shoulders became visible as the hoods were removed these birds would presently be launched to scout and harass the enemy under cover of darkness when mark chose the campsite karel and his magical assistants busied themselves weaving protective spells around the area the prince personally oversaw the posting of sentries ate lightly then entered his small tent grimly impatient for morning he wrapped himself in a blanket stretched out on the ground two swordbelts beneath him his body in contact with both of his sheathed swords and tried to get some sleep the prince sometimes tried to calculate whether he had spent more of his life in the field in one way or another than he had under a roof certainly he sometimes felt that way the familiar sounds of a military camp low voices a fire crackling someone sharpening a blade were soothing rather than disturbing yet sleep eluded mark his mind could not cease struggling with plans and calculations the ominous signs of blue temple presence and worse in the land ahead suggested that one of his chief enemies might well now be in possession not only of woundhealer but of wayfinder as well but the prince could take comfort in the fact that against the sword of force even the sword of wisdom would be no more useful than a broken dagger wayfinder mark felt confident could never tell its owner how to locate shieldbreaker or shieldbreakers holder or how to avoid any danger posed by him the prince shifted position on his blanket feeling as wide awake as ever what would he do if he were wood of course wayfinder would be able to tell its owner the whereabouts of the magician karel say or the location of the sword sightblinder and from that information an enemy might well be able to deduce that mark was somewhere near no sword or combination of swords could solve all problems sleep eventually came to mark in the form of a troubled doze and with sleep came disturbing dreams that shattered into unrecognizable fragments as soon as he awoke leaving a feeling of anxiety and one thing more he had awakened with a new plan the prince conferred with the wizard karel just before dawn and karel agreed that mark should ride on alone but carrying both his swords ahead of the main body of his troops the old wizard had some forebodings about what seemed a chancy scheme and at first had argued against it but mark was impatient and stubborn enough to adopt the idea even against karels opposition at sunrise as the prince swallowed hot tea and chewed on a hard biscuit preparatory to riding out alone karel warned him that carrying shieldbreaker and sightblinder at the same time even with both swords sheathed could cause him problems i must warn you prince that holding both of these swords drawn at the same time may well produce some powerful psychic effect even on you who in some ways seemed to possess a curious partial immunity to the swords power i have done as much before perhaps but i warn you that your immunity is far from complete i understand that uncle have you since leaving home tried either of the swords you carry not yet then do so now in the relative privacy of his uncles tent prince mark drew from its sheath the godforged blade that rode on his right hip sightblinder as always produced some spectacular effects when it was drawn mark was aware of no change in himself but he knew that in the eyes of his uncle he was somehow transformed into a figure evoking either terror or adoration even the great magician karel here in his own tent surrounded and supported by all his powers and knowing intellectually that the figure he saw was only a phantasm of magic was powerless to see the truth behind the image what do you see uncle the old man passed a hand across his eyes the details of the deception do not matter i no longer see you in your true nature of course but an alien image which frightens me even though i know the old man averting his eyes from mark made a gesture of dismissal prince mark sheathed sightblinder which he had held in his left hand and saw karel relax somewhat next the prince drew shieldbreaker the sword of force was silent and inert because no immediate danger threatened mark gripping the black hilt was aware of the vast power waiting there but he felt no more than that then still gripping shieldbreaker the prince pulled the sword of stealth from its sheath once more and stood holding both swords at the same time he saw by the change in his uncles face that his own appearance had once more altered perhaps even more terribly than before the nerves in marks arms and shoulders tingled the effect was strange but well within his range of tolerance carefully mark sheathed both swords again sightblinder first he tried to reassure karel but the old man remained cautious and perturbed he warned the prince unnecessarily not to be caught in combat with an unarmed foe whilst holding shieldbreaker i know that mark patiently reminded his counselor karel still looked worried the prince putting a hand on the old wizards shoulder reminded him that he mark was no stranger to the swords and he assured the old man though not without a certain mental reservation that the effect of holding the two swords at once had not been strong enough to cause him any real concern at the same dawn hour when mark set out alone from his camp ben was urged out of a light sleep into instant alertness by the tug of a rapierpointed claw upon his garment crouching over him where he sat with his back against a tree was a winged messenger from mark this helpful friendly bird having been instructed by karel brought ben the welcome news that tasavaltan troops were not very many kilometers away and the prince himself was even closer the birds sense of horizontal distance was notoriously inaccurate so ben did not derive as much comfort from this news as he otherwise might have as the hours passed valdemar continued to observe the destruction of the personality even the physical identity of the sorceress who such a short time ago had come riding at the head of a force of demons and human thugs to slaughter her enemies and kidnap him not that delia appeared to care in the least she kept humming little snatches of simple cheerful songs but her clothing was now sodden with rain and getting dirty evidently it was now deprived of what valdemar supposed must have been the magical protection afforded the garments worn by tigris even the womans face was notably changed from that of the conqueror who had devastated the blue temple camp valdemar wondered if he could have recognized this as the same individual had he not seen with his own eyes the several stages of the change rain and circumstances seemed to have washed and scoured away an aura of bad magic and perhaps some subtle though mundane makeup as well from her countenance only the physical parts of the transformation had taken any time at all never since the thunderbolt fell had valdemar caught any hint that any part of her older wasted and vicious personality might have survived valdemar had no doubt that the metamorphosis had resulted from a blow struck at tigris by the great and mysterious magician she had feared so terribly and from whom she had been so desperately trying to escape one of the oddest things about the whole situation as valdemar saw it was that the blow the sudden transformation had not really done her any harm as far as he could tell quite the opposite and here was another turnaround to consider he who had been the prisoner of tigris was now delias captor or more properly her keeper now he the simple farmer had become the worldly experienced mentor it was not a role he relished but there was no one else to take responsibility for her and the idea of simply abandoning her was unacceptable though in her previous persona she had treated him unjustly still her new helplessness was disarming and her new childlike personality was charming in its innocence delia was more talkative than tigris had been almost every time valdemar looked at her he found her gazing back at him as if she sought his guidance and she kept asking naive questions earlier under relentless questioning from this young woman valdemar had tried to explain how he had been guided to her by the sword of wisdom he thought that tigris had never quite believed that story she had been chronically suspicious and perhaps incapable of understanding a simple truth now when he told delia the same tale she somehow had no trouble at all believing if not comprehending what he had done this sword has brought us together you and i valdemar patting the black hilt assured his new companion thats good her tone suggested complacent acceptance if nothing like full understanding it is a magic sword magic ah and delia nodded solemnly with an appearance of wisdom are you acquainted with magic then no she said vaguely no i dont think so except yes except sometimes when i still lived on the farm i think there were things that i could do what kind of things when plants were sick sometimes i could make them well really then i will have to tell you about my vines a shadow as swift as it was insubstantial abruptly fell over the two young people simultaneously valdemar was once more stricken with the helpless sickness in his guts this time he recognized the cause and now his fear was greater than before the presence this time was smaller and more nearly bearable than dactylarthas had been but the young man had no doubt that this sudden intruder was a demon too he clutched for dear life at the sword of wisdom and cried to it for help he did his best to lift it as if to strike a blow the demon only chuckled a truly hideous sound the ghastly wraithshape of it drifted in the air in front of valdemar what do you mean to do young man strike me with your sword i at the moment brave words seemed impossible to come by wayfinder will not protect you nothing will if i simply reach out to you like this fear and nausea gripped him then dragged their slimy presences away val wondered why the demon did not simply seize wayfinder out of his almost paralyzed hands but the shadow drifted on and the sword of wisdom was still his it was it had to be only playing with them like a cat with a pair of mice delia utterly miserable pathetically ignorant clung to him wanting to be comforted vals fears were confirmed the vile creature had only pretended to depart for now it came drifting back its vague shape gathered over delia and it whispered something frightful into the young womans ear shocked uncomprehending delia screamed and wept valdemar tried to summon up his nerve his will to rise to her defense but physical and mental cramps assailed him and he fell back groaning delia shrieked again horrible memories had stirred in her when she heard the demon speak woods name then as unexpectedly as it had come the demon was gone delia expressed her fear that the ancient one was coming to get her val thats what it meant that thing which spoke to me just now whatever it was it told me things that made me start to remember val hold me and valdemar still sick and trembling from the recent presence of a demon found himself doing his best to comfort delia he held her while she wept and promised to protect her and in his ignorance he could even believe for a time that he might be able to afford her such protection as for the ancient one himself with every passing hour each incoming report he was becoming more firmly convinced of his former assistants treachery though by this time as wood assured himself grimly the objective truth concerning her guilt or innocence really no longer mattered he had decided to consider her guilty and that was that whatever she had really done or not done after this he would never again be able to trust her even minimally too bad at one time she had shown great promise wood now welcomed back as warmly as he ever welcomed any being the demonic scout who had just tormented tigris listening attentively the ancient one received from this creature a new report the news related with much demonic merriment was that tigris had certainly been reduced to childish helplessness and now this was the crowning effect seemed to be on her way to a new existence as a farmers wife the ancient one reacted to this announcement with a great deal of amusement and satisfaction he went so far as to reward the messenger at least he promised a substantial though unspecified reward to be delivered in the future the demon praised its masters generosity its gratitude sounded as sincere as the virtue that it praised and it slavishly rejoiced at having brought good news yes well well the human nodded all things considered such a fate will do quite well as the first phase of our settlement of accounts with her and the next phase of her punishment master the servile creature almost gibbered with delight when may we expect to enjoy that tersely in a voice tinged with regret the ancient one explained that for the next few hours or perhaps days he was going to be too busy dealing with his chief opponents to pay this traitress much attention he concluded but do keep me informed most gladly master valdemar still asked the sword for safety and the sword still required him and delia to fly the flights thus commanded were random jaunts as far as val could see getting them nowhere in particular but rather keeping them in the same area of almost uninhabited country uncomfortably close to the camp from which tigris had kidnapped him how very long ago that seemed and val was growing increasingly worried about the griffin he supposed that the creature had grown tired lacking its proper magical nourishment or reinforcement or perhaps thought valdemar the beast was simply becoming increasingly restive in the control and company of these two milksops when he asked delia if she remembered anything about the animals diet she only shuddered and insisted that she knew nothing whatever on the subject valdemar couldnt decide whether she was telling the truth or not when he asked the sword for help in feeding their chief means of transportation wayfinder obliged evidently there was some kind of food the griffin favored and when valdemar turned to the sword for help wayfinder directed them to a landing place where the creature browsed contentedly for a time burrowing its head into the dense foliage of a grove of peculiar trees valdemar was unable to tell at first glance whether the beast was eating leaves fruit or perhaps something more meaty that dwelled in the high branches he made no effort to find out is it a very big magic then the young blond woman was staring gravely wideeyed alternately at valdemar and at the sword he was consulting with regard to their next move he was disconcerted by the way she put a thumb or knuckle in her mouth her pink lips sucking at it also he wanted to tell her that her garments needed some adjustment he was more certain than ever that in her previous persona her clothing must have been protected by some magical means now this enhancement was no more and seams and fabric not made to withstand rough usage without help here and there starting to give way her blouse or tunic or whatever the right name was for the upper garment she was wearing was tending to come open in front matters were tending toward the immodest how could he think of her as a potential bride valdemar told himself that he was not really accustomed to dealing with children he said of course this sword is magic magic of tremendous power havent i just been telling you the griffin was showing signs of reasonable contentment as it continued feeding valdemar assumed that he and delia would soon be riding on the monsters back again he wondered if some curse was on him too that circumstances kept arising to delay his return home of course once he had reached that goal another problem would arise what ought he to do then with the sword any such treasure would inevitably draw trouble as valdemar saw the situation he would have to hide it get rid of it trade it off somehow as soon as an opportunity arose but that could wait until he was safely home once wayfinder had seen him that far valdemar was sure he wanted nothing more to do with any magic of the gods as for his wife whoever she might be he sat looking long and soberly at delia what am i to do with you girl when weve got that far i dont know will you at least be safe from demons when weve reached that point she could no more answer that question than an infant she looked back at her caretaker with mild concern waiting for him to find some reassuring answer at least valdemar growled ill know where i am then and ill be able to do something he picked up the sword and once more asked it to show him the way home fourteen the sword of wisdom failed to respond at all to this important question or to the others valdemar asked valdemar took this to mean that he too should adopt a course of inactivity that would be all right if it didnt last too long he could use the rest anyway the griffin had not yet finished its protracted feeding also val was still being bothered by his cut fingers the skin around the little wounds was red and sore and even felt warmer than the adjacent flesh as if he were getting a local fever healing was slow not helped by the fact that he had to keep using his hand delia despite her claim to have spent her childhood on a farm protested that it bothered her to have to deal with blood and injury but when valdemar coaxed her she agreed to do what she could to help him first wearing an absentminded look she searched among the nearby bushes and eventually came up with what she said were useful herbs varieties to help the small wounds heal while engaged in this search she took tune out to complain she had not been able to find the kind of berries she would really like to eat there should be little red berries in the spring i suppose your farm was a long way off from here i suppose it was the young woman answered vaguely then she lifted her head sharply listen what valdemar turned uneasily hand groping for his sword the birds hear them except theyre not the same kind that used to sing on the farm eventually with delias assistance val succeeded in getting an effective bandage on his hand the poultice of leaves that she bound on stung a little at first but then felt vaguely comforting as delia finished tying the last knot in the little bandage he continued to stare at her thoughtfully long ago valdemar had abandoned the last suspicion that this shocking innocence was some kind of a trick a pose on her part and she showed no signs of snapping out of it no it seemed that she was his responsibility now so far the pair of them had had enough to eat fortunately the griffin had been carrying some field rations mostly hard bread and cheese in one of its panniers but those supplies were quickly running out and valdemar realized that to keep himself and his supposed bride going he was going to have to somehow scrounge more nourishment from other sources he would have to think seriously about that problem soon at the moment he was very tired the sword of wisdom would of course lead them to good things to eat as soon as he wanted to make that his priority but valdemar had the feeling that they were under pursuit if not direct attack and he had learned that the sword could only handle one question or one main goal at a time he would not risk his life and delias for food until actual starvation threatened sitting against a tree he was pulled back from the brink of sleep by his companion leaning over him is it a very big magic delia now repeated innocently she was gazing thoughtfully at the sword which lay in valdemars lap his hand on the black hilt earlier valdemar remembered with a sense of irony this woman or rather this womans other self had been the one to accuse him of feigning an innocence too great for the real world it is indeed valdemar replied at last with the slow patience of near exhaustion it is a gigantic tremendous magic and also very sharp be careful he had thought for a moment from the eager way his charge was leaning forward that she had been about to run a testing finger right along the edge of wayfinders blade she who had once been tigris had never objected to valdemars having complete charge of the sword of wisdom but from the way she was gazing at the weapon now it was obvious that something whether it was the bright beauty the supernal keenness or the intricate underthesurface pattern of the steel held a strong fascination he slid wayfinder back into the sheath still fastened at his waist and then he leaned back against the tree his eyelids were getting very heavy and he would rest for just a moment delia feeling a mixture of mischief and curiosity reached for the sword again as soon as val losing his battle to exhaustion dozed off and at that moment the griffin as if sensing that something of importance was about to happen silently turned its head watching delia keenly as she reached for wayfinder she could not test the sharpness of the edge while the sword remained sheathed softly she put her hand on the black hilt and drew the weapon forth so quietly that valdemar slept on holding the sword with a double grip on the sturdy hilt made delia feel strange her arms and hands were going tingly in a way that she knew somehow had something to do with magic the sensation made her forget about testing the physical edge she held up the sword to smile at it in innocent admiration val had told her that the sword answered questions and helped people what should i ask she whispered aloud the question seemed addressed more to herself than to the instrument of the gods the griffin at the moment chewing its mysterious nourishment chewing with the jawmotions of a cow and the fangs of a gigantic lion had no answer for her warily delia turned her head looking carefully at valdemar to make sure that he was still asleep then inspiration came small hands whiteknuckled with the strain of gripping the black hilt she raised the heavy sword of wisdom and whispered to it again show me the way to make him want to keep me with him she whispered devoutly and smiled a moment later because sure enough wayfinder had just twisted slightly in her hands pointing at what at nothing in particular that she could see just at some bushes moving eagerly and quietly holding the heavy blade extended carefully in front of her delia investigated the sword led her through a screen of brush and on a few meters more to a point where she heard the sounds of murmuring water just ahead still following the swords guidance she soon arrived at a small stream partially dammed by a fallen tree and lodged debris above the dam a pleasant little pond had formed partially shaded by standing trees the day was warm and sunny for a change and the pool invited her to test it with her fingers not prohibitively cold certainly it looked deep and clear enough to provide a bath sniffing fastidiously at her armpits she grimaced and could not remember ever before being this dirty what had awakened valdemar he did not know but full consciousness suddenly returned sitting up straight with a reflexive wrench of all his muscles he felt a cold hand at his heart when he saw that the sword of wisdom was no longer in its sheath which was still belted securely at his waist delia was missing too maybe she had only stepped into the bushes to relieve herself jumping to his feet val called her name first softly and then at considerable volume to his vast relief an answer came drifting from somewhere in the middle distance a moment later he thought he could hear prolonged splashing quickly the young man pushed his way through the bushes to investigate he stopped abruptly as soon as the pond came into view the sword at least was safe stuck casually into the moist earth at the waters edge delias clothing including an undergarment or two which valdemar had never seen before lay beside the upright blade the young woman herself completely unclothed above the waist covered by water below that waved at valdemar from midstream no more than an easy leap away she called cheerfully for him to join her in her bath val come in come in im coming he heard himself reply his voice was a mere croak already he was striding forward as if hypnotized somehow it was as if he were watching his own behavior from outside he was aware of stripping off his own garments and stepping down into the current half an hour later delia still unclothed lying at ease amid the spring grass and early flowers a little inland from the waters edge was frowning prettily she had hold of the huge hand of valdemar who as naked as she was lay almost inert beside her and was turning it this way and that as if interested in the articulation of the wrist and now your bandage has come off again she was complaining what are we to do for your poor fingers never mind my fingers valdemars voice had a newly calm and thoughtful quality something crackled in the brush nearby galvanizing him into action first lunging then crawling awkwardly to reach the sword with his bandaged hand on the black hilt he turned to find himself facing nothing worse than the griffin driven by curiosity to see what its two masters were about delia who had crawled after him started tickling him playfully another half hour had passed before delia asked valdemar whether the magic sword could heal his ringers no there is another sword called woundhealer that would be needed to do that woundhealer where is it i dont know it was with me for a while before i met you or rather i was with some people who were carrying that sword but where it is now just help me put on a bandage again my fingers will be all right and we face bigger problems than a couple of little wounds the bandaging went more easily this time perhaps because delia was less afraid of hurting him as she tied the last knot val said regretfully better get dressed we must be moving on the griffin appeared to be through feeding for the time being anyway but vals renewed questioning of the sword with safety as his goal this time elicited no clear indication from wayfinder valdemar strolling about with his arm around delia bending now and then to kiss her kept trying to picture her as his wife working beside him in the vineyard yesterday such a vision would have seemed impossible now it was much clearer he began to talk to her about his vines and grapes and about the good wine that could be made from them in a year or two when the plants were fully matured delia listening to vals description of his work and his plans for the future saw nothing frightening or unpleasant in the prospect in fact she found herself quite pleased his description of the vineyard stumbled to a halt does this suit you then he asked yes she told him simply all i want now val is to stay with you oh oh my dear delia when the pair of them were busy gathering what food they could foraging to augment the supplies still remaining from the griffins fastdiminishing store she demonstrated a definite magical affinity for growing things making thorny vines bend to and fro to yield her their juicy berries without pricking her reaching hands and arms i foresee a great future for you in the country little woman i keep telling you i have always lived on a farm and do your parents live there still im not sure a shadow crossed the young womans face i dont want to think about them then dont once more delia at a moment when her companion was inattentive got her small hands hands no longer as pale and soft as they had been on the weapon of the gods in simple words she whispered a new question to the sword of wisdom asking it to guide them to the sword called woundhealer so that her lovers cut fingers could be healed yet again they mounted the griffin valdemar thinking that his own most recent query was the one to which the sword was now actively responding gave the beast commands quickly they were airborne they had not flown far before the young man noticed that a flying reptile was following them he could not be sure whether it was actually trying to catch up with them or not but the griffin was flying so slowly that that seemed a possibility grimly valdemar urged their mount to greater speed the nightmare head turned on the long neck the eyes seeming to glow with their own fire looked straight at him but the griffin ignored the command faster i said val waved the sword as if threatening the beast with it the threat was a bluff and it proved a serious mistake with a move that appeared deliberate for all its speed the beast reached up with an impossiblelooking extension of one of its almost leonine hind legs the blow from the great claws caught wayfinder cunningly knocking the sword of wisdom neatly out of valdemars hand val uttered a hoarse cry of surprise and dismay there was no use trying to grab for the sword it was already gone in the next moment he saw the pursuing reptile catch the falling treasure in midflight and with the gleaming blade between serrated teeth go wheeling away on swift wings carrying the prize at the moment of the swords fall as if a successful and unpunished act of rebellion had given it courage the griffin became totally unmanageable skimming low over forest and wasteland it launched into a series of acrobatic moves as if determined to dislodge at once its two uncongenial masters from its back val and delia hung on all but helpless shouting at the creature and at each other sky wasteland and patches of forest spun round them as the griffin looped the couple clung desperately to saddle and basket suddenly a bluewhite wall of water loomed a pond or miniature lake hardly had the body of water come into sight when the crazed animal plunged straight into it diving and swimming like a loon the waters liquid resistance finally dislodged the humans valdemar choking almost drowning felt a piece of basket rim break off in his hand swimming in water over his head he fought his way to the surface just in time to see his escaped means of transportation floundering ashore from the wooded shoreline the griffin leapt into the air again displaying magical celerity where was delia treading water turning this way and that val hoarsely called her name a long moment passed before he saw her floating face down desperately he stroked to reach her got the muddy bottom of the pond under his boots and carried her ashore by that time to his great relief she was coughing and moaning feebly she spat out a mouthful of muddy water when he would have helped delia to sit up on the bank she cried out in pain her back had been somehow injured in the watery rough landing she protested that she could not walk could hardly move standing now on the shoreline with a chance to look around valdemar thought that this territory looked vaguely familiar as far as he could tell they had returned to a point at no very great distance from the place where a young woman named tigris had kidnapped him and their adventures with the griffin had begun the scouting reptiles informed the ancient one that tigris was not very many kilometers away a beastmaster relayed the information she is in worse shape than ever lord the peasant who is traveling as her companion strips off her clothing and uses her at will wood chuckled for the moment he continued to be satisfied with the progress of his punishment and we have taken their sword from them the reporting human gloated the ancient ones demeanor changed i hope that none among you has dared to touch it hastily the subordinate explained no one had disobeyed orders one of the more simpleminded flying reptiles had caught the falling sword wayfinder in midair and was bringing it in flying slowly under the unaccustomed load wood was not really surprised by the news regarding the sword he had been working for some time and on several levels to get wayfinder away from tigris and valdemar and into his own hands it had been part of his plan to obtain the sword without letting any of his associates possessed of human intelligence or greater get it into their own hands even for an instant the task had been further complicated by the fact that wayfinder itself had doubtless been employed to protect its possessors from him but as matters had turned out his plan succeeded anyway perhaps he was tempted to believe the swords magic was not invariably supreme soon the sword itself was brought in but almost immediately after getting wayfinder into his hands wood was distracted again from thoughts of pleasant vengeance by reports from both demons and reptiles confirming that a force of about a hundred tasavaltan riders was on its way south heading almost directly toward his camp on hearing this one of the ancient ones currently most favored human subordinates immediately suggested evoking a large force of demons and dispatching them all against the hundred cavalry and their support people and creatures the proposed tactic would undoubtedly serve well to determine whether mark was accompanying this main tasavaltan force or not but if mark was indeed there the discovery might cost the discoverer wood a whole force of demons he decided prudently to begin by sending only one or two of the vile creatures as for attacking mark personally he had other ideas about that having been aware for some years of the presence of shieldbreaker in the tasavaltan arsenal wood assumed that the prince would be coming against him armed with the sword of force shieldbreaker was undoubtedly the mightiest piece of armament in the world capable of nullifying the power of any other weapon even another sword that might be deployed against it with these facts in mind the ancient one pleased as he was to be finally holding wayfinder took it for granted from the start that any attempt to locate mark directly by using the sword of wisdom was bound to fail so wood on first obtaining the sword of wisdom made only a perfunctory attempt to locate mark when that was unsuccessful he acted rather to locate the wizard karel or the sword sightblinder on the assumption that mark would be found very near that person or object when the ancient ones small squad of demonic skirmishers attempted to strike at the force from tasavalta they would encounter in fat old karel a magician of sufficient stature to beat the attackers off though not as quickly and effectively as mark would have been able to repel them in karels archives as he was soon explaining to an anxious pair of military officers in his tent were listed the locations of many demons lives and the old magician gave assurance that he knew how to find out more such locations very quickly if and when the need arose besides karel had the power to make things unpleasant for a lot of demons whose lives he lacked the knowledge to terminate so unpleasant that they would even prefer to incur woods displeasure rather than persist in this attack wood observing the fate of his demon skirmishers as closely as he could while still remaining at what he considered the best distance to exercise command felt reasonably confident that mark was no longer accompanying his cavalry and his chief magician then where was the prince of tasavalta marks archenemy chewed a fingernail heretofore wellkept and pondered wherever the prince might be wood felt sure that he would be armed not only with the sword of force but also with the sword of stealth such a combination would make a formidable antagonist out of the veriest weakling in the hands of a warrior like mark the effect was bound to be overwhelming against all but the strongest and most crafty defense well wood considered that he was ready in less than a minute before woods demons could begin their serious attack even before most of the tasavaltan force had been made aware of the impending threat karels magic had slain or dispersed the handful of magical skirmishers but the confrontation once begun continued between marks uncle and the ancient one the two commenced sparring at long range wood had long wanted to test directly the occult strength of kristins overweight uncle now having at last made immediate contact the ancient one had grudgingly to admit that although he felt confident of being able to wear this veteran adversary down in time the struggle was bound to be a long and draining one wood did not choose to spare the time and effort to fight it to a conclusion now he was going to need all his powers to deal with mark armed as the prince must now be not that wood thought mark was going to represent the ultimate test the ancient one had received certain magical indications that his own final success or failure in his bid to dominate the world was going to depend upon another confrontation now still relatively remote against the dark king and the horde of demons that one could call up wood considered it unlikely that his rival vilkata had really been permanently removed from the scene but no not even the dark king would represent the ultimate challenge sooner or later the ancient one was thinking now it would be necessary to concentrate his efforts with the sword of wisdom on locating the emperor in anticipation of a final combat with that man the lady yambu lying on an ebon couch covered with a white sheet her head now pillowed on rich fabrics was being more or less forcibly maintained by her newest captor in a state of responsive consciousness finding it necessary to converse with him whether she wanted to or not she expressed to wood her surprise that his first questions to the sword of wisdom did not seem to have been concerned with establishing his own safety she asked him the reasons for this lack of caution he assured the silver queen that he scorned to be so timid you will understand that i am sure my lady you yourself have never been accused of excessive caution no doubt that is intended as a compliment of course i have always regarded you with the greatest respect wood paused before adding in a low convincing voice i would never have deserted you in your time of need meaning that the emperor who was my husband did you are the best judge of his behavior in that instance without hesitating the ancient one continued support me now and i will give you real youth eternal youth and beauty a far more lasting change than even woundhealer will ever be able to provide her head turned on the brocaded pillow and tigris did she have the same promise from you what has happened is happening to that woman is no secret but dear lady i made her no promises i never found that woman half as interesting as i find you i have no interest in what is happening to her now will you let me rest of course dear lady for a time walking alone a few moments later wood developed a shrewd suspicion this lady was really trying to find to rejoin her former husband though he thought it doubtful that the silver queen herself was fully aware of her own motivation perhaps he wood ought to announce his readiness to help her in this quest because he really wanted to find the emperor too on an impulse drawing wayfinder wood took time out from his immediate struggle to command that sword to guide him to the great clown the swords reaction was simply to point straight down to the spot of earth on which wood was standing he could readily find one interpretation of this answer if he remained where he was the emperor would come to him of course there were other possibilities am i to dig into the earth i hope not or do you simply mean that i must wait faugh the secrets of the gods are welded into this bar of metal and all i can do is ask questions like any other supplicant and hope and wait faced with this behavior by the sword of wisdom the ancient one began to wonder if his calculations regarding marks behavior could have been wrong he wondered also whether it might be the emperor instead of mark who was now armed with shieldbreaker when wood tried to locate mark directly wayfinder became as inert as any farmers knife wood who had also taken possession of woundhealer on entering the camp was considering that he might eventually want to trade that treasure for a sword he wanted more though he would dislike having to give up the sword of healing having certain uses for it in mind he thought that the next time he talked with yambu he would elicit some comment from her on the subject of trading woundhealer fifteen mark in a grim mood kept riding forward the country through which he traveled was largely desert and for a time remained almost flat the land got rougher as he drew closer to a rivers rocky gorge he had now been traveling alone ahead of the advancing column of tasavaltan cavalry for more than a full day the prince had had no conscious contact with anyone friend or foe since he had separated from his hundred picked troopers from karel the assistant magicians and the rest of the fastmoving force on parting from his friends mark had ridden for a short time without drawing either sightblinder or shieldbreaker but rather soon the prince decided that he had better not advance any farther without having in hand one of his two swords or better both of them mark wanted to have the sword of stealth in hand before he was seen by the enemys reptile scouts and he wanted to draw shieldbreaker before coming within range of any enemy weapons since leaving karel behind the prince had several times sensed the power of contending magical forces and he realized that something might be happening to delay his uncle and the cavalry but even with sightblinder in hand to enhance his powers of observation he had been unable to perceive the details of the magical combat between karel and wood or of karel and woods demons mark supposed that barring such magical hindrance his tasavaltan escort ought to be not much more than a couple of hours behind him carrying sightblinder drawn for protection deprived mark of information he might otherwise have received from scouting birds and made him unable to send winged couriers to his friends confronted by magic powerful enough to deceive humans the birds with their limited intelligence could hardly be expected to disregard the visual image they would either perceive mark as some fearful presence and refuse to approach him or they would see him as some beloved object another bird he supposed or a favorite handler not the twolegged master for whom they had been trained to carry messages and fight thus on occasion when he saw a friendly messenger in the air mark risked sheathing sightblinder again under these conditions the prince had received indications that wood himself was now somewhere in this general area the most recent of these communications was a note from ben explaining that the blue temple force had been destroyed and its camp taken over by an expedition under the command of tigris mark observed several flying reptiles at irregular intervals of time their paths in the sky converged at a place no very great distance ahead of him this fact warned the prince that he was almost certainly closely approaching some enemy from this point on he rode with the two swords continually drawn and now the subtle blending of their two powerful magics shieldbreaker in his right hand sightblinder in his left both swords more fully activated than when he had tried them in karels presence gave mark strange exotic feelings of power and glory wave after wave of giddiness threatened to unbalance him in his saddle his uncles warnings clamored in his memory but mark forcibly put them from his mind just now both of his swords were necessary old karel had more than once cautioned him that these like other forms of power could be addictive not that mark had needed the warning he had long been old enough to understand that for himself the prince retained a firm faith that shieldbreakers protection would hold absolutely against any spells or other attacks that wood might launch personally or might order to be made by others as mark grew closer to the enemy the powers slumbering in the sword of force awoke and made a tapping sound he knew that this noise signaled a hostile presence somewhere close enough to represent an immediate danger now and again as mark moved forward the dull sound arose only to sink back almost to inaudibility in the circumstances knowing the power of this sword the prince found the faint noise more comforting than alarming as when the duel commenced between karel and wood marks experienced senses provided him with a vague but disturbing warning of evil magic strange presences nearby he could feel these groping in the air around him and then withdrawing thwarted wood on taking over the camp established by tigris had quickly reorganized its layout and defenses the ancient one now occupied a blue and silver pavilion in the center of an elaborate and heavily safeguarded bivouac the powers human and inhuman who had come here with the treacherous young enchantress had all by now been formally charged with incompetence or worse every one of them had now been taken away in chains or the magical equivalent thereof having as he thought magical capabilities to spare and no real concern for problems of logistics the ancient one had also set out to make this facility luxurious in the few moments he thought he could spare from more immediate concerns he studied the condition of his prisoner yambu and talked with her on several subjects the ancient one with the help of several subordinates was also conducting or preparing to conduct experiments with some new magical techniques he nursed at least feeble hopes that these would enable him to get around the defense posed by the sword of force but it did not take long to confirm his most gloomy auguries regarding the new methods these were doomed to fail as absolutely as any other inferior magic ever set in opposition to a sword he was angry but he had really expected no other result it is no use he admitted his voice descending to a quiet rasp of rage shieldbreakers protection remains absolute these new techniques had required some human sacrifice and the director had been chosen the lady yambu had asked whether she was being considered as a candidate and wood had looked pained at the suggestion the ancient one did truly regret that tigris was not currently available in his camp so that she could do him a final service as the sacrifice it would be hard he thought to imagine anything more satisfactory than watching her be fed slowly to a demon unless of course he should manage to lay his hands on woundhealer and tigris together then new possibilities would open he would be able to treat her after all to that little vacation in one of his remote strongholds for which she had once so eagerly expressed a wish yes wood already missed his little comrade and he was going to miss her more oh if only she had remained loyal to him a little longer it was unsatisfying to have the decision on when to end a relationship taken out of ones hands so to speak wood talked with brod and in the course of this discussion he formally enlisted the sarge as one of his followers brod groveled in gratitude you may demonstrate your thankfulness by performing a certain mission for me do this job well and i will give you something more important anything my master commands i want you to seek out a certain woman you will be given her approximate location and magical means by which you will be able to certainly identify her and bring her back here to me for my personal attention you need not be too concerned about her sensibilities while she is in your charge i take your meaning master i think i made it plain enough ben forced to seek shelter almost continually had been able to make little or no progress to the north but he kept trying on rounding a bend in a path that wound its way through scrubby forest he suddenly came upon a vision that stopped him in his tracks he was confronting a young woman tall and strong with clear blue eyes and bright red hair who stood regarding him steadily it was ariane his longlost love intellectually ben knew better he realized almost at once that he had really encountered mark carrying the sword sightblinder so that the prince must appear to his old friend as to anyone else he met as some object of overwhelming love or fear knowing well the powers of sightblinder and also that mark would almost certainly have armed himself with the sword of stealth ben had braced himself mentally for such a moment still the shock was almost overwhelming mark on seeing his friend turn pale and sit down as if his knees had betrayed him sheathed sightblinder and advanced to offer words of greeting and reassurance in a minute ben had pulled himself together had given mark the bad news about the loss of zoltan and the sword of healing and was ready for whatever had to be done next the prince took a turn at walking loaning weary ben his ridingbeast for an hour or two in this manner the pair headed south again mark told ben that he had been for some time reasonably certain that an enemy camp was not far because he had observed the converging reptile flightpaths ben confirmed that his the lost sword of healing had been carried that way too at dusk advancing cautiously the two men observed sparks of firelight ahead suggesting the presence of a camp taking counsel together the two experienced warriors decided that armed as they were with swords they stood an excellent chance of being able to launch a successful raid without waiting for the arrival of the tasavaltan troop and karel mark emphasized if wood is indeed in this camp i want to get my hands on him before he has a chance to fly off with the sword i need ben raised a hand to silence him someone was approaching valdemar had been forced to leave the injured delia in an abandoned hut which at least offered shelter against the intermittent cold rain while he sought help even in the gathering dusk he quickly recognized bens hulking figure but standing beside ben in that first moment was an almostforgotten horror out of valdemars own childhood a faceless figure of which he could be certain only that it was frightful and in the next moment even as he recoiled in horror the young giant beheld the image of horror replaced by one of his beautiful wife to be and then that form faded too beside ben there was only a tall man sheathing what appeared to be a sword in a few moments introductions had been made and explanations begun from valdemar mark soon heard in a drastically condensed version the story of how the woman who had been tigris was now lying in an abandoned hut reformed and injured in dire need of help valdemar in the course of this relation reported how tigris had abducted him from this site and mentioned the loss of wayfinder ben expressed his doubts you think shes reformed young one maybe her magics been taken away but ill shed no tears for that its some kind of trickery shes worked upon you its not quickly and firmly the prince squelched this argument there was no time for quarreling now even if the situation was in fact just as valdemar described it he mark could not would not go off on a tangent now to help some woman in distress however deserving she might be and then the prince made a plea of his own help me now valdemar help ben to guard me against attackers when we invade this camp and i swear that i in turn will help you as soon as i can with all the power of tasavalta and of the swords that i can bring to bear the towering youth let out a sound of frustration something between a sigh and a snort i must accept your offer prince it seems i have no choice mark decided that they would not attack the camp till dawn giving them all a chance to eat and rest he shared out the food from his saddlebags before bedding down for the night mark and ben discussed tactics with the inexperienced valdemar the two veterans made the point that the only enemy tactic they really had to worry about whatever forces might oppose them here was that of people deliberately disarming themselves and then hurling themselves on the prince who carried shieldbreaker valdemar nodded the theory of the situation was easy enough to comprehend as for putting it into practice i will do the best i can cant ask for any more than that in the first gray light of dawn the three men soon came close enough to woods encampment to hear the sounds of people stirring and smell the smoke of campfires evidently the ancient one confident in his strength had made no particular effort to conceal his position mark made wary by this lack of concealment wondered whether wood was more or less expecting him perhaps even trying to lure him into making a solo attack it turned out that woods camp was magically protected against casual discovery but with shieldbreaker in one hand and sightblinder in the other the prince crossed the invisible boundary unharmed and unimpeded had it not been for a softly augmented thudding from the sword of force he would not even have realized that he had encountered any defenses matters were different for the two men who formed his escort ben despite his experience and alertness was unaware of the magical protection until unnatural light flared around him and valdemar and immaterial weapons slashed at their minds and bodies shields and snares of magic closed on the three intruders only to recoil an instant later like snapped bowstrings broken by the unyielding central presence of the sword of force shieldbreakers voice beat loudly light flared across the early morning dimness and the claws of magic lashing out at it were instantly blunted and beaten back valdemar and ben were staggered momentarily but the power that might otherwise have destroyed them was quenched before it could have serious effect hoarse cries in human voices went up from near the center of the camp ben thought that perhaps the backlash of the broken spells had taken toll among the minor wizards there certainly by now the entire enemy camp was aware of an intrusion soldiers in blue and silver magicians and others came pouring out of their tents the trio of invaders stood in plain sight of most of them and sightblinder immediately provoked primary confusion among the defenders human and inhuman the first human sentry to get a clear look at mark near the edge of camp ran forward hesitantly sword halfraised by an arm that jerked uncertainly as if the man himself did not know whether he meant to salute or strike evidently this man perceived the invading prince as wood himself or as some hideous demonic power an instant later a real demon came hurtling down out of the lowering morning sky even had mark been lacking shieldbreaker he would have confronted the foul thing with a wary respect but not with terror as the emperors son he had always possessed the power without understanding why or how he had it to drive away even the most powerful of those evil creatures simply by commanding them to depart in the past the prince had been forced to demonstrate this ability several times often enough to give him confidence in it now and the sword of force he felt sure added another impenetrable layer of protection against demons such beings as old karel had once explained to mark were creatures of magic and pure malevolence born of great explosions at the time of the old worlds dying they could will nothing but evil and karel thought that they could take no action of any kind except by means of magic magic employed to inflict injury was by definition a weapon and shieldbreaker was proof against all weapons material or otherwise a human being abandoning all weapons could win barehanded against the sword of force but a demon could hardly disarm itself without ceasing to exist perhaps sightblinder notwithstanding this mornings demon understood at once just what antagonist it must be facing because the thing vanished out of the air again as quickly as it had appeared and of its own volition and now inevitably but foolishly a few material weapons were deployed directly against the holder of the sword of force marks body no longer under full control of his own will stretched back and forth with magical celerity darted to right and left executing parry cut and thrust with ruinous violence and precision but all under cover of sightblinders cloak of deception the visible counterfeit of mark some image of terror or love beheld by each friend or enemy more often than not appeared weaponless and unmoving a single enigmatic figure standing immobile in the midst of causeless carnage enemy swords spears missiles and shields were hacked and harvested in a spray of fragments shieldbreaker chopped up human flesh and body armor with ruthlessly complete indifference the sword in marks right hand in those moments when that weapon could be glimpsed became a silver blur the hammersound blurred also with its speed and swelled up to a steady thunderroll valdemar had never seen or dreamed of anything like this before few people had there was there could be in the whole world nothing else like this to see the young man was momentarily stunned into immobility one man mark advancing with his weapons sent the first wave of blue and silver opposition reeling back in confusion so far the princes double bodyguard had not been required to do anything but stay close to him if they stayed close enough they remained within the aegis of protection of the sword of force shieldbreaker flashed invisibly between their bodies and around them smashing slung stones and arrows out of the air but now sooner than either val or ben had expected some of the enemy began to come against mark unarmed val saw the first one a squat strong soldier in silver and blue come charging barehanded between two of his fellows armed with short spears the sword of force put out its flickering tongue of power and both spearshafts were severed in a blink the unarmed enemy who would have charged between the spears to grapple with the prince instead encountered the battlehatchet swung accurately at the end of vals long right arm the vineyardist had never killed before but he was left with no time now to meditate upon the fact another unarmed foe was coming ben and val stepping forward one on the princes right hand and one on his left acquitted themselves well in the first fight with the initially disorganized foe there came a brief lull panting mark gave his orders we go forward again i must find wood whatever swords are here will be with him advancing boldly pressing their initial advantage he and his escort penetrated to one of the central tents ripping open fabric with a blade the prince cursed on realizing that his chief antagonist was not here either but a moment later to their joy the three attackers discovered in this tent a pair of important prisoners zoltan and yambu were both stretched out on narrow beds eyes staring and bodies rigid obviously under some magical constraint any humans who might have been stationed to guard them had already taken to their heels in only moments the prince and his flankers were able to set the pair free into the right hand of each prisoner briefly and in turn mark pressed the hilt of the sword shieldbreaker this instantly and permanently broke the grip of the magic wood had bound them with zoltan on being released from imprisonment sat up with a strangled gasp of relief to see valdemar and ben before him standing one on each side of a blackeyed mermaid zoltan understood that he was facing the sword of stealth when a moment later the mermaids image turned into that of wood himself and then into a nameless shrouded figure of horror a memory from nightmares of his childhood whatever horror the lady yambu might have experienced in her captivity or on waking to see mark wielding sightblinder she bore the burden well less than a kilometer away the young woman who had once been tigris was still lying injured half delirious inside some peasants halfroofless and long abandoned hut fearing equally for her own survival and for her lovers safety delia drifted in and out of feverish sleep in her lucid moments the young woman hoped and prayed to all the gods that the two of them would be able to get away from this seemingly endless conflict to the peaceful vineyard val had so proudly described to her almost delia felt that she already knew that place that she and valdemar had already lived there together in dreams she saw the little house the garden a green and summery vision of delight a paradise once possessed now gone again and unattainable in her pain and distress she had lost track of how much time had passed since val had left her here alone many hours certainly she was afraid it had been days she feared in her state of suffering that the man she loved had suffered some horrible fate or worse that he had cruelly deserted her zoltan still suffering somewhat from woods maltreatment could provide little relevant information about wood nor could he guess what swords the ancient one might hold but yambu was able to confirm that wayfinder had been here in this camp and in woods hands where the ancient one was now or whether he had with him that sword or any other she did not know mark assumed that wood had carried the sword of wisdom away now in the center of the camp mark and his augmented bodyguard faced a development the prince had not really expected a carefully prepared series of enemy counterattacks by a surrounding composite force of armed and unarmed men specially trained to fight against shieldbreaker at the next pause in the action mark suspected and his panting friends agreed that the ancient one must be somewhere near at hand directing these attacks the beleagured handful craned their necks trying to spot their enemy in the clouded sky the prince grunted hell be riding on a griffin or im surprised hell be too shrewd to mount a demon when he expects me to be present before anyone could answer him there sounded from somewhere in the distance what mark and his compatriots could recognize as a tasavaltan horn thats karel thank all the gods let us hope some cavalry is with him karel himself riding forward with a courage matched only by his physical clumsiness doing his best to keep up with the cavalry had been able to determine with fair accuracy despite woods attempts at concealment just where the enemy camp had been established some of the tasavaltan scouting birds had been deceived by enemy magic and others temporarily outfought by reptiles but the uncle of the prince and princess could also determine even without much help from feathered friends that mark was now in the vicinity he signalled to the cavalry commander to sound the charge in moments the tasavaltan mounted troopers supporting and supported by a truly formidable magician were heavily engaged with the forces surrounding prince mark and his small bodyguard drawing a deep breath mark commanded an advance toward their allies there were plenty of fallen weapons about with which the former prisoners could arm themselves they advanced meanwhile wood still carrying wayfinder was airborne mounted on his own especially large and vicious griffin he circled above the fighting dispatching relays of reptiles with urgent messages to his officers below he sent other winged couriers with orders to speed the advance of his additional ground forces already marching to the scene what had once been an orderly camp was now a ruined trampled field of mud fallen bodies and ruined and discarded weapons and collapsed tents time and again the princes personal bodyguard saved his life by beating off unarmed attack he and the unmatchable power in his right hand rescued them in turn the onslaught of the tasavaltan cavalry had relieved some of the pressure from surrounding forces but still mark and his handful in the center had all that they could handle so far thanks to skill and luck and the weapons of the gods none of them were more than slightly wounded wood hovering on his chosen griffin darting away and coming back now and then swooping low enough to get a good look at the figure he knew must really be mark sometimes perceived instead a man he recognized as the emperor again the ancient one beheld a shadowy figure insubstantial yet angular somehow almost mechanical something out of the old world he knew that the sword of stealth was tricking him into seeing ardneh though shieldbreaker had prevented wood from using wayfinder effectively to plan his counterattack on mark the sword of wisdom continued to be effective against marks allies karel and the tasavaltan cavalry the trouble was as long as mark himself was on the scene wood could not spare the time to accomplish their destruction the next time he dove his mount low enough to get a close look at the fighting around mark the ancient one beheld to his own freezing horror the hulking foul image of the kingdemon orcus a being now ages dead along with ardneh his great antagonist putting aside the initial shock of this perception wood summoned up his intelligence and will gritted his teeth and stubbornly denied what both his eyes and his best magical perception were assuring him to be true that was mark and with the two swords mark was winning a number of woods people who as a rule were more afraid of their master than of any other conceivable enemy or at least of mark fought like fanatics but on encountering the armed prince of tasavalta a majority of these unfortunates perceived mark as wood and they saw confronting them a figure even more terrible in its wrath than the original and the very terror with which the ancient one had sought to bind his fighters to him resulted in their defection yambu had been struck down and was out of action for the time being those of the princes friends who were still fighting beside him could only hope if they should lose sight of mark for a moment that when they again saw a figure they took to be him it was not really that of wood or another enemy instead for wood snarling rage was giving way to a kind of calm he prepared to risk everything on a single move my plan is failing because my fools down there lack wit and nerve to execute it properly very well then i see i must grapple with him myself wood meaning to hurl himself unarmed on mark reined his griffin round to circle in a wide loop gaining momentum for a final charge meaning to hurl himself unarmed on mark he began divesting himself of weapons right and left but stopped when he came to woundhealer and wayfinder sheathed at his side not yet both swords may have to go but only at the last moment when ill know that he still has shieldbreaker in hand marks tiring ridingbeast tripped and fell hurling him violently to the ground though protected against all enemy weapons mark had been knocked out of the saddle by accident the prince lay temporarily stunned zoltan being closest to him on his right side grabbed up shieldbreaker val who was in the best position on the other side took up sightblinder which had fallen from marks left hand moments later having seen from a distance how their prince went down karel and some of the tasavaltan cavalry attacked fiercely and broke through to surround and defend him in the double confusion of a melee and a joyful reunion valdemar was easily able even though he lacked sightblinder to step away without being noticed the ancient one circling away momentarily failed to see mark go down coming back swooping very low to the ground for a final attack wood observed only a confused struggle in the place where he expected mark to be the ancient ones hopes rose perhaps his plan of attack had succeeded after all the griffin great wings blurring with its speed roared low above the struggling throng sustaining what to it were minor wounds from tasavaltan stones and arrows closing swiftly on the knot of central activity where mark must be wood saw zoltan standing in the tasavaltan ranks shieldbreaker would be down on the ground there somewhere underneath that scramble the direct attack on mark would have to wait for his next pass or if the prince was already slain such a desperate tactic would be after all unnecessary but here was another choice target and this run would not be wasted swerving his mount slightly at full speed to meet the altered target the ancient one swung wayfinder with all his strength against zoltan and the world seemed to explode with tremendous violence in woods face the shocked griffin literally somersaulted in midair and the body of its rider went hurtling from the saddle some of the onlookers were quickwitted enough to realize almost immediately that wood must have swung wayfinder against shieldbreaker and that the sword of wisdom had been dazzlingly destroyed in every quarter of the field increasing numbers of enemy soldiers were panicking into flight no matter how thoroughly their secret training had prepared them for a fight against two overwhelming swords the reality was overwhelming and they found themselves unable to stand against it the surviving tasavaltan troopers taking heart from the fall of their archenemy fought all the harder the physical combat flared and receded and flared again the fighting was fierce the slaughter great the number of fallen in blue and silver much larger than those in blue and green wood had been determined to wear down his foe by numbers if he could win in no other way mark still sprawled on the ground but now fiercely protected by his friends and his surrounding troops was starting to regain consciousness part of his trouble was due to the strain of carrying two such swords into battle at the same time karel now was at the princes side mumbling a reminder of his own warnings on the subject but at the same time the elderly wizard protected mark and all the tasavaltan forces against anything that woods lesser magicians were able to try against them valdemar his perceptions enhanced by having sightblinder in his grip went running toward the place where he had seen woods plummeting body strike the earth the crashing weight had halfcollapsed a large tent in an area of the battlefield now otherwise deserted inside the standing portion of the tent valdemar discovered that the falling body halfarmored in bright metal had torn its way right through the fabric as it came down the corpse lay on its back rain falling on the face the whole head looking hideously altered from the human the terrible wound of shieldbreakers latest riposte showed plainly in the center of the chest where armor of steel and high magic had been shredded as effortlessly as skin the sword of mercy still reposed in its sheath at the waist of the dead wizard the proof of the identity of this deformed and otherwise nearly unrecognizable corpse was in its right hand dead fingers still gripping the black hilt of what had been the sword of wisdom the hilt itself still bearing a stump of broken blade oncemagnificent metal dulled and lifeless now after the briefest of hesitations the young man identified the sheathed and intact sword beyond any doubt he did this by drawing it forth and using it to treat his own small injuries recently received in battle then valdemar working quietly and quickly and unobserved inside this halfcollapsed pavilion wrapped up woundhealer in tent fabric having used the blade itself to cut a piece to size and then he promptly made off with it trusting to sightblinder in his right hand to afford him an unimpeded exit from the battlefield valdemar had no trouble justifying this action to himself the fight seemed to have been won or at least was in a lull with every prospect for an eventual tasavaltan victory he told himself that he had done his share and more than his share of the necessary fight against the evil folk who would have hounded delia to her death or worse their glorious enemy the prince of tasavalta was still alive now protectively surrounded by his own fiercely defensive troops all of them unlike valdemar trained fighters overshadowing all other considerations of course was the fact that delia desperately needed help the help that he could bring her now and that he feared might never reach her if he were to trust the sword of mercy to someone else with both leaders now fallen a lull had fallen over the field of combat the enemy had retreated to regroup or were perhaps recovering from a rout or else they were following the tasavaltans who in turn were trying to retreat with their injured prince val could not immediately see just what was happening and in fact he did not greatly care he moved out boldly armed with the sword of stealth making steady progress not looking back he separated himself from whatever was left of the battle he was going to bring help and healing to the woman he loved he told himself as he trudged away that after he and delia were safely out of trouble the prince of tasavalta would be welcome to the sword to all the swords the prince had not seemed a bad man but valdemar really put little faith in marks promises of help obviously the prince was going to be fully engaged in his own problems for some indefinite time to come val could not blame him in marks place he would have done the same presently the fighting flared up again around the prince and his close companions so that their search for the nowmissing valdemar just tentatively begun had to be abandoned for a time zoltan and ben exchanged guesses as to whether valdemar had been killed of course there was nothing to be done about it if he had been men had been dispatched to look for woods body for he might have been carrying a sword or two the corpse of the fallen wizard was discovered and with the help of karel recognized but no unbroken swords were with it sightblinder was gone from the field but shieldbreaker in zoltans hand fought on with devastating effect any minions of wood whose morale had survived the loss of their leader and who were still misguided enough to strike directly with material weapons at the holder of the sword of force saw their spears and swords and missiles shattered and broken and they themselves were slaughtered when they came within range of shieldbreakers matchless force similarly any who tried to attack that person with magic saw their spells too broken by the sword of force some minor wizards in woods camp expired with startling visual effects and again and yet again cleverly trained and fanatically led one frantic wouldbe wrestler after another cast down his weapons and tried to close with the figure assumed to be mark again and again that mans new bodyguard beat back these attempts with ordinary blades cudgels skill and strength sixteen valdemar struggling against exhaustion after the prolonged fighting kept moving as fast as he could trudging on through rain and muck he snatched brief periods of rest when quivering knees and faintness told him that he must in the first stage of his journey carrying two swords he passed many wounded numbers of them crying out pitiably setting his jaw he closed his ears to the sounds of pain and carried woundhealer wrapped and hidden past the victims of the fighting telling himself that he had already done more than his share for the tasavaltan cause at moments when he closed his eyes every groan of pain seemed to be sounding in delias voice he kept on moving as quickly and steadily as he could back toward his beloved when valdemar was half a kilometer from the camp he thought he heard the sounds of battle started up behind him yet again he did not look back but kept going and the noises slowly faded once more resting only when his weariness compelled valdemar traveled for about an hour before coming in sight of the abandoned hut where he had left delia running the last few meters calling her name he heard a welcome answer and found her inside waiting for him he remembered to put sightblinder away before he entered delia lying almost exactly where val had left her cried out to him in weak but joyous welcome woundhealer drawn he rushed forward to his womans side minutes later the couple were resting and eating preparatory to starting their long journey to valdemars vineyard when a dull shadow fell across the doorway blocking the dim light of the rainy day val looked up to glimpse a massive figure clad in woods blue and silver livery the young man had taken off his belt and left both swords imprudently just out of easy reach in the next instant val lunged for them only to be felled by a stunning blow on head and shoulder good day to you both young folks said sergeant brod delia hurled herself on the intruder but brod laughing easily caught her and clamped her wrists behind her back in one of his huge hands he said things have gone a little wrong with the masters magic but i see the spell he gave me to find you here is still working just fine but on taking a good look at the woman he had just caught who continued to squirm and hiss and scratch brod had some difficulty in believing this ordinarylooking female had once been tigris even though he had never had a good look at the enchantress it seemed to the sarge that woods longrange punishment had been devastatingly effective in fact if wood had not thoughtfully provided him with a certain magical means of identification he would probably have failed to recognize her at all val lay on the floor of the hut groaning by all indications unable to move the sarge making sure he had delia in a safe grip bent over to get his first good look at the weapons on the earthen floor the tools val had just been trying to reach he was astonished and momentarily distracted by what he saw swords by all the gods shifting his grip on delias arms he muttered lets jus see which ones we got and bent over meaning to look closely at the black hilts projecting from the swordbelt it was now or never val seeing double his head and neck aflame with pain a deadly weakness dragging all his limbs summoned up what strength he could and hurled himself forward grappling brod around the knees brod struck viciously at his assailant stretching the already injured man out helpless on the floor but he had to let go of delia in the process in the moment when brod was busy defending himself from val delia managed to pull one of her hands free diving to reach the swords she was able to pull sightblinder from its sheath with the same movement of her arm she threw the weapon as far as she could so it went flying into a far comer of the hut when brod instinctively released her and went plunging after the sword she stuck out a leg and tripped him so that he came down with a slam that drove the breath out of his body a moment later she had seized woundhealer and without hesitation thrust its bright blade straight into her lovers chest the sarge regaining his feet and lunging forward once more after the tantalizingly available sword of stealth had almost got his fingers on its hilt when the great weight of valdemars body once more fully functional landed on him from behind skidding forward with vals momentum both men went crashing out through the old huts flimsy wall wrestling hand to hand the two went rolling over and over brods effort to knee his opponent failed valdemars huge arms quivered straining against muscles every bit as powerful as his own suddenly the sarge stiffened looking over valdemars shoulder at a terrible male figure that towered above them both the figures blue eyes glared its empty hands were extended in the gesture of a wizard about to loose a blasting curse valdemar saw nothing of this apparition he only felt brods body convulse and heard him scream out master wood before he retched up blood and died turning valdemar beheld only delia he saw her in her true form for she had let go the hilt of sightblinder whose blade remained embedded deeply in brods heart val struggling to his feet recalled once urging ben to use woundhealer to save this very man and val muttered now no no more youve had enough chances tethered at a little distance from the hut they found brods ridingbeast along with a spare mount saddled and ready the saddlebags of both animals contained food and other useful items he said something didnt he about having been sent to bring me back delia shuddered it wasnt you they really wanted love it was that other woman tigris i dont want to hear about her or think about her in less than half an hour the pair wishing with all their souls to put the horrors of their last few days behind them were hastening away from the scene of their most recent struggle delia her spirits risen again with the return and triumph of her lover began to play with woundhealer giggling and marveling at the inability of this sharp blade to cut her fingers off or even scratch them how different this sword from the one that had so treacherously hurt vals fingers earlier watching her perform such tricks gave val the shivers and he ordered her to stop for once in a meek mood she obeyed without a murmur valdemar noted also with belated apprehension that the sword of mercy had only partially if at all restored delias memory he supposed that woods expunging of her evil experiences both as perpetrator and victim would not be construed as an injury somehow out of renewed spirits and talk of a future that suddenly seemed clear the topic of marriage came under discussion the urge for wedlock came with the greatest intensity upon valdemar his sense of propriety an innate conservatism in matters of society and morals was really stronger than delias delia wondered aloud if she was too young for matrimony and whether she ought to take such a step without consulting her mother would that be possible her companion asked vaguely surprised no no i dont see how i dont know if shes still alive valdemar was in a mood to insist on a ceremony otherwise it would be shameful to continue to take advantage of you in this way is that what you call it take advantage come take advantage of me again on the next morning the couple awakened to idyllic sunshine from the state of the morning sky it seemed likely that for a change a whole day might be going to pass without rain delia yes i think perhaps the most proper thing for us to do is to perform some kind of wedding ceremony ourselves chewing on a grass blade the young woman thought over this idea yes we can do that if you like having won his point the youth still felt it necessary to explain his thoughts and feelings otherwise the difficulty as i see it is going to be in finding someone qualified to marry us even when we get back to my vineyard therell really be no one the nearest village is about a days walk distant and i dont know if theres anyone in that village id want to perform my wedding ceremony thats too bad but in fact delia did not seem very much upset val continued a white temple priest or priestess would be the best i think maybe someday we can get to a white temple somewhere i pray to ardneh sometimes actually i pray to ardneh a great deal hes not dead like the other gods delia was now listening carefully wideeyed and nodding as far as her companion could tell she was accepting everything he said as truth that made him feel the importance of weighing his words carefully he added moodily i could almost wish that we still had the other sword wayfinder would show us where to find the right priest or official is it that important to you finding someone to say words over us we could pretend we still have the findingsword half in jest half seriously valdemar closed his eyes held out his hands gripping an invisible hilt imagining or pretending that he still had the sword of wisdom he said sword if you can do so without keeping me longer from my vineyard or putting us in danger show me the way to someone who could marry us of course there was really no weight tugging at his hands no bright metal to point and give him a direction but delias fingers were pulling at his sleeve opening his eyes valdemar discovered that they were no longer alone standing on the other side of the little clearing regarding them in a friendly way was a middlesized darkhaired thirtyish man wearing boots and practical trousers of pilgrim gray his upper body covered by a short white robe which made him look like a white temple priest on pilgrimage he appeared to be unarmed valdemar scrambled to his feet greetings to you sir i am valdemar and this is delia the man nodded his head briskly his eyes were faintly merry and greetings to you in ardnehs name i am the man you see before you sir the truth is that i have taken a certain vow for a time i may not speak my real name delia appeared to find this interesting a vow to a god which one the other shrugged slightly a deprecating gesture a vow to myself thats all you might call me brother white if it is easier for you to call me something brother white valdemar was suddenly anxious are you a priest of the white temple as your robe suggests the newcomer nodded in acknowledgement i am among other things then reverend brother would you be willing to perform a certain ceremony for us sir that is what you both want delia and val looked at each other then said together it is then it would please me to be your witness if you will perform the ceremony for yourselves valdemar looked again at delia then agreed he was beginning to have the distinct impression that he had known this man somewhere before but he could not recall where or when and then abruptly a hint of insight came to valdemar he asked sir do you know the lady yambu i do then sir are you possibly he who is called the emperor she spoke to me once of such a man who was once her husband indeed i am the answer was very matteroffact neither a boast nor an apology val didnt know exactly what to say next at last he announced sir the blue temple covets your treasure im sure they do the emperor smiled then looked almost wistful for a moment but i doubt they know how to get at it delias thoughts were elsewhere if we are to be married she murmured thoughtfully i wish i had a new dress to wear there had been nothing of the kind in brods saddlebags let me see said the emperor and he bowed to delia slightly as if asking her permission for what he was about to do then he took her by one hand and turned her spun her gently considerately as if he were the skilled partner of the worlds most graceful dancer white perhaps white would be best why i see nothing in the least wrong with what you are wearing now and with the spinning in the time it took young legs to dance a step her stained frayed garments changed became a dress a gown of purest ivory val would have expected a white temple priest presiding at a wedding to read from some kind of a book but instead the emperor or brother white simply took each of the young people by the hand held their hands clasped together in his own and asked them questions about their commitment to each other the girl became very solemn for a time when this rather ordinarylooking man looked at her and spoke to her and to valdemar the setting was a pleasant place and true to the mornings promise for once it was not raining when the ceremony had been concluded and valdemar had kissed his bride he turned to brother white and said sir we are young and healthy we intend to avoid war in the future so we have no need of either of these swords that we are carrying or rather others have greater need of them than we do and we have had proof more proof than we needed that the possession of such treasure can bring disaster as well as healing so i want to give them to you brother white listened carefully and nodded a noble gift and i thank you and i am proud to accept still others have greater need than i so my acceptance must have one condition yes sir that you carry these swords which are now mine with you a little longer hand them over to the next person you meet who appears to be in need of their powers valdemar and delia nodded the emperor waved them on their way very well pleased to be formally united as man and wife delia and valdemar continued their progress homeward on brods pair of ridingbeasts not hurrying now but not wasting any time she had noticed with no great surprise that as soon as she and her husband were alone again her wedding dress had turned into clothes very much resembling her own garments but not worn or grimy they pressed on at times when the way ahead still seemed long and difficult valdemar reminded his new bride and himself that he had come on foot in no very great number of days from his home to this region and that they therefore ought to have no great trouble walking home again especially not with the sword of stealth to guard them on their way the land around them had become more hospitable and there were increasing signs of human habitation and valdemar had begun to ride with sightblinder sheathed instead of drawn perhaps he had also begun to lose a little of his alertness he was halfway across a narrow bridge spanning a small stream when he raised his eyes to see ben of purkinje armed and mounted waiting for him on the west bank val slowed his ridingbeast and put a hand to the black hilt at his side he hoped devoutly that delia would know what to do to stay in concealment where she was back on the east bank they had not yet entirely foresaken caution as they traveled the bridge was a single great log carved flat on its upper surface the brisk stream splashed and gurgled underneath speaking a little more loudly than was strictly necessary valdemar called out ben surprised to meet you here the ugly face smiled faintly cant say im that surprised to meet you matter of fact a lot of us have out been looking for you and for a couple of swords and for a certain woman ever since we won the battle i was sure our side had it won else i would not have left even as valdemar spoke the words he wondered if they were strictly true urging his mount slowly forward he halted again when he came close to ben who with his ridingbeast was almost blocking the west end of the span then val looked around are you alone i wanted to talk to you about that ben said mildly and reined his mount back slightly from the narrow path giving val plenty of room to pass val urged his own steed forward a moment later just as val was passing ben seized him round the waist and dragged him from the saddle gripping him fiercely to keep him from drawing any weapon delia came cantering briskly across the narrow bridge with sightblinder raised to defend her husband at the sound of hoofbeats ben looked up and what he saw momentarily paralyzed him before he could recover val had knocked him out when ben came to himself with the feeling of just having made a magically quick and complete recovery he found himself sitting beside the little path valdemar a sword in his huge right hand was standing looking down at him obviously the couple were packed up and in the act of moving on the sound of a womans voice came from somewhere just out of bens sight around the next bend of the path as if she were gently fussing with a couple of ridingbeasts bens own mount was waiting patiently just beside him where is she ben leaped to his feet looking around who ariane i saw her here his voice trailed off as some version of the truth dawned on him valdemar shook his huge head he threw his weapon to the ground where metal clashed on metal one of the two swords that we are leaving you is sightblinder that you are leaving me ben inquired stupidly following vals gesture he looked down uncomprehendingly two magnificent blackhilted blades lay crossed on the ground in front of him waiting to be picked up yes said valdemar we are leaving them with you chiefly because of a promise we have made and one of these swords i repeat is sightblinder i ought to have expected that yes do you understand now whatever woman you thought you saw before i knocked you out was never actually here ah yes the woman with me is my wife and were leaving both swords with you does the lady yambu still live she does said ben slowly and the prince too good i hoped mark was going to survive heal them and heal marks princess i will said ben and let himself sit down again heavily in the grass his legs so recently touched by the sword of healing were as strong and healthy as they were ever going to be and yet his sitting down was a collapse he was going to be all right he was all right but some losses even woundhealer could not restore ariane was still gone gone forever at a little distance he could hear valdemar mounting and then the two animals moving away accompanied by the voices of their riders but for some considerable time ben of purkinje only sat where the givers of gifts had left him staring at his magnificent paired swords
