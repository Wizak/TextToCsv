the lovers assistant or new art of love introduction the publishing history of this translation has been sketched by cross in his history of henry fielding and may simply be summarized here the first edition entitled ovids art of love paraphrased and adapted to the present time or times was first issued in february and was advertised in the gentlemans and scots magazines in that month during march further advertisements appeared in the london magazine and the st james evening post the most extensive notice ran however in fieldings own jacobite journal no where it served as basis for a detailed comparison between the art of love and the art of jacobitism of this anonymous original edition no copy is known in the work was reissued in london and dublin under the title the lovers assistant and again in london in meanwhile advertisements for the original edition as by henry fielding had been run by the publisher andrew millar in and inasmuch as millar apparently still had unsold sheets in the edition may comprise these sheets with new title pages and prefatory matter necessary because of fieldings death in at any rate the modern instances referred to by the author of the preface are not too modern to have been written in there has been no reprint since the present text is printed from the edition collated with a copy of the issue the latin text which in the original faces the english is omitted notes keyed by letters and asterisks appear in the original it will be noted that fieldings notes combine scholarly and facetious remarks he frequently used footnotes for comic effect especially in the translation of the plutus of aristophanes in which he collaborated literature affords few pleasures so satisfying as translations done by those who are not only expert in the languages concerned but who also are of the same spirit as the authors they translate some examples come readily to mind popes horace drydens juvenal and persius smolletts lesage langs aucassin and nicolette and pounds translations from provenal such a felicitous combination appears in henry fieldings translation of book i of ovids ars amoris throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries english translators of the classics abounded including marlowe jonson chapman and sandys roscommon waller denham cowley and dryden by the major kinds of translation had been differentiated described evaluated and practised to summarize dryden wrote as follows in his preface to the edition of ovids epistles translated by several hands all translation i suppose may be reduced to these three heads first that of metaphrase or turning an author word by word and line by line from one language to another the second way is that of paraphrase or translation with latitude where the author is kept in view by the translator so as never to be lost but his words are not so strictly followd as his sense and that too is admitted to be amplyfied but not alterd the third way is that of imitation where the translator if now ie by taking such liberties he has not lost that name assumes the liberty not only to vary from the words and sence but to forsake them both as he sees occasion and taking only some general hints from the original to run division on the groundwork as he pleases doubtless he refers to the translation of verse into verse but actually verseintoprose also falls within drydens third way when the author of the preface to the lovers assistant speaks of it as an undertaking in translation he means prose imitation or paraphrase of verse earlier in the miscellanies fielding had published part of juvenals sixth satire modernized in burlesque ie hudibrastic verse the modernization as in his art of love was of place england instead of italy as well as time and allowed the author to satirize some of his contemporaries as well as the customs of his own age when four years later he turned to the first book of ovids artis amatoriae he found prose an even better medium for imitation or modernization the result is a most enjoyable pot pourri of roman mythology and eighteenth century social customs combined with some of the patriotism left over from fieldings antijacobinism during the fortyfive his devotion to and constant use of the classics has excited comment from every fielding biographer since his own time his works abound in classical instances references and imitations and most of his writing includes translations from greek or roman authors his library as austin dobson observed was rich in editions of the classics curiously the sale catalogue lists only one unidentifiable ovid item as contrasted with editions of horace of lucian and between and of aristotle this probably means that along with other unlisted works known to have been in his possession his ovid was retained by his family or given to a friend drydens translation of book one of the ars amoris is included among fieldings books however and cross suggests that fielding kept one eye on it it is surprising how much visualization there is in his imitation many of the incidents resemble those treated by hogarth with whom by fielding was on excellent terms there is also some resemblance in his contemporaneous materials or modernization to scenes in fieldings own later plays and in his novels preface this work was begun many years ago though altered in some places by the author before his death as will appear by the modern instances introduced in it many of which being so applicable to the present time is the occasion of it being now published as to any exception which may be made to the impurity of this work we shall transcribe what was written long ago in its defence from the preface prefixed to mr drydens translation of this poem a great many people are mistaken in these books and tho they were made use of as a pretence to drive the author from the court of augustus and confine him to tomos on the frontiers of the getae and sarmatae yet they were not the true cause of his confinement they are very far from being so licentious as the writings of several other poets both greek and latin however we must own he might have been a little more discreet especially in some placesa note a he means in the other two books that which offended the romans most in this work cannot touch us it has always been more dangerous in italy to converse with women of honour and frequent their houses than tis with us where there is more liberty and what in that country may be an occasion of debauchery would not at all be so in ours notwithstanding all that has been said against these books of the art of love by some overscrupulous persons whose discretion has too much of affectation in it they are not only necessary for the knowledge of the latin tongue and the roman history concerning which they contain several things very particular but for the noble sentiments we find in them which the gravest and learnedest writers have thought worthy to be quoted for authorities in a word theres nothing in them that comes near the licence of some epigrams of catullus martial and ausonius of some satires of horace and juvenal and several other pieces of ancient and modern authors which are read and commented upon and about which even celebrated jesuits and other religious persons as eminent for their piety as their erudition have employed their studies yet who has condemnd or complaind of them we must confess such things should be managed with address and those of them who have meddled with any of the authors i have named have shewn that it may be done so by their succeeding so happily in it as for this treatise of the art of love for which the author has also prescribd a remedy as it is liable to be ill interpreted by those whose pens poison every thing they touch so it may bear a good construction by such as know how to turn every thing to advantage i will yet say this art may be applyd to those that intend to marry there is nothing sure against decency in all that i agree if you will have it so that it extends so far as to direct one to the means to gain a mistress if this was not lawful heretofore in italy on account of the jealous humour of the italians we cannot for the same reason only say it ought to be forbidden in our country any more than in several others provided we could be sure the ladies modesty would not be offended before whom youth should be always careful not to exceed the bounds of the respect thats due to them to this i may add that if the objection of impurity lies against any part of this work it is only against the two latter books for in that which we have here paraphrased there is nothing capable of offending the nicest ear with regard to the merit of this paraphrase which is entirely a new undertaking and might perhaps if properly encouraged be carried on with other latin poets we shall only observe that the utmost care hath been taken to preserve the spirit and true sense of the author and where we have been obliged to deviate we have given the literal translation in the notes upon the whole we cannot suppress what one of the most learned men of this age said upon persuing the paraphrase viz that he thought it would serve better to explain the meaning of ovid to a learner than any other translation or all his numerous commentators book i if in so learned an age as this when arts and sciences are risen to such perfection there be any gentleman unskilled in the art of loving let him come to my school where if he hath any genius he will soon become an adept for i would by no means have any young gentlemen think that erudition is unnecessary upon this occasion it is well known that the rules of art are necessary to the conduct of a ship for which reason none but able and experienced seamen are preferred to the command of one rules are necessary even to make a good coachman as those gentlemen who have the ambition to excel this way very well know in the same manner is art required to drive the chariot of love well now it hath pleased venus to place me in the coachbox what a captain is to a ship or the driver to his chariot that am i to love i own indeed master cupid is a little wild and often stubborn but he is only a child and of an age to be disciplined and however fierce the disposition of a lad may be a judicious schoolmaster knows very well how to correct it for many a boy who hath afterwards turned out a hero hath when at school very patiently submitted to the lash and quietly at the word of command held out his hands to be whipt duke william himself when a lad very possibly submitted to correction and he who was hereafter to become the terror of his enemies might in his youth have been afraid of his tutor mr pointz was his preceptor i am the preceptor of love both these youths were of a fierce disposition both elevated in their birth but as the stoutest ox submits himself to the yoke and the most fiery horse to the bridle so shall love to me though he may bend his bow against my breast and shake his torches at me no matter nay the more he pierces me with his arrows the more he burns me the more severely will i be revenged of him but here master apollo i will tell no lies to my readers i do not pretend to have received any inspiration from you any more than from parson whitefield and as for miss clio and her eight sisters i never visit them nor have i even a capacquaintance with them i write from experience only and experto crede roberto is my motto i promise my readers that i will tell them truth and if i must for form sake invoke any muse venus herself shall be the person sweet goddess then be thou present and smile at my undertaking but as for you who cannot smile i mean you prudes with your screwd faces which may be considered as signs hung forth before the door of virtue and which perhaps like other signs promise what is not to be found in the house i desire neither your favour nor your company goodnaturd girls are all i write to and such i promise them may read my works without a blush know then my good scholar that art unexperienced in the art of love that this art consists of three principal points first to select a proper mistress secondly to win her affections and thirdly to preserve your mutual affection of all these therefore we will treat or to speak metaphorically through these three roads we will drive the chariot we have undertaken to guide first then as to the choice of a mistress to whom you may say in thee alone my choice is fixed do not believe such a one will fall into your lap it will become you to look about sharp for her and with all your eyes i do assure you and here my first instruction shall be where she may most probably be found for he is a bad huntsman who would beat about the royal exchange for a hare or a fox and not a much better gunner or fisherman who goes a shooting in somersetgardens or attempts to angle in the magnificent bason there as these all know the places where their game resort so must you here then i by no means advise you to make a long voyage after a foreign mistress as perseus did who fetched andromeda from the indies or paris whom nothing would serve but a grecian mistress your own country my friend will produce women which the world cannot equal beauties are as plenty in the city of london as apples in herefordshire or grains of wheat in hampshire they are indeed as plenty as fish in the sea or birds in the air nay the sky hath not more stars than london hath beauties for england not cyprus is the queen of loves favourite island whether you love green fruit and which is in the bud only or beauty in its fuller bloom or that which is arrived to perfect ripeness nay if nothing but wisdom or sagacity will serve your turn of these too old england will afford you a sufficient plenty in the pleasant month of may repair to vauxhall here take your evening walk either round the verdant scenes where nightingales the only foreigners who give us their songs for nothing warble their most delicious notes when your limbs demand repose you may enjoy it in an alcove from whence the embatteld troops of venus will pass in review before you again the lofty dome of ranelagh invites your steps whether the illustrious artist took his model from that house which as a reward for their industry or for some little regard for their honey the benevolent nature of man hath conferred on that laborious animal the bee or whether a more pious disposition chose this form from the musical instrument which summons the whole parish to church or whether the wondrous force of genius unassisted by any model did not of itself strike out this wondrous architecture let kent or benson inquire hither from every corner of the town repair the loveliest nymphs here too thou mayst survey them either walking or reposed on benches at thy ease nor is the mall to be neglected where once die brawny arm of charles displayed its strength and beat his subtle courtiers at the play whence it derives its name nor kensington must thy gardens be passed by once the delight of mighty caroline and to the future age a monument of her taste here the charmers draw in sweet air and send it forth again in sweeter sighs as tributes to the loved memory of that mighty queen as for the ring formerly the scene of beautys many triumphs it is now become a lonely deserted place brilliants and brilliant eyes no longer sparkle there no more the heedless beau falls by the random glance or wellpointed fan the ring is now no more yet ruckholt marybone and the wells survive places by no means to be neglected by the gallant for beauty may lurk beneath the straw hat and venus often clothes her lovely limbs in stuffs nay the very courts of law are not excluded and the scenes of wrangling are sometimes the scenes of love in that hall where thames sometimes overflowing washes the temple of venus lucy the grave serjeant becomes a victim to the fair and he who so well knows how to defend others cannot defend himself here the special pleader loses all power to demurr and finds beyond his expectation a novel assignment spring up in the cause him venus lucy laughs at from her neighbouring temple for the council is now become the client and squeezes an empty hand harder than he ever did a full one but above all the theatres are the place of sport for these will be most fruitful to your wishes here you will find one object to love and another to toy with some of whom a single touch will suffice and others in whom you will desire a stronger tenure neither do the ants in pursuit of grain or the bees in quest of flowers swarm in greater numbers than the beauties to the theatres the variety of charmers here have often distracted my choice hither they come to see and to be themselves seen and many are the lovebargains here made and now friend i will tell you a story romulus was the first person who ever made this use of the theatre when he ordered his soldiers to fall foul on the sabine ladies whom he invited to a play acted by his command not that i would have you think that theatre was like the playhouse in conventgarden enriched with scenes machines and other decorations to say the truth it was no better than a barn or booth here he assembled the sabine girls and ordered his romans to chuse every man his miss they did so and while the poor girls thought no harm those fellows felt strange emotions within now while a certain dancer called the ludio was performing a tambourine which i suppose took greatly at that time romulus on a sudden gave the signal for falling on this was instantly obeyed they all rushed in laid their hands upon the girls and soon gave them sufficient tokens of their purpose as the doves who are the most timorous of birds fly from eagles or as the young lamb runs from wolves as soon as she sees them so terrified were these ladies at the men rushing upon them in this unlawful manner the colour forsook their cheeks at once all were equally in a fright though they discovered their fear by different symptoms some of them tear their hair others sit in amazement terror strikes some dumb others call in vain for the assistance of their mammas one cries out another is shocked to death one stands still another endeavours to get out of the house but all their endeavours are vain and perhaps indeed their blushes heightened their beauty they were all led off and those who would not go were carried methinks i hear one of their gallants thus addressing his weeping fair why my dear will you spoil those lovely eyes with tears i promise you you shall be served no worse than your mother hath been before i will only do to you what your father did to her ah romulus romulus no general ever better knew how to reward his soldiers i promise you that when i hear your drum beating up for voluntiers i will enlist under your command ever since that time the theatre hath been consecrated to love and many a pretty girl since the sabines hath owed the loss of her maidenhead to it other places of publick meeting may likewise be frequented as horse races and the like and especially public shews which never fail of women here get upon a crouded scaffold and sit next to the girl you like squeeze yourself as close to her as you can for custom here countenances such squeezing whether the pretty creatures will or no here find some opportunity to begin a discourse you will not be driven to talk upon your fingers or by signs but may use your tongueb begin then with news or the chitchat of the town nay the shew itself will afford a subject for instance supposing it was my lord mayors shew you may ask her what alderman that coach or those liveries belong to and be sure to admire the same with herself do not omit moreover to give her an early intimation of your gallantry and that you are a womans man if it should happen that any one of the aldermen should be a greater cuckold than the rest of his brethren take care to titter at his appearance and while the pageants are passing by endeavour to find out a resemblance of horns in some of them all those things have a remote tendency to this great point note b these verses are transposed from the place in which they stand in the original and this i think with advantage to the connection if a grain of snuff should happen to fall on the ladys bosom wipe it off with your fingers and if none fall wipe off that none take every opportunity to be as officious in her service as possible if she drop her fan or gloves presently take them up for this you will have sure reward in the very fact for you may at the same time lift up her petticoat and see her legs be careful that the person who sits behind her doth not press her tender back with his knee small matters captivate light minds many a man hath drawn considerable advantage from handing a lady to coach by gallanting her fan or even by taking up her clog nor will towerhill when the tragic scaffold is strewed with sawdust be an improper place to begin your intrigue for cupid himself always attends and acts the part of an executioner on such occasions many a poor man having lost his heart while he hath attended to anothers losing his head while the fairone carelessly laying her hand on his argues concerning the criminals guilt and offers to lay a wager that he will die well the wounded lover feels a sudden stroke and is not better able to bear the smart without a sigh if it was the custom of england to imitate the romans in insulting over the conquered what spectacles might have formerly been exhibited how many french youths and virgins might have followed the chariotwheels of our monarchs in that cafe many a poor english heart must have submitted to a french conquest and beauty would have been triumphant in chains nay i prophesy we shall again see those victorious times our mighty george now meditates new triumphs and france shall be punished as she ought rejoice o ye shades whose bodies lie buried in the plains of fontenoy where british colours were polluted by gallic hands william your avenger comes the general in him shone forth in his first campaign and while a youth he managed war beyond his years let not his age therefore deter us from ranking him among our greatest commanders his warlike genius springs forth and outruns his years impatient of the sluggish pace of time the swedish charles was scarce beyond a child when he crushed two mighty enemies at once charles the german prince yet but a youth what was he when he past the rhine and terrified the host of france thy fathers genius william and his courage shall inspire thy youthful arms with that genius and that courage shalt thou conquer such beginnings dost thou owe to the mighty name of thy illustrious sire that thou who art the noblest of all young commanders mayst hereafter become the first among the old tis time to avenge the injuries attempted to thy house and to maintain thy glorious fathers rights thy countrys father and thy own girts on thy sword and thy cause is no less glorious than thy arms in both is france inferiour and to both shall yield i prophesy that thou shalt conquer and to thy conquest i dedicate my votive prayers prepared hereafter to resound thy praise when we shall see thee most lovely prince returning thy glories far outshining the gold in which thou art attired thee shall crouds of youths and beauteous virgins hail from their crouded windows as thou passest and universal joy shall overspread each british face on that blest day if then my scholar thou shouldst happen to be placed in a window near some lovely girl who fired with the glories of the young conqueror should enquire into all his matchless labours his wound at dettingen his danger and intrepidity at fontenoy his toils at home in defiance of cold and fatigue his pursuit to carlisle his victory at culloden and many more which will then be as well known repeat all if thou canst and if thy memory fails go on nevertheless for invention cannot here outdo the reality and thy fictions shall recommend thee equal with truth to her ears again when thou dost sit down at table among the women thou mayst reap other pleasures besides those of wine for to speak figuratively cupid with glowing cheeks often presses the horns of bacchus in his tender arms and the wings of the little god of love being wetted with wine he is unable to fly off and if he happens to shake his wet wings he may possibly sprinkle the bosom of your mistress with love in more intelligible language wine fills our minds with courage and makes them susceptible of other warm passions care flies away and is dissolved in much liquor then comes laughter the poor man becomes bold and grief and solicitude and knitted brows vanish then it is that simplicity a rare virtue in our age opens our hearts wine having divested us of cunning at this season many a watchful young fellow hath gained the heart of his mistress and love hath sprung from wine as the flame doth from fire however do not confide too much at this time to the light of a candle for night and wine obstruct us in forming a true judgment of beauty paris beheld the goddesses in open daylight when he gave the preference to venus indeed by candlelight and in a sidebox almost every one is a beauty jewels clothes and women are all best discerned by the light of the sun and here if i should recount all the rural haunts in which a lover may find his game i might write more volumes than oldmixon tunbridge and scarborough and cheltenham and holt and many other places shall be therefore omitted but bath thy sulphurous waters must not be past by hence master dapperwit bringing home the wounds made by fair eyes in his bosom cries out on his return the waters are not so wholesome as they are reported i have received more harm than good at the place here rises the temple of the god cnash whose walls are hung round with the portraits of beauties the apotheosis of this god hath cost many a poor man his heart thus far my scholar i have endeavoured to instruct thee in what places thou art to hunt for thy game and where to spread thy net i will now proceed to shew thee by what means puss is to be taken when you have found her sitting mind all as my old schoolmaster used to say for i assure you my instructions will be worthy the attention of both the great vulgar and the small my first lesson then is be confident believe every woman is to be come at do but spread your net and i warrant she runs into it sooner shall the birds be silent in the spring or the frogs in the winter sooner shall the greyhound run away from the hare than a woman shall resist the youth who gently assails her though she skrews up her face ever so demurely she will at length yield to his persuasions a dark corner is as agreeable to a girl as to one of us though we cannot so well dissemble our desires as she can but if we should once enter into a confederacy against the sex to leave off courting them they would soon begin to act the part of lovers and come a wooing to us and what is this but a natural affection common to the females of every other species who often make love to the males and give me leave to tell the ladies that we are more able to command our affections nor are our desires so furious and exceeding all bounds as theirs the story of byblis is too well known to be related who being in love with her brother punished her crime with her own hands and hanged herself in her garters miss myrrha loved her papa with an affection improper for a daughter for which she was turned into a tree i do assure you the story is true and the tree now drops continual tears for her offence which we use as a perfume and they retain the ladys name in the shady valleys of ida there was a white bull which was the glory of the farmer to whom he belonged this bull had a beautiful black speck between his horns all the rest of his body being as white as milk with him the gnossian and cydonian heifers were all in love and eagerly longed to be embraced by him in the tenderest manner in which bulls embrace the fair sex of cows pasipha i am very sorry to say it conceived a passion worse if possible than that of mrs mary hamilton for this bull lady is not more envied in the drawingroom than was every handsome heifer by this unfortunate woman the story is so well known that there is not a freethinker in the age who can refuse his credit to it though they believe nothing which they cannot see and account for this poor girl is reported to have mowed the sweetest grass with her own hands for her beloved bull she likewise wandered about among the cows without the least regard to mr alderman minos her husband for a bull had totally supplanted him in her esteem alas pasipha to what purpose are the brocaded petticoats your gallant is not sensible of your finery why do you consult your lookingglass in order to pursue the mountainherds or why with so much art do you set your tte if you will consult your glass let it inform you you are no heifer ah how desirous are you to have those horns on your own forehead which you intend to graft on your husbands it would be better to preserve your virtue and be constant to the alderman if you can like him but if you must make a cuckold of him do it at least with a young fellow no nothing but a bull will suffice she leaves the aldermans house and flies away to the groves and mountains to say the truth i believe she used to drink away her senses and that is the best excuse for her ah how often hath she cast a jealous eye on some heifer and cried out why should that vixen please my love behold says she how the slut dances a minuet on the grass before him let me die but she is silly enough to think her airs become her in my loves eyes at length she resolved to punish her rivals one heifer she ordered barbarously to be yoked to the plough another she condemned to be sacrificed and held the entrails of the poor victim in her hand with all the insulting triumph of a rival now says she having the entrails in her hand now go and make yourself agreeable to my dear at one time she wishes to be europa at another io for one of these was herself the wife of a bull and the other made her horse of one filled with these thoughts she contrived the strangest method of compleating her desires she sent for a joiner of great ingenuity and ordered him to make her a large cow of wood into this she conveyed herself and thus deceived master bull into her embraces she conceived by this monstrous coition and brought forth an offspring which by his partaking equally of the human and taurine form betrayed her horrid passion if the cretan lady had abstained from the love of thyestes o how women disdain constancy to their husbands the sun had not stopt in the middle of his career and turned about his face to the east that he might avoid the bloody banquet god be praised the cuckolds of our age are not so bloody in their revenge the daughter of nisus who stole her papas hair feeds hungry dogs in those parts which first set her a longing for minos agamemnon after returning safe from so many bloody campaigns and from the dangerous seas which he crossed fell at last a dreadful victim to the whore his wife who hath not wept at the sad story of cresa consumed by the flames of a sorceress who afterwards drenched her hands in the blood of her own children phoenix the son of amyntor hath often paid many a tear for his amours though he had not the wretched fate of hippolytus to be torn in pieces by wild horses and thou o phineus why dost thou indulge that jade harpalice by digging out the eyes of thy children believe me divine vengeance will hereafter inflict the same punishment on thyself all these have been the effects of womens raging desires which are so much more violent and mad than ours come on then and doubt not the conquest of any girl whatever there is not one in a thousand who will deny you and even those who will deny you love to be put to the question if you are disappointed therefore your repulse will be attended with no danger but why should you apprehend any disappointment when every new amour pleases them and they all hanker after the lovers and husbands of other women this i am afraid is too natural in all things the corn in our neighbours field seems always to flourish beyond our own and we think our own cow gives less milk than his however before you attack any lady make first sure of her maid for she will pave the way to your addresses if the lady have many females about her person take care to secure her who is most in the confidence of her mistress and who will faithfully betray to you all her private conversation when you have found this confidant out corrupt her with promises and intreaties for she can soon bring you to the end of your desires if she pleases let her watch the opportunity physicians will tell you the use of attending proper seasons when the mind of your mistress is easy and apt for your purpose this season i apprehend is when she is in the best humour for love then becomes luxuriant in her mind as corn doth in a rich soil when the heart is full of gladness and bound up by no vexation it is open and then the compliments of a lover will easily find an admission remember troy was defended while it remained in a sullen mood and opened its gates to the armed horse when it was full of goodhumour and drunk with joy yet every vexation should not deter you for if your mistress should be uneasy at the falshood of her husband then is a proper time to attack her and to assist her in revenging the injury when your mistress is in this humour let abigail while combing her hair at the toilette in a morning stir her up to vengeance this will underhand promote your voyage for while you openly manage your sails she works under the water with her oars now let abigail with a soft sigh mutter to her self ah poor lady i am afraid it is not in your power alone to revenge your husbands perfidy then let her introduce a discourse of you let her say something in your favour and swear that you are gone distracted and dying for love but no time must be lost lest the passions she hath raised should again subside and resentment intervene by delay and freeze up her love as ice doth water and here perhaps you will ask a question whether it is prudent to kiss the agent herself this is not easy to answer for it is a mere cast of the dye whether you succeed the better of the worse for it one woman is by enjoyment made a more industrious solicitor another becomes just the reverse one thinks of procuring the pleasures she hath tasted for her mistress another of securing them herself the event is doubtful and though she may be easy enough to be had my advice is abstain from the confidant for i will not imitate the empyric in striking bold strokes nor will i lead my scholars over a precipice i give no advice but what is safe nor shall any youth by following my precepts run himself into rosamonds pond if therefore the girl who goes between you and your mistress pleases you in her person as well as in her diligence enjoy the mistress first and the maid falls of course but never begin with the latter one thing however i must admonish you if my art deserves any credit and my words are to be regarded as any thing better than wind either never attempt the confidant or go thorough stitch with her for by making her particeps criminis you take away her evidence this doctrine you may learn from all other sportsmen for if a bird escapes with birdlime on his wings or a boar breaks through the toils or a fish gets off from the hook they are all sure to alarm their companions and spoil the sport of the fowler the hunter or the fisher if once therefore you attempt her press her to it with all your vigour and never leave her till you have enjoyed her for when once she is involved in the same guilt with yourself you are sure she will not betray you nay you may be assured further that she will betray every word and action of her mistress to you but take particular care not to blab any of the secrets she discloses to you for while her mistress hath no suspicion of her confidant she will be able to lay her entirely open to your knowledge and now to resume that matter believe me he is deceived who thinks that none but the farmer and mariner are obliged to regard the season for as it is not proper at all times to commit the corn to the fallacious fields nor to trust your vessel at all times to the green ocean so neither is it always safe to attack a tender girl for she will be taken at one time who will resist at another if it be for instance her birthday perhaps her grandmother hath instructed her to be particularly cautious on that day so if it be the day of the week on which childermas hath happened to fall that year or king charless martyrdom defer the attack at all such seasons for to speak in sealanguage then is dirty weather then it blows a hurricane and if you weigh anchor at that season you will be scarce able to keep your keel downwards above all avoid your mistresss birthday nor will it be more prudent in you to visit her first on the morning of valentines day you will pay more for being her valentine than it is worth indeed all seasons which give them any hint of receiving presents should be carefully avoided for be never so cautious and sneaking have it of you she will they all very well know the art of squeezing a lover who longs to squeeze them mrc deards will make his appearance in his silk nightgown and unbundle his packet in your presence the lady will then desire you to look over his trinkets she can do no less you know in compliment to your taste then she will make you a present of a kiss and afterwards desire you to buy it note c an eminent joyner in london i promise you my dear says she if you will but buy me this single jewel i will not ask another of you the lord knows how long but i have really a present occasion for this and besides it is the cheapest thing i ever saw if you pretend to have no money about you the answer is o my dear you may give your note mr deards will take your note so that you may repent having learnt to write your name then she adds o la i had almost forgot it is my birthday i am sure you will make me a present on my birthday for they can be born every day in the year to serve their purpose or else she pretends to have lost a drop from her earring this loss makes her miserable and sure says she if you loved me you would repair that loss nay some are not so honest as to desire a present they only borrow but they are sure never to restore by this means you lose the thing without having the merit of bestowing it in short if i had ten mouths with ten tongues in each all would not suffice to display all the arts by which harlots pick the pockets of their cullies begin then your amour with an epistle let that break the ice for you and make the first discovery of your flame in this you may insert all your little blandishments and expressions of fondness nor be ashamed however high your quality is to add the strongest entreaties remember that many a rebels son hath had his life spared at the supplication of his father nay the wrath of heaven itself is often averted by prayer it is moreover my advice to you to be liberal of your promises for what injury can you receive by promising this is a treasure in which any man may be rich nor can your mistress complain that she is absolutely cheated if you can bring her to believe your promises a lifely faith hath supported many a man for a long time for though our faith may sometimes deceive us it is however a great and commodious virtue beware of giving for when once your mistress hath the present in her clutches she may answer jilting you to her prudence she hath gained at least what she is in possession of and cannot be said to have lost any thing by the bargain on the contrary keep her still in expectation seem always about to give but never part with a shilling for in this manner doth a barren soil often deceive its owner thus that he may not be a loser the gamester pushes on his ill luck and one flattering throw makes him eager to have the box again in his hands indeed the great business is to enjoy your mistress before she hath touched you if she once yield to you gratis she will continue to bestow her favours still gratis in hopes of being at last rewarded for all her past favours epistolize therefore first flatter and sooth her with tender lines let these probe her mind and open the way for your addresses you know the story of cydippe who was outwitted by a letter inclosed in an apple by which means she was made to speak words she never intended i would advise the young gentlemen of the temple to study the arts of persuasion on other accounts besides that of defending sheepstealers at an assizes for a pretty girl may be as easily captivated by eloquence as a judge or jury and surely she is a much nobler prize but here conceal your art and do not carry your eloquence in your face and above all things beware of hard words for who but an empty coxcomb ever made a verbose declamation to his mistress by such methods you may raise her abhorrence more probably than her love let your passion appear credible and disclose it in easy and common language it may be as tender and warm as you please but preserve the stile of conversation if she should not receive your letter but send it back unopened hope for better success another time and maintain your purpose time brings the stubborn steer to bend his neck to the yoke and the horse to endure the bridle iron bonds and ploughshares are worn out by constant use what is harder than a rock or what is softer than water and yet hard rocks are hollowed by soft water penelope herself in time might have been conquered you see troy though it defended itself so long was however taken at last if she reads your letters but is unwilling to answer them do not attempt to compel her if she but reads your fondness it is sufficient if she will read in time she will answer what she reads all these matters will be brought about in their own good time perhaps the first answer she sends you will be a cruel one and may desire you to quit all future solicitations she fears to be taken at her word and hopes you will not grant her request follow her and in time you will obtain your wishes if you meet her chair and the curtains should be drawn approach it as it were by accident and when you discover her there whisper something tender in her ear but whisper softly lest the chairman or any other impertinent person should overhear you when she walks in the mall dangle after her and interrupt her walk with your conversation here you will have an opportunity of seeing her shape and shewing her yours by sometimes walking behind and sometimes before her but for the most part keep even pace with her whether she trips along briskly or only saunters sometimes she will take a longer walk as far perhaps as the second or third stone hither follow her and take every opportunity of getting up close to her side never let her go to the play without attending her no matter what the play is she will bring sufficient entertainment for you with her here keep your eyes always intent on her only and admire every thing about her by your eyes and by signs you may inform her of many things be sure to applaud greatly any amorous wanton dance and be no less favourable to those scenes where the business of love is transacted and almost brought to a conclusion on the stage many of which occur in congreve vanbrugh and wycherly if she rises between the acts rise also if she sits as sometimes ladies do to express their contempt for the audience do you likewise keep your seat in a word conduct yourself entirely according to her example and pleasure now with regard to your person do not imitate some finical petit matre in his toupet much less in more detestable effeminacies tuck your hair rather under your hat like the rough foxhunter who traverses hill and dale to the musick of the horn a careless air in dress becomes a man colonel theseus carried off miss ariadne in a campaign wig without a single curl in it in the same manner did captain hippolytus march off with miss phaedra though his shock head of hair never had any powder in it nay lady venus herself chose young jack adonis in a jockey coat and buckskin breeches cleanliness however is agreeable let your face be burnt with the sun but let your cloaths be well made and without a spot on them wash your mouth and clean your teeth often let your beard be close shaved and your nails short and free from dirt observe these documents and leave all other niceties to the women and to men who desire to supply their places but now bacchus summons his poet he likewise assists lovers and favours the flame which warms himself the cretan lady having jumped out of bed in a raving fit wandered on the foreign shore of dia she had nothing on but a loose wrapping gown without stockings or cap and her hair hung dishevelled over her shoulders she complained of the cruelty of theseus to the deep waves whilst an unworthy shower of tears ran down her cheeks she wept and lamented aloud and both became her nor did her tears diminish her beauty once and again she beat her delicious breasts with her hands and cried aloud the perfidious man hath abandoned me what will become of poor ariadne what will become of poor ariadne on a sudden a vast multitude was heard while many kinds of strange instruments like those of the miserable masons accompanied the voices the poor lady sunk with fear and suppressed her last words nor did the least blood remain in her countenance and now behold the bacchanalian women with their hair about their ears and the light satyrs who are always forerunners of the god behold old master silenus as drunk as a piper riding on an ass which he is hardly able either to sit or guide the old gentleman endeavouring to follow the bacchanalians who fly from him and towards him sets spurs to his ass which being a vicious beast kicked up and threw him over his ears upon which all the satyrs set up a loud shout crying out rise father rise and be dnd to you and now the god himself high mounted on his fourwheel chaise the top of which was adorned with grapes and which he drove himself flung his golden reins over the backs of his pair of tygers poor ariadnes colour forsook her cheeks and theseus and her voice at once deserted her lips thrice she attempted to fly and thrice being retained she grew stiff with fear and stood trembling as corn waves in the field or reeds on the river bank when fanned by the wind to whom the god behold madam a more faithful lover at your feet fear nothing lady fair you shall be the wife of bacchus the sky shall be your dowry where shining in a bright constellation by the name of ariadnes crown you shall often direct the doubtful mariners passage he said and leaping from his chariot lest ariadne should be afraid of the tygers the sand sunk under the weight of his feet and catching her instantly in his arms he carried her who was incapable of scratching directly off for every thing we know is in the power of a deity and now whilst part of his train sing the hymenaeum and other cry evie evoe two very mysterious words and full of masonry the god and his newravished bride go together between a pair of sacred sheets whenever therefore you happen to be in company with a pretty girl over a bottle pray heartily to bacchus and invoke his nocturnal rites that the wine may not get into your head you may now take an opportunity to toast some nymph by a fictitious name of whom you may say an hundred amorous things all which with the least assistance she will readily apply to herself double entendres likewise may be used you may moreover draw certain figures in wine on the table and after having spoken of your mistress in the third person you may take this method of writing her name and convincing her that she herself is the goddess but let your gloating eyes inform her of your passion for an expressive countenance often finds both words and utterance when she drinks receive the cup from her and let her see you industrious to find out the place before pressed by her lips and then drink eagerly at the same and whatever part of the meat she shall touch with her fingers do not fail to give the preference to that if in catching at it you touch her hand into the bargain it is the better but above all things let it be your endeavour to please her keeper if she have any for to make a friend of him will be very useful to you both when you are at table let him be always helped first and to the most elegant tidbit and when you drink together offer him always the place of toastmaker whether he be your inferiour or your equal let him always choose before you and be not ashamed to trowel him well over with flattery it is a safe and common way to deceive under pretence of friendship i must own however safe and common it is it is not altogether blameless this is indeed a dishonesty not very unlike that of a major domo who under the colour of friendship empties your cellars of your wine by pushing the bottle further than is necessary now to fix a certain stint to your cups i allow you never to drink till your head becomes giddy and your feet begin to totter beware of quarrels which are often occasioned by wine let not your hands be too ready to strike in your cups remember the old story of the wedding of pyrothous and many more where drunken fools by being quarrelsome in their liquor have come short home a drinking bout is in reality a properer scene for joke and mirth than for fighting i proceed to other lessons if you have a voice then sing if you have handsome legs cut capers or slide into the minuet step in short endeavour to please your mistress by exerting those talents in which nature hath given you to excel now as real drunkenness may be hurtful to you so you may sometimes reap advantages by pretending yourself in liquor by stammering or lisping a little slyly for then if you should descend to some expressions of the grosser kind it will be imputed to your having taken a cup too much drink bumpers to the health of your mistress and of the gentleman with whom she is obliged to sleep but i do not insist on your being extremely sincere on this occasion for you may heartily wish him hanged at the same time if you please when the company rises to go away there is always a confusion in the room of which you may take advantage you may then creep close up to your mistress may perhaps palm her and gently tread on her toes whenever you have an opportunity of speaking to her privately be not bashful like a country boobily squire remember fortune and love both favour the bold i do not intend to lay down any rules for your oratory on this occasion do but begin boldly and you will be eloquent of course set this only before you that you are to act the part of a lover to talk of wounds and darts and dying and despair and all that as mr bayes says for if you can once make her believe you are in love your business is done to create therefore this faith in her you must employ every art of which you are master nor is this indeed so difficult a task for every woman believes herself to be the object of love be she never so ugly she is still amiable in her own eye sometimes indeed no deceit is in the end put on the woman for her pretended lover becomes often a real one and is the very creature which he before personated and by the way young ladies let me tell you this is no small encouragement to you to countenance such pretences for if you manage well you may often inspire a man with love in earnest while he is endeavouring to impose a fictitious passion upon you but to return to my scholars flatter with all your might for the mind is taken as it were by stealth by flattery even as the bank which hangs over a river is undermined by the liquid waves never be weary therefore of commending her face or her hair her taper arm or her pretty little foot the chastest matrons are fond of hearing the praises of their beauty and the purest virgins make the charms of their persons at once their business and their pleasure what else is meant by that ancient fable of juno and pallas whom the greek poets represent as yet ashamed of the conquest obtained by venus this vanity seems to extend itself to animals in many of which we may observe some traces of it the peacock if you seem to admire her spreads forth her golden plumes which she never displays to an indifferent spectator the racehorse while he is running for a plate enjoys the beauties of his wellcombed mane and gracefully turned neck secondly to flattery add promises and those not timorous nor sneaking ones if a girl insists upon a promise of marriage give it her and bind it by many oathsd for no indictment lies for this sort of perjury the antients vented horrid impieties on this occasion and introduced jupiter shaking his sides at the perjuries of lovers and ordering the winds to puff them away nay he is said to have forsworn himself even by styx to juno and therefore say they he encourages men to follow his example note d this is the most exceptionable passage in the whole work we have endeavoured to soften it as much as possible but even as it now stands we cannot help expressing detestation of this sentiment which appears shocking even in a heathen writer but though a christian must not talk in this manner yet i believe it may be one of those sins which the church of rome holds to be venial or rather venal i would here by no means be suspected of infidelity or profaneness it is necessary there should be a god and therefore we must believe there is nay we must worship him for he doth not possess himself in that indolent state in which the deities of epicurus are depictured if we live innocent lives we may depend on the care of his providence restore faithfully whatever is deposited in your hands be just in all your contracts avoid all kind of fraud and be not polluted with blood a wise man will be a rogue only among the girls for in all other articles a gentleman will be ashamed of breaking his word and what is this more than deceiving the deceivers the sex are for the greatest part impostors let them therefore fall in the snares which they have spread for others perhaps you have never read the justice of busiris when egypt was burnt up nine years together for want of rain one thrasius a foreigner came to court and being introduced to the king by clementius cotterelius he acquainted his majesty that jupiter was to be propitiated by the blood of a stranger the king answered him then thou thyself shalt be the first victim and with thy foreign blood shalt give rain to egypt to the same purpose is the story of phalaris who roasted the limbs of perillus in his own bull thus making proof of the goodness of the work by the torments of the unhappy maker now there was great justice in both these examples for nothing can be more equitable than that the inventers of cruelty should perish by their own art to apply this to our present purpose as there is no deceit or perjury which women will stick at putting in use against us let them lament the consequence of their own examples thirdly tears are of great service the proverb tells you tears will move adamant if you can bring it about therefore let your mistress see your cheeks a little blubbered upon occasion if tears should refuse to come as they sometimes will an onion in your handkerchief will be of great use fourthly kisses what lover of any sense doth not mix kisses with his tender expressions perhaps she will not give them easily no matter take them without her leave perhaps she will scratch and say you are rude notwithstanding her scratches she will be pleased with your getting the better do this however in so gentle a manner that you may not hurt her tender lips nor let her complain of being scrubbed with your beard now when you have proceeded to kisses if you proceed no farther you may well be called unworthy of what you have hitherto obtained when you was at her lips how near was you to your journeys end if therefore you stop there you rather deserve the name of a bashful squire than of a modest man the girls may call this perhaps violence but it is a violence agreeable to them for they are often desirous of being pleased against their will for a woman taken without her consent notwithstanding her frowns is often well satisfied in her heart and your impudence is taken as a favour whilst she who when inclined to be ravished hath retreated untouched however she may affect to smile is in reality out of humour ravishing is indeed out of fashion in this age and therefore i am at a loss for modern examples but antient story abounds with them miss phoebe and her sister were both ravished and both were well pleased with the men who ravished them though the story of deidamia was formerly in all the trojan newspapers yet my reader may be pleased to see it better told venus had now kept her word to paris and given him the beauty she had promised not as a bribe but as a gratification for his having made an award in her favour in the famous cause between juno and others against venus in trover for a golden apple which was referred to him at the assizes at ida paris every one knows no sooner had received mrs helen than he immediately carried her off to his fathers court upon this the grecians entered into an association and several noblemen raised regiments at their own expence out of their regard to the public for cuckoldom was a public cause no one knowing whose turn it would be next lieutenantgeneral achilles who was to command a large body of grenadiers which the greeks call myrmidons did not behave handsomely on that occasion though he got off afterwards at a courtmartial by pleading that his mother who had a great deal in her own power had insisted on his acting the part he did for i am ashamed to say he dressed himself in womens clothes and hid himself at the house of one lycomedes a man of good fortune in those parts fie upon it general i am ashamed to see you sit quilting among the girls a sword becomes your hands much better than a needle what can you mean by that workbasket in a hand by which count hector is to fall do you carry that basket with you to put his head in for shame then cast away your huswife and all those effeminate trinkets from a fist able to wield harry the fifths sword it happened that at the same time when the general at the house of squire lycomedes performed this feat miss deidamia one of the maids of honour was visiting at the same place this young lady soon discovered that the general was a man for indeed he got her maidenhead he ravished her that is the truth ont that a gentleman ought to believe in favour of the lady but he may believe the lady was willing enough to be ravished at the same time when the general threw away his needle and grasped the armour you must remember the story for it was in the trojan alamain the young lady began to change her note and to hope he would not forsake her so ah little mia is this the violence you complained of is this the ravisher you are afraid of why with that gentle voice do you solicite the author of your dishonour to stay with you to come at once to the moral of my story as they are ashamed to make the first advances so they are ready to suffer whatever a pushing man can do unto them as for those pretty mastermisses the adoniss of the age who confide in their own charms and desire to be courted by the girls believe me they will stay long enough before they are asked the question if you are a man make the first overtures remember it is the mans part to address the fair and it will be hers to be tenderly won be bold then and put the question she desires no more than to have the question put and sure you will not deny your own wishes that favour jupiter himself went a courting to the heroines of old for i never heard of any girl who courted him but if you find madam gives herself any immoderate airs at your proposal it will then be good to recede a little from your undertaking and to affect to sheer off for many of them according to the poet pursue what flies and fly what doth pursue a short absence will soon cure her disdain it may be proper likewise to conceal your intentions a little at first and make your first advance under the pretence of platonic friendship i have known many a prude taken under these false colours and the platonic friend hath soon become a happy lover and now as to your complexion for believe me this is a matter of some consequence though i would not have you effeminate yet i would have you delicate a fair complexion in a tar is scandalous and looks more like a borough captain or one of those freshwater sailors who have so much dishonoured our navy the skin of a seaman ought to be rough and well battered with winds and waves such likewise ought to be the face of a foxhunter who ought not to fear rain or easterly winds and the fame becomes the soldier but let the soldier of venus look fair and delicate nay if your complexion inclines to paleness so much the better for this will be imputed by every young girl to love young orion with a pale countenance wandered through the groves being sick with the love of lyrice and the same effect had the love of nas upon the countenance of daphnis two lovers very famous in antiquity leanness is another token of a lover to obtain which you need not take physick sitting up all night and writing loveletters will bring this about be sure to look as miserable as possible so that every one who sees you may cry there goes a lover and here shall i lament the wickedness of mankind or only simply observe it to you but in reality all friendship and integrity are nothing more than names alas it is dangerous to be too prodigal in the praises of your mistress even to your friend for if he believes you he becomes your rival it is true there are some old stories of faithful friends patroclus never made a cuckold of achilles and phaedras chastity was never attempted by pirithous pylades loved hermions who was his friends wife but it was with the pure love of a brother and the same fidelity did castor preserve towards his twinbrother pollux but if you expect to find such instances in these degenerate days you may as well have faith enough to expect a pineapple from a peartree or to hope to fill your bottle with burgundy from the river i am afraid we are grown so bad that iniquity itself gives a relish to our pleasures and every man is not only addicted to his pleasures but those are the sweeter when seasond with anothers pain it is in short a terrible case that a lover ought to fear his friend more than his enemy beware of the former and you are safe beware of your cousin and your brother and your dear and intimate companions these are the sort of gentry from whom you are to apprehend most danger here i intended to have finished but one rule more suggests itself you are to note then that there is a great variety in the tempers of women for a thousand different women are to be wooed a thousand different ways mr miller will tell you that the same kind of soil is not proper for all fruits one produces good carrots another potatoes and a third turneps now there is as great a variety of disposition in the human mind as there are forms in the world for which reason a politician is capable of accommodating himself to innumerable kinds of tempers not proteus could indeed diversify himself more ways than he can nay you may learn this lesson from every fisherman for some fish are to be taken with one bait and some with another others will scarce bite at any but are however to be drawn out of the water by a net one good caution under this head is to consider the age of your mistress old birds are not taken with chaff and an old hare will be sure to double again consider circumstances do not frighten an ignorant woman with learning nor a poor country girl with your fine cloathes for by these means you will create in them too great an awe of you many a girl hath run away frighted from the embraces of the master and afterwards fallen into the clutches of his footman and here we will now cast our anchor having finished the first part of our intended voyage finis footnotes footnote here ovid uses the examples of automedon who was the coachman of achilles and of tiphys who was pilot or steersman to the argonauts footnote this is a literal translation by which it appears this barbarous custom of whipping boys on the hands till they look as if they had the itch was used by the roman schoolmasters as well as by ours footnote the original introduces achilles who was the pupil of chiron footnote in the original held forth at his masters commands those hands to be whipt which hector was hereafter to feel the indelicacy of which image we have avoided applying to our british hero footnote both born of a goddess footnote this is transferred we hope not improperly from roman to british superstition the latin alludes to augury and very justly ridicules the folly of divination by the flight of birds footnote nor were clio or her sisters seen by me while i tended a flock in the valleys of ascra this ascra was a valley near the helicon which was the residence of the parents of hesiod now hesiod was fabled whilst he was keeping his fathers sheep to have been led by the muse to the fountain hippocrene and being i suppose well ducked in that water commenced poet footnote this whole passage is a manifest burlesque on the invocations with which the ancients began their poems not very different is that sneer at the beginning of the metamorphosis dii caeptis nam vos mutastis et illas adspirate but the strongest piece of burlesque of this kind is the invocation to venus at the beginning of lucretius for what can be more so than a solemn application to a deity for her assistance in a work the professed intention of which is to expose the belief of any deity at all and more particularly of any concern which such superior beings might be supposed to take in the affairs of men for my own part i must confess i cannot perceive that graceful air of enthusiasm which a noble author observes in the invocation of the antients many of them indeed seem to have been too apparently in jest to endeavour to impose on their readers and in reality to apply to the muses with less devotion than our modern poets many of whom perhaps believe as much in those deities as in any other footnote ovid would here insinuate that the courtezans only were the subjects of the ensuing poem and in his tristibus he cites these lines and pleads them in his defence but he is not overhonest in his profession for in many parts it appears that his instructions are calculated for much more than concessa furtia footnote andromeda was the daughter of cepheus king of aethiopia and of cassiope her mother having offended the nereids by contending with them for superiority in beauty neptune at their petition sent a seamonster which greatly annoyed the aethiopians upon this they consulted the oracle of jupiter ammon who ordered them to expose one of the progeny of cepheus and cassiope to be devoured by the monster andromeda was accordingly tyd to a rock where she was espied by perseus who killed the monster and rescued the lady for which he received her at the hands of her parents as his reward the story is told in the th book of the metamorphosis footnote bunches of grapes in methymna a city of lesbia the wine of which country was famous among the ancients footnote ears of corn in gargara which was in mysia a province of the hellespont footnote the original is and the mother of aeneas resides in the city of her son aeneas from whom the romans derived their original was the son of venus by anchises footnote the original rendered as literally as possible is as follows walk at your ease under the pompeian shade when the sun enters the herculean lion or where the mother hath added her benefactions to those of her son a work rich in foreign marble nor avoid that portico adorned with ancient pictures which is called livia from the name of its founder nor that adorned by the statues of the belides who attempted the lives of their unfortunate cousins and where you see the cruel father standing with his drawn sword nor pass by the temple of venus and her lamented adonis nor omit the seventhday festivals of the jews nor the egyptian temples of the linnenclad heifer she makes many women to be that which she herself was to jupiter to explain these several particulars to an english reader it must be known that the porticos in rome were the publick walks and here persons of both sexes used to assemble among these was one built by pompey the second portico mentioned is by the best commentators understood of the octavian which was built by octavia sister to augustus and mother to marcellus and this adjoined to a temple built by the same marcellus the third portico was built by liviathe wife of augustus and called from her name the fourth where the picture of the belides was is to be understood of the portico of apollo palatinus in which were the statues of the fifty daughters of danaus and grandaughters of belus these being married to the fifty sons of their uncle aegyptus every one by her fathers command slew her husband on the first night save only hypermnestra for this they were punished in the lower world by being obliged to fill a barrel full of holes with water scaligerand others have here made a mistake supposing the picture of the belides was here hung up but the contrary appears by many authorities particularly by this in qv trist signa peregrinis ubi sunt alterna columnis belides stricto barbarus ense pater it appears that the number of pillars was equalled by the number of statues thly the temple of venus in which she was worshipped together with adonis after the assyrian manner this adonis was the son of cinyras king of cyprus begotten by him on his own daughter myrrha the fame of his beauty and the passion which venus bore towards him are well known thly the jewishsynagogues the jews having been encouraged by julius caesar were very numerous in rome at that time and the strangeness and pomp of their ceremonies inviting the curiosity of the roman ladies their synagogues became famous places of intrigue the temple of isis this goddess when a woman was called io she was the daughter of inachus and being beloved by jupiter was by him to preserve her from his wifes jealousy turned into a heifer juno suspecting the fact obtained this heifer of her husband and set argus to watch over her jupiter wanting to visit his old friend sent mercury to kill argus in revenge of which juno ordered a gadbee to sting the poor heifer which thereupon growing mad ran to egypt where she was again restored to the shape of a woman and married to osiris the feast of isis was celebrated in rome ten days together by the women and was a time of carnival among them footnote in caesars forum which was built on the appianway was the temple of venus genetrix footnote races were run at rome in april in the circus maximus which was likewise the scene of many other public exercises and shews footnote and when the procession shall pass on with the ivory deities do you applaud most the statue of lady venus thus the original the paraphrase preserves the same sense though in other circumstances these statues were carried in procession on many occasions particularly at the maegalesian games footnote adjusting her cushion footnote putting a footstool under her footnote the original mentioned the fights of the gladiators the paraphrase comes as near as our customs admit for the britishladies never attend to see men kill one another in jest footnote augustus caesar among other rich shews with which he entertained the people exhibited to them a seafight in a place dug on purpose near the banks of the tyber the poet takes this occasion of introducing many compliments to the grandson of this prince we have done little more than altered names in this place and as we are assured all here said is as properly applicable to the noble person to whom we have transferred it the learned reader will admire that any passage in an antient author can be so apposite to the present times and the true english reader will be no less delighted to see ovidintroduced as singing forth the praises of the british hero footnote parthia footnote the crassi footnote hercules footnote bacchus footnote the original here described the many nations who are led captives footnote here we have inverted the original but sure the sense upholds us in so doing footnote baiae a place not far from naples famous for wholesome as well as pleasant baths it is described very largely by diodorus and horace mentions it as the pleasantest place in the world footnote in the original the temple of diana in the suburbs it stood in a grove not far from rome the next line partaque per gladios c alludes to a very singular custom by which the priests of this temple succeeded to each other viz by conquest in single combat for which every slave or fugitive was admitted to contend and the victor was rewarded with the priesthood this practice was renewed every year and was as strabo informs us originally taken from the scythians footnote byblis fell in love with her brother caunus and upon his rejecting her addresses hanged herself the poets feign she was afterwards turned into a fountain see metam ix footnote myrrha was the daughter of cinyras who being in love with her father took an opportunity while her mother was employed in the sacrifices to ceres to supply her place her father discovering the imposture ran after her with a drawn sword to kill her but she escaped by means of the night and fled into sabeaea she was changed into the myrrhtree the story of which is in metamx but though the poets have subjoined fable to this fact it is related by pliny as a true history footnote pasipha was the daughter of the sun married to minos king of crete the poets feign that being in love with a bull she employed daedalus a famous artist to make her a wooden cow into which she conveyed herself in order to enjoy her monstrous desires from this unnatural coition sprung the minotaur a monster half man and half bull which was enclosed in a labyrinth and afterward destroyed by theseus footnote the original alludes to the cretans who were famous among the antients for the vice of lying footnote europa was the daughter of agenor king of cydon beloved by jupiter and by him run away with in the shape of a bull footnote aerope was the wife of atreus she committed adultery with her husbands brother thyestes by whom she had two sons whom atreus caused to be killed and served up to his brothers table to avoid this sight the sun is said to have gone backward footnote scylla the daughter of nisus king of the megarensians fell in love with minos while he was besieging her fathers city she stole away her fathers hair on which the fate of the city depended and carried it to minos for which fact she was rewarded by her lover with contempt only she is by some said to have been changed into a lark but ovid who here seems to confound two stories together makes her transformation to have been into a rock which lies between sicily and italy where the dashing of the waves against the rock representing the sound of the barking of dogs gave rise to the fable which is here hinted at footnote clytemnestra the wife of agamemnon who in the absence of her husband committed adultery with aegysthus and with him afterwards murdered agamemnon at his return from troy footnote cresa was the daughter of creon king of corinth and second wife to jason to whom medea enraged with jason who had forsaken her sent a casket in which wildfire was inclosed and by which she was burnt as soon as it was opened this medeaafterwards on account of the same anger with jason tore to pieces her two sons which she had bore to him footnote this phoenix having incensed his father by lying with a woman who was beloved by the latter fled to the protection of peleus the father of achilles and was by bim sic preceptor of that young hero footnote hippolytus being beloved by his stepmother phaedra and refusing to gratify her desires was by her falsely accused to his father theseus upon which account he was obliged to fly and the chariot horses being frighted by seacalves dashed the chariot topieces and him also footnote phineus king of arcadia having repudiated his wife cleopatra married harpalice by whose instigation he put out the eyes of his sons for which he was afterwards punished by divine vengeance with the loss of his own footnote the romans paid a religious regard to their birthday as appears from many passages in their poets at this time they used to receive presents from their relations and acquaintance we have here given the sense of the original only varying the customs kalendae martii ovid advises the lover to abstain from visiting his mistress in the kalends of march at which time the matronaliawere celebrated to juno lucina and the husbands used to pray to that goddess to protect the chastity of their wives horace likewise lib iii ode hints that this was not the proper season for batchelors to give a loose to their gaieties sive erit ornatus circus c a third caution ovid gives is not to visit on those days when the wealth of the roman conquests were exposed to the circus in admiring which as mycellus observes the girls were too much taken up to attend to the desires of their lovers to say the truth some custom seems to be alluded to here which is not sufficiently preserved from the ruins of antiquity footnote then the pleiades are at hand then the goat is merged in the sea viz in the month of october and november footnote the original points at the day in which the romanswere overthrown by the gauls on the banks of the river allia this was the th of the kalends of august a u c and it was marked as a black day in their kalendar as this nation is too happy to produce any such day we have been obliged to give it a different turn in our paraphrase footnote cydippe was a beautiful virgin of the island of delos she was celebrating the rites of diana when she was seen by acontius who falling in love with her and not daring openly to declare his passion contrived to drop an apple at her feet in which were inclosed these two lines i swear to you by the mystical rites of diana that i will attend you as a companion and become your bride cydippe took up the apple and read the lines by repeating which words they became her own and she was ignorantly betrothed to her lover for it was a law that whatever any persons said in dianas temple they were obliged to perform footnote ariadne was the daughter of minos king of crete she fell in love with theseus and with a clew of thread helped him out of the labyrinth into which he went to kill the minotaur he afterwards basely deserted the poor lady of which our poet will presently tell the story footnote silenus was the pedagogue of bacchus and his fosterfather he was likewise his companion on all occasions and is often introduced in his drunken mood by our poet footnote at this wedding eurytion the centaur getting drunk attempted to ravish hippodamia the bride of pyrithous but theseus knocked his brains out with a bowl upon this a battle ensued between the centaurs and the lapithae who defending the cause of their prince pyrithous destroyed almost all the centaurs horace lib i ode mentions this story likewise as a caution to men not to be quarrelsome in their cups footnote here and in many other places we have been obliged to supply that connection which is greatly wanting in the original footnote phoebe and ilaira were two pretty girls the daughters of leucippus and by their father betrothed to two brothers idas and lynceus but before the celebration of their nuptials were ravished by castor and pollux this ended in the death of castor by the hands of lynceus and of lynceus by pollux whose death while idas was attempting to revenge he was struck dead by thunder at the feet of pollux footnote orion the theban was in love with merope the daughter of aenopian but who this lyrice was is not so plain no mention being made of her in any other place footnote daphnis was
