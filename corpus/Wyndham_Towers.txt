 wyndham towers by thomas bailey aldrich to edwin booth my dear booth in offering these verses to you i beg you to treat them as you have many a time advised a certain lord chamberlain to treat the players not according to their desert use them after your own honor and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty these many years your friend and comrade t b aldrich note the motif of the story embodied in the following poem was crudely outlined in a brief sketch printed in an early collection of the authors verse and subsequently cancelled for a purpose not until now accomplished wyndham towers is not to be confused with this discarded sketch the text of which has furnished only a phrase or an indirect suggestion here and there that the writers method when recasting the poem was more or less influenced by the poets he had been studying chiefly the dramatists of the elizabethan era will he hopes be obvious it was part of his design however far he may have fallen from it to give his narrative something of the atmosphere and color of the period in which the action takes place though the story is supposed to be told at a later date wyndham towers before you reach the slender higharched bridge like to a heron with one foot in stream the hamlet breaks upon you through green boughs a square stone church within a place of graves upon the slope gray houses oddly grouped with plastered gables set with crossed oakbeams and roofs of yellow tile and purplish slate that is the falcon with the swinging sign and rustic bench an ancient hostelry those leaden lattices were hung on hinge in good queen besss time so old it is on ridgepiece gableend or dovecot vane a gilded weathercock at intervals glimmers an angel on the wing most like of local workmanship for since the reign of pious edward here have carvers thrived in saintsheads skillful and winged cherubim meet for rich abbeys from yon crumbling tower whose brickwork base the cunning romans laid and now of no use else except to train the ivy of an idle legend on you see such lens is this thin devon air if it so chance no fog comes rolling in the torridge where its branching crystal spreads to join the taw hard by from a chalk cliff a torrent leaps not lovelier sappho was giving herself all silvery to the sea from that leucadian rock beneath your feet lie sand and surf in curving parallels off shore a buoy gleams like a dolphins back dripping with brine and guards a sunken reef whose sharp incisors have gnawed many a keel there frets the sea and turns white at the lip and in illweather lets the ledge show fang a very pleasant nook in devon this upon the height of old was wyndham towers clinging to rock there like an eagles nest with moat and drawbridge once and good for siege four towers it had to front the diverse winds built god knows when all record being lost locked in the memories of forgotten men in caesars day a pagan temple next a monastery then a feudal hold later a manor and at last a ruin such knowledge have we of it vaguely caught through whispers fallen from traditions lip this shattered tower with crenellated top and loops for archers alone marks the spot looming forlornly a gigantic harp whereon the invisible fingers of the wind its fitful and mysterious dirges play here dwelt in the last tudors virgin reign one richard wyndham knight and gentleman the son of rawdon slain near calais wall when bloody mary lost her grip on france a lonely wight that no kith had nor kin save one a brother by illfortunes spite a brother since t were better to have none of late not often seen at wyndham towers where he in sooth but lenten welcome got when to that gate his errant footstep strayed yet held he dear those gray majestic walls timestained and crusted with the seas salt breath there first his eyes took color of the sea there did his heart stay when fate drove him thence and there at last but that we tell anon darrell they named him for an ancestor whose bones were whitening in holy land the other richard a crusader name yet it was darrell had the lionheart no love and little liking served this pair in look and word unpaired as white and black of once rich bough the last unlucky fruit the one for straightness like a norland pine set on some precipices perilous edge intrepid handsome little past blown youth of all pure thought and brave deed amorous moulded the courts high atmosphere to breathe yet liking well the camps more liberal air poet soldier courtier t was the mode the other as a glowworm to a star suspicious morbid passionate selfinvolved the soul half eaten out with solitude corroded like a swordblade left in sheath asleep and lost to action in a word a misanthrope a miser a soured man one fortune loved not and looked at askance yet he a pleasant outward semblance had say what you will and paint things as you may the devil is not black with horn and hoof as gossips picture him he is a person quite scrupulous of doublet and demeanor as was this master wyndham of the towers now latterly in most unhappy case because of matters to be here set forth a thing of not much moment as life goes a thing a man with some philosophy had idly brushed aside as t were a gnat that winged itself between him and the light had through the crooked working of his mind brought wyndham to a very grievous pass yet t was a grapestone choked anacreon and hushed his song there is no little thing in nature in a raindrops compass lie a planets elements this wyndhams woe was one griselda daughter to a man of bideford a shipman once but since turned soldier now in whitehaired wrinkled age sitting beneath the olive valiant still with sword on nail above the chimneyshelf in case the queen should need its edge again an officer he was though lowly born the man aforetime in the netherlands and through those everfamous french campaigns marry in what wars bore he not a hand in rawdon wyndhams troop of horse had served and when he fell that day by calais wall had from the frenchmens pikes his body snatched and so much saved of him which was not much the good knight being dead for this deeds sake that did enlarge itself in sorrows eye the widow deemed all guerdon all too small and held her dear lords servant and his girl born later when that clash of steel was done as her own kin till she herself was laid i the earth and sainted elsewhere the two sons let cool the friendship one in foreign parts did gold and honor seek at hall stayed one the heir and now of old friends negligent thus fortune hardens the ignoble heart griselda even as a little maid demure but with more crotchets in the brain i warrant ye than minutes to the hour had this one much misliked in her childthought confused him somehow with those cruel shapes of iron men that up there at the towers quickened her pulse for he was gaunt his face mature beyond the logic of his years had in it something sinister and grim like to the visage pregnant fancy saw behind the bars of each disused casque in that east chamber where the harness hung and dinted shields of wyndhams gone to grace at poitiers this one this at agincourt that other on the sands of palestine a breed of fierce manslayers sire and son of these seemed richard with his steel crossbow killing the doves in very wantonness the gentle doves that to the ramparts came for scattered crumbs undreamful of all ill each wellsent dart that stained a snowy breast straight to her own whitebudding bosom went fled were those summers now and she had passed out of the childworld of vain fantasy where many a rainbow castle lay in ruin but to her mind like winestain to a flask the old distrust still clung indelible holding her in her maidhoods serious prime well pleased from his cold eyes to move apart and in her humble fortunes dwell secure indeed what was she a poor soldiers girl merely a tenants daughter times were changed and lifes bright web had sadder colors in t that most sweet gentle lady rest her soul shrunk to an epitaph beside her lords and six lines shorter which was all a shame gaunt richard heir that other at earths end the younger son that was her sweetheart once fighting the spaniards getting slain perchance and all dear oldtime uses quite forgot slowly unnoted like the creeping rust that spreads insidious had estrangement come until at last one knew not how it fell and little cared if sober truth were said she and the father no more climbed the hill to twelfth night festival or mayday dance nor commerce had with any at the towers yet in a formless misty sort of way the girl had place in wyndhams mind the girl why yes beshrew him it was even she whom his soft mother had made favorite of and wellnigh spoiled some dozen summers gone perhaps because dull custom made her tame or that she was not comely in the bud her sweetness halting like a tardy may that wraps itself in mist and seems not fair for this or finer reason undivined his thought she touched not and was glad withal when she did note how others took his eye and wore rue after thus was her white peace undarkened till it so befell these two meeting as they a hundred times had met on hillpath or at crossing of the weir her beauty broke on him like some rare flower that was not yesterday evn so the spring unclasps the girdle of its loveliness abruptly in the north here long the drifts linger in hollows long on bough and briar no slight leaf ventures lest the frosts keen tooth nip it and then all suddenly the earth is nought but scent and bloom so unto him griseldas grace unclosed where lagged his wit that guessed not of the bud that slept in stem nor hint had of the flower within the bud if so much beauty had a tiger been t had eaten him in all the wavewashed length of rocky devon where was found her like for excellence of wedded red and white here on that smooth and sunny field her cheek the hostile hues of lancaster and york did meet and blending make a heavenly truce this were indeed a rose a king might wear upon his bosom by st dunstan now himself would wear it then by seeming chance crossed he her walks and stayed her with discourse devised adroitly spoke of common things at first of days when his good mother lived if t were to live to pass long dolorous hours before his fathers effigy in church of one who then used often come to hall ever at yuletide when the great log flamed in chimneyplace and laugh and jest went round and maidens strayed beneath the mistletoe making believe not see it so got kissed of one that joined not in the morricedance but in her seagreen kirtle stood at gaze a timid little creature that was scared by dead mens armor nought there suffered change those empty shells of valor grew not old though something rusty would they fright her now looked she upon them held she in her mind t was spring and loud the mavis piped outside the day the turkish helmet slipped from peg and clashing on the floor congealed her blood and sent both hands to terrorsmitten eyes she trembling ready to yield up the ghost right merry was it finally he touched on matters nearer things she had foreboded and this one time must needs lend hearing to and end so sorry business ere woe came like a true maid and honest as she was so tutoring the tremble on her lip and holding back hot tears she gave reply with such discretion as straight tied his tongue albeit he lacked not boldness in discourse indeed indeed sir you speak but in jest lightly not meaning it in courtierway i have heard said that ladies at the court i judge them not have most forgiving ears and list right willingly to idle words listen and smile and never stain a cheek yet not such words your fathers son should use with me my fathers daughter you forget what should most precious be to memorys heart love that dared death and so farewell farewell it was in sooth for after that one time though he had fain with passionbreathed vows besieged that marble citadel her breast he got no speech of her she chose her walks let only moon and star look on the face that could well risk the candor of the sun ran not to lattice at each sound of hoof by stream or hedgerow plucked no pansies more mistrusting proserpinas cruel fate herself upgathered in sicilian fields at chapel for one needs to chapel go asunday glanced not either right or left but with black eyelash wedded to white cheek knelt there impassive like the marble girl that at the footend of his fathers tomb inside the chancel where the wyndhams lay through the long years her icy vigil kept as leaves turn into flame at the frosts touch so richards heart on coldness fed its fire and burned with surfeit of indifference all flavor and complexion of content went out of life what served once served no more his hound and falcon ceased to pleasure him he read some musty folios there were on shelf but even in brave froissarts page where god knows there be wounds enough no herb nor potion found he to purge sadness with the gray dust gathered on the leaf unturned and then the spider drew his thread across certain bright coins that he was used to count with thrill at fingers ends uncounted lay suddenly worthless like the conjurers gold that midst the jeers and laughter of the crowd turns into ashes in the rustics hand soft idleness itself bore now a thorn twopronged with meditation and desire the cold griselda that would none of him the fair griselda not alone by day with this most solid earth beneath his feet but in the weird and unsubstantial sphere of slumber did her beauty hold him thrall herself of late he saw not t was a wraith he worshipped a vain shadow thus he pined from dawn to dusk and then from dusk to dawn of that miraculous infection caught from anycolored eyes so they be sweet strange that a man should let a maids slim foot stamp on his happiness and quench it quite with what snailpace the traitor time creeps by when one is out with fortune and undone how tauntingly upon the dials plate the shadows finger points the dismal hour thus wyndham with hands clasped behind his back watching the languid and reluctant sun fade from the metal disk beside the door the hours hung heavy up there on the hill where life was little various at best and merriment had long since taen its flight sometimes he sat and conned the flying clouds till on dusks bosom nestled her one star and spoke no word nor seemed alive at all but a mere shape and counterfeit of life or urged by some swift hunger for green boughs would bid the hound to heel and disappear into the forest with himself communing for lack of gossip so do lonely men make themselves tedious to their tedious selves thus passed he once in a white blaze of noon under his oaks and muttered as he went my fathers daughter and your fathers son faith but it was a shrewd and nimble phrase and left me with no fitting word at tongue the wench hath wit and matter of her own and beauty that doth seldom mate with wit nature hath painted her a proper brown a russetcolored wench that knows her worth and mincing too should have her ruff propt up with supertasses like a dame at court and go in clothofgold ill get a suit of genoa velvet and so take her eye has she a heart the ladies of whitehall are not so skittish else does darrell lie most villainously often hath he said the art of blushing s a lost art at court if so good riddance this one here lets love play beggar to her prudery and starve feeding him ever on looks turned aside to be so young so fair and wise withal lets love starve nay i think starves merely me for when was ever woman logical both day and nighttime not since adam fell i doubt a lover somewhere what shrewd bee hath buzzed betimes about this clovertop belike some scriveners clerk at bideford with long goosequill and inkhorn at his thigh methinks i see the parchment face of him or one of those swashbuckler devon lads that haunt the inn there with red spanish gold rank scurvy knaves ripe fruit for gallowstree or else the sextons son here wyndham laughed though not a man of mirth indeed a man of niggard humor but that sextons son lean as the shadow cast by a church spire eyes deep in the sockets noseless high cheekboned like nothing in the circle of this earth but a deathshead that from a mural slab within the chancel leers through sermontime making a mock of poor mortality the fancy touched him and he laughed a laugh that from his noonday slumber roused an owl snug in his oaken hermitage hard by a very rare conceit the sextons son not he forsooth he smacked of churchyard mould and musty odors of motheaten palls a living death a walking epitaph no lover that for tingling flesh and blood to rest soft cheek on and change kisses with yet lover somewhere from his sly cocoon time would unshell him in the interim what was to do but wait and mark who strolled of evenings up the hillpath and made halt this side the coppice at a certain gate for by that chance which ever serves ill ends within the slanted shadow of the towers the maid griselda dwelt her gray scarred sire had for cloth doublet changed the steel cuirass the sword for gardeners fork and so henceforth in the mild autumn and sundown of life moving erect among his curves and squares of lily rose and purple flowerdeluce set none but harmless squadrons in the field save now and then at tavern where he posed tankard in hand and prattling of old days a whitemustached epitome of wars how runs the proverb touching him who waits who waits shall have the world times heir is he be he but patient thus the thing befell wherefrom grew all this history of woe haunting the grounds one night as his use was who loved the dark as bats and owlets do wyndham got sound of voices in the air that did such strange and goblin changes ring as left him doubtful whence the murmurs came now here now there as they were winged things such trick plays echo upon hapless wight chancecaught in lonely places where she dwells anon a laugh rang out melodious like the merles note when its ecstatic heart is packed with summertime then all was still so still the soul of silence seemed to grieve the loss of that sweet laughter in his tracks the man stopped short and listened as he leaned and craned his neck and peered into the gloom and would the fabulous hundred eyes were his that argus in the grecian legend had he saw two figures moving through a drift of moonlight that lay stretched across the lawn a mans tall shape a slim shape close at side her palm in tender fashion pressed to his the woven snood about her shoulders fallen and from the sombre midnight of her hair an ardent face outlooking like a star as in a vision saw he this for straight they vanished where those silvery shadows were was nothing had he dreamed it had he gone mad with much thinking on her and so made ghosts of his own sick fancies like a man carved out of alabaster and set up within a woodland he stood rooted there glimmering wanly under pendent boughs spellbound he stood in very woeful plight bewildered and then presently with shock of rapid pulses hammering at heart as mad besiegers hammer at a gate to life came back and turned on heel to fly from that accursed spot and all that was when once more the girls laugh made rich the night and melted and the silence grieved anew like lead his feet were and he needs must halt close upon this but further off a voice from somewhere echo at her trick again took up the rhyme of sweetheart sigh no more it was with doubt and trembling i whispered in her ear go take her answer birdonbough that all the world may hear sweetheart sigh no more sing it sing it tawny throat upon the wayside tree how fair she is how true she is how dear she is to me sweetheart sigh no more sing it sing it tawny throat and through the summer long the winds among the clovertops and brooks for all their silvery stops shall envy you the song sweetheart sigh no more t is said the malays have an arrow steeped in some strange drug whose subtile properties are such that if the point but prick the skin death stays there like to that fell cruel shaft this slender rhyme was through the purple dark straight home it sped and into wyndhams veins its drop of sudden poison did distill now no sound was save when a dry twig snapped and rustled softly down from branch to branch or on its pebbly shoals the meagre brook made intermittent murmur so t is he thus wyndham breathing thickly with his eyes dilating in the darkness darrell he i set my springe for other game than this of hare or rabbit dreamed i not of wolf his frequent visitations have of late perplexed me now the riddle reads itself a proper man a very proper man a fellow that burns trinidado leaf and sends smoke through his nostril like a flue a fop a hangeron of willing skirts a murrain on him would elizabeth in some mad freak had clapped him in the tower ay through the traitors gate would he were dead within the year what worthy men have died persons of substance civic ornaments and here s this gilt courtbutterfly on wing o thou most potent lightning in the cloud prick me this fellow from the face of earth i would the moors had got him in algiers what time he harried them on land and sea and done their will with scimitar or cord or flame of fagot and so made an end or that some shot from petronel or bow had winged him in the folly of his flight well had it been if the inquisitors with rack and screw had laid black claw on him in days whose chronicle is writ in blood the richest ever flowed in english veins some foul mischance in this sort might have been for at dark fortunes feet had darrell flung in his youths flower a daring gauntlet down a beardless stripling at that solemn hour when breaking its frail filaments of clay the mothers spirit soared invisible the younger son unhoused as well he knew had taken horse by night to london town with right sore heart and nought else in his scrip but boyish hope to footing find at court a pages place belike with some great lord or some small lord that other proving shy of merit that had not yet clipt its shell day after day in weather foul or fair with lackeys hucksters and the commoner sort at whitehall and westminster he stood guard reading mens faces with most anxious eye there the lords swarmed some waspish and some bland but none would pause at plucking of the sleeve to hearken to him and the lad had died on london stones for lack of crust to gnaw but that he caught the ages malady the something magical that was in air and made men poets heroes demigods made shakespeare rawleigh grenvile oxenham and set them stars in the forefront of time in fine young darrell drew of that same air a valiant breath and shipped with francis drake of tavistock to sail the spanish seas and teach the heathen manners with gods aid and so among lean papists and black moors he with the din of battle in his ears struck fortune who would tamely bide at home at beck and call of some proud swollen lord not worth his biscuit or at beautys feet sit making sonnets when was work to do out yonder sinking philips caravels at sea and then by way of episode setting quick torch to piratenests ashore sir francis drake called this singeing the king of spaynes beard brave sport to singe the beard o the king of spain brave sport but in the end dreamed he of home of where the troutbrook lisped among the reeds of great chalk cliffs and leagues of yellow gorse of peaceful lanes of londons roaring streets the crowds the shops the pageants in cheapside and heard the trumpets blaring for the queen when t was the wind that whistled in the shrouds off cadiz ah and softer dreams he had of an unnamed and sweetest mystery and from the marble of his souls desire hewed out the white ideal of his love a new pygmalion all things drew him home this mainly foot on english earth once more dear earth of england his propitious fame a thorn in none but crooked envys side he went crossgartered with a silken rose at golden lovelock diamond brooch at hat looping one side up very gallantly and changed his doublets color twice a day ill fare had given his softer senses edge good fortune later bade him come to dine mild spensers scholar philip sidneys friend so took he now his ease in devonshire when town was dull or he had need at heart for sight of wyndham towers against the sky but chiefly did he bask him by the thames for there t was that young england froze and thawed by turns in glorianas frown and smile as some wild animal that gets a wound and prescience hath of death will drag itself back to its cavern sullenly to die and would not have heavens airs for witnesses so wyndham shrinking from the very stars and telltale places where the moonlight fell crept through the huddled shadows back to hall and in a lonely room where no light was save what the moon made at the casement there sat pondering his hurt and in the dark gave audience to a host of grievances for never comes reflection gay or grave but it brings with it comrades of its hue so did he fall to thinking how his day declined and how his narrow life had run obscurely through an age of great events such as men never saw nor will again until the globe be riven by gods fire others had ventured for the golden fleece knaves of no parts at all and got renown by force of circumstance and not desert while he up there on that rockbastioned coast had rotted like some old hulks skeleton whose naked and bleached ribs the lazy tide laps day by day and no man thinks of more then was jade fortune in her lavish mood why had he not for distant colchis sailed and been the jason of these argonauts true some had come to block on tower hill or quittance made in a less noble sort still they had lived from lifes highmantling cup had blown the bead in such case if ones head be of its momentary laurel stripped and made a show of stuck on temple bar or at the southwark end of london bridge what mattered it at worst man dies but once so far as known one may not master death but life should be ones lackey he had been times dupe and bondsman ever since his birth had walked this planet with his eye oblique grasped what was worthless what were most dear missed missed love and fame and all the sum of things fame gets a man in england the queens smile which means when she s in humor abbeylands appointments stars and ribbons for the breast and that sleek adulation that takes shape i the downdrooping of obsequious lids when one ascends a stair or walks the pave good lord but it was excellent to see how expectation in the anteroom crooks back to greatness passing to the queen kind sir sweet sir i prithee speed my suit t was somewhat to be flattered though by fools for even a fools coin hath a kind of ring yet after all thus did the grapes turn sour to master fox in fable who would care to moil and toil to gain a little fame and have each rascal that prowls under heaven stab one for getting it had he wished power the thing was in the marketplace for sale at stated rates so much for a mans soul his was a haughty spirit that bent not and one to rise had need to cringe and creep so had his brother into favor crawled like slug into the bosom of a rose and battened in the sun at thought of him forgotten for a moment wyndham winced and felt his wound why bides he not in town with his blond lovelock and wenchluring ways there runs his fox what foul fiend sends him here to wyndham towers is there not space enough in this our england he needs crowd me so has london sack upon his palate staled that he must come to sip my devon cream are all maids shut in nunneries save this one what magic philtre hath he given her to thaw the ice that melted not for me rich is he now that at his setting forth had not two silver pieces to his purse it is his brave apparel dazzles her thus puts he bound and barrier to my love another man were he abused as i ill have no more of him if i but dared nay i dare not i have fawns blood i think i would and dare not thrice the hooded clock solemnly like some old carthusian monk with meagre face half seen beneath his cowl intoned the quarter memory went not back when this was not a most familiar sound yet as each stroke on the dead silence fell wyndham turned startled now the sanguine moon to clouded opal changing momently rose sheer above the pinetrees ragged edge and through the wideflung casement reaching hand with cold and spectral finger touched the plates of his dead fathers armor till it gleamed one mass of silver there it stood complete that august panoply which once struck dread to foemen on the sunny plains of france menacing terrible this instant stood with vizard down and joustinglance at charge as if that crumbled knight were quick within a footfall on the shingle walk below grated a footfall light as mercurys disdaining earth and wyndham in the dark half crouched upon the settle with his nails indenting the soft woodwork held his breath then suddenly a blind rage like a flame swept over him and hurled him to his feet such rage as must have seized the soul of cain meeting his brother in the stubblefield anon came one that hummed a blithe seasong as he were fresh from tavern and brave cheer and held the stars that blinked there in the blue boon comrades singing in highhearted way his trueloves kiss a memory on his lip straight on he came to unrenowned end whose dream had been in good chainmail to die on some wellfoughten field at set of sun with glorious peal of trumpets on his ear proclaiming victory so had he dreamed and there within an arch at the stairtop and screened behind a painted hangingcloth of coiled gold serpents ready to make spring ignoble death stood his convulsive hand grasping a rapier partway down the blade to deal the blow with deadlyjewelled hilt black death turned white with horror of himself straight on came he that sang the blithe seasong and now his step was on the stair and now he neared the blazoned hangingcloth and now the lights were out and all life lay in trance on floor or pallet blanketed to chin each in his mask of sullenseeming death fond souls that recked not what was in the air else had the dead mans scabbard as it clashed against the balustrade then on the tiles brought awkward witness one base hind there was had stolen a venisonpasty on the shelf and now did penance him the fall half roused from dreadful nightmare once he turned and gasped then straightway snored again no other sound within the dreamenchanted house was heard save that the mastiff lying at the gate with visionary bone snarled in his sleep secret as bridalkiss may murder be done was the deed that could not be undone throughout eternity o silent tongue that would blab all with silence what to do how hide this speechless witness from mens gaze living that body vexed us being dead t is like to give us trouble and to spare o for a cavern in deepbowelled earth quick ere the dusky petals of the night unclosing bare the fiery heart of dawn and thus undo us with its garish light let us this mute and pale accusing clay in some undreamedof sepulchre bestow but where hold back thy fleetwingd coursers time whilst we bethink us ah such place there is close too at hand a place wherein a man might lie till doomsday safer from the touch of prying clown than is the spiced dust of an egyptian in his pyramid at a dark alcoves end of that long hall the ancient armorroom in the east wing a certain door whereof no mortal knew save wyndham now that other lay acold was to the panels of the wall so set and with such devilish shrewdness overlaid by carvings of wildflower and curled grapeleaf that one not in the favor of the trick albeit he knew such mechanism was ere he put finger on the secret spring had need of job for ancestor in faith you pressed a rose a least suspected rose and two doors turned on hinge the inner door closing a space of say some six feet square unlighted sheathed with iron doubtless here the mediaeval wyndhams hid their plate when things looked wicked from the outer wall or on occasion a grim ruthless lord immured some inconvenient twofaced friend to banquet bidden and kept over night such pranks were played in merrie england then sealed in the narrow compass of that cell shut from gods light and his most precious air a man might have of life a halfhours lease if he were hale and wellbreathed at the start hither did richard bear his brothers corse and fling it down upon the stonepaved floor in a thin strip of moonlight flung it down and then drew breath perhaps he paused to glance at the white face there with the strange halfsmile outliving death the brightness of the hair lying in loops and tangles round the brow a seraphs face of silver set in gold such as the deft italians know to carve perhaps his tigers blood cooled then perhaps swift pity at his very heartstrings tugged and he in that black moment of remorse seeing how there his nobler self lay slain had bartered all this jewelstudded earth to win lifes color back to that wan cheek ah let us hope it and some mercy feel since each at compt shall need of mercy have now how it happened whether t was the wind or whether t was some incorporeal hand that reached down through the dark and did the thing man knoweth not but suddenly both doors ere one could utter cry or put forth arm closed with dull clang and there in his own trap incontinent was redstained richard caught and as by flash of lightning saw his doom call an thou wilt but every ear is stuffed with slumber shriek and run quick frenzied hands along the iron sheathing of thy grave for t is thy grave no egress shalt thou find no lock to break no subtilesliding bolt no careless rivet no half loosened plate for daggers point to fret at and pry off and let a stifling mortal get to air angels of light what were a thousand years of rankling envy and contemned love and all the bitter draughts a man may drink to that half hour of richards with his dead through silence gloom and starstrown paths of night the breathless hours like phantoms stole away black lay the earth in primal blackness wrapt ere the great miracle once more was wrought a chill wind freshened in the pallid east and brought seasmell of newly blossomed foam and stirred the leaves and branchhung nests of birds fainter the glowworms lantern glimmered now in the marsh land and on the forests hem and the slow dawn with purple laced the sky where sky and sea lay sharply edge to edge the purple melted changed to violet and that to every delicate seashell tinge blushpink deep cinnabar then no change was save that the air had in it sense of wings till suddenly the heavens were all aflame and it was morning o great miracle o radiance and splendor of the throne daily vouchsafed to us yet saith the fool there is no god and now a level gleam thrust like a spearhead through the tangled boughs smote wyndhams turrets and the spell was broke and one by one on pallet stretched or floor the sleepers wakened each took up afresh his load of life but two there were woke not nor knew t was daybreak from the rusty nail the gateman snatched his bunch of ancient keys and yawning vowed the sun an hour too soon the scullion with face shining like his pans hose down at heel and jerkin half unlaced on hearthstone knelt to coax the smouldering log the keeper fetched the yelping hounds their meat the hostler whistled in the stalls anon with rustling skirt and slumberfreshened cheek the kerchiefd housemaid tripped from room to room sweet gillian she that broke the groom his heart while wroth within behind a highbacked chair the withered butler for his master waited cursing the cook that day the brewis spoiled that day came neither kinsman to break bread when it was seen that both had lain abroad the wolfskins of their couches made that plain as pikestaff or the mole on gillians cheek the servants stared some journey called them hence at dead of night some messenger had come of secret import may be from the queen and they paused not for change of raiment even and yet in faith that were but little like sir richard had scant dealings with the court still if northumberland were in arms again t was passing strange no beast had gone from rack how had they gone then who looked on them last up rose the withered butler he it was they supped together of no journey spoke spoke little t was their custom after meal the masters brother sallied forth alone the master stayed within that did he not quoth one i saw sir richard in the close i the moonrise t was eleven on the stroke said gillian softly he or t was his ghost methought his face was whiter than my smock passed through the courtyard and so into house yet slept he not there and that other one the guest unwelcome kinsman little loved how these shrewd varlets turn us inside out at kitchenconclaves over our own wine him had no eye seen since he issued forth as curfew sounded call me lying knave he of the venisonpasty had the word and let me nevermore dip beak in ale or sit at trencher with good smoking meat if i heard not in middle of the night the cock crow thrice and took it for a sign so marry t was that thou wert drunk again but no one laughed save he that made the jest which often happens the long hours wore on and gloaming fell then came another day and then another until seven dawns in times slow crucible ran ruddy gold and overflowed the gray horizons edge and yet no hosts at table an ill thing and now t was on the eve of michaelmas what could it mean from out their lethargy at last awaking searchers in hot haste some in the saddle some afoot with hounds scoured moor and woodland dragged the neighboring weirs and salmonstreams and watched the wily hawk slip from his azure ambush overhead with ever a keen eye for carrion but no man found nor aught that once was man by land they went not went they waterways might be from bideford or ilfracombe mayhap they were in london who could tell god help us do men melt into the air yet one there was whose dumb unlanguaged love had all revealed had they but given heed across the threshold of the armorroom the savage mastiff stretched himself and starved now where lags he upon what alehouse bench twixt here and london who shall lift this weight were he not slain upon the queens highway ere he reached town or tumbled into ford with too much sackandsugar under belt then was his face set homeward this same hour why lingers he ill news t is said flies fast and good news creeps then his must needs be good that lets the tortoise pass him on the road ride dawkins ride by flashing tarn and fen and haunted hollow look not where in chains on hounslow heath the malefactor hangs a lasting terror give thy roan jade spur and spare her not all devon waits for thee thou for the moment most important man a sevennight later when the rider sent to town drew rein before the falcon inn under the creaking of the windy sign and slipped from saddle with most valorous call for beer to wash his throat out then confessed he brought no scrap of any honest news the last hope died and so the quest was done they fard afoot quoth one but where god wot the blackthorn bloomed anew and the long grass was starred with flowers that once griselda prized but plucked not she poor wench from moon to moon waxed pale and paler of no known disease the villageleech averred with lips pursed out and cane at chin some inward fire he thought consumed a dark inexplicable blight had touched her thinned her till of that sweet earth scarce more was left than would have served to grow a lily later at a freshturned grave from out the maiden strewments as it were a whisper rose of most pathetic breath of how one maid had been by two men loved no names gods mercy and that neither man would wed her why conjecture faltered there for whiter was she than newdrifted snow or bleached lambs wool or any purest thing such stuff in sooth as heaven shapes angels of and how from their warm comfortable beds these two men wandered out into the night sore stricken and distempered in their mind and being by satan blinded and urged on did fling them headlong from a certain crag that up clovelly way oerhangs the sea oerhangs the sea to tempt unhappy folk from door to door the piteous legend passed and like a thrifty beggar took from each and when the long autumnal season came to that bleak bitter coast and when at night the deep was shaken and the pent cloud broke crashing among the lurid hills of heaven and in brief sudden swoonings of the gale contentious voices rose from the sanddunes then to low sobs and murmurs died away the fishwives with their lean and sallow cheeks lit by the flickering driftwoods ruddy glow drew closer to the crane and under breath to awestruck maidens told the fearful tale the red leaf withered and the green leaf grew t was said that once the queen reached out her hand this was at richmond in her palace there and let it rest on burleighs velvet sleeve and spoke right stately was she in her rouge prithee good master cecil tell us now was t ever known what ill befell those men those wyndhams were they never never found look you t will be three years come michaelmas t were well to have at least the bones of them fore god sir this is something should be seen when the armada which god smote and sunk threatened our realm our buckler and our shield were such stout hearts as that young wyndham was the elder brother well heaven fashioned him our subjects are our subjects mark you that not found forsooth why then they should be found fain had my good lord burleigh solved the thing and smoothed that ominous wrinkle on the brow of her most sweet imperious majesty full many a problem his statecraft had solved how strangle treason how soothe turbulent peers how foil the pope and spain how pay the fleet mere temporal matters but this business smelt strongly of brimstone bring back vanished folk that could not master cecil an he would the red leaf withered and the green leaf grew dark were the days that came to wyndham towers with that grim secret rusting in its heart on the seas side along the fissured wall the lichen spread in patches of dull gold up to the battlements at times assailed by sheeted ghosts of mist blown from the sea now by the whistling arrows of the sleet pelted and thrice of lightning scorched and seamed but stoutly held from dreary year to year by legions of most venerable rooks shrill blackrobed prelates of the fighting sort in the wide moat run dry with summer droughts great scarlet poppies lay in drifts and heaps like bodies falln there in some vain assault within decay and dolor had their court dolor decay and silence lords of all from room to room the wind went shuddering on some vague endless quest now pausing here to lift an arras and then hurrying on to some fresh clue belike the sharpnosed mouse through joist and floor discreetly gnawed her way and for her glossy young a lodging made in a cracked corselet that once held a heart the meditative spider undisturbed wove his gray tapestry from sill to sill over the transom the stone eagle drooped with one wing gone in most dejected state moulting his feathers a blue poisonous vine whose lucent berry hard as indian jade no squirrel tried his tooth on june by june on the south hillslope festered in the sun mans foot came not there it was haunted ground the red leaf withered and the green leaf grew an oak stood where an acorn tumbled once ages ago and all the world was strange now in that year king charles the second left forever the soft arms of mistress gwynn and wrapt him in that marble where he lies the moulderd pile with its entombed crime passed to the keep of a brave newfledged lord who liking much the sane and wholesome air that bent the boughs and fanned the turrets top cried here dwell i so fell it on a day the stroke of mallets and the screech of saws in those bleak chambers made such din as stopped the careful spider halfway up his thread and panic sent to myriad furtive things that dwelt in wainscots and loved not the sun vainly in broken phalanx clamorous did the scared rooks protest and all in vain the moths on indolent white damask wings at door and casement rallied wyndham towers should have a bride and ghosts had word to quit and now behold what strange thing came to pass a certain workman in the eastern wing plying his craft alone as the day waned one gregory nokes a very honest soul by trade woodcarver stumbled on a door leading to nowhere at an alcoves end a double door that of itself swung back in such strange way as no man ever saw and there within a closet on the flags were two grim shapes which vaguely seen at first in the half light grew presently distinct two gnomes or vampires seemed they or dire imps straight from the pit in guise fantastical of hose and doublet one stretched out full length supine and one in terrorstricken sort half toppled forward on the bended knee grasping with viselike grip the others wrist as who should say arouse thee sleep no more but said it not if they were quick or dead no sign they gave beyond this sad dumb show blurred one face was yet luminous like the moon caught in the fleecy network of a cloud or seen glassed on the surface of a tarn when the wind crinkles it and makes all dim the other drawn and wrenched by mortal throes and in the aspect such beseeching look as might befall some poor wretch called to compt on the sudden even as he kneels at prayer with mercy turned to frost upon the lip thus much saw nokes within the closet there ere he drew breath then backing step by step the chisel clutched in still uplifted hand his eyes still fixed upon the ghosts he reached an open window giving on the court where the stonecutters were to them he called softly in whispers under his curved palm lest peradventure a loud word should rouse the phantoms but ere foot could climb the stair or the hearts pulses count the sum of ten through both dread shapes as at gods fingertouch a shiver ran the wavering outlines broke and suddenly a chill and mistlike breath touched nokess cheek as he at casement leaned and nought was left of that most piteous pair save two long rapiers of some foreign make lying there crossed a mass of flaky rust o luckless carver of dead images saintshead or gargoyle thou hast seen a sight shall last thee to the confines of the grave ill were thy stars or ever thou wert born that thou shouldst look upon a thing forbid now in thine eye shall it forever live and the waste solitudes of night inhabit with direful shadows of the nether world yet leave thee lonely in the throng of men not of them thou but creature set apart under a ban and doomed henceforth to know the wise mans scorn the dull mans sorry jest for who could credence give to that mad tale of churchyard folk appearing in broad day and drifting out at casement like a mist marry not they who crowded up the stair in haste and peered into that empty cell and had half mind to buffet master nokes standing with finger laid across his palm in argumentative appealing way distraught of countenance most woebegone see the two swords as i m a christian soul odds man cried one thou st been adreamin man cleave to thy beer an let strong drink alone so runs the legend so from their long sleep those ghosts arose and fled into the night but never bride came to that dark abode for wild flames swept it ere a month was gone and nothing spared but that forlorn old tower whereon the invisible fingers of the wind its fitful and mysterious dirges play
