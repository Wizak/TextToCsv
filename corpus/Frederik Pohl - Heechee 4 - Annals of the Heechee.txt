 on wrinkle rock it isnt easy to begin i thought of a whole bunch of different ways to do it like cute you dont know about me without you have read some books that was made by mr fred pohi he told the truth mainly there was things which he stretched but mainly he told the truth but my friendly dataretrieval program albert einstein says im too prone to obscure literary references anyway so the huckleberry finn gambit was out and i thought of starting with a searing expression of the soulsearching cosmic angst thats always so much a part of my normal conversation to be immortal and yet dead to be almost omniscient and nearly omnipotent and yet no more real than the phosphor flicker on a screenthats how i exist when people ask what i do with my time i give them an honest answer i tell them that i study i play i plan i work indeed that is all true i do all these things but during and between them i do one other thing i hurt or i could just start with a typical day like they do in the pv interviews a candid look at one moment in the life of the celebrated robinette broadhead titan of finance political powerhouse maker and shaker of events on all the myriad worlds maybe including a glimpse of me wheeling and dealingfor example a tablepounding conference with the brass hats at the joint assassin watch or better still a session at the robinette broadhead institute for extrasolar research i stepped up to the podium in a storm of serious applause smiling i raised my arms to quell it ladies and gentlemen i said i thank each of you for making time in your busy schedules to join us here you are a distinguished group of astrophysicists and cosmologists famed theorists and nobel laureates and i welcome you to the institute i declare this workshop on the fine physical structure of the early universe to be in session i really do say that kind of thing or at least i send down a doppel to do it and my doppel does i have to its expected of me im not a scientist but through my institute i supply the cash that pays the bills that lets science get done so they want me to show up to greet them at the opening sessions then they want me to go away so they can work and i do anyway i could not decide which of those tracks to begin on and so i wont use any of them theyre all characteristic enough though i admit it sometimes im a little too cute sometimes maybe even often i am unattractively burdened with my own interior pain which never seems to go away often im just a touch pompous but at the same time honestly i am frequently quite effective in ways that matter a lot the place where im actually going to start is with the party on wrinkle rock please bear with me you have to put up with me only for a little while and i have to do it always i would go almost anywhere for a really good party why not its easy enough for me and some parties happen only once i even flew my own spaceship there that was easy too and didnt really take any time from the eighteen or twenty other things i was doing at the time even before we got there i could feel the beginning of that nice party tingle because they had the old asteroid dressed up for the occasion left to itself wrinide rock wasnt much to look at it was patchy black spotted with blue ten kilometers long it was shaped more or less like a badly planned pear that the birds had been pecking at of course those pockmarks werent from pecking birds they were landing sockets for ships like ours and just for the party the rock had been prettied up with big twinidy starburst letters our galaxy the first years are the hardest revolving around the rock like a belt of trained fireflies the first part of what it said wasnt diplomatic the second part wasnt true but it was pretty to look at anyway i said as much to my dear portable wife and she grunted comfortably settling herself in my arm is garish real lights could have used holograms essie i said turning my head to nibble her ear you have the soul of a cybernetician ho she said twisting around to nibble backonly she nibbled a lot harderam nothing but soul of cybernetician as are you dear robin and kindly pay attention to controls of ship instead of fooling around that was just a joke naturally we were right on course sliding into a dock with that agonizing slowness of all material objects i had hundreds of milliseconds to spare when i gave the true love its final nudge so i gave essie a kiss well i didnt exactly give her a kiss but let me leave it that way for now all right and she added are making a big deal of this you agree it is a big deal i told her and kissed her a little harder and since we had plenty of time she kissed me back we spent the long quarter of a second or so while true love drifted through the intangible glitter of the party sign in as pleasant and leisurely a fashion as one could wish thats to say we made love since i am no longer real since neither of us is still really meatone may ask how do you do that i have an answer for that question the answer is beautifully also layishly lovingly and above all expeditiously i dont mean we shirk our work i just mean that it doesnt take long to do it and so after we had pleased each other powerfully and lounged around for a while afterwards languidly and even showered sharingly we still had plenty of time out of that quarter of a second to study the other docking sockets on the rock we had some interesting company ahead of us i noted that one of the ships docked ahead of us was a big old originalheechee vessel the kind that we would have called a twenty if wed known that so huge a ship existed back in the old days we didnt just spend that time rubbernecking were sharedtime programs you know we can easily do a dozen things at once so i also kept in touch with albert to check on whether there were any new transmissions from the core and make sure there was nothing from the wheel and keep in touch with a dozen other interests of one kind or another while essie ran her own searchandmerge scans so by the time our locking ring mated with one of those birdpecked holes that were actually the berthing ports for the asteroid we were both in a pretty good mood and ready to party one of the advantages of being what dear portableessie and i are is that we didnt have to unfasten seat belts and check seals and open locks we dont have to do anything much we dont have to move our storage fans aroundthey stay right where they are and we go where we like through the electrical circuits of whatever kind of place we happen to be plugged into if we want to go farther than that we can go by radio but then were up against that tiresome lag in roundtrip communications so we docked we plugged in to wrinkle rocks systems we were there specifically we were on level tango bay fortysomething of the tired old asteroid and we were not by any means alone the party had begun the joint was jumping there were a dozen people gathered to greet uspeople like us i meanwearing party hats or holding party drinks singing laughing janie i shouted at one hugging her and sergei golubka essie cried hugging another and right then while we were in the first moment of greeting and hugging and being happy a nasty new voice snapped hey broadhead i knew the voice i even knew what would come next what bad manners flicker flash pop and there was general julio cassata looking at me with the controlled sneer of soldiertocivilian contempt across a broad bare desktop that hadnt been there a moment before i want to talk to you he said i said oh shit i didnt like general julio cassata i never had though we kept running into each others lives that wasnt because i wanted it that way cassata was always bad news he didnt like civilians messing in what he still called military affairs and he didnt much like machinestored people of any kind cassata was not only a soldier he was still meat only this time he wasnt meat he was a doppel that was an interesting fact in itself because meat people dont make doppels of themselves lightly i would have pursued that odd fact farther except that i was too busy thinking about all the things i didnt like about julio cassata his manners are lousy he had just demonstrated that there is an etiquette to the gigabit space that we machinestored people inhabit polite machinestored people dont just dump themselves on each other without warning they approach politely when they want to talk to you maybe they even knock on a door and wait outside politely until you say come in and they certainly do not impose their private surrounds on each other thats the kind of behavior that essie calls nekulturny meaning it stinks just what i would expect from julio cassata hed overridden the physical bay we were in and the gigabitspace simulation of it that we were jointly occupying there he was with his desk and his medals and his cigars and all and that was just plain rude of course i could have pushed all that out and got back to my own surround guys do that sort of thing when theyre stubborn its like two secretaries oneupping each other about whose boss gets put on the pvphone first i didnt choose to do that it wasnt because i have any hangup about being rude to rude people it was something else i had finally got around to wondering why the real or meat cassata had made a machine duplicate of himself what was before us was a machine simulation in gigabit space just as my own beloved portableessie was a doppel of my also beloved realessie the original meatcassata was no doubt chomping a real cigar several hundred thousand kilometers away on the jaws satellite when i figured out the implications of that i actually almost felt sorry for the doppel so i suppressed all the instinctive words that suggested themselves i only said what the hell do you want from me bullies respond well to being bullied he let a little of the fire go out of the steelyeyed glare he even smiledi think he meant it to be friendly his eyes slid from my face over to essie who had popped herself into cassatas surround to see what was going on and said in what could have been intended as a light tone now now mrs broadhead is that any way for old friends to talk to each other is very poor way for old friends to talk she said noncommittally i pressed what are you doing here cassata i came to the party he smiledoily smile fake smile he had very little to smile about considering when we came off maneuvers most of the old exprospectors got leave to come here for the reunion i hitched a ride i mean he explained as though of all people essie and i needed explaining to i doppeled myself and put the store on the ship that was coming here maneuvers essie sniffed maneuvers against what when foe come out are going to pull out sixshooters and fill skunks with holes like swiss cheese blamblamblam we have better than sixshooters on our cruisers these days mrs broadhead cassata said genially but i had had enough small talk i asked again what do you want cassata abandoned the smile and got back to his natural state of nasty nothing said cassata by that i mean nothing broadhead i want you to butt out he wasnt even trying to be genial anymore i kept my temper im not even butting in wrong youre butting in right now in your damn institute youve got workshops going on one in new jersey one in des moines one on assassin signatures one on early cosmology since those statements were perfectly true i only said the broadhead institute is in business to do that kind of thing thats our charter its what we founded it for and its why jaws gives me exofficio status so i have a right to sit in on jaws planning sessions well old buddy cassata said happily see youre wrong about that too you dont have a right you have that privilege sometimes a privilege isnt a right and im warning you not to put it on the line we dont want you getting in the way i really hate those guys sometimes now look cassata i began but essie stopped me before id even picked up speed boys boys cannot save this for another time came here to party not to fight cassata hesitated looking belligerent then he nodded slowly looking thoughtful well mrs broadhead he said thats not a bad idea it can keep a while after all i dont have to report back for five or six meat hours yet then he turned to me dont leave the rock he ordered and vanished essie and i looked at each other nekulturny she said wrinkling up her nose as though she still smelled his cigar what i said was worse than that and essie put her arm around me robin is pig that man forget him okay arent going to let him make you all gloopy and sour again please not a chance i said bravely party time ill race you to the blue hell it was actually one hell of a fine party i hadnt taken essie seriously when she asked if i thought the party was too much of a big deal i knew she didnt mean it essie had never been a prospector herself but every human being alive knew what this party was it was to celebrate nothing less than the centennial of the finding of the gateway asteroid and if there was ever a bigger deal in the history of the human race i dont know what it could have been there were two reasons why wrinide rock was chosen for the site of the hundredth anniversary party one was that basically the asteroid had been converted into an old folks home it was perfect for the geriatric cases when the treatment for atherosclerosis made the osteoporosis worse and the antitumor phages brought on mйniиres syndrome or alzheimers wrinide rock was the place to be old hearts didnt have to pump so hard old limbs didnt have to struggle to keep a hundred kilos of meat and bone erect the maximum gravity anywhere was about one percent of earthnormal totterers could trot and skip they could turn cartwheels if they wanted to they couldnt be caught by slow uncertain reflexes in front of a speeding car there werent any cars oh they could die of course but that didnt have to be fatal because wrinide rock had the very best personalitystorage facilities in the universe when the old meat carcass passed the point of repair the ancient put himself in the hands of the here after people and the next thing he knew he was seeing the world with unfiawed vision hearing the tiniest sound forgetting nothing learning fast he was bloody well rebornonly without the mess and nastiness of the first time lifemaybe i should say lifeas a machinestored intelligence was not the same as being in your own body but it wasnt bad in some ways it was better so say i and i ought to know you never saw a happier bunch of machinestored citizens than the folks who lived on wrinlde rock it really was a rock it was a lumpy old asteroid a few kilometers through more or less just like the million others that circle the sun between jupiter and mars or some other place wellnot just like this particular asteroid was pierced and drilled with tunnels from crust to crust no human being had drilled them we found it that way and that was the other reason why it was the best place to have the celebration for the hundredth anniversary of human interstellar ffight wrinkle rock you see was quite an unusual asteroid even a unique one originally it circled the sun in an orbit at right angles to the ecliptic that was the merely unusual part the unique part was that when it was found it had been stuffed full of ancient heechee spaceships not just one or two but lots of themnine hundred and twentyfour in fact ships that still workedwell that worked most of the time anyway especially if you didnt care where you were going we never knew where that would be at first we got in the ship and we fired er up and leaned back and waited and prayed sometimes we hit lucky more often we died most of the ones of us still around for the party were the ones who had been lucky but every successful voyage in a heechee ship taught us something and by and by we could go anywhere in the galaxy and even be pretty sure of arriving alive we even improved on the heechee technology in a few ways they used rockets to get from dirtside to low orbit we used lofstrom loops then the asteroid wasnt necessary anymore to the people running the spaceexploration program so they moved it into earth orbit first they were going to turn it into a museum then they decided to make it a home for survivors of the heechee trips thats when we began to call it wrinkle rock before that its name had been gateway now here we are going to come up against another communication problem because how do i say what essie and i did next the easy way is just to say we partied well we did that all right thats what you do at parties we flitted around in our disembodied way to greet and hug and trade catchup stones with our disembodied friendsnot that all our friends on the rock were disembodied but we didnt bother with the meat ones right away so for the next tens of thousands of milliseconds it was just one long succession of marty long time no see and oh robin look how young janie yeexing has made self and remember the way this place used to smelt it went on for a long time because after all this was a pretty big party well ill give you the numbers after about the first fifty big hugs and glad lies i took a moment to call up my faithful dataretrieval program albert einstein albert i said when he ambled in blinking at me amiably how many he sucked his pipe a moment then pointed the stem at me quite a lot im afraid there were all in all thirteen thousand eight hundred fortytwo gateway prospectors first to last some are of course irretrievably dead a number of others have chosen not to come or couldnt or perhaps are not here yet but my present count is that three thousand seven hundred twentysix are present about half of whom are machinestored there are also to be sure a number of guests of former prospectors as in the case of mrs broadhead not to mention a number of patients here for medical reasons unconnected with exploration thank you i said and then as he started to leave one more thing albert julio cassata it has been bugging me to try to figure out just why he is getting nasty about the institute workshops and especially why he is here at all id appreciate it if you could look into the matter but i already am doing that robin albert smiled ill report to you when i think i have some information meanwhile have a nice time i already am i said satisfied an albert einstein is a handy gadget to have around he takes care of things when im having fun so i went back to partying with an easy mind we didnt know all of the reuniting veterans but we knew an awful lot of them and thats what makes it a little hard to tell you exactly what we were doing because who wants to hear how many times one of us shrieked to one of them or one of them cried to one of us what a surprise how wonderful you look we zoomed through gigabit space all up and down and through the riddled quadrants and levels and tunnels of the old rock greeting this one and that one of our colleagues and machinestored peers we had drinks with sergei borbosnoy in the spindlesergei had been essies classmate in leningrad before taking off for gateway and eventually a mean lingering death from radiation exposure we spent a long time at a cocktail party in the gateway museum wandering with glasses in hand around the exhibits of artifacts from venus and peggys planet and bits and pieces of tools and fire pearls and prayerfan datastores from all over the galaxy we ran into janie yeexing who had been going with our friend audee walthers iii before he took off to visit the heechee in the core probably shed wanted to marry him i thought but the question no longer was relevant because janie had got herself killed trying to land a chopper in the middle of a winterweather humcane on a planet called persephone of all dumb things i said grinning at her an aircraft accident and then i had to apologize because nobody likes to hear that their death was dumb those were the stored souls like us the ones we could talk to easily and without intermediaries of course there were a lot of meat people we wanted to greet too but that was a whole other problem being a disembodied mind in gigabit space is not easily described in a way its like sex that is its something that you cant easily say what its like to someone who hasnt tried it i know this about sex because ive tried to describe the joys of making love to some rather odd peoplewell not exactly people but intelligencesnever mind who they were just yet and it takes a lot of work after many milliseconds of listening to my attempts at description and discussion and metaphorand a lot of incomprehensionwhat theyve said was something like oh yeah now i get it its like that other thing you dosneezingright when you know you have to and you cant do it only you have to and it gets to be more and more of an itch until you cant stand it if you dont sneeze and then you do and it feels good is that right and i say no thats wrong and give up its just as hard to tell what its like in gigabit space i can describe some of the sorts of things i do there though for instance when we were drinking with sergei borbosnoy in the spindle we werent really in the spindle a spindle did actually exist it was the central hollow in the gateway asteroid at one time the bar it containedit was called the blue hellhad been every prospectors favorite place for drinking and gambling and trying to get up enough courage to sign on for one of those terrifying often fatal and oneway rides in a heechee ship but the real spindle wasnt used for drinking anymore it had been converted into a sunlamped solarium for the feeblest cases among the geriatric inhabitants of wrinkle rock did that cause us any problems not a bit we just created our own simulated spindle complete with blue hell gambling casino and we sat there with sergei swilling down icy vodka and nibbling pretzels and smoked fish the simulation had tables bartenders pretty serving waitresses a threepiece band playing hits of half a century ago and a noisy celebrating party crowd it had in fact everything you would expect in a happy little gin mill except one thing reality none of it was real the whole scene including some of the partying people was nothing but a collection of simulations taken out of machine storage just as i am just as essie is in her portable formjust as sergei was you see we didnt have to be in the spindle real or otherwise when we sat down to have a drink we could have created any setting we liked we often did essie and i where want to dine essie would ask and id say oh i dont know lutece la tour dargent or no i know ive got a taste for fried chicken how about a picnic in front of the taj mahal and then our support systems would dutifully access the files marked taj mahal and chicken fried and there we would be of course neither the background nor the food and drinks would be realbut neither were we essie was a machinestored analog of my dear wife who was still alive somewhere or otherand still my wife too i was the stored remainder of me what was left after i died on the exciting occasion when we first met a living heechee sergei was stored sergei because hed died too and albert einstein well albert was something else entirely but we kept him with us because he was a hell of a lot of fun at a party and none of that made any difference the drinks hit just as hard the smoked fish was just as fat and salty the little bits of raw cruditйs were just as crisp and tasty and we never gained weight and we never had hangovers while meat people well meat people were a whole other thing there were plenty of meat people among the gateway veterans gathered to celebrate the rocks hundredth anniversary a lot of them were good friends a lot of the others were people i would have loved to have for friends because all us old prospectors have a lot in common the difficulty with meat people is trying to carry on a conversation with them im fasti operate in gigabit time theyre slow fortunately theres a way of dealing with the situation because otherwise trying to talk to one of those torpid tardy flesh and blood people would drive me right out of my mind when i was a kid in wyoming i used to admire the chess masters who hung around the parks pushing their greasy pieces over the oilsmeared boards some of them could play twenty games at once moving from board to board i marveled how could they keep track of twenty positions at once remembering every move when i could barely keep one in my head then i caught on they didnt remember anything at all they simply came to a board took in the position saw a strategy made a move and went on to the next they didnt have to remember anything their chessplaying minds were so quick that any one of them could take the whole picture in while his opponent was scratching his ear see thats the way it is with me and meat people i could not stand to carry on a conversation with a living person without doing at least three or four other things at the same time they stood like statues when i saw my old buddy frankie hereira he was licking his lips as he watched some other ancient codger struggling to open a bottle of champagne sam struthers was just coming out of the mens room his mouth opening to shout a greeting to some other live person in the hall i didnt speak to either i didnt even try i just set up an image of myself and started it in motion one for each of them then i went away i dont mean i actually went anywhere i just paid attention to other things i didnt have to stay around because the subroutines in my programs were perfectly capable of walking one of my doppels toward frankie and one toward sam and smiling and opening my mouth to speak when they noticed me by the time i had to make a decision on what it was i wanted to say i would be back there but that was the meat people fortunately for my boredom threshold there were lots of machinestored people as well some were very old friends some were people i knew because everybody knew them there was detweiler who had discovered the voodoo pigs and liao xiechen who was a terrorist until the heechee appeared and he changed sides he was the one who had exposed the entire gang of murderers and bombthrowers in the american space program there was even harriman who had actually seen a supernova explode and coasted long enough on the expanding wavefront to win a fivemilliondollar science award in the old days there was mangrove who wound up in a heechee station orbiting a neutron star and found out that the queer tiny maneuverable globes moored to the station were actually sample collectors and could be made to go down to the stars surface and bring back some eleven tons a chunk almost as large as a fingernailof neutronium mangrove ultimately died of the radiation dose he got bringing it home but that didnt keep him from joining us on wrinkle rock so i raced along the conduits of gateway quick as the lightning in the serried sky and greeted a hundred old friends and new sometimes portableessie was with me sometimes she was off on her own excursions of greeting faithful albert was never out of call but he never joined in the hugs and embraces either fact was he never showed himself except to me or when invited to nobody in that giggly steamy highschoolreunion newyearseve weddingreception atmosphere wanted to bother with a mere dataretrieval system even though he was about the very best friend i had ever had so when we were back in the spindle back drinldng with sergei borbosnoy and things got a little tedious for me i whispered albert essie gave me a look she knew what i was doing she didnt mind she just went on rattling along in russian to sergei there wasnt anything wrong in that because of course i understand russianspeak it fluently along with a bunch of other languages because after all ive had plenty of time to learn what was wrong was that they were talking about people i didnt know and didnt care about you called master albert murmured in my ear i said dont be cute have you figured out whats going on with cassata not entirely robin he said because if i had i would of course have sought you out to report however i have drawn some interesting inferences infer ahead i whispered smiling at sergei as he poured another freezing shot of vodka into my glass without even looking at me i perceive three discrete questions said albert comfortably setfling himself down to a nice long tutorial the question of the relevance of the institute seminars to jaws the question of the maneuvers and the question of the presence of general cassata himself here these could be further subdivided into no i whispered they could not quick and simple albert very well the seminars are of course directly related to the central question of the foe how they could be recognized through their signatures and why they wish to alter the evolution of the universe the only real puzzle is why jaws should now express concern about the institutes seminars since there have been many similar conferences without objection from jaws i believe that that is related to the question of the maneuvers for this belief i can adduce a datum since the maneuvers began all communications from both the jaws satellite and the watch wheel have been embargoed emwhat embargoed yes robin cut off censored prohibited no communication of any sort with either is allowed i infer that first these events are related and both are related to the maneuvers as you know there was a false alarm on the watch wheel some weeks ago perhaps it was not a false alarm albert what are you saying i wasnt speaking out loud but essie gave me a puzzled look i smiled reassuringly or tried to though there was nothing reassuring about the thought no robin said albert soothingly i have no reason to believe the alarm was other than false but perhaps jaws is more concerned than i this would account for the sudden maneuvers which appear to have included testing some new weapons weapons another look from essie out loud i said cheerily na zhdrovya and raised my glass exactly robin said albert gloomily that leaves only the presence of general cassata to account for i believe that is quite simply explained he is keeping an eye on you he isnt doing a very good job of it thats not exactly true robin it is a fact that the general seems to be quite involved in his own affairs just now yes he is in fact closeted with a young lady and has been for some time but before retiring with the young person he ordered that no spacecraft may leave for the next thirty minutes organic time i think it quite probable that he will check up on you before that time has expired and meanwhile you cannot leave the asteroid wonderful i said i think not albert corrected me deferentially he cant do that albert pursed his lips in the long run that is so he agreed cartainly you will sooner or later be able to get higher authority to overrule general cassata since there is still some degree of civilian control of the joint assassin watch service however for the moment i am afraid he has the asteroid sealed bastard probably he is albert smiled ive taken the liberty of notifying the institute of this development and undoubtedly they will respond unfortunately that will be at organic speeds im afraid he paused is there anything else or should i go on with my investigations go damn it i stewed around in gigabit space for a while trying to cool off when i thought i was at least marginally fit to talk to again i rejoined essie and sergei borbosnoy in their simulation of the blue hell drinking parlor essie glanced up amiably in the middle of a long anecdote then fixed her eyes on me ho she said something is upsetting you once more robin i told her what albert had told me bastard she said concurring with my own diagnosis and sergei chimed in nekulturny that one then essie took my hand fondly after all dear robin she said is not important at this time you agree had no intention of leaving party for quite some considerable time even meat time yes but damn his soul that soul is well damned already dear robin drink a little wifi cheer you up so i gave it a try it didnt work very well nor was i having a lot of fun listening to essie and sergei talk understand that i liked sergei not because he was handsome he wasnt sergei borbosnoy was tall cadaverous balding he had soulful russian eyes and a sincere systematic russian way of swallowing vast quantities of icecold vodka a tumblerful at a time since he too was dead he could keep that up indefinitely without getting any drunker than he wanted to be however according to essie he had had the same capacity when they were students together in leningrad and both were still meat that kind of thing is a lot of fun sure if youre a studentespecially if youre russian it wasnt that much fun for me so hows it going i said genially when i noticed that they had stopped talking and were gazing at me essie reached over smoothed my hair affectionately and said hey old robin is not so interesting for you all this oldtimes stuff right why not go look around im fine i said untruthfully and she just sighed and said go so i went i had some private thinking to do anyway it isnt easy for me to say just what i needed to think about because no offense meat people cant quite take in the large number of assorted topics a sharedtime machinestored personality like me can keep in my headthat is my headall at once which leads me to realize that ive already made a mistake meat people cant juggle that many thoughts meat people are hardly any good at all at parallel processing meat people are linear what i have to keep in mind is that when communicating with meat people i must make allowances for these lacks so having tried three times to figure out how to start i now perceive that i should have started in a fourth and wholly different way i should have started by telling about the kids who lived on the watch wheel on the wheel so now we have to go back a little bit in time not very far actually at least it isnt far in meat terms not nearly as far as well have to go for some other things im afraid just a few months i have to tell about sneezy sneezy was eight years oldin his personal counting of time which was not the same as any other time weve been talking about his real name was sternutator that was a heechee name which is not surprising because he was a heechee child he was unfortunate enough to be the son of two heechee specialists in useful disciplines who happened to be on standby when the heechee found out that they couldnt go on hiding from the universe anymore there were a whole lot of heechee personnel waiting for just that emergency the massed minds of the heechee ancient ancestors recognized the need and so the standby crews were dispatched at once to the outside galaxy little sternutator went with them sternutator was not a fortunate name for a kid in school at least not when most of his classmates were human beings in the heechee language the word meant a kind of particle accelerator vaguely akin to a laser in which particles were tickled until they were emitted in one huge highpowered burst the boy made the mistake of translating his name literally for his classmates and naturally they called him sneezy after that or most of them did harold the smartass human nineyearold who sat behind him in concepts said he was one of the seven dwarfs all right but his parents had picked the wrong dwarf to name him after youre too dumb to be sneezy said harold during recess in the play pit after young sternutator had beaten him out in a patternrecognition bee what you really are is dopey and he bounced across the trampoline and gave sneezy a push that sent him flying into the taichi instructor robot which was fortunate for both of them the gamesthing reacted instantly catching the heechee boy in its padded arms safely sneezy didnt get hurt and harold didnt lose his recess time the schoolthing at the far end of the pit didnt even see what had happened so the taichi robot dusted sneezy off and politely adjusted the pod that hung between his legs and then whispered in his earin heecheehes only a child sternutator when hes older hell be sorry but i dont want them to call me dopey he sobbed they wont nobody will except harold and hell apologize for it some day and as a matter of fact that part of what the gamesthing said was true or almost true few of the other eleven children in the class liked harold none followed his example except fiveyearold softstick and that only briefly softstick was also a heechee and a very young one usually she tried her very best to be accepted by the human children when she found out that they didnt follow harolds lead she reversed herself so no harm came to young sneezy except that when he told his parents about it that night they were respectively angry and amused the angry one was his father bremsstrahlung who took his skeletal son on his bony knee and hissed this is sickening i am going to request a work order on the schoolthing for letting this fatbodied bully hurt our son the amused one was sneezys mother worse happened to me in school bremmy she said and that was back home let the boy fight his own battles heechee do not fight femtowave human beings do bremmy and i speculate that we will have to learn this from themoh in a nondamaging way to be sure she put down the shiny lightemitting instrument she had been studying because she had brought some work home from the office she steppedit was a motion more like skating than walking because of the light gravity on the wheelacross the room to lift sneezy from his fathers lap feed the boy my dear she said goodhumoredly and he will forget the whole matter you are taking it more seriously than he so femtowave scored fifty percent on that exchange she was quite right in that her mate was far more upset than their son however femtowave was wrong in her other assertion sneezy never forgot it perhaps he did not remember it properly what stuck with him was not just that human beings did indeed fight sometimes but that their fighting did not take place only with those grossly bulging fists or grossly swollen feet they could hurt someone simply by calling a name did i do it wrong again should i have started by explaining the purpose of the watch wheel well better late than never lets back up again to get the loose ends reraveled when the first heechee who could not control his own destiny met the first human being who could the heechee child named sternutator was on that standby ship in the core with his parents he was homesick home was a cozy little city of eight or ten million on a planet of an orangeyyellowy little star inside the great black hole that was the core of the galaxy even at three sneezy knew what that meant he knew that the reason his family was on the ship was that there might come a time when they would all have to drop everything and plunge through the schwarzschild barrier and rejoin the outside stars he didnt expect it to happen to him of course no one ever does then when he and his family were assigned to the watch wheel sneezy found out what real homesickness was the purpose of the wheel was simple it was a place to put dream seats the dream seats were a heechee invention that wed come across before we ever met a living heechee what the heechee used them for was to keep tabs on planets where intelligent life might someday evolve but hadnt yetlike our own planet a few hundred thousand years ago when the heechee last came to earth the dream signals werent dreams basically they were emotions a heechee encased in the dreamseat web of glittering antennametal could feel what others were feelingeven when the others were far away far away in planetary terms at least they didnt work in any useful way in galactic terms this was because the dreamseat signals unfortunately came by simple emf they were limited by the speed of light and obeyed the law of inverse squares so the effective range of the dream seats was only in the billions of kilometers not the trillions of trillions that separated star from star the job of bremsstrahlung and the other dreamseat operators both human and heechee was to be the eyes and ears of the wheel their assignment was to monitor the most important object in either heechee or human cosmology the kugelblitz that hung outside the galactic halo there wasnt any point in the galaxy itself close enough for the purpose so the wheel had been built and flown to a position only six au from the kugelblitz in its lonely position in nearintergalactic space that was everyone agreed a reasonable way to do it it was true that in the event that something at last did transpire around the kugelblitz and the watchers did finally receive the signals they feared it would be some fortyodd minutes after the actual event because that was how long it would take lightspeed signals to cross six times the distance of the earth from the sun there was also just a tiny bit of uncertainty over whether the dream seats would catch anything at all in that event after all some argued the model of the dream seat the heechee had originally used did not have any sensitivity for say machinestored intelligences like my very own albert einstein it was only after people like essie tinkered with them that they could handle that chore what reason was there to believe it would be able to detect the wholly unknown signatures of the basically theoretical assassins but there wasnt anything they could do about the second problem and as to the first as nothing had happened around the kugelblitz for almost certainly some millions of years it did not seem that three quarters of an hour one way or another would make any difference the next morning sneezy was awakened by the voice of the housething in the wall saying in the heechee language drill day sternutator drill day wake up now for drill day it kept repeating its message until sneezy had slid out of the warm hug of his pouchy hammock and then it relented drill day sternutatorbut it is only a aass two drill there will be no school that was a case of bad news turned good for sneezy he slung his pod between his skinny thighs and pulled on the rest of his clothes and put a call through to haroldfor they did not always fightwhile he oiled his teeth shall we watch the ship come in sneezy proposed and harold rubbing sleep out of his eyes yawned and said you bet your tiny ass dopey meet you in ten minutes at the schoolhall corner since it was a drill day even a class two drill both sneezys parents were already gone to their posts but the housething parented for both of them it pleaded with sneezy to eat some breakfast and urged him to take an airbath sneezy closed the apartment door on the housethings entreaties and hurried through the quiet drillday passages of the wheel toward the schoolhall when harold was not being overbearing and sneezy not sullenly resentful they were friends that hadnt happened right away harold was nearly the first human being sneezy ever saw and sneezy was definitely harolds first heechee the looks of each appalled the other to sneezy harold looked fat bloated grossly swollenabout like a corpse thats been in the water for a week maybe to harold sneezy looked worse than that the thing a heechee looks most like is a human being who has died in the desert and dried out to rope and leather sneezy had arms and legs like a person but he didnt have any flesh to speak of on them and of course he had that funny pod not to mention that faint ammonia smell that hovers around all heechee all the time so friendship wasnt instinctive at first on the other hand they didnt have much choice there were fewer than fifty children on the whole watch wheel and twothirds of those were in the other schools spaced around the rim so their choice of peers was limited the babies sixyearolds and younger of course didnt count the nearadult teenagers counted a lot to be sureeither sneezy or harold would have been thrilled to be allowed to hang out with any of thembut they also of course didnt want to be bothered with kids they could have gone to one of the other sectors even eightyearold sneezy had done it many times alone or with classmates but there was nothing in either of the other sectors that was not duplicated in their own and the children there were strangers there was no rule against sneezy going almost anywhere he liked in fact with companions or withoutat least if you didnt count the forbidden cubicles on the outer perimeter where the dream seats were constantly manned sneezy wasnt forbidden to play in dangerous areas there werent any dangerous areas in the huge watch wheel there were certainly places where truly dangerous amounts of energy were deployed without warningfor signal bursts for spin regulation for mass shiftingbut there was no employment of energy anywhere on the wheel that was not constantly monitored by unflagging machine inteffigences and often enough by stored dead human or heechee intelligences as well and of course there was no danger from people there were no kidnapers or rapists on the wheel there were no uncapped wells to fall into or forests to get lost in there were groves of trees here and there sure but none that even an eightyearold could not see his way out of from its very center if any child got lost even for a moment he had but to ask the nearest workthing for directions and be set at once on his way that is a human child would do that a heechee child like sneezy didnt even need to find a workthing because he could simply inquire of the ancient ancestors in his pod the watch wheel was so safe in fact that most of the children and even some of the grownups that served it sometimes forgot what supreme danger they were watching for so they had to be reminded even for the children there were the frequent drillsespecially for the children because when and if the watchers in the dream seats ever found what they were watching for as some day they surely would the children would have to take care of themselves no adult would then be able to take care of them even the workthings would be busy their programs instantly switched to analysis and communication and data storage the children would have to find an approved place to hideto stay out of the way reallyand cower in it until they were told they could come out again there were precedents for this sort of thing in the middle of the twentieth century schoolkids in america and the soviet union had had to learn to leap under their desks lie prone clasp their hands over the backs of their necks and sweat with fearif they failed in any of this their teachers told them the nuclear bombs would frenchfry them for the children on the watch wheel the stakes were higher it was not only their own lives that might be lost if they caused trouble what might be lost was perhaps everything so when there was a drill they too sweated with fear at least they usually did but now and then there was a class two drill class two meant only that routine precautions were to be taken because a supply ship was coming in class two drills were not scary at allat least they were not if you didnt think the thing through there was no school on the days when a supply ship came in there was no work done anywhere on the wheel because everybody wduld be too busy with the ship docking those families who had served their time and were ready to be rotated would be packing and gathering at the dock to get their first sight of the ship that would take them back to the warmly inviting huddle of stars that was the galaxy and everybody else would be getting ready to oversee offloading the supplies and the new personnel by the time sneezy got to the schoolhall corner he had already eaten his sandwich and harold was waiting youre late dopey the human boy snapped they didnt sound the sighting signal yet sneezy pointed out so we arent late for anything dont argue thats a baby thing to do come on harold led the way he assumed that was his right he was not only older than sneezy but he outmassed sneezy three to one forty kilograms of harold to not much more than fifteen for the youthful skeletally skinny heechee boy harold wroczek was a tall child with pale hair and blueberrycolored eyes but he was not much taller than sneezy whose people were all emaciated and elongated by human standards to harolds annoyance the other thing he was not more of than sneezy was strong under that dry leathery heechee skin were powerful tendons and muscles though harold tried to climb the handholds to the docking levels faster than sneezy the heechee boy kept up easily he was off the top of the ladder before harold was so harold panted up to him you watch it dopey dont get in the way of the workthings sneezy didnt bother to answer not even a twoyearold on the wheel would have been stupid enough to get in the way on such an occasion the ships came only four or five times in a standard year they didnt linger they didnt dare to and no one dared delay them so as soon as the boys were in the huge spindleshaped space of bay they retreated as close to a wall as they could well away from the scurrying carrythings and the grownups arriving to watch the ship come in all the landing docks bay included were on the inside of the wheel its external shell was transparent at that point but there wasnt anything to be seen through it yet except the inside curve of the wheel itsell with the other two landing docks identical to the one they were in but empty peering in at them i cant see the ship harold complained sneezy didnt answer the only answer was to say that of course harold could not since the ship was still approaching faster than the speed of light but harold had explained often enough to sneezy that he didnt enjoy the dumb heechee habit of giving answers everybody knew to questions that werent really meant to be answered traffic to the wheel was almost all oneway except for people the human and heechee complement were sent back when their tours of duty were over usually roughly the equivalent of three standard earth years then they went back to the galaxy and their homes wherever those might be most went to earth quite a few to peggys planet others to one of the habitats but supplies never went back machinery instruments parts recreational materials medical outfits foodthey stayed when the items were consumed or broken or outmoded they were recycled or simply retained as extra mass for the wheel extra mass was a good thing the more mass the watch wheel had the less it would be affected by movements inside it and so the less energy would have to be expended to keep it spinning straight and true so the cargohandling carrythings had little to do while the ship was coming in only to stack the personal possessions of returning personnel there wasnt much of that there were only eight families to be rotated a mellow note sounded the ship was in normal space the dockmaster stood over his screens and boards checked the readings and called lights it wasnt an order it was a courtesy for the audience just to let them know what was happening the actual extinguishing of the lights like almost everything else that happened was controlled by the sensors and the docking programs the lights in bay went out so in the same moment did all the lights on the rest of the wheel visible through the shell and then sneezy could see the sky there was not much to see there werent any stars the only stars bright enough to be seen from the watch wheel were those from their own galaxy and their eyes didnt happen to be pointed that way there were other galaxies by the hundreds of millions in their line of sight but only a few dozen of them were nakedeye objects and those only pale tiny smudges of firefly light then as the wheel slowly pun through its endless round the westernmost of the smudges dipped out of sight and the onlookers murmured a pale colorless ificker of light hard to see painful to the eyes when seen and then abruptly like a slide projected without warning on a screen there was the ship the supply ship was immense itself a spindle meters long the shape meant that this time it was an originalheechee ship not one of the new humanbuilt ones sneezy felt a special glow he didnt have anything against the human ships which were usually either torpedoshaped or simple cylinders as everybody knew the shape made no difference at all in interstellar travel they could just as easily have been spheres or cubes or chrysanthemums the shape was only a matter of the whims of the designers most of the supply ships that visited the watch wheel were humanmade and humancrewedand generally loaded with human recruits too so that that minor fraction of the wheels complement that was heechee was still further outnumbered a heechee ship might mean more heechee to redress the balance so thought sneezy but not this time the great spindle settled inside the embrace of the wheel its approach course was a corkscrew turn beginning to twirl to match the wheels own slow spin so that by the time its teat was touching the hatch of bay they were synchronized rings meshed seals locked from the aft quarters of the ship cables spun out to the capstans at bays i and securing themselves and tightening to make the ship an integral part of the structure of the wheel the mass shifters in the utility conduits shuddered and chugged adjusting the balance of the wheel to match the new increments harold stumbled off balance as the floor twitched beneath them sneezy caught him and harold shoved him away you take care of yourself dopey he instructed but then the ship was securely locked in and its wonders began to pour out the carrythings were the first to spring into action hurrying into the cargo hatches and emerging with crates and bales and articles of furnishings and machines most could not be identified by sight but the cargo bay was suddenly brightened with lovely smells as the handlers offloaded crates of fresh fruit peaches and oranges and berries wow gosh look at those bananas cried harold as a handler came off the ramp with all four limbs upraised each one holding a stalk of unripe fruit i wish i had one right now you arent supposed to eat them until they turn yellow sneezy pointed out with pride in his knowledge of strange human foods he got a withering glare from harold i know that i mean i wish i had one ripe one now or some of those whatdoyoucallthem berries sneezy bent to whisper to his pod for help then straightened up they are strawberries he stated i wish i had some too strawberries harold whispered it had been a long time since he had seen a strawberry the wheel grew or manufactured most of its own food but no one had yet got around to a berry patch it was easy enough to make food with strawberry flavoror any other flavor imaginable for that matter chonfood was endlessly variable but the crispness the texture the smellno there was always a difference between chonfood and the real stuff and the difference was that the real stuff was wonderful the boys slid carefully closer to the stacked crates of fruit inhaling deeply there was space between the crates and the wall of the bay out of the way of the carrythings and the boys fit into that space as no adult could i think those are raspberries said harold peering across stacks of lettuce and carrots and scarletripe tomatoes and look cherries i would like to have some strawberries best said sneezy wistfully and a carrything gently setting down a box marked instruments fragile paused as though listening it was it heard two of its long handling arms extended themselves to the crates of strawberries opened one of the crates extricated a little basket of fruit resealed the end of the crate and reached over the other crates to hand the basket to sneezy why thank you said sneezy surprised but polite you are welcome sternutator said the carrything in heechee sneezy jumped oh do i know you i was your taichi teacher the carrything announced give some to harold then it turned and raced off for the next load harold looked resentful for a moment then dismissed the emotion as unworthywho would be jealous of the attentions of a lowgrade machine intelligence the two boys divided the fruit nipping each berry between fingertips by its short green stem and nibbling it away the strawberries were perfect fully ripe sugarsweet taste fuffilling all the promise of look and smell the people will be out in a minute harold announced chewing blissfullyand was surprised to see sneezy suddenly stop eating the heechee boys eyes were staring at the ship following the direction of sneezys eyes harold saw the first of the passengers at last emergingthere were fifteen or twenty of them adults and children that was always interesting of course it was the biggest reason the boys were there to see what new companions or rivals the ship might be bringing them but the expression on sneezys face was not just curiosity it was either anger or fearastonishment at least harold decided annoyed as he always was because heechee expressions were hard for a human to read the newcomers looked human enough to harold though there was something about the way they walked hard to see at this distance that was odd harold looked again and saw something else the wheel had turned a bit farther now just past the bulk of the ship out in the emptiness of intergalactic space was the cluster of patches of dirtyyellow light the wheel was there to watch the light was not really yellow to begin with of course spectroscopy showed that far more than ninety percent of the radiation from the kugelblitz was in the violet end of the optical spectrum and beyond but those frequencies were bad for human or heechee eyes the transparent shell had been doped to exclude them only the yellow came through harold grinned in satisfaction whats the matter dopey he said patronizingly you suddenly scared about the kugelblitz sneezy blinked those great pink oddlooking heechee eyes at him scared of the kugelblitz no what are you talking about you look so funny harold explained im not funny im mad look at that sneezy waved a skinny arm at the dock thats a heechee ship and the people are all wearing ancestor pods but every one of those people is human if harold had been a heechee boy instead of a very human one he wouldnt have laughed about the kugelblitz the kugelblitz was not a laughing matter the kugelblitz was where the foe livedthe beings the heechee called the assassins the heechee had not given them that name as a jest to the heechee there was nothing jestable about the foe heechee didnt laugh at dangerous things they ran away from them that was another significant difference between sneezy and harold and then there was oniko who was different still oniko bakin was one of the new arrivals her contingent of replacements included twentytwo humans and no heechee at all four of them were children and the one who turned up in sneezys school was oniko when she appeared for classes on her first day the other children clustered around her but youre human one said so why do you wear a heechee pod we always have she explained then she courteously shushed them to pay attention to the teacherthing oniko was indeed human she was also female and just about sneezys age her skin was pale olive her eyes were black and hooded with an epicanthic fold her hair was straight and black and sneezy was proud to be able to identify her by these signs as one of that subgenre of human beings called oriental she spoke colloquial english though to sneezys surprise she spoke colloquial heechee too lots of humans spoke a little heechee more or less but oniko was the first in sneezys experience who was equally at home in both the language of do and the language of feel that did not lessen his astonishment at seeing a human child wearing a pod in eurhythmics that first day she was in school with him oniko became his partner for stretchandbend movements sneezy got a closeup look at her although he still thought that her flesh was distressingly flabby and her mass worrisomely large he liked the sweet smell of her breath and the gentle way she spoke his namenot dopey not even sneezy but sternutator in the heechee tongue he was disappointed when their housething called early to take her out of school for some formality with her parents because he wanted to know her better at home that night he tried asking his father why a human being should wear a pod very simple sterny bremsstrahlung said wearily they were a lost catch the reason bremsstrahlung was tired was that he had been doing double duty all the watchers had the times when a ship was docked at the wheel were thought to be specially vulnerable since a certain amount of confusion was inevitable at such times every dream seat was manned and all the watchers kept on duty until the ship had departed and the wheel was secure once more it had been a very long shift for bremsstrahlung a lost catch he explained is a group of human beings who flew one of our ships to a oneway destination as to this one ask your mother she talked to the ships crew only for a moment femtowave protested i was hoping for news from home bremsstrahlung patted her fondly what news could there be when they left onlywhat was it three or four hours after we did femtowave acknowledged the correctness of his observation with a flexion of her throat she said in amusement the poor crew still was in shock they were all heecjiee they left the core with specialists and materials to go to earth stopped there were loaded with supplies for us stopped on the way to pick up the new people from the lost catch oh how confusing it all must be for them exactly said bremsstrahlung anyway once the original humans reached the artifact they couldnt leave so then they were stuck there forever if it were forever femtowave smiled they would not be here now bremmy she did not smile in the human way since heechee musculature is not the same what happened was that a knot of muscle gathered below her cheekbones the taut flesh itself did not move you know what i mean her husband said anyway sternutator this little group of less than one hundred humans turned out to be very rich in sensitives he said it demurely to be a sensitive meant that one was particularly good at using the dream seat to listen for signs of external intelligence and of course bremsstrahlung himself was among the most sensitive beings ever found that was why he was on the wheel will oniko work in the dream seat sneezy asked of course not at least not until she grows up you know that it is not only important to be able to receive any impressions that may come a particularly gifted child might be able to do that but it is just as important to be able to refrain from broadcasting ones own feelings more important femtowave corrected there was no smiley knot of muscle on her cheek now that was nothing to smile about more important i agree said her husband as to whether this child is a sensitive or not well theres no way for me to know that she will be tested probably she already has been as you were since surely one of her own parents must be a sensitive and there is quite a strong genetic component involved does that mean that i wifi work in the dream seat when i grow up sneezy asked eagerly we dont know that yet his father said he thought for a moment and then added somberly for that matter we dont know if the wheel will still be here bremsstrahlung his wife cried that is nothing to joke about bremsstrahlung nodded but didnt say anything he was really quite tired perhaps he told himself that was why he hadnt been joking actually sneezys best witness about the human girl was oniko herself she was assigned to his schoolhall and of course the schoolthing introduced her at once to the other students oniko it said was born on a food factory and hasnt had much chance to know much about the world so please help her when you can sneezy was willing the chances didnt come very often though he was not the only child curious about the newcomer and most of the others being human were far more forward than he sneezys school was almost like the storied oneroom red schoolhouse of american antiquity there really was only one room it was different from the antique though in that it didnt have just one teacher or not exactly each student got quite individual instruction with his or her own customtailored battery of learning programs the schoolthing was a mobile unit it cruised around the room as needed mostly to keep discipline and to see that none of the students was still eating his lunch when he should have been parsing sentences it did not teach for that purpose each student had his own carrel when the schoolthing had finished counting heads and checking on the reasons for any absences it bustled around making sure of clean hands and freedom from symptoms of illnessand in the case of the youngest pupils fastening the seat belts that kept them in their carrels not to mention escorting them to the toilet as needed not to mention all the other functions required for children who a few of them were still quite tiny for all of this the schoolthing was quite adequate it even looked reassuring it had a face when it was wearing its normal schoolthing equipage it appeared to be a little old woman in a shapeless gown the gown was cosmetic of course so was the smiling face so were all of its physical attributes for when school was not in session the schoolthing did quite other jobs and wore quite other appearances and of course when more help was neededwhen the children needed more supervision at exercise time or if any special problem should arisethe schoolthing coopted as many other artificial inteffigences as needed from the wheel pool sneezy noticed subconsciously that the schoolthing was hovering around oniko much of the time but he was too busy trying to prove to the satisfaction of his numbertheory program that was congruent to to the base to pay much attention it wasnt that number theory was difficult for sneezy far from it like all heechee children he had absorbed most of its principles at about the same time he learned to read what made mathematics challenging for sneezy was the silly human system of countingto the base imagine with positional notation so that if you got two digits in the wrong order the number was hopelessly wrong then exercise time the schoolthing chirped cheerily and sneezy found out why the schoolthi g was paying particular attention to oniko bakin all the individual teaching programs logged off the restraining straps slid away from the small ones the children stood up and stretched and laughing and shoving trooped out to the safe area outside the schoolhall except oniko she remained behind sneezy didnt notice that at first because he was busy as all the children were busy with the vigorous muscleagainstmuscle tuggings and shovings and bendings and pressings that all of them had to perform twenty times a day that was mandatory all over the wheel and not just for children the light pull of the watch wheel was enervating it didnt encourage children to develop strong muscles or adults to keep them in any practical sense as long as they stayed on the wheel that wouldnt matter because what did a human or heechee need muscles for there but no one would stay on the wheel forever and once they got back to normal gravity they would regret the flab accumulated on the wheel sneezy being heechee was more methodical and purposeful in his exercising than most of the human students he finished early and looked around when he saw that oniko wasnt in the play pit he peered into the schoolhall there she was the girl was strapped into a sort of jointed metal casing that followed the shape of her body an exoskeleton and the contraption was writhing and twisting and bending with the girl inside it oh said sneezy understanding at once youre being acclimated to gravity oniko opened her eyes and looked at him levelly without answering she was gasping for breath heechee are no better at reading human expressions than humans are with those of the heechee but sneezy could see the strain lines on her face and the sweat on her brow its good that youre doing that he said then it occurred to him to be tactful do you mind my being here he asked because the girl was certainly being twisted and shaped into some rather extraordinary positions no she panted sneezy tarried indecisively as he looked more closely he could see that it was not only exercise she was given a stinger needle was in the vein of her arm gently seeping some sort of fluid into her bloodstream she saw his eye and managed to say im being recalcified to make my bones stronger yes of course sneezy said encouragingly i guess your habitat didnt have much surface gravity but this will help im sure he thought for a moment and then said in charity i guess you cant do the real exercises yet oniko she took a deep breath not yet she said but i will when the next halfholiday came around sneezy and harold planned to visit the coconut grove oniko was just outside the schoolhail door as they left and on impulse sneezy said to her were going to get some coconuts do you want to come along harold grunted annoyance from behind him but sneezy paid no attention oniko pursed her lips considering the invitation her poise and manner were very nearly adult as she said yes thank you very much i would enjoy that sure harold put in but what about lunch i only brought enough for myself i already have my lunch said the girl patting her school bag since i was planning to explore the wheel today anyhow its quite interesting i think harold was indignant interesting look kid its not just interesting its the most important thing in the whole universe its the only thing that keeps the whole human race safeheechee too he added as an afterthought i mean if we werent on guard every minute who knows what would happen of course oniko said politely i know that it is our task to monitor the kugelblitz that is why we are all here certainly the look she gave harold was almost maternal both my parents are watchers she said with that selfdeprecatory tone that announces great pride and my uncle tashi as well nearly everyone where i come from is good at that sort of thing probably when i grow up i will be too if there was one thing harold couldnt stand when he was condescending to someone it was to be condescended to he glowered are we going to get some coconuts he demanded or are we going to stand around talking all day lets get going he turned leading the way his expression said that he personally had had no part in inviting this funny new human kid with the pod and expected nothing good to come of it in a moment it seemed he was right the coconut grove was not far from the schoolhall in the curved geometry of the wheel in fact it was directly above the school there was a lift chain just a few dozen meters away at the intersection of two main corridors but in the light gravity of the wheel active children seldom bothered with such things harold pushed a door open to reveal the vertical shaft with handholds just next to the schoolhall he scuttled up out of sighi sneezy nodded encouragingly to the girl she hesitated i dont think i can manage that yet she said naturally sneered harold from above no problem said sneezy at once embarrassed at his lack of thoughtfulness well take the lift he called up the shaft and didnt wait to listen for harolds answer they got it all the same when they stepped carefully off the lift chain and found harold waiting oh god he said if she cant handle the ladders hows she going to climb a tree ill climb for her sneezy said you go ahead ungraciously harold turned away to pick the best tree for himself he went up hands and feet like a monkey the coconut trees were a dozen meters tall before you got to the crown but they were no trouble for an agile child to climb with only wheel weight harold vain of the muscles he religiously cultivated had naturally chosen the tallest and richestladen and oniko looked up at him with some fear just stand clear sneezy encouraged in case he drops one i wont damn well drop one snapped harold from above sawing away at one of the husks it probably wouldnt hurt even if he did said sneezy but all the same all the same you think ill break said oniko with dignity dont worry about me climb a tree ill watch sneezy glanced around and chose a shorter tree with fewer fruits but he thought larger ones were only allowed two each he explained or else the guardthing will report us ill be right back and he swarmed up his tree even faster than harold and made his choice among the triangular green fruits he carefully tossed three good ones to the ground a few meters away from oniko and when he was down again she was studying them in surprise but these arent coconuts she exclaimed ive seen pictures of coconuts theyre brown and hairy and hard those are inside the green stuff sneezy explained take that big one tap it with your knuckles to make sure its ripe but she didnt know how to do that either sneezy did it for her and handed the nut back to her oniko took it in her hand and hefted it thoughtfully although it weighed nothing much on the wheel its mass was the same as it would have been anywhere else in the universe and it looked formidably hard to penetrate how do we get the green stuff off she asked tell her to give it to me dopey harold ordered from behind them his own coconuts already on the ground he snatched it and with two quick strokes of his knife he had the stem end open and handed it back to her drink it he commanded its good the girl looked at it suspiciously then at sneezy he nodded encouragement hesitatingly she lifted it to her lips tasted made a face rummaged around the inside of her mouth with her tongue exploring the flavor of the coconut juice tried a larger sipand reported in surprise why yes it is good well open them up and get the meat later sneezy said working on his own coconut maybe we should eat our lunches now the juice is good to drink with the sandwiches but though sneezys family had adopted the human habit of sandwiches onikos had not what she pulled out of her bag was a collection of lumpy little objects in gaily colored paper in the red a pickled plum in the golden a hard brown piece of something she said was fish although neither sneezy nor harold was willing to taste it to find out nor was oniko interested in harolds extra deviled egg nor in the ham sandwiches sneezy had persuaded his father to let him take ham was enough of an adventure for sneezy he had only in the last year begun to accept human foodor as close to real human food as the wheels synthesizers created but you should try these oniko scolded thank you no said sneezy harold was less diplomatic he made throwingup noises but i try your food oniko pointed out these coconuts for instance are quite good she took another deep sip found the nut empty silently sneezy opened another and passed it over to her i think she said judiciously that when i grow up and return to earth i will buy an island where these grow and then i too will be able to climb the trees both boys stared at her they were almost equally astonished though for different reasons harold because he was deeply impressed at the girls casual assumption of such wealthbuy an island return to earth one must be very rich to contemplate either and sneezy was simply baffled by the entire concept of owning land at all i have been told of such nice islands oniko went on there is one called tahiti which is said to be very pretty or perhaps one nearer the islands of japan so i can visit my relatives whom i have never met you have relatives in japan earth asked harold suddenly respectful his own family were descendants of early settlers on peggys planet earth was not muchmore than a myth to him but i thought you were born on a heechee artifact i was and my parents before me oniko said taking another sip of the coconut milk and settling down to repeat once again an oftentold story but my fathers father aritsune bakin married in the great temple at nara then he took his bride to gateway and sought their fortune his fathers father had himself been a gateway prospector but was badly injured and confined to the asteroid he had some money when he died that money paid for my fathers fathers trip with his wife along they took only one trip the first time out they found their destination was the artifact there were eighteen large heechee ships there none of which could be made to fly by them and their own ship would no longer respond to the controls that was so that the information from the artifact would be kept secret until the proper time sneezy put in in some embarrassment he had already heard a fair amount of criticism of heechee practices with their abandoned ships and stations yes of course said oniko forgivingly six other gateway ships arrived at the same destination and were all of course marooned there there were four threes a one and another five like my grandfathers so in all there were twentythree original prospectors fortunately eight of them were women of childbearing age so the colony survived when finally we were for the first time she hesitated when you were rescued harold offered we were not rescued we were never lost merely detained so when finally we were visited again just four years ago the population of the artifact was eightyfive i was just a small child then of course some of us went directly to earth or other places but because i was little my parents remained so that i could begin to be prepared for these horrible heavy places you think this is heavy harold snickered wow waitll you try peggys planet or earth i shall oniko said firmly sure you will harold said skeptically what about the money of course original gateway rules applied oniko explained there were earned bonuses and royalties for the prospectors and their descendants according to the rules the value of the artifact and its contents was estimated at two biffion eight hundred million and some odd dollars divided by the number of prospectors who reached there alive twentythree wow said harold goggleeyed as he did arithmetic in his head of course oniko added apologetically my parents are the only descendants of four out of the original twentythree so i will inherit all four sharesabout onesixth of the totalif they die without having any other childreni hope they will not she finished wow harold was speechless even sneezy was impressed though not with the money this child possessedavarice was not a heechee vice but he admired her for the lucid cogent way she told her story really she said it was quite nice there when the new people came many new experiences much to talk about not that it wasnt very nice beforeoh what is happening she finished in distress gazing around it was getting dark the overhead light dimmed swiftly replaced by a much fainter red glow in a moment it was as dark as it ever got in the coconut grovedark enough so that the palms evolved to thrive in the circadian rhythm of the earths tropical climates had their period of rest before the lights came on again and photosynthesis resumed its so the trees wont get sick sneezy explained but theyll leave the red lights on so we can see the trees dont mind that sneezy didnt mind that either as harold well knew the older boy chortled dopeys afraid of the dark you know sneezy looked away it was untrue but it was not wholly false in the densely packed star cluster at the heechee core there was seldom a time on the surface of any planet without one degree or another of sunlight darkness was not exactly frightening but it was at least discoxnfiting he said you were telling us about where you came from oh yes sternutator it was so nice even the original prospectors came to love it i think though of course they wished they could see their families again but there was plenty of food and water and much to do we had a great many heechee books and more than one hundred heechee ancient ancestors stored there to talk to they taught us how to use the pods she said proudly patting hers sneezy reached out a finger to touch hers and felt the warm stirrings of the presence within your ancestor seems very nice he told her thank you she said gravely your pod is much smaller than mine though he offered oh yes we dont need the microwave you see we only have them for the ancestors my father says we had much to learn from the heecheeonce we learned the language of course thank you said sneezy in return he wasnt sure what he was thanking her for but it seemed polite harold was not in a polite mood what we had to learn from the heechee he said was how to be cowards and we just wouldnt learn that sneezy felt the knots of muscles at his shoulders gather heechee emotions arent the same as human emotions but even the heechee can feel annoyance he said unsteadily i do not want you to call me a coward harold doggedly harold said oh im not talking about you personally dopey but you know as well as i do what the heechee did they just ran away and hid i do not want you to call me dopey either anymore harold jumped to his feet and what are you going to do about it he sneered sneezy rose more slowly wondering at himself he was ill at ease in the gloomy palm grove but he was also beginning to shake for other reasons i am going to tell you that it is wrong for you to call me that no one else does no one else knows you as well as i do harold said stubbornly sneezy perceived that the human boys feelings had been hurt in some wayit did not occur to sneezy to use the word jealousy harolds forearms were raised his fists were clenching why sneezy marveled it looked as though he wanted to fight perhaps he would have perhaps sneezy would have fought him back heechee did not usually practice violence on each other but sneezy was a very young heechee not as civilized as he would be in another decade or so what stopped them had nothing to do with civilization it was oniko she made a gagging sound glared at the coconut in her hand in revulsion then suddenly flung it away oh my god she said in strangled tones and began to vomit profusely when the two boys got her down to the classroom the schoolthing which possessed paramedical skills among all its others reproached them bitterly for letting the poor child drink so much of an unfamiliar juice as penance they had to escort her to her apartment and stay there with her until a parent returned so both harold and sneezy were late for dinner hurry it up cant you harold complained just behind him in the downshaft im going to get smacked sneezy was already hurrying as much as he could swinging down from one handhold to another on the descending cable he was not afraid of being smacked neither of his parents would strike a child but he was impatient to see them there were questions he wanted to ask as they hurried down the long passageway to the crossway where both their homes were sneezy right harold left he was framing the questions in his mind and then they stopped short sneezy hissed in surprise harold groaned aw shit they both heard the piercing metallicelectronic squeal that seemed to go right through bone into brain to make sure they noticed the ceiling lights flashed on and off three measured times and all the voices of all the workthings awoke at once drill the nearest ones called to the boys take rest positions at once empty your minds lie still this is a drill i wish i had a better way of talking to meat people i wish it were possible for me to tell about sneezy and onikц and the wheel as i experienced them i dont mean that i experienced them directly i didnt i wasnt there but i just as well might have been because everything that happened on the wheel like everything that happened anywhere in the galaxy was recorded somewhere in gigabit space and thus available to those who had been vastened like me so in a certain sense i was there but while i was accessing that particular store i was also doing fortyeleven other things some of them interesting some of them important some of them just a lot more of that poking around among the yearnings and sorrows inside my head that i seem to keep on doing all the time i dont know how to convey all that i dont mean that i wasnt paying attention to the story of the kids i was they touched me there is something infinitely heartmelting for me anyway about the courage of kids i dont mean the physical fistfight and namecalling kind of courage like when sneezy stood up to harold though that was very brave behavior for a heechee boy to exhibit i mean the way a child can stand up to a real danger maybe even an irresistible and undefeatable danger its futile and hopeless and heartbreaking like a twoweek kitten mewing defiance to an escaped pit bull it melts me albert isnt always tolerant of the way i feel about kids he tells me sometimes that essie and i probably should have had children of our own and then maybe i wouldnt idealize them the way i do maybe so but regardless of whatever i maybe should have done or possibly wouldnt be i do have this sudden rush of liquefaction around the region of the heart when i see kids doing what they must do in the face of the overwhelming fear actually neither harold nor sneezy was that frightened at first a drill was a drill theyd had plenty of drills before they flopped where they were they closed their eyes they waited this was no class two drill like the landing of a ship it was an allout alert the kind that happened at random times and had to be carried out perfectly as soon as the warning whistle quieted down the rest of the wheel did too the workthings that had no duties turned themselves to standby and stood frozen the lights dimmed themselves to murk just enough to make things out the inertial sensors that monitored the spin of the wheel gave their mass shifters one more pat into place and shut down so did the vertical lift cables so did all the other nonessential inorganic machines and intelligences of the wheel sneezy and harold were shut down too or as close to it as active children can get among the required courses for every child in the wheels schoolhalls was practice in what some people used to call satori the blanking of the mind they were quite good at it lying curled like a fetus next to the equally curled harold sneezys mind was emptied of everything but the graygold notwarmnotcold notbrightnotdark haze of abandonment of self or almost of course you could never achieve perfection at satori an attempt to be perfect was itself an imperfection there were thoughts stirring in sneezys fog questions questions about oniko that sneezy still wanted very much to ask his parents questions about whetherby some ternble chancethis drill might just possibly be no drill at all but reality the deck of the wheel felt dead under his cheek no buzz of air pumps or whine of cable motors no voices no rustle or footstep of anyone moving no irregular satisfying thump and rumble as the mass shifters worked to keep the wheel turning true sneezy waited as the questions tried to form themselves in his mind he separated himself from them letting them dwindle away half formed until one question began to recur insistently why was this particular drill lasting so long in fact it was over an hour before the nearest cleanerthing suddenly jerked itself erect again it pointed its sensor toward the two boys and said the drill is over you can get up now they didnt need to be told of course even before the cleanerthings words were spoken the wheel began to come back to life lights sprang up distant whines and thumps and shudders said that all the caretaking machinery was turning itself on again harold jumped up grinning i guess my dad had to go on duty he cried happily the translation of that remark was so he wont remember i was late mine too said sneezy then struck by a thought and probably both of onikos parents had to go on so probably so probably they had to leave her alone anyway harold nodded so what was the use of making us stay there dumb things he said kicking the cleanerthing as they passed see you tomorrow of course sneezy said politely and hurried home as expected neither parent was there the housething told him that his father had been called to the dream seats and his mother had been caught by the drill far into the third sector of the wheel both were on their way home his father arrived first looking again tired wheres your mother he asked it was the housething that answered for sneezy femtowave has been delayed by a slight problem one of the maintenance circuits was sluggish in coming back on line after the drill shall i prepare dinner of course bremsstrahlung grumbled tired and irritable why is this sternutator why havent you told the cookthing to start already and besides he said remembering why werent you here two hours ago oniko was sick sneezy explained bremsstrahlung paused his memory pouch half unslung on his way to the airbath and is that now something that you must worry about are you now a mediething sneezy explained about the coconut juice we had to take her home i wanted to leave father he protested but her housethings told us to stay with her and her ancestor agreed ironically bremsstrahlung repeated her ancestor no of course i mean not really hers father but she carries the ancestor in her pod her name is ophiolite the ancestor i mean for a human bremsstrahlung said approvingly this oniko shows considerable intelligence i have wondered why more humans dont carry memory pouches of course they dont require the radiation as we do but still the pods are so convenient in other ways yes but she has an ancestor in hers weary as he was bremsstrahlung was a good father he sank down on a forkrest his pod loose beneath him to explain things to his son you must remember sternutator that if a group of ancestors were inadvertently left behind during the removal it must have been very lonely for them of course they would have formed attachments to the first intelligent beings who appeared there even if they were human yes but said sneezy i dont have an ancestor in my pod yet children dont have ancestors in their pods bremsstrahlung explained even many adults do not because the ancestors are very busy with important work but when you grow up yes but said sneezy she does bremsstrahlung groaned and stood up neatly hanging his memory pouch beside the bath door he begged later son please im really tired it wasnt just intellectual curiosity with sneezy it wasnt even the jealousy of one kid toward another with a better toy there were almost moral questions involved perhaps almost religious ones both heechee and humans had learned how to supplement their own brains with machinestored intelligences but they went by different routes human beings had gone the way of calculators and computers and servomechanisms all the way to the supple and enormous gigabit webs that nurtured such artificial intelligences as albert einstein the heechee had never developed a they hadnt had to they had learned early on how to store the minds of their dead in machine form few heechee truly permanently died they wound up as ancient ancestors a human astronomer who desired to calculate the orbital elements of the planets of a doublestar system would as a matter of course turn the problem over to a computation facility a heechee would employ a battery of dead ancestors as a practical matter one system worked as well as another but it was not entirely a practical matter humans didnt revere their computers heechee ancient ancestors on the other hand deserved and demandeda kind of respect sneezys mother came in while his father was still bathing she listened to his questions and said rubbing the back of his neck mter dinner sterny all right it takes a lot out of your father when hes on extra shifts in the dream seat and then of course hes worried sneezy gaped worried fatigued yes sneezy expected that that was the price a watcher paid sitting in the dream seat for hours on end trying to sense some alien presence always fearing that he might some day succeedas some day surely someone would with consequences no one could guess but worried when at last the cookthing had dinner on the table and his parents were restored and almost relaxed bremsstrahlung said heavily it was not a planned drill sternutator two shift watchers thought they detected something so the emergency was called he writhed his forearms like a shrug what they felt is very uncertain it was not clear not strongbut they are good watchers of course there had to be a shutdown sneezy stopped eating knife halfway to his mouth his father said quickly but i felt nothing at all when i came on i am sure of that no one else did then either there have been false alarms before femtowave said hopefully to be sure thats why there are so many of us to make sure such alarms are false it may be a million years before the assassins come out you know who can tell bremsstrahlung finished his meal quickly then sat back on his pouch now sternutator what are your questions about your human friend oniko sneezy rolled his eyes slowly oh yes he had had a million questions but the thought that maybe there had been a real signal of emerging assassins had driven all of them out of his mind false alarm all right but how did any watcher know for certain that any alarm was false but those were the questions his father obviously did not want to discuss sneezy searched and came up with one of the things that had been troubling father it is not just the pod oniko has so much money why are they so rich he used the english words although they had been speaking heechee since their own tongue had no such concepts bremsstrahlung shrugged his wide wiry shouldersit was the heechee equivalent of a frown human beings he said as though it explained everything it did not yes father sneezy said but not all human beings have so much wealth no of course they do not his father said these particular humans chanced to acquire some heechee devices some of our property sterny they didnt even seek it out they simply discovered it by chance and in human practice that gave them ownership which they then traded for money femtowave said pacifyingly as far as they knew the devices were abandoned of course she ticked her tongue to the cookthing which removed the used utensils and served up their dessert it wasnt pie or ice cream it was one of a variety of ropy vines the heechee ate which both cleared their palates and lubricated their teeth antiseptically after a meal the concept of money isnt without value femtowave added since it functions as a sort ot rough servomechanism for social prioritysetting bremsstrahlung picked a fiber out of his teech and said indignantly are you proposing that heechee should take up the same system no no bremmy all the same it is interesting interesting he groaned foolish i would say whats the use of money dont we have everything we need without it not as much as oniko has sneezy put in wistfully bremsstrahlung put down his eating knife and gazed at the boy in despair when he spoke it was not to his son but to his wife do you see he demanded do you see what is happening to our son here the next thing you know hell be asking for an allowance and the crying shame he said unconsciously using the english expression since heechee didnt cry is that we are older and wiser than they how did we get ourselves into a position where we accommodate our ways to theirs femtowave glanced from her husband to her son both were upset in the boys case she was sure mostly because bremsstrahlung was in her husbands case the reasons were graver bremmy dear she said patiently whats the use of worrying about these things we knew what exposing our son to human values meant we talked it over before we left the core yes in five minutes altogether said her husband moodily five minutes was all the time we had femtowave leaned down to whisper to her pod obediently it caused the housething to rearrange the wall images of their room the pleasing monochrome traceries faded and the nostalgic mural of home with its pavilions and terraces overlooking the bays and majestic hills surrounded them sneezy wont forget she said reassuringly really i wont father the boy said his voice tremulous no no of course bremsstrahlung said heavily they finished their dessertweed in silence then when the housething had cleared everything away they communed with the ancestors for a while letting the weary old dead ones talk complain advise it was a very heechee thing to do slowly bremsstrahlung calmed down by sneezys bedtime he felt quite restored sleep now my son he said affectionately yes father said sneezy then father what is it do i have to keep on sleeping in a cocoon cant i have a real bed with blankets and pillows his father looked at him with puzzlement before he began to look at him with outrage a bed he began and femtowave moved to cut off the explosion before it could get started now please sternutator she said not one more word go sneezy injured went off to his room to glower at the cocoon and its dense soft litter it was embarrassing to sleep in something like that when all the other boys had beds he climbed in pulled the cocoon closed over him turned around ten or twelve times to mold the litter to his liking and fell asleep his parents were unslinging the hammocks in the other room preparing for their own sleep bremsstrahlung was silent his belly tendons rippling in displeasure femtowave seeing changed the murals again the lovely pastels disappeared on every wall there was now blackness with a few objects visible to one side the great sprinkled sprawl of the galaxy to the other the cluster of fuzzy sulfurcolored objects that were their reason for being there dont you see my dear she said none of this matters in comparison with the great purpose we serve we must never forget why our people removed to the core in the first placeand why we have come out again bremsstrahlung gazed unhappily at the smoky roiling mass some things do matter he answered stubbornly fairness always matters his wife said gently yes bremmy fairness always matters but in comparison with the assassins it doesnt matter very much theres not a great deal more to say about the children just now they had an interesting and happy life on the wheelfor a while being much of an age the three of them spent much time together they did interesting things they explored the lungs of the wheel where tangles of leafy vines grew on the wastes from the sinks and toilets of the wheel and sopped up the carbon dioxide both human and heechee bodies exhaled they toured the workshops where anything at all could be fixed from a toy to the wheels tiny fleet of spacecraft femtowave worked there and fondly showed the children around they poked into the spacecraft themselves hanging in their docking teats like puppies nursing they peered into the library with its tens of millions of socketed and indexed data fans there on those racks were all the stories humans had ever told and all the memories of the heechee ancestors and all the dictionaries and compilations and texts of either racewell not really all but enough to overwhelm sneezy harold and oniko they visited the zoo where cats and cows and monkeys and heechee pets and exotics grazed or hung from bars or rested chin on paw to stare back at the staring children there were only a few dozen organisms represented but for most of the children they were the only nonsentient beings they had ever seen they even visited the dream seats children were rarely allowed there but sneezys father guaranteed their behavior so one day on bremsstrahlungs time off they were permitted to gaze at the emplacements from a safe distance it was a thrilling experience the seats were sited in clusters of four every three hundred meters or so around the external perimeter of the wheel each cluster was in a little bubble of crystal made of a substance that was transparent not only to light but to every other form of electromagnetic radiation was that necessary no one could say for sure but perhaps it would helpanything that could make the task of the watchers more sure was worth doing even if there was only a remote chance it mattered as was normal when there was no drill only one seat in each group of four was occupied hold hands bremsstrahlung instructed and you can come just a little closer warily the children tiptoed within a meter of the onduty watcher a human female from another sector her eyes closed her ears stopped she almost looked asleep as they peered at her through the interstices of the glittering web of antennametal that surrounded her through the crystal they could see below thembelow by the geometry of the slowly spinning wheelspace itself including the distant muddy blob of the kugelblitz sneezys hand tightened watchfully on onikos he no longer was repelled by the touch of human fleshso lardy so springy so fat in fact he rather enjoyed holding her hand what surprised him was that she seemed rather to enjoy holding his since harold had not failed to let him know long since that to a human being the feel of hot hard writhing heechee flesh was equally distasteful perhaps oniko did not find it so or perhaps she was simply too polite to show it bremsstrahlung escorted them back to the public parts of the wheel when they had looked their fill then he returned to get ready for his own shift on the way back to their home area the children gabbled excitedly about what they had seen pausing only to be diverted by a class trip of tiny ones going to the aquarium for the first time the aquarium wasnt just a sort of museum much of the heechee diet was seafood and so was some of the human many of the animals in the tanks were sooner or later going to wind up on a table sneezy harold and oniko followed the little kids tolerant of their chatter amused by their reactions to the weird widemouthed seasnakes that heechee loved or the squid that were for human tables one of the squid was near the tank wall and as a threeyearold came close it flashed from white to mottled and ejected a plume of ink as it rocketed away the child jumped and gasped harold laughed oniko laughed and after a moment sneezy laughed too although of course the heechee laugh was not quite the same sound or rictus as the human silly little kid oniko said with maternal fondness i remember the first time i she did not finish there was a sudden squeal of warning from all over and the lights began to flash drill drill cried the schoolthings as everyone dropped at once to the floor harold managed a quick question why do we have a drill now he demanded of the nearest schoolthing lie still empty your mind it ordered but then it relented for just one second it is only a class two it said an unscheduled ship is approachingnow take your position and so they did all of them even the tiies but sneezy had trouble emptying his mind because there was a question yes of course when a ship came in there was always a class two drill that was not very frightening but never before in his experience bad a ship come in unscheduled and this ship was from jaws by the time the drill was over and sneezy was back in his parents home the unscheduled ship was secured and silent but it was still there and the rumors had flown like fire bremsstrahlung confirmed them yes sternutator he said with worry you must leave all children must the wheel is being evacu ated of everyone not an adult because we cant risk a child radiating at the wrong time i am second in my class in satori father of course you are but the joint assassin watch has ordered that you must go with the others please my son there is nothing we can do about it theyll take very good care of you femtowave put in but her voice was even hoarser with worry than his fathers but where will i go sneezy begged his parents looked to each other to a good place his mother said at last we dont know where yet you children all come from different places and i dont think they will get all of you to your proper homes at once but truly sterny you will be taken care of and it is only for a while until this false alarm is cleared up you will be back with us soon i hope that is true said his father and there was no time no time for any last visits to the zoo or the coconut grove or anywhere just one short session at the schoolhall so that each could pick up possessions and say goodbye to the schoolthing the schoolthing couldnt keep order that day it didnt try it only dealt with each student separately bidding a farewell making sure the lockers were emptied while all the other children chattered excitedly in anticipation and fear none of them knew where they were going yet harold of course was praying for his own home sneezy listened wistfully he wondered if he envied harold was peggys planet really the way harold pictured it summer all the time and no school and millions of hectares of wild fruits and berries to pick any time any day but its a long way harold was saying i bet ill have to change ships that means ill be a month getting home it would take me nearly three months sneezy said wistfully oh but thats because of your stupid schwarzschild barrier harold explained quite unnecessarily to a boy who had already penetrated it once you dont think youre going to go there do you dopey good heavens theyre not going to run a whole ship for a couple of heechee kids that would be just inefficient they wouldnt do that in that harold was right there were not that many children on the wheel and so the great earthbuilt ship that received them was going to only one place to earth harold was crushed oniko was fearful sneezy waswell sneezy did not know from one moment to the next what he was because the excitement and the pangs of leaving his parents and the nagging worry about what this sudden and unprecedented move meant all fought for dominance in his mind the result was only confusion they had less than twelve hours to board that was a good thing the less time for the excitement to melt away and the fears and miseries to grow the better at last they trooped one by one into the great interstellar vehicle as soon as the hundred new watchers and their gear had been taken off onikos parents were there hugging their daughter without words so were mr and mrs wroczek and sneezy politely looked away as harold began to cry at the parting goodbye father goodbye mother said sneezy goodbye dear sternutator said his father trying to keep the emotion out of his voice sneezys mother didnt even try it will be a nice place sterny dear she promised hugging him we wont be able to hear from you normally because theyve blacked out transmissions to the wheelbut oh sterny she hugged him hard heechee cant cry but there is nothing in their physiology or minds that keeps them from feeling loss as keenly as any human sneezy turned away it was not a heechee custom to kiss on parting but as sneezy entered the ship he wished that in this case an exception had been made albert speaks im albert einstein or at least robinette broadhead calls me that and i think i should clarify some matters with all his cutesy false starts robin has still failed to convey a good deal of data which i believe to be essential among others who the foe were i will help out thats what i do i help robinette broadhead i should explain my own situation to begin with im not the real albert einstein hes dead he died quite a good many years before it was possible at least for human beings to store a person as a database after the meat part wore out as a result we dont even have a real copy of that albert einstein around i am at most a rough approximation of what he might have been if he had been me what i really am is something quite different from any sort of reconstruction of a human being basically i am a simple dataretrieval system dressed up with some fancy touches for prettys sake the way people used to conceal a bedside communications phone inside a teddy bear in order to make me more userfriendly my user robinette requested that i should look like and act like a person so my programmer gave him me she was glad to do it she liked humoring robinette since she was not only his programmer but his wife s ya lavorovnabroadhead so the way i look and act is really only a whim of robins i think it is fair to say that robin is a man of many whims and many moods too im not disparaging him he cant help it robin started out organic for that reason he suffered the handicaps of all meat beings his intelligence was only what could be produced by sloppy biochemical means his mind was not precise and certainly not mathematical it was the product of a meat brain bathed in constant floods of hormones biased by sensory inputs like pain and pleasure and quite capable of screwing itself up over programming elements beyond my personal experience like doubt and guilt and jealousy and fear imagine living like that actually its a wonder to me that he functions as well as he does i dont see how i could myself but then i cant say i really understand these things since i have never felt them except in an analog sense that doesnt mean i cant deal with them essie broadheads programs can do damn near anything understanding is quite unnecessaryyou dont have to understand how a spacecraft works to get into it and push the buttons i can project how given stimuli will affect robins behavior at least as well as he can and i dont have to understand to do it after all i dont understand the square root of minus one either but that doesnt keep me from finding useful ways of employing it in equations it works e to the i times pi power equals it does not in the least matter that all the quantities involved are irrational transcendental imaginary or negative it doesnt matter that robin himself is all these things either he is all of them especially he is negative a good part of the time in ways that keep him from being that other irrational not to say transcendental state happy this is silly of him by every objective standard robinette broadhead has it made he has everything human beings desire he has vast wealthwell it is true that he does not now personally have the wealth since he is now machinestored and there are fussy human legal problems over ownership by dead people but the actual wealth is vested in his real wife and there is so much of it that if robin wants to spend a few hundred million here or there he has but to say the word he even uses the wealth wisely most of it he spends on the robinette broadhead institute for extrasolar research with its facilities in places like london brasilia johore peggys planet and a dozen locations in the old united states not to mention its fleet of exploration ships always busy poking around the galaxy because of this his life has purpose and he has a lot of power whats left health of course he has that if anything went wrong it would simply be corrected at once love certainly he has the best of all possible wives in s ya lavorovnabroadheadat least he has the machinestored simulation of her and the simulation is essentially perfect since s ya wrote her doppels program herself in short if ever a meat person or anyway former meat person had reason to be happy robin is that person this just shows that reason is not dominant in his psyche all too often he isnt happy at all his endless concerns and confusions about who he loved and what he nieant by love and whether he was being fair or faithful to his various love partners are typical examples for instance robin loved gelleklara moynlin both being meat people at the time they had a fight they made up then through an accident neither of them had any opportunity to prevent he abandoned her in a black hole for thirty years well that was a bad thing of course but it wasnt his fault yet it took him endless hours of couch time with my colleague the computer psychoanalyst sigfrid von shrink to relieve his mind of the guilt that had caused him so much pain irrational you bet but theres more meanwhile while klara was hopelessly out of reachas far as he knew foreverhe met and fell in love with and married my basic creator s ya lavorovna by any figure of merit i can find to assess such matters that was a fine thing but then klara reappeared when robin had to confront the fact that he loved both of them he simply went into fugue what made it worse was that he happened to die around the same time one would think that would simplify things it is obvious that these biological matters really should not have caused him any further concern he didnt have any biology anymore but no not robin broadhead robin is not hopelessly stupid either he is as aware as i that anthropologically speaking questions of fidelity and jealousy and sexual guilt have only to do with the biological fact that love implies intercourse which implies reproductionjealousy is at root only a question of ensuring that the child one raises is genetically ones own he knows that unfortunately he cant feel that even the fact that he never biologically fathered any children in the first place doesnt change anything what strange things meat people worry aboutand go on worrying about even when they have been promoted to nonmaterial existence like me but robin did worry a lot and when robin worried i worried too about him because thats one of the other things i was programmed to do i observe that i am becoming nearly as discursive as robin well that cant be helped like master like man as the old meatperson proverb sayseven when the man is a purely synthetic artifact of subroutines and databases like me we come now to the foe they were the race of intelligent beings nonmeat that the heechee had learned of the foe had wiped out at least four civilizations and damaged a couple of others it was apparent that they didnt like meat people of any kind it even appeared that they didnt like matter of any kind somehow even i did not know howthey had added so much mass to the universe that it was slowing its rate of expansion at some time in the future it would collapse back on itself and rebound the only logical inference was that then the foe would somehow so tamper with it that the next universe would be more hospitable to them viewed objectively this was an impressive and elegant project i was never able to make robin see that though he remained matteroriented because of his unfortunate background and the foe were still around locked away in their own black hole that atypical black hole that contained no matter but was a sink of energy there was a name for such a black hole it was called a kugelblitz when robin and i first met the heechee named captain and his crew it was traumatic for the heechee their way of dealing with the assassins had been to run away and hide they could not believe that human beings were so reckless as to choose any other course they told us what was going on and were shocked when we refused to follow their example when captain was at last convinced that humanity was going to keep our galaxy he recognized the inevitable he didnt like it but he accepted it he hightailed it back to the place where the heechee had run to when they perceived what a threat the foe were the great black hole at the core of the galaxy his errand was to tell the rest of the heechee that all their plans were ruined by this impudent race of human beings and to get them to help us this was a pretty urgent matter the heechee possessed enormous resources even though we had spent decades learning their technology and adding it to our own before ever living human laid eyes on living heechee there was bound to be much we didnt know about so captain promised to mobilize heechee help for usimmediatelyto help prepare for the day when the foe might come out to destroy a few more races of meat people unfortunately what immediately meant to the heechee was nothing like what immediately meant to useven if we include the pitifully slowmotion meat human beings as part of us the clocks in black holes run slow the timedilation factor at the core made them slower than human by a factor of about forty thousand to one fortunately immediately at least meant as soon as ever they possibly could and in fact they responded astonishingly fasteverything considered the first heechee vessel to pop out of their ergosphere turned up practically instantlythat is in only eighteen years the second came along only nine years after that the reason they could be so prompt was that they had maintained a number of ships on permanent standby alert and those first heechee to reach us were invaluable they were the ones who helped us build the watch wheel to stand on sentry duty at the kugelblitz and helped us locate all the caches and centers of mothballed heechee apparatus all over the galaxy including often enough mothballed human gateway prospectors who had got that far and couldnt get back i should i think tell you a little more about the annals of the heechee to explain just why they were so fearful as a matter of routine hundreds of heechee ships were constantly being deployed on voyages of exploration and discovery the heechee were as inquisitive as human beings and as stubbornly determined to find out everything that could be found there were a good many theoretical problems in science that made them itch to learn the answers what was the truth they wanted to know behind the missing massthe fact that all the observable matter in the universe did not seem to weigh enough to account for the observed motion of galaxies did protons really decay was there something before the big bang and if so what human scientists worried about all these questions too in the days before we met the heechee the heechee had a big advantage over those early humans they could go out and take a look so they did they sent out expeditions to study novae and supernovae and neutron stars and white dwarfs and pulsars they measured the flow of matter between pairs of close binaries and they metered the flux of radiation from the infall of gas around black holes they even learned to look inside the schwarzschild barrier around black holes a trick which led to some useful technology later on and i do not even speak of their equally great curiosity about the ways particles fit together to make atoms atoms joined into molecules and molecules became living things like themselves i can easily summarize exactly what it was that the heechee wanted in the way of knowledge they wanted it all but of all their quests none was more urgent or more assiduously pursued than the search for inteffigent life in the universe other than their own over time the heechee found a couple of examplesor almost did the first was a chance discovery that brought quick joy and almost instant disappointment a small icy planet hardly worth a second look in the normal course of events surprised them by showing some curious anomalies in its magnetic field no one was greatly interested at first then on a routine sweep a heecheemanned exploration ship checked out the reports from the instrumentonly robot investigators the planet was more than au from its parent notverybright k star certainly not the sort of place where you would expect life to develop its surface temperature was only about k and nothing stirred on its glacial surface but when the heechee investigators sounded the ice they found great masses of metal buried in it echoes showed the metal to be in regular shapes when excitedly the crew called for thermal borers and sent them down to investigate they found buildings factories machines and nothing living at all they faced the disheartening fact that once there had been intelligent life on that planet well up to early industrial standards by the remnants they disinterred but it was there no longer dating the ice cores showed that they were half a million years too late to find anyone alive and that wasnt the worst of it the worst was a finding by the geologists and geochemists that said inarguably that that particular planet could not have evolved in that particular orbit its composition was like that of venus the earth and mars the kind found only close to a primary something had hurled it so far from its sun that it froze of course it could have been some astronomical accident like the near passage of another star but none of the heechee could believe that then they found the second heartbreak it wasnt a heartbreak at once it was a bright hope that persisted for a long timemore than a century it began when a heechee vessel caught the scent of a radio transmission tracked it down and found a genuine incontestable artifact of a highly technological civilization traveling through interstellar space it did not have a living crew it couldnt have except perhaps for microbes the object was a vast gossamer metal spiderweb a thousand kilometers across but so fairysilk flimsy that the whole thing weighed less than a fingernail it did not take the heechee long to realize what they had where the wires joined were transistorlike things and strips of piezoelectric materials the object was a calculator it was also a computer a camera a radio transmitter all wonderfully crafted into a gauzy web you could crush into the palm of your hand it was a robot sailship propelled by light the proof was certain there was intelligent life in the universe like the heechee themselves not just intelligent life it was technological life starfaring life they understood at once that this was an ultralight interstellar probe a starwisp drifting out to explore the galaxy by radiation pressure surveying other stars and reporting back by radio to its makers on their home planet but where was the home planet the heechee ship had unfortunately failed to measure the precise alignment of the web when they captured it though they knew within a few degrees of where it had pointed those few degrees encompassed some hundred million stars far and near so for the next century every heechee ship that went into space wherever bound carried a dedicated radio receiver it was always on and it did nothing but listen for the song of another of those starwisps and they found them the first one was damaged its orientation no longer perfectbut even that limited the choices to only about a million stars an improvement of two orders of magnitude and then they found a fine new one in perfect working order zeroed in precisely swarms of heechee explorers pounced on that corner of the galaxy there were still a lot of stars to search but now only hundreds instead of millions they searched them all this one had no planets those two were close binaries where no planets could possibly support life even if planets had existed these others were too new and bright too young to have given life a chance to evolve and then there was this other one it wasnt prepossessing it was a cinder too small and dull to be even a neutron star true it was in the right place true it did have planets but it had been a nova hundreds of thousands of years before all its planets were scorched bare there was nothing left that could be called a living thing but on the fourth planet there was a line of rubble across a valley that had once been a dam a tunnel buried inside the collapsed sides of a mountainyes this had been the place the starwisps had come from and once again the heechee had got there too late it was almost as though the heechee thought someone had been going around the galaxy wiping out civilizations before the heechee could get to them or before those civilizations could get living representatives of themselves into interstellar space and then the heechee made one final terrifying discovery they sent out an expedition under a wonderful heechee female named tangent and the whole nightmare picture came together for them i wont tell you about tangent the reason for that is that sooner or later robin will he doesnt know that yet he doesnt know that he himself wifi hear it shortly from someone who knew it at first hand he would know that if he would let me tell him about this personor indeed about some other persons whose presence on gateway will matter greatly to him but robin can be quite obstinate when i try to tell him things he really ought to know that is the story i apologize for the discursions let me just add one thing it is not exactly irrelevant i implied a while ago that although i knew that e to the i times pi power equaled i didnt understand why i mean there is no intuitive reason why raised to the power of times the ratio between the circumference and the diameter of a circle should equal anything in particular at all much less a simple negative integer like minus one i wasnt quite open about that i dont exactly know why that is but i do have suspicions unfortunately they have to do with phenomena like the missing mass and the perplexing question of why we have only three perceptible dimensions in space instead of nine and robin simply wont listen to me when i talk about that either some parties at the party there was one place on gateway i absolutely had to see again after i got tired of brooding over all the things i had to brood over and hearing people say hey robinette youre looking great i went there it was called level babe quadrant east tunnel room and for several sick and scary months it had been my home i went there all by myself i didnt want to take essie away from her old leningrad buddy and anyway the part of my life that was wrapped up in that dirty little hole was not a part she had shared i stood gazing at it taking it all in i even actuated perceptors i dont usually bother with because i didnt want to just see it i wanted to smell and feel it it looked smelled and felt crummy and i almost drowned in the huge hot flood of nostalgia that washed over me room was the cubicle i had been assigned to when i first came to gatewayjesus decades and decades ago it had been cleaned out some and redecorated a lot it wasnt a hole for a scared gateway prospector to hide himself and his funk in any more now it belonged to some feeble old geriatric case who had come to wrinide rock because that was where he had the best chance of clinging to his wornout meat body a while longer it looked different theyd fixed it up with a real bed if a narrow one instead of my old hammock there was a shiny new pv comxnset mounted on the wall and a foldaway sink with actual running water and about a million other luxuries i hadnt had the geriatrics case had tottered off somewhere else to join the party no doubt anyway he wasnt there i had it all to myself all the closetsized claustrophobic luxury of it i took a deep breath that was another big difference the smell was gone theyd got rid of the old gateway lug that soaked into your clothes and skin the wellused air that everybody else had been breathingand sweating into and farting intofor years and years now it only smelled a little of green growing things no doubt from the plantings that helped the oxygenreplenishment system along the wails still glimmered with the heecheemetal shineblu only gateway had never had any of the other colors changes sure there had been changes but it was the same room and what a world of misery and worriment i had crammed into it id lived the way every gateway prospector livedcounting up the minutes until i would have to take a ifight any flight or be kicked off the asteroid because my money was gone poring over the lists of expeditions that were seeking crew members trying to guess which one might make me richor really trying to decide which one might at least not make me dead i had bedded gelleklara moynlin in that room when we werent doing it in her own i had cried myself crazy in it when i came back from the last mission i had shared with her without her it seemed to me that i had lived a longer life right there in those few lousy months i had spent on gateway than in all the decades since i dont know how many milliseconds i spent there in maudlin nostalgia time before i heard a voice behind me say well robin you know i had an idea i might find you mooning around here her name was sheri loffat i have to confess that glad as i was to see sheri again i was also glad that essie was busy hoisting a few with her old drinking buddy just then essie is not a jealous woman at all but she might have made an exception for sheri loffat sheri was peering in at me through the narrow doorway she looked not a minute older than the last time id seen her more than half a century back she was looking a whole lot better than she had then in fact because then she was just out of the hospital after a mission that had gone sour in every way but financial now she was looking one other thing besides good she was looking extremely appetizing because what she was wearing apart from a broad grin was nothing but a knitted shirt and a pair of underwear panties i recognized the outfit immediately like it she asked leaning in to kiss me i put it on just for you remember i answered indirectly i said im a married man now that was to set the record straight but it didnt keep me from kissing her back as i said it well who isnt married she asked reasonably ive got four kids you know not to mention three grandchildren and a greatgrand i said my god i leaned back to look at her she wriggled her way in the doorway and hooked herself by the scruff of her tee shirt to a hook on the wail that was just what we used to do sometimes when we were still meat and gateway was the doorway to the universe because the asteroids rotational gravity was so light that hanging was more comfortable than sitting i did like the outfit i was not likely to forget it it was exactly what sheri had been wearing the first time she came into my bed i didnt even know you were dead i said to welcome her she looked uncomfortable with the subject as though she hadnt quite got used to it it only happened last year of course i didnt look quite this young then so being dead isnt a total loss she put her fingers on her chin studying me up and down she commented i keep seeing you on the news robin youve done well so did you i said remembering you went home with five or six million dollars didnt you from that heechee toolbox you found more like ten million when you counted in the royalties she smiled rich lady she shrugged i had a lot of fun with it bought myself a couple of counties of ranchland on peggys planet got married raised a family died it was pretty nice all right not counting the last part but i wasnt just talking about money though youve obviously got plenty of that what do they say the richest man in the universe i should have hung on to you while i had the chance i had realized shed come down off the hook to get closer now i discovered i was holding her hand sorry i said letting go sorry for what the answer to that was that if she needed to ask the question she wouldnt understand the answer but i didnt have to say so she sighed i guess im not the lady youve got on your mind right now well oh thats all right robin honest it was just a kind of foroldtimessake thought stifi she went on honestly im a little surprised you arent with her and that guywhats his name sergei borbosnoy but she shook her head impatiently no nothing like that its wait a minuteyes eskladar harbin eskladar i blinked at her because i knew who harbin eskladar was hed been pretty famous once not that id ever met him certainly i hadnt wanted to at least not at first because harbin eskladar had been a terrorist and what would my dear portableessie be doing with an exterrorist but sheri was going right on of course i guess you move in pretty high society these days i know you knew audee walthers and i guess youre tight with glare and all those others glare i was having trouble keeping up with sheri but that stopped me cold although shed said it in english it was a heechee name she looked at me with surprise you didnt know gosh robin maybe one time im ahead of you didnt you see the heechee ship dock and suddenly the party began to seem as though it might be fun again id seen the heechee ship all right but it had never occurred to me that there might be heechee on it i dont think it was polite of me to duck out like that by the look on her face sheri didnt think so either but i was glad of the excuse i dont like to put too much of a strain on essies wonderful absence of jealousy and although i said see you soon when i kissed sheri goodbye i didnt mean it in gigabit space and alone again i hollered for albert he was there before i knew it yes i said with annoyance you didnt tell me there were heechee on the rock what are they doing here he smiled placidly at me scratching his ankle as to the second question they have every right to be here robin this party is a reunion for people who were on gateway long ago after all all three of these heechee have very long ago as to the first part he let himself look putupon ive been trying to tell you about some of the persons you would be interested in for quite some time robin i didnt think it would be tactful of me to interrupt if i may now you may now tell me about these heechee i already know about eskladar oh for a moment albert looked nonplussed it is not an expression i often see on him then he said obediently the heechee ship came direct from the core and the three particular heechee who i think would interest you are named muon barrow and glare it is especially glare who is of interest for she was a shipmate of tangent on the expedition to the sluggard planet that woke me right up tangent exactly yes robin he beamed in addition i want to see them i said waving him quiet where are they theyre on level jane robin in the old gymnasium its a recreation room now but maynt i also tell you about the others eskladar you know about and i suppose you know about dane metchnikov too and first things first albert i commanded rightnow i want to see somebody who actually knew tangent he looked stricken please at least the message from mrs broadhead he hadnt mentioned a message before well sure i said what are you waiting for he looked indignant but what he saidin exactly essies tone with exactly essies inflectionswas tell old gloopy robin is okay see old sweetheart but only look dont touch i think i may have started to flush i dont think albert could have seen it though because i waved him away as he finished speaking and i was on my way to level jane so conscience doth make cowards of us all and make us deaf too even to things we really ought to hear ill put a girdle round the earth in forty milliseconds whenever i want to so to get from level babe down to level jane took basically no time at all especially since i wasnt really on level babe in the first place and wasnt on level jane when i got there but what seems like no time at all to a meat person can be quite a stretch for somebody like me i had time to wonder about a couple of things had i heard right was my wife essie actually with harbin eskladar true the time of terrorism was long over all of those monstrous peo pie who burned and bombed and destroyed were long irretrievably dead or in prison or reformed and the reformed ones like harbin esldadar were after all back in the population theyd paid their debt to society the thing was i couldnt believe that essie would have thought they had paid their debt to her never mind that their fooling around had very nearly killed her twice and had had every intention of killing us both a third time but had missed it wasnt a personal matter with essie it was exactly the same as with me the terrorists that had blighted the already miserable earth back in the days when there wasnt enough of anything to go around and thousands of twisted people tried to redress the situation by making sure there was less of everything for everybody were not mere criminals they were filth it was true that eskladar had finally come over to the side of the good guys in the white hats had even turned in some of the biggest and rottenest of th leaders thus saving a lot more lives and property than he himself had ever damaged but still when i saw the three heechee i forgot about eskladar fortunately they werent meat they were ancient ancestors and that was good because it meant i could talk to them i would not have known the place they were in if albert hadnt mentioned that once it had been the gateway gymnasium it didnt look like a gymnasium anymore it was a sunny little room with tables and chairs and there were people all over it the human people had drinks in their hands the heechee dont drink they nibble things in the same manner and for the same reasons what they like are sort of mushroomy growths with a high intoxication index and these heechee had fiat bowls of the nibblestuff in front of them hello i said breezily sliding up close im robinette broadhead i do get a certain amount of deference the people around made room for me ungrudgingly and the female of them flexed her wrists in courteous greeting we had hoped to meet you of course she said we know your name for every heechee does they had learned the custom of shaking hands and we did it these ancient ancestors were fresh out of the corehad started nearly eleven years ago by our clocks but only a matter of weeks by theirs most of that time had been spent crossing deep space from the core to earth i intimated my surprise at seeing heechee on what i had always considered private property of the human race and one of the machinestored humans said oh but theyve got every right to be here mr broadhead every person who ever served on gateway was included in the invitation to this party and each one of them did serve here once now that was a creepy feeling because the last previous time a living heechee had been on gateway was something like years in the past so youre the ones who left us the ships i said smiling as i lifted a glass to them they responded by holding bits of mushrooms between fingertips aimed generally in my direction and the female said muon left what you call the food factory out in your what you call the oort cloud yes barrow actually left the ship on your planet venus that your sylvester macklen discovered i left nothing i only visited this system once but you were with tangent i began and felt a tap on my shoulder i turned and there was my dear portableessie robin dear she began tore yourself away from harbin eskladar have you i said genially im glad youre here this is glare she was shaking her head in puzzlement have not been with this harbin eskladar is no matter wish to make sure you are aware you didnt understand i said all excited this is tangent were talking about could you tell us about that trip glare if you wish and essie said but please robin is certain matters to be considered in this matter dane metchnikov has requested lawyer that halted me for a moment because i had put dane metchnikov so far out of my mind that i hadnt thought of the reasons why he might want to talk to a lawyer about me it was a downer but i shrugged later my darling please essie sighed and i prepared myself for the story you cant blame me really the story of tangent was important if it hadnt been for her expedition everything would have been very different not just heechee history all history in fact human history might have been so different that there might well never have been any so i put everything aside to hear glares story of that famous voyage and i didnt give another thought to whose presence on the asteroid the presence of dane metchnikov implied the tide at its crest the heechee were great explorers and in all the annals of the heechee the most famous voyage of all was tangents it was a wellplanned trip and it had a wonderful leader tangent was very wise it was her wisdom as a matter of fact that caused the heechee to run away from the gateway asteroid and nearly everything else it wasnt hard for tangent to be wise she had her own considerable knowledge and experience plus those of the living members of her crew like glare and best of all she had twelve or thirteen dead people to contribute their smarts to her own to all this she added an awful lot of courage enterprise and compassion you would have liked hernot counting that she did look pretty funny to human eyes she couldnt help that of course being a heechee when i say tangent was an explorer i dont mean that she went hunting for new bits of geography like magellan or captain cook tangents explorations didnt involve geography at all long before tangent was born the heechees huge spacegoing telescopes had done all the geography the heechee would ever need they had spied out every star and nearly every planet in all the galaxyseveral hundred billion pieces of geography in all every one photographed and spectroscoped and catalogued in the central datastores so tangent didnt have to trouble herself with maps and surveys she had more interesting things to think about what tangent explored was creatures living beings tangents mission was to study the organic things that inhabited some of that geography the other thing to remember about tangent is that by heechee standards she was breathtakingly beautiful i dont personally happen to share heechee standards heechee look like heechee to me and i wouldnt marry one on a bet to me tangent would have looked like something out of my childhood in the food mines in wyoming the way we celebrated halloween in my childhood was with pumpkins and goblins and one of the most popular figures pulled out of the closet every october by every gradeschool teacher was a cardboard skeleton arms and legs jointed skullfaced every bone articulated tangent looked a lot like one of those figures except that she was real she actually lived you couldnt see between her bones like all the heechee her bones were covered by a tough dense muscled skin about as voluptuous to the touch as an acorn squash because she was female she was baldmales sometimes had a little fur on their scalps females almost never she had eyes that no popular songwriter would ever find rhymes for because basically they looked terrible the pupils were blotchy blue and the overall color of the eyes was more or less pink her limbs were about as thick as a sixyearold famine victims though nowhere near that sexyto a human being anyway her pelvis was wide her legs came down off the ends of it and between those pipestem legs she wore the typical heechee survival kit that was a pearshaped pod that generated the microwave flux that they needed to stay healthy as terrestrial plants need sunlight and in addition contained all sorts of useful or merely enjoyable tools and sundries including the stored minds of dead ancestors which the heechee used instead of computers sounds ravishing doesnt it no it doesnt but beauty is in the eyes of the cultural norm to heechee eyes especially to male heechee eyes tangent was a knockout to heechee ears even her name was kind of sexy she had taken the name tangent as all heechee got their adult names as soon as she was old enough to show an interest in any abstract thing in her case the interest was in geometry but the heechee language provided many opportunities for puns and plays on words and she was quickly called by a nickname a word very much like tangent which can roughly be translated as thatwhichcausesdroopingthingstostraighten none of this had anything to do with her qualifications as a leader of exploration parties but those were equally impressive she was a credit to the heechee race this made the fact that she had a large part to play in their downfall even more traumatic on tangents historic trip her command was a huge heechee ship it carried instruments and devices of a thousand kinds and a crew of ninetyone that included glare who was the penetration pilot it wasnt just a very large ship it was a very special one tangents ship was purposedesigned and its purpose was tailored to her special needs it could land on a planet hardly any heechee interstellar ships could do that or ever needed to they were designed to go into orbit around a planet and leave the problems of reentry and takeoff to specialized landing craft tangents was an exception it would not exactly land because the planet she was investigating hardly had a solid core to land on apart from a lump of metallic hydrogen kilometers inside its freezing crushing slushy atmosphere but it had something more important to the heechee it had life there was life on tangents ship too every member of the crew of ninetyone was a specialist in one of the many varied kinds of operations that would be required my new friend glare for instance the penetration pilot was the one who would guide the ship down into the frigid sludgy dense atmosphere of the sluggard planet it was a skill few heechee had and her training had been extensive so there was a lot of life on that ship and lusty roaring life at that the heechee werent emotionless machines in their own peculiar heechee way they were as horny and as temperamental as human beings this occasionally made problems for them just as it does for humans the three male heechee who constituted tangents particular problem in that respect were named quark angstrom and searchandsay i dont mean you to believe that these were their precise names even if you were to translate them literally from the heechee those are just as close as i know how to come quark was named after a subatomic particle angstrom was named after a color of that wavelength and searchandsay was a command given to their ancestral databases when they wanted to find out what was available tangent thought they were a neat bunch of guys among the three of them they embodied all the heechee manly virtues quark was brave angstrom was strong and searchandsay was gentle any one of them would have made a fine mate since tangents mating time was coming up it was good that a male was available who would make a perfect mate the heechee race was at the crest of its flood tide there is nothing in human history that approaches the vastness and majesty of the heechee epic dutch merchants spanish dons and english queens centuries ago sent adventurers out to capture slaves collect spices mine gold to discover and to loot all of the unexplored world but that was only one single world the heechee conquered billions of worlds now that has a cruel sound the heechee were not cruel they deprived no natives of anything they valued not even clay tablets or cowrie shells for one thing it wasnt necessary the heechee never had to enslave a native population to extract precious ores it was much easier to locate an asteroid of the proper composition then tow it to a factory that would swallow it whole and excrete finished products they didnt even need to grow exotic foods or rare spices or pharmaceuticals heechee chemistry could sample any organic matter and duplicate it from its elements the other reason they werent ruthless toward natives is that there almost never were any natives in all the galaxy the heechee found fewer than worlds with life anywhere above the prokaryote stage and of planets inhabited by civilized sentients comparable to themselves none at all there were a few near misses one of the near misses was the good old planet earth they missed because the time was out of joint they were about half a million years too early on earth the closest thing to intelligence at that time was inside the hairy sloped skull of a stooped and smelly little primate we now call australopithecus too soon the heechee mused regretfully when they found them so they took a few samples and went away another near miss was a handless tubby creature that lived in a swill on the planet of an f star not far from canopus if they werent exactly intelligent they had evolved at least as far as superstition there were vanished traces of extinct civilizations here and there some of them puzzlingly fragmentary there were a number of potentially interesting ones that might be expected to reach the point of social institutions some time in the next million years and then there were the ones tangent was investigating now they called them the sluggards the sluggards were really quite intelligent they had machines they had governments they had a languagethey even had poetry the sluggards were not the only race the heechee had found with some of such things but they were by all odds the most promising if only one could talk to them so tangents ship settled itself in orbit and the explorers gazed down at the turbulent planet below said angstrom to tangent uglylooking planet it reminds me of the place where the voodoo pigs lived remember i remember tangent said fondly in fact she remembered well enough that she let herself lean against angstroms exploring hand which was delicately tweaking the ropy tendons of her back in the way she knew well said searchandsay jealously it is not in the least like that planet that one was hot this one freezes gases on this one we couldnt breathe even if it were warm enough because the methane would poison us while among the voodoo pigs we could walk about even without masksexcept for the smell anyway tangent touched angstrom affectionately but we didnt mind the smell did we she asked then considering she stroked searchandsay as well although she was missing nothing of the view of the planet and was quite aware of the clicks and wheeps of the ships sensors which were busy drinking in data from the instruments that had been left on the planet many years before she also missed nothing of the sexual innuendos tangent said kindly both of you have work to doquark too and so do i lets do it actually the eightyseven crew members not directly involved were rather touched by tangents romance they liked her they wished her well besides all the heechee world loved lovers just like ours by the end of the second day of the voyage searchandsay reported peevishly that the ancestors were not only ready but positively clamorous to talk to tangent she sighed and took her seat in the control cabin what she was sitting on mostly was her pod her seat was so constructed that her pod was plugged in directly to all the ancestral pods on the ship it was a useful arrangement it wasnt always a comfortable one the ancient ancestors had neither sight nor hearing being only stored intelligences in a databank just like me but the brightest and most experienced of them learned to read the electronflow of optics or instrumentation almost as well as with ears and eyes the most senior ancestor aboard was a longdead male named flocculence flocculence was a vip he was the most valuable person aboardperhaps even more valuable than tangent herselfbecause before his death floeculence had actually visited this planet tangent opened her ears to the ancestors there was an immediate babble of voices every ancestor in the ships store wanted to talk the only one of them that had the right to talk just then though was flocculence he quickly hushed the others i have been monitoring the recordings he said at once nine of the recording channels we left in place have no datai dont yet know if they malfunctioned or if the sluggards simply never visited those locations the other fiftyone however are full they average nearly three hundred thousand morphemes each but thats a lot cried tangent delighted thats almost a whole bookequivalent for each channel more flocculence corrected her for the sluggard language is extremely compact listen i will replay a section of one of the recordings there was a faint low hooting soundtangent did not so much hear it as feel it in her bones and now the same recording speeded up and frequencyshifted to a normal bitrate for us the hooting became a quick shrill twittering tangent listened with impatience it hurt her ears have you translated any of it she asked less for informationshe knew that if there had been any major breakthroughs she would have been notified at oncethan to make the noise stop but surprisingly the ancient ancestor crowed oh yes much in listening post seventeen there was what i think you would call a political meeting it has to do with the nature of the site itself it is either theologically sacred or dangerously polluted and the sluggards were discussing what to do about it the debate is still going on after sixtyone years well only about seven hours of their time tangent good good tangent said happily it was a major victory there were few better ways of gaining insight into a culture than through studying its modes of settling public questions and youre sure thats what it is are your translations reliable oh said flocculence doubtfully fairly reliable i wish we had binding force here with us binding force was flocculences former partner in many investigations the two of them had made a wonderful team some day no doubt they would again but for the moment binding force was far too ancient to go into space again and too healthy to die how reliable is fairly reliable well at least half our sluggard vocabulary is words deduced from context i could be deducing wrong unlucky for you if you are tangent snapped and then immediately caught herself im sure youre doing a fine job she soothed and hoped it was true glare hadnt been on flocculences first trip but before she shipped out with tangent she had learned quite a lot about the sluggards for that matter everybody had the sluggards were after all really quite important to the heechee as important say as a diagnosis of cancer would have been to any human before full medical came along the sluggards possessed an ancient civilization in terms of years it was far older even than the heechees own but that didnt really signify because nothing much had happened in it what did happen happened very slowly the sluggards planet was cold the sluggards themselves were both cold and sluggishthat was how they got their name they swam slowly through a slush of gases the chemistry of their bodies was as tedious as their movements and so was their speech so was the propagation of impulses through their nervous systems which is to say their thoughts so when that first heechee expedition could no longer doubt that these slushy creepy creatures possessed intelligence they were both delighted and ticked off what was the use of discovering another intelligent race at last if so simple an exchange as take me to your leader which leader could take six months to complete that first heechee discovery ship lingered in orbit around the sluggard planet for a year flocculence and binding force dropped sondes into the sludgy atmosphere and painfully built up a slow recognition of discrete sounds that was the first step toward a vocabulary it wasnt easy it certainly wasnt simple the sondes were dropped more or less at random aiming only at spots where the deepprobe radars and sonars had identified clusters of beings often the clusters were gone by the time the sondes got there the ones that were best aimed recorded slow deep moans transmitters passed the sounds into orbit recording experts speeded them up and transposed them down to the audible range and after weeks each tape might produce a single word but heechee semanticists had many resources at the end of their year in orbit they had identified enough of a vocabulary to prepare a simple tape then they constructed a graven tablet with a picture of a heechee a picture of a sluggard a picture of a sound playback unit and a picture of the tablet itself all the images were incised on flat surfaces of crystal so that the sluggards could feel themthey were after all blind then the heechee duplicated the lot sixty times and dropped a set into each of sixty sluggard population centers the tapes read greetings we are friends talk to this and we will hear we will answer soon soon in that context meant a good long time when that was done the heechee ship left the crew was somewhat glum there was no sense waiting around for an answer the best thing was to come back when the sluggards had had time to discover the messages get over the initial shock and respond even then there would be an inevitable longish period of dumb questions and timewasting answers but they didnt need a live heechee for that they chose their least valuable ancient ancestor explained to her what sorts of questions might be asked and what sorts of answersand urgings and counterquestionsshould be returned and left her in orbit to spend a dismal few decades in solitude every heechee in the crew wished he could be there to get those answers but few could feel very confident of doing ittheir best guess was that to get any solid information from the sluggards would take more than half a century as indeed it did twenty days after arrival in orbit around the sluggard planet tangent was as ready for the real work of the expedition as she ever would be the ancient ancestor they had left behind was unfortunately no longer operational but she had served her purpose questions had been asked and answered and the data was in store radar or the heechee device that did for the heechee what radar had done for human beings had located the present positions of the physical clusters that marked sluggard communities as well as other objects solid enough and large enough to constitute navigation hazards ftl radio contact had been made with the home planets and the data transmitted and frail old binding force had sent a cheery message approving their translation attempts and urging them on the special structures on tangents ship that would allow it to carry out its main mission had been checked and tested and reported ready there was one other heechee device which they had hoped would serve them well but it was a disappointment that was a sort of communications instrument what it transmitted and received was a special sort of datawell what you might call feelings it neither transmitted nor received information in the classical senseone could not use it to order another thousand kilotons of structural metal or to command a ship to change its course but one heechee wearing the appropriate metalmesh helmet could hear the emotions of others even at planetary distances it was what we came to call the dream seat for the heechee the main domestic use of the device was for what passed among them as police work the heechee didnt detect crimes they prevented them the emanations from a mind so disordered as to be about to commit an antisocial act a violent act in particular could be detected in the early stages a counselingandintervention team was then dispatched at once to apply corrective therapy the dream seats had also been very helpful in deciding that for instance the voodoo pigs were close enough to inteffigent to bear watching because their feelings were far more complex than those of the lower animals so it was a standard heechee resource instrument in that fundamental heechee quest for interstellar companionship it had been hoped that tangents orbiting spacecraft could simply listen in on the sluggards and hear their moods and anxieties and joys the dream seat did work as a matter of fact it just didnt work in any very useful way as with everything else the sluggards did their emotions were hopelessly slow said quark glumly pulling off the head set you might as well be listening to how a sedimentary rock feels about metamorphosis keep trying tangent instructed when at last we understand the sluggards it will all be worthwhile later on she remembered saying that and wondered how she could have been so wrong ive told you an awful lot about tangent and her shipmates and i havent yet told you why it all matters trust me it mattered a lot not only to tangent and to the whole heechee race but to humanity in general and most especially to me in particular but good old albert tells me i talk too much and so ill try to keep to essentials the essentials were that tangent and her crew did what heechee ships almost never did they took their specially armored spacecraft and dived it down into the dense frigid damaging gases of the sluggard planet in order to visit the sluggards on their home turf turf isnt the right word eitheri have a lot of trouble finding right words because the vocabulary i learned as a meat person on earth really doesnt apply anymore the sluggards didnt have turt in the sense of plots of land to build on they didnt have any land their specific gravity was so close to the specific gravity of the gases they lived in that they floated along with all their household goods their households and their sluggard equivalents of factories farms offices and schools and of course neither human nor heechee could live in that environment unprotected although the heechee were careful engineers there was at least a nagging worry that even their ship might fail in the crushing pressures where the sluggards lived so before they entered the planets atmosphere they checked and rechecked and doublechecked everything there was to check flocculence and the other ancient ancestors had to do double duty not only keeping up with their work of translation but storing and analyzing all the data about the ships own systems are we ready tangent asked at last seated at the captains stool in the control room webbing herself in as did all the others one by one the section chiefs reported readiness and she took a deep breath i would commence descent now she said to the penetration pilot glare glare ordered the steerperson commence descent the ship slowed its orbital speed and slipped down into the cold thick swirling poison gases the sluggards swam in entry was bouncy but the ship had been built for that navigation was blind at least optically speaking but the ship had sonar and elec tromc eyes and on the screens in the room they could see the shapes of clusters of sluggard homes and other objects as they approached i would not go so fast tangent cautioned because of the risk of cavitation glare agreed slow down she ordered and the great ship inched toward the nearest sluggard arcology the whole crew watched the screens with awe and delight sludgy objects began to appear there were structures like clouds and creatures like the softplastic toys shaped like amoebae or jellyfish that children play with the sluggards were almost as still as their buildings all of the females and most of the males moved so slowly that no heechee eye could see a change only a few of the males going into what they called high mode now and then exhibited visible motion and more and more of the males did that as the ship approached and their torpid senses let them know that something or other seemed to be happening that was when tangent made her first mistake she assumed that the movement of the males was because they were startled at the sudden appearance of the heechee ship heaven knows that must have startled themlike a highspeed lander suddenly appearing over a primitive human village that had never seen a spacecraft or even an airplane before but it wasnt startlement that sent the males lashing about so fast and destructively it was pain the highfrequency sound the heechee ship steered by was agony to the sluggards it drove them out of their minds and before long the weaker of them died of it could the heechee ever have really satisfied their yearning for interstellar friends with the sluggards i dont see how my own experience says no it was as hard for heechee to communicate with sluggards as it is for us stored persons to get into any meaningful realtime relationship with meat people its not impossible its generally just more trouble than its worth and when i talk to meat people at close range they dont usually die of it after that it wasnt a happy ship anymore the expectation had been so delicious the letdown was mean it got worse the mission was teetering on the verge of failure though the sondes continued to trickje words into the recorders the attempts to approach sluggards in their homes were always both catastrophic and disappointingdisappointing for the heechee catastrophic for their new friends and then in orbit there came the news from home it was a message from binding force and what he said with the testiness of age and the resentment of one who wishes he had been present was in free translation youve screwed it up the important parts of the data were not customs and polity of the sluggards it is their poetry the shipboard ancient ancestors had recognized the poetry as poetryas a sort of combination of the songs of the great whales and the old norse eddas of earth like the eddas they sang of great battles of the past and the battles were important the songs were of creatures who had appeared without bodies and had caused great destruction the sluggards called them the equivalent of assassins and according to binding force they were in fact without bodieswere creatures of energy had in fact really appeared and caused great destruction what you thought were mere legends scolded binding force in his message were not about gods and devils they are straightforward accounts of an actual visit by creatures that seem totally hostile to all organic life and there is every reason to believe they are still around that was the first time the heechee had ever heard of the foe loves by the time glare finished her story there was quite a crowd gathered around every one of them had questions but it took a moment for them to get the questions together glare sat silent rubbing her rib cage the movement made a faint grating noise like someone running a finger across a washboard a short black man i didnt know said excuse me but i dont understand how did tangent know that was the foe he was speaking in english and i realized that someone had been translating glares story all along the someone was albert while he was translating the short mans question into heechee for glare i gave him a look he shrugged in response meaning well i wanted to hear the story too glare was shrugging too in response to the questionat least she was giving her abdomen that quick contraction that is the heechee equivalent we didnt know she said that came later after binding force had performed deepstructure analysis on the sluggard eddas then it became clear that these intruding assassins were not from that planet of course there was much other data of course albert chimed in the missing mass for one thing yes said glare the missing mass this had been a great puzzle for our astrophysicists for some time as i believe it had been for yours she reached thoughtfully for another of the little fungus caps while albert explained to the others how the missing mass had turned out to be no natural cosmic phenomenon but an artifact of the foe and at that point i stopped listening i hear plenty of that kind of thing from albert all the time i stop listening a lot then too hearing glare tell us the story of tangents terrible trip was one thing that was a story i could listen to with full attention but when albert gets into the why of things my mind wanders next thing he would be getting into ninedimensional space and machs hypothesis he did glare seemed quite interested i wasnt i leaned back waved to the waitress for another shot of rocket juicethe damn near lethal white whiskey that gateway prospectors had drowned their worries in in the old daysand let him talk i wasnt listening i was thinking about poor horny tangent all those hundreds of thousands of years ago and her illfated trip ive always had a soft spot in my heart for tangentwell thats not exactly true either there are those words again how inaccurately they convey meaning i dont have a heart so of course there are not any soft spots in it and always isnt exact either because ive only known about tangent for about thirty or perhaps i should say thirty million years but i do think of her often and with sympathy because id been shot down too and i knew how it felt i took a pull of my rocket juice gazing benevolently at the group around the table the rest of the audience was a lot more fascinated than i had been by the way albert and glare exchanged cosmological quips but then they hadnt had albert living in their pockets for the last fifty years in that time you get to know a program pretty well i reflected that generally speaking i knew what albert was going to say before he said it i even knew the significance of the way he looked at me sidelong now and then as he talked he was reproaching me in a subliminal way for not letting him tell me something he had wanted to tell me very much i gave him a tolerant smile to let him know i understood him and a little bit to remind him that i was the one who decided who got told what when then i felt a gentle hand on the back of my neck it was essies hand i leaned back against it pleasurably just as albert took another of those looks at me and said to glare i suppose you had a chance to get to know audee walthers iii on your trip here that woke me up i turned to essie and whispered i didnt know audee was here said essie in my ear appear to be many things you are unwilling to know about meat persons present her tone made the back of my neck tingle it was a mixture of love and severity it is the tone essie uses when she thinks i have been unusually gloopy or silly or obstinate oh my god i said remembering dane metchnikov dane metchnikov she agreed is also present here on rock as meat along with person who rescued him oh my god i said again dane metchnikov he had been along on that blackhole expedition that had burdened my conscience for half a century i had left him and the others there and among the others had been gelleklara moynlin yes whispered essie are presently in central park central park isnt much of a park when klara and i were prospectors together it was about a dozen mulberry and orange trees and not many more than that bushes it still wasnt much different the little pond we called lake superior was still curving up around the shape of the asteroid now the park was much more densely grown but i had no trouble at all spotting a dozen or more human beings in among the shrubbery eight or ten of them were the elderly veterans who lived on wrinkle rock all meat posed like statues under the trees a few were partygoers like myself only meat and among them i had no difficulty in recognizing that other motionless meatperson statue who was gelleklara moynlin she hadnt changed a bit at least physically in another way she had changed almost terminally she wasnt alone she was in fact between two men worse she was holding hands with one of them and the other had an arm draped around her shoulder that was a nasty blow all by itself because the last i had known of klara the only person she was likely to be holding hands with or being held by was me it took me a moment to realize that the handholding man was dane metchnikovit had after all been a long time since i had seen him last the other one i didnt know at all he was tall slim and good looking and if those things hadnt been enough to damn him he was resting his hand on klaras shoulder in a fond and habitual way sometimes when i was young and enamored of some person or other i had this burning desire to know her perfectly utterly in every way and one of the ways was a fantasy the fantasy was that i would find her so sound asleep that nothing i could do would wake her and so i would steal up on the dear loved one all asleep and investigate all those secret things without her knowing to see if there was stubble in her armpit to check on how recently she had cleaned out the glop under her toenails to peer up her nostrils and into her earsand to do all of this see when she didnt know i was doing it because although we conducted many a mutual exploration it was a whole other thing when it was observed as with most of my fantasies it was the kind of thing that my former analyst program sigfrid von shrink looked on with toleration and not much approval he read meanings into it that i didnt enjoy and as with most fantasies it wasnt all that much fun when i had the chance to do it i could do it now there was kiara as though carved in eternal stone there was also essie right there with me to dampen the urge to explore but she would have gone away if i had asked her to she didnt say a word essie didnt she just hovered silently behind me as i stood there invisible in gigabit space staring at the woman i had mourned for most of my life klara looked very good it was hard to believe that she was actually older than i waswhich is to say about six months older than god my birthday was almost the same as the discovery of gateway whose hundredth anniversary we were celebrating klara had been born some fifteen years earlier she didnt look it she didnt look a day older part of that of course was simply full medical klara was quite a rich woman and shed been able to afford all the tissue restoration and replacement around even before it became basically free for anyone whats more she had spent thirty years in the time trap of a black hole where i had abandoned her to save myselfit had taken me all those thirty years to get over the guilt of thatand so in those long years she had aged only minutes because of time dilation in terms of elapsed time since her birth she was well over a hundred in terms of time counted by her own body clock certainly in her sixties in terms of the way she looked the way she looked was the way she had always looked to me she looked really good she was standing there with her fingers interlaced with those of dane metchnikov her head was turned to the man who had his arm around her her eyebrows were dark and bold as ever and her face was klaras face the one i had wept over for thirty years dont startle her damn robin commanded essie from behind me just in time i had been about to display myself right in front of them not thinking that this encounter would not be a whole lot easier for her than it was for me and that she would need more time an awful lot more time to handle it so then what i demanded not taking my eyes off klara so then said essie scowling you act like normal decent human being you know you give woman chance you show up at edge of woods maybe and you walk toward her give her little chance to see you coming get ready for quite traumatic encounter before you speak but that will take forever have forever dummy said essie firmly anyway have other thing to do arent paying attention right arent aware doppelcassata is looking for you hell with him i said absently i was so busy studying the face and form of my longlost love that i had no patience for anything elseor brains for anything else either it took me a good many microseconds to remember that the longer i put off starting the conversation the longer it would be before i could hear her voice youre right i said reluctantly might as well see the bastard just let me get started here i calved off a doppel of me behind a drooping lime tree rich with golden fruit and started the doppel walking toward the pair and then i followed essie meekly enough back to the spindle where she said cassata was waiting it would take a long time for my doppel to reach kiara speak to her wait for her to respondmany many miffiseconds i wished desperately that i could shorten the time because how could i wait and i also wished desperately that i could make it longer because what was i going to say julio cassata took my mind off thesewhats essies wordthese gloopy maunderings hes good at that hes like the mosquito bite that takes your mind off the toothache for a moment hes never a welcome distraction but at least he is a distraction when we found him he was in the blue hell essie squeezed my arm grinning cassata was sitting at one of the little tables with a drink in front of him reminiscently pawing a young woman i had never seen before i didnt see much of her then either because as soon as cassata perceived we were there he changed it all partygoers girl and blue hell vanished we were in his office on the jaws satellite his hair had got combed his tunic collar had buttoned itself and he was gazing at us frostily over his steel desk he pointed to two metal chairs sit down he ordered essie said dispassionately cut crap julio you want talk to us fine we talk not here is too ugly he gave her the kind of a look a major general gives a second lieutenant then he decided to be a good fellow whatever you like my dear you pick essie sniffed she glanced at me hesitated then abolished the military office instead we were in our familiar true love complete with couches bar and gentle music playing yes cassata nodded agreeably looking around appreciatively thats much better nice place youve got here mind if i help myself he didnt wait for permission but headed for the bar mind all this crap said essie spit it out julio embargoed our ship right why only a temporary inconvenience my dear cassata twinkled as he made himself a chivas and nothing i only wanted to be sure i got a chance to talk to you even a counterirritant can be too damn irritating i said so talk essie gave me a quick warning look because she heard my tone i was keeping myself under control i wasnt in any good mood to talk to julio cassata some people think that machinestored people never get all wound up and flustered because were just bits of data arranged in a program it isnt true at least it isnt true for me and especially not just then id been up and down in an emotional carnival ridekeyed up in the first place by the party exalted and somber while i listened to the story of tangents terrible trip torn with a hundred emotions by running into kiara i wasnt about to enjoy talking to cassata of course i seldom do enjoy talking to cassata i dont see why anyone would his main conversational gambits are orders and insults he doesnt talk he issues statements he hadnt changed he took a long pull on his scotch looked me in the eye and said youre a pest broadhead it wasnt a promising remark essie halfway through making me a mai tai twitched and almost spilled it she looked at me worriedly its essies policy to do all the fighting herself when were in a situation that calls for it she thinks i get too excited when im the one that yells but i fooled her this time i said politely im sorry if ive caused you any inconvenience julio would you be good enough to tell me why you say that what remarkable selfcontrol i displayed it was a lot more than the lout deserved a lot more than i would have given him if i hadnt at the last moment realized that i ought to feel sorry for him what i had realized was that after all he was under sentence of death major general julio cassata and i go back a long waytheres no use adding up the years arithmetic gets all mixed up when youre in gigabit time we had had many contacts and i hadnt enjoyed any of them he wasnt a stored personality himself though that is usually he wasnt like many meat people who have to deal with us stored souls on an urgent basis he makes a doppel of himself and sends it out to talk to us it isnt quite the same as a facetoface in real time but the difference is only psychological well painfully psychological he inputs himself as a machinestored intelligence and comes looking for us whichever of us he wants to talk to sometimes me then he says whatever he has to say listens to what we have to say in return carries on a conversation just as well in the form of a disembodied bundle of bits in gigabit space as he would if he and we were meat people around a table no not just as well a hell of a lot better at least in that we are that much faster then meatjulio calls his doppelgangerjuio back and listens while it tells him what happened all that is straightforward and certainly not painful at all it is also very efficient the pain comes later the doppel asks just what meatcassata would have asked objects to what he would have objected to says just what he would have saidas of course it must being him and it isnt like sending an ambassador out and waiting for a response because even the best of ambassadors assuming that any ambassador could do the job as well as a doppel does would certainly take time to do it the doppels take at most a matter of seconds if the conference is to take place at planetary distanceslonger of course if the person the meat man wants to talk to happens to be at the other end of the galaxy before the meat person has a chance to wonder how the conference is going to go the doppel is back and tells him thats the good part then comes the only part thats not so good because what do you do with the doppel after its done its job you could just leave it in storage of course theres plenty of capacity in gigabit space and one more stored personality wouldnt matter much but it bothers some people to have duplicates of themselves around it especially bothers someone like cassata being military hes got the military mind a stored duplicate of him knowing everything he knows isnt just an annoying loose end its a security risk someone might find it and ask it questions threaten it torture it hold its feet to the fire well i dont know exactly what goes on in julio cassatas mind and i thank god i dont every day all of that is quite foolish of course but the doppels are cassatas own and if he thinks some imaginary enemy might sometime find out from them the secrets of his service no one else can interfere hes a shift commander for jaws the joint assassin watch that means hes in charge of a large part of the defense programs against the eventual coming out of the assassins from their kugelblitz so if he wants conferences with parties at a distance which he does he has to do this sort of thing almost daily which means that if he left his doppels in storage there would be hundreds and thousands of major general julio cassatas around so he doesnt just store them he kills them thats what it feels like to cassata himself anyway when he terminates his doppel it feels as though hes assassinated a twin and the other bad thing about that is that the doppel itselfhimself damn itknows thats whats going to happen sometimes it makes our conversations sort of gloomy thats why i didnt rip julio cassata to simulated bloody shreds for his impudence he was as surprised as essie he unwrapped a fresh cigar staring at me you all right he demanded all right wasnt anywhere near a correct diagnosis because i was wondering just how close my doppel had got to klara and how she would react when she saw it but i had no intention of telling julio cassata any of that so i just said ill be fine when you tell me what all this is about i was quite polite but cassata had never subscribed to the theory that politeness should go both ways he worried off the end of the cigar with his teeth and spat the nasty little plug of tobacco on the floor watching me carefully then he said you arent as important as you think you are broadhead i managed to keep the smile on my face though the temperature was going up inside you think the embargo is just for you wrong that heechee ship came right here from the core you know i hadnt known i didnt see what difference it made either and said so classified material broadhead cassata rumbled those heechee ancient ancestors theyve been blabbing their heads off they shouldve been debriefed at jaws first yes i said nodding that makes sense because naturally things that happened half a million years ago or so are pretty important military secrets not just half a million years ago they know all about the present state of readiness in the core and there are meat heechee there plus this waithers guy whos actually been there and seen it for himself i took a deep breath what i wanted to do was to ask him all over again whom he possibly was trying to keep all these secrets from but that would have meant prolonging an old argument and i was tired of being with cassata anyway i just said still politely you said i was a pest and i dont see what the heechee ship has to do with that he had the cigar well lit by then he blew smoke at me and said nothing thats a separate thing i came here because of the ship but i also wanted to tell you to stay out of the way stay out of what way why i asked and felt essie stirring restlessly because she had got tired of marveling at my selfcontrol and was beginning to have trouble retaining her own because youre a civilian he explained you mess around in jaws affairs you get in the way and things are getting to a point where we cant afford civilian meddling anymore i began to get a glimmering of what was bugging him i smiled at essie to reassure her that i wasnt going to kill this impudent general i really wasntat least not yet the maneuvers didnt go well i guessed cassata choked and sputtered cigar smoke who told you that i shrugged its obvious if theyd been a success your pr people would have had pictures on every newscast you arent bragging therefore youve got nothing to brag about so the people you want to keep secrets from are the ones whore paying your bills like me wise ass he snarled if you say any of that ill take care of you personally how are you going to do that he was back in control now all military all brass including the brain for openers he said im withdrawing your jaws clearance effective immediately that was too much for essie julio she rasped you gone crazy or what i put a restraining hand on her arm i said seriously julio ive got a lot of things on my mind right now and jaws isnt one of them not right up top anyway i had no intention of bothering any of the people at jaws anytime in the near futureuntil you came along with your arrogant orders now of course ill make it my business to check up on everything jaws does he bellowed ill have you arrested i was beginning to enjoy myself i said no you wont you dont have the authority and you dont have the clout because ive got the institute that took him back for a moment the broadhead institute for extrasolar research was one of the best ideas id ever had id endowed it a long long time ago for quite different reasonswell to tell the truth about half of the reasons were tax reasons but id endowed it well i had given it a charter that let it do just about anything it wanted to outside of our solar system and id taken the precaution of loading the board of directors with people who would do what i wanted them to cassata recovered fast the hell i dont have the clout thats an order i studied him thoughtfully then i called albert he popped into existence blinking at me over his pipe transmit a message for me i ordered instruct all branches of the institute that effective at once they are to cease cooperation with the joint assassin watch service and deny any jaws personnel access to our premises or our data reason given a direct order from julio cassata major general jaws cassatas eyes began to pop now wait a minute broadhead he rumbled i turned back to him politely you have some comment to make about this he was perspiring you wouldnt do that he said his tone was funny half wheedle and half snarl were all in this together the foe is everybodys enemy why julio i said im glad to hear you say that i thought you were under the impression they were your private property dont worry i wont stop the institute from functioning itll go on with its studies the scout ships will keep on surveying well go right on accumulating data about the foe we just wont bother sharing any of this with jaws anymore now does albert send the message or not he tapped the ash off the end of his cigar for a moment looking stricken no he muttered sorry i couldnt quite hear what you said no then he shook his head despairingly hell blow his stack he said but he said he and the only he he could have meant was the meatgeneral cassata who was of course himself he said he i said to essie when cassata had gone glumly away she said soberly is interesting i agree doppeljulio comes to consider meatjulio separate individual hes turning schizo is turning scared she corrected realizes has only limited time to live sad little man then she said diffidently dear robin realize thoughts are elsewhere at this moment i didnt agree because it wouldnt have been polite nor did i deny it because it was true even while i was quarreling with julio cassata i was stealing peeks at the scene in central park my doppel had finally reached klara and said hello to her and she was just beginning to say robin its ni but can i make suggestion well of course you can i said embarrassed if id had blood vessels to redden my face i probably would have blushed perhaps i did anyway suggestion she said is go easy of course i said nodding i would have said of course to almost anything she said now if you dont mind id like to uh know what you would like to do only have problem with discrepancy in time scales right so really is no hurry at all for you dear robin can talk a little first i sat still a moment i was by then quite embarrassed it isnt easy to be telling one woman that you want very much to talk to another when you have as uneasy a conscience as i always seem to have about my wife essie and my longlost love gelleklara moynlin on the other hand essie was absolutely right there was no hurry at all she was watching me with love and concern on her face is tough situation for you eh dear robin she put in the only useful thing i could think of to say was i love you a lot essie she didnt look loving in return she looked exasperated yes of course she shrugged dont change subject you love me i love you both have no doubt of this is not relevant to present discussion discussion is how you feel about very nice lady whom you also love gelleklara moynlin and complications arising therefrom it sounded worse when she spelled it out it did not make me any more comfortable weve had that discussion a million times i groaned so why not one million times more get comfortable dear robin have at least fifteen maybe eighteen hundred milliseconds before klara finishes saying what nice surprise is to see you again so we talk you and i unless you dont want i thought it over and gave up i said why not and indeed there was no reason there was also no reason not to get comfortable as essie said we had talked this out many times before all one night and edging up on most of the next day once that had been a long time agooh billions of secondsand i had been talking to the real essie the fleshandblood meat one we were newly married at the time we had been sitting on the veranda of our house sipping iced tea and watching the sailboats on the tappan sea and it had really been an easing loving talk obviously essie remembered that longago meatperson conversation as well as i did because when she got us comfortable that was where she got us oh not really in the sense that we were physically there but really what does really mean i could see the sailboats and the evening summer breeze was warm this is nice i said appreciatively feeling myself beginning to relax being a disembodied datastring does have its advantages essie grunted complacent agreement she gazed affectionately around our old home and said last time did this were drinking tea want something stronger this time robin brandy and ginger i said and a moment later our faithful old maid marchesa appeared with a tray i took a long sip thinking i thought too long for essies patience she said so get on with it dear robin what is frying your head afraid to talk to klara no i mean i said swallowing my quick indignation no thats not it we already did talk back when she and wan showed up with the heechee ship true essie agreed noncommittally no really that parts all right we got straightened out on the bad things im not worrying that shell blame me for dumping her in the hole if thats what you mean essie sat back and regarded me seriously what i mean robin she said patiently is not important at all is what you mean that we wish to uncover if not confrontation between klara and you what are worried she and i will scratch eyes out wouldnt happen robin apart from technical difficulties arising from fact that she is meat i am only soul no of course not im not worrying about her meeting you exactly ah and inexactly well what if realessie runs into her portableessie looked at me in silence for a moment then took a thoughtful pull at her own drink realessie hah it was only a thought i apologized understand that wish to understand more precisely are asking me if meatme is likely to show up on wrinkle rock she inquired i thought that over i wasnt sure exactly what i did mean i hadnt meant to say anything at all about it of course as old sigfrid von shrink used to tell me its the things i say that i didnt mean to say that say the most and it was true that there was a real touchy delicate bit here portableessie is only a doppelganger realessie meatessie is still alive and well shes also human what with full medical and all although she is getting along in years she is not just a woman she is a really handsome sexy normal one she is also my wife she is also a wife whose husband is in no shape to provide her with as they say the benefits of consort all of that is already a nagging kind of worry that adds to all the other nagging worries sigfrid is always telling me i shouldnt beat my breast about their advice doesnt do much good i guess i cant help it but theres more meatessie is also an exact duplicate of portableessie or to put it more accurately she is the original of that exact duplicate who is portableessie my faithful wife lover advisor friend confidante and coconstruct in gigabit space so i know her very well worse than that she knows meeven better because shes not only all those things i just mentioned she is also my well my creator since essie is better known in some circles as dr s ya lavorovnabroadhead one of the worlds great authorities on data processing of any kind she herself wrote most of our programs when i say the copy is exact i mean exact essie even updates herselfi mean meatessie revises portableessie from time to time to make sure the exactness is always up to the moment so my portableessie is in no way different in any way that i can detect from meat or real essie but i never see meatessie i couldnt handle it call the reason for that whatever you like tact jealousy loopiness whatever it is i am willing to accept as a fact of life that it is better that i dont see the meat original of my dear wife i have a very clear idea of what i would learn if i did under the circumstances either she takes a lover now and then or she is crazier than i believe possible i am willing to accept that this happens i will even concede that it is fair but i dont want to know about it so i said to portableessie no i dont think meatessie would be jealous enough to matter if she were here and i dont think klara would and anyway i dont want to know where essie is or what shes doingnot even negatively i added swiftly as portableessie opened her mouth so dont tell me what she is doing even if its something i would like to hear its not that at all essie looked doubtful she took another pull at her drink with that look she gets when she is trying to work out the wiring architecture of the labyrinthine processes of my mind then she shrugged fine accept what you say she said decisively is not that which is making you gloopy this time so what then is reason is curiosity about klara moynlin where has been all these years why is dane metchnikov with her i looked up well i did wonder no need to wonder is quite simple after encounter with you kiara wished to go away somewhere went very many places for long time ultimately went very far went back into black hole had just escaped from rescued others in partymetchnikov included i said oh for some reason that didnt seem to satisf essie she gave me an irritated look then she said slowly think you are telling truth robin is not klara is on your mind yet is clear you have been quite moody lately will say if you can what it is if you dont know how can i i said suddenly angry meaning she sighed that as original writer i am in better position to overhaul your program pick out bugs make happy again no no she agreed of course not have long agreed to leave old robinette broadhead program alone bugginess and all so then is only oldfashioned method of debugging talk talk it out robin say first word that comes into mind just like for old sigfrid von shrink and i took a deep breath and confronted the subject i had been spending a lot of time avoiding i sighed mortality several thousand milliseconds later i was back in central park watching gelleklara moynlin let go of her companions and move toward doppelme and wondering just why i had said that i hadnt intended to i dont intend to describe the long circular conversation i had with essie after that either because although i do these things i dont take much pleasure in talking about them it got nowhere it had nowhere to go i had no reason to worry about mortality because as essie had wisely pointed out how can you die when youre already dead funnily that didnt cheer me up at all watching klara didnt either so i sought other entertainment while i waited for either klara or doppelme to say something interesting in their glacierslow way it had been news to me that audee walthers iii was on the rock and i sought him out that wasnt much better he was there all right or almost being meat he was just getting there he was in the process of disembarking and it was not very entertaining to observe him slowly gradually pulling himself up out of the docking hatch onto the floor of the bay to make conversation i said to essie he doesnt look a bit different he didnt froggy faced with solid trustworthy eyes he was exactly the same man he had been thirty and more years before when i saw him last has been in core naturally said essie she wasnt looking at him she was looking at meto see if i was going to do anything gloopy again i supposed so i wasnt sure for a second which of us she meant when she added poor guy i gave her a noncommittal grunt we werent the only persons present there were even meat people there curious to see the ship that had been where few ships containing humans had ever boldly gone watching them and audee was about as exciting as watching moss grow and i began to fidget audee wasnt on my mind klara was on my mind essie was on my mind julio cassata was on my mind and most of all my own slippery uneasy internal worries were on my mind what i wanted very badly was something to take my mind off all the things that were on my mind standing around among the statues wasnt doing the trick i wish i said i could hear his story go ahead then essie invited what oh you mean start a doppel so when he comes out no doppel dummy said essie see audee is wearing pod pod contains ancient ancestor no doubt ancient ancestor is not meat but stored intelligence almost as good as you and me so ask ancestor why dont you i gazed with love at my love what a highly intelligent person you are essie i said fondly and adorable too and i reached out to the pod because i really did want to hear what had happened to audee while he was gone almost as much as i wanted wanted wanted to know really just what it was that i did want out of the core there was a real good reason why i wanted to hear about audees trip to the core right then maybe from the strictly linear view of a meat person it seems that shoot this is just one more damn digression linearly maybe it is im not linear i do parallel processing maybe a dozen things at a time in an average millisecond and there was a really marked parallel going on here im sure audee knew about the parallel when he volunteered to ride a heechee ship back into the core he probably hadnt thought it all out he could have had only a tentative idea of what he was letting himself in for but theres the parallel whatever it was going to turn out to be he no doubt figured it would be better than trying to straighten out his life audees life was as tangled almost as my own for he had two loves too so audee took his chances and his departure he also took along with him our friend janie yeexing who was one of his loves but that as you will see didnt last audee was a pilot by profession a hot pilot audee had flown airbodies on venus superlights on earth shuttles to the gateway asteroid privateparty jet charters on peggys planet and longlines interstellar spacecraft to everywhere in audees view one heechee ship was like any other heechee ship and he had no doubt he could fly anything can i set course he asked the heechee captain because he wanted to start out on the right foot as a willing worker captain wanted to start out on the right foot too so he obligingly waved the ships pilot out of the way and audee took his seat heechee seats are made for people wearing pods between their legs human beings dont usually do that so most heechee ships converted to human use have webbing stretched across the wings of the seat this one of course had none audee did not intend to start out by complaining he made the best of it he rested his bottom on the vshaped seat read off the course settings and gave the control wheels the customary muscular shove into position it took strength it had been a while since audee had had to do that the new earthbuilt ships were made easier to pilot to make conversation he panted a lot of the oldtimers wondered about these wheels yes said captain politely what about them please well why are they so hard to turn captain glanced at his crewmates in puzzlement then back at audee he reached out a negligent fingertip to touch the wheel it moved easily what is hard he asked hissing in the heechee manner that expressed either annoyance or concern audee looked at the slight slim figure of the heechee he coaxed the wheel back until the righton vertical markers flashed shocking pink it took as much muscle as ever as he reached for the starterteat he swallowed hard it had become clear to him that the trip was going to be full of surprises the ship shuddered slightly and the viewscreen blurred into the mottled gray that showed they were already going faster than light no further action of the pilot would be necessary for some time but audee was reluctant to get up for as long as he sat in the pilots seat he felt some sense of being in control of what was going on he tried making a little more conversation we always wondered about those controls he offered you know because there are five of them some of the big brains thought you heechee believed in fivedimensional space captain hissed loudly for a moment and the tendons that stood out from his flat chest writhed in the attempt to understand his english had become quite good but nuances of expression sometimes avoided him believe audee walthers but there is no question of belief there is no faith required as in that concept you have of religion well sure said audee grimly but do you believe that no of course not said captain in surprise space doesnt have five dimensions audee grinned thats a relief because i was having trouble trying to visualize it has nine captain explained they stopped briefly in their race to the core because captain had left some of the stored heechee craft in unstable orbits that would not do he explained in the years they would be in the core the machines could drift to destruction and heechee did not like useful things destroyed but audee had stopped listening years he said i thought this trip would be only a few months how many years quite a few i think said captain to us it will be only months but home you know is in a black hole and so when captain left one of his crew to deal with the unmanned ships janie yeexing elected to go with him she would she said fly one of them back to earth if captain didnt mind she really hadnt planned on years captain didnt mind neither did audee oddly enough he was quite confused enough about whom he loved to welcome a few months in which the question need not be faced a situation not unfamiliar to me it must have been a weird and wonderful trip for audee suddenly thrust into a heechee ship with heechee shipmates for that matter the heechee didnt have any easy time of it either though at least they had previously had the experience of encountering bipeds that were markedly fat and hairy while audee had never before shared a ship with living skeletons but those problems were not unique to audee or his hosts weve all had them since many times over and that story is old theres not much point in recounting audees difficulties with ninedimensional space and with trying to make sense of heechee arithmetic naturally everything in the ship was weird and strange to himchairs designed to accommodate the heechee pod a bed that was a sack filled with dry rustly stuff to burrow into and we wont even mention the toilets it helped when as time passed he began to think of his shipmates as individual persons instead of as merely five examples of the category heechee captain was the easiest to recognize he was the darkest the one with the fuzziest approximation of hair on his scalp the one who spoke pretty good english whitenoise was the little female almost pale gold in color approaching nubility and worried about it mongrel had great difficulty with the few english words he tried burst had a great sense of humor and loved trading dirty jokes with the otherseven now and then with audee through captain as interpreter it helped still more when captain had the bright idea of giving audee a heechee poda modified one of course as captain told audee one part of the heechee pod was useless to audee if not indeed dangerous to his health that was the tiny microwaveradiation generator the heechee race had evolved on an otherwise pleasant planet of a star that happened to be near a large and active gas cloud bremsstrбhlung radiation in the microwave frequencies had drenched that world from prebiotic times and the heechee had evolved to tolelate itindeed to need it as human beings need the sun so when they began venturing to places where the radiation could not follow they had to bring their own source of microwave along then when a little later on in their history they discovered how to preserve the essentials of a deceased heechee they found another use for the pods each one contained the stored transcription of an ancient ancestor they even gave audee an ancient ancestor of his own to his surprise she wasnt really ancient at all she had been dead only a matter of weeks she had been captains own lover and her name was twice that was the final step in audees assimilation of the notion that the heechee were people its a small universe isnt it as audee began to get used to captain captain got used to audee enough to open a discussion that had been very much on his mind he got his chance when audee asked about the foe it was after all the central problem the universe posed to both heechee and humans the foe the assassins the race of inimical deathdealing beings whose existence had caused the heechee to pack up and flee to a safe hideout in the galactic core audee made captain go over and over the story often with the other heechee in the crew chiming in it still wasnt easy to grasp i under stand about tangents trip he said and i understand that you knew a lot of civilized races had been wiped out but how did you get from there to this idea of crumpling up the universe the heechee looked at each other i think first it was the deceleration parameter said shoe captain writhed his biceps in agreement yes the deceleration parameter of course it was only a question for theoretical astrophysicists at first you understand i would understand better if i knew what a deceleration parameter was audee groaned it could also be called an anomalous braking effect whitenoise offered from the other side of the room captain flexed his twisty biceps in agreement he went on it means only that our astronomers had observed that the universe was expanding less rapidly by a power law than it should have something was slowing it down and you figured out it was the foe captain said somberly in conjunction with the other evidence and after ruling out every other possibility it became clear that it could be nothing else but some artificial intervention on a cosmic scale and there just were no other candidates i can see that that would be disconcerting said audee disconcerting captain rasped it changed everything he gazed thoughtfully at audee out of those pink eyes with the blotch of pupil in the middle he glanced at the other heechee swiftly then made the snuffling sound that was the heechee equivalent of clearing ones throat to announce a change to a serious subject it is not too late he announced audee blinked not too late for what it is not too late for your people to join ours in the core captain said precisely speaking slowly to make sure that audee understood it would be quite congenial for your human race inside the core if you were to come there it sounds said audee politely trying to lighten the conversation as though it might be a little crowded crowded why crowded asked captain cheek twitchingit was the equivalent of a frown we have mapped this galaxy quite carefully and when we retreated to the core we chose the best planets to take there with us there are not too many left outside that are congenial to your raceor to ours audee saw a chance to do a little justified boasting on behalf of the human race ah but we make them congenial he explained proudly there are six planets already mapped and explored for example that would be perfect for human beings except that the temperature range is a bit low we can fix that were seeding those planets atmospheres with chlorofluorocarbons they trap heatlike carbon dioxidewhich causes a greenhouse effect which will i understand carbon dioxide captain gritted i also understand chiorofluorocarbons and yes it is true that certain of these compounds will in fact persist in an atmosphere for many centuries once put there i agree that this may in certain cases raise the mean temperature of a planet by a few degrees well a few degrees is all you need for some of them audee said reasonably and theres venus its too hot by far but before long well probably spread reflective dust particles in its upper atmosphere this will cut down the insulation and make venus habitable then we can do the same thing on other planetsthere are two or three already identified we can seed life where life never existed to make its own gaea effect we will move planets if we must to better orbits captain was growing testy but we have already done all of that inside the core he urged do you know how many habitable planets we already have in place more than eight hundred fifty most of them not yet occupied even by advance parties as you see we planned for a long stay yes said audee neutrally i see that captain hissed faintly in puzzlement he was aware that there was something in audees tone but couldnt tell what it was he snuffled again and went on so you can join us some planets are prettier than others to be sure and i am certain you could have some of the very finest your entire race could fit on one of themtwo or three at the most he corrected himself thinking it over and do what asked audee captain blinked at him whywait of course he said it is possible we would be safe there audee walthers especially if we stop all transmissions at once and begin the transfer of all human beings and energyusing devices into the core as soon as possible energyusing devices devices that radiate detectable energy that would give away our presence captain explained ah said audee nodding having spotted the flaw but you people posted automatic sensors he pointed out why wouldnt the foe have done the same perhaps they have captain said glumly i didnt say it was certhin we would be safe i only said it was possible and if they have not in fact detected thisoutbreakthen we can stay inside there for millions and billions of years if necessary waiting but waiting for what captain whyof course waiting until some other race perhaps evolves to challenge them audee studied the heechee carefully wonderingly it was clear that more than language differences lay between them one has he said gently us for some time after that audee worried that he might have hurt captains feelings he had after all implied against the entire heechee race an accusation of cowardice what audee didnt know was that captain took it as a compliment if there is one part of audees trip that i envy him more than any other it is his penetration of the black hole itself not that audee enjoyed it no one would it was scary as they approached that glowing boiling violently radiating furnace of infalling gases that marked the approach to the heechee hideout captain ordered everyone strapped into their hanunock sacks whitenoise applied power to the crystal helix the heechee called a disruptor of order it glowed diamondbright the temperature rose the ship began to shake captain had learned to read human body language about as well as audee had learned heecheethat is not very wellbut he did not miss the whitening around audees jaw you seem afraid he commented by heechee standards it was not an impolite remark audee took it without offense yes he said gazing at the eyewrenching surface of infalling gases i am terribly terribly afraid of entering a black hole that is curious captain said thoughtfully we have done this many times and there is no peril to this ship tell me which are you more afraid of this penetration or the foe audee thought it over the two kinds of fear were not at all the same i guess he said slowly the foe captains cheek muscles writhed approvingly that is not in any way nonrational he said that is wise now we go in the diamond corkscrew erupted in showers of sparks thousands of them struck audee and all the others aboard but they did not burn they did nothing at all but seemed to pass right through the bodies and come out the other side the lurching of the ship threw audee violently against the harnesses of his safety cocoon it had been built for heechee mass not that of the larger human body and it creaked alarmingly the process went on for a long time audee had no way to measure it many minutes surely perhaps an hour or more and it didnt get less violent he could hear the heechee crew croaking comments and orders back and forth among themselves and wondered dazedly how they were able to function when their gizzards were being jolted out of them and wondered if heechee had gizzards and wondered if he were going to die and then without warning it was over the heechee began to unstrap themselves captain glanced curiously at audee and called would you like to see our core he waved a skinny arm at the viewscreen and there it was what appeared on the ships viewing plates was a dazzle of light the heechee core was packed with sunsten thousand sunsmore suns than there are in a thousand lightyears from earth packed into a sphere of space only twenty lightyears across there were golden stars and dull crimson stars and blindingly bluewhite stars there was a whole rainbow hertzsprungrussell spectrum of stars that made the night sky a flood of color on any planet in the corethat made the term night an exotic abstraction in fact because there was no place in the core that was ever dark i wish i could have seen it i dont envy very many people very many things but i envied audee walthers that when i heard what he had seen a dense compaction of starsmore than in any clusterwell it would have to be wouldnt it or else any globular cluster would itself have become a black hole and constellations like christmas trees i mean colors even from earth the stars are different colors everyone knows that but hardly anyone ever sees what the colors are theyre all so far and so faint that the colors wash out and mostly they look like various impure versions of white but in the core in the core red is ruby and green is emerald and blue is sapphire and yellow is gleaming gold and white is by god blinding and there isnt any gradation of firstmagnitude down to faint or invisible the bright ones are far brighter than firstmagnitude and there are hardly any stars on the borderline of visibility because there arent any faraway stars at all i did envy audee for what he saw but really what he saw was only the viewscreen of the heechee ship he never set foot on a heechee planet he didnt have time first to last audees elapsed time inside the core was about equal to the span of a normal nights sleep he didnt do any sleeping of course he certainly didnt have time for that he hardly had time to breathe as a matter of fact because there was so hopelessly much to see and do if it hadnt been for the ancient ancestors things would have taken so ponderously long that it might hardly have mattered whether audee got to the core or not but captains messages had been receivedonly moments before by heechee standards their relay machines worked in machinestorage time and the ancient ancestors nearly could too with only minutes of warning the heechee had had time to do almost nothing but bleat and shake but they rallied fast they had always kept a full flotilla of standby crews and ships available for just this situation they were dispatched at once by the time audee had been inside the core for four local hours he had seen six large heechee ships sent off with hastily drafted often bewildered shiphandlers historians dreamseat sensitives and diplomatsat least what passed among the heechee for diplomats those first shiploads of heechee specialists had been standing by waiting for just that summons probably none of them had actually expected to get itnot on my shift anyway each one of them might have prayed if heechee had prayed or at least asked of massed ancestral minds those crews had been standing by for a good long whilethousands of centuries by galactic time even by the clocks in the core it had been a matter of decades no one crew stayed on standby for that long they rotated at intervals of what local time measured as the equivalent of eight or nine months then returned to their normal homes and habits it was a lot like national guard service in the old days in the united states like national guardsmen too the surprise was ugly when the emergency they were standing by for turned out to be real and immediate half the heechee had families half the ones with families had been allowed to bring mate and offspring with them just as peacetime american soldiers had carried along wives and kids the similarities ended there peacetime soldiers suddenly called on to fight usually had the chance to send their families out of the way the heechee didnt the places they were stationed in were the ships they set out in and so in those first half dozen ships the crews included pregnant females infants and a fair number of schoolage heechee children most of these were terrified few wanted to go on this mysterybus excursion into the unknown but then much of the same was true of the crews themselves none of this audee saw with his own eyes only in the communications screens of captains spaceship that was what he arrived in and there he stayed by the beginning of the fifth hour of his visit to the core another spaceship had had time to reach them the two ships docked the second ship was much larger than captains it had a complement of nearly thirty and all of them slid as rapidly as they could through the mated hatches to observe this queer animal this human at first hand the first thing that happened was that three of the new heechee gently and carefully took audees pod away from him so he was deprived at once of the comforting presence of twice he understood the necessity none of the new heechee spoke english and anyway they could get from the stored mind of the ancient ancestor all the information she had been getting from him over weeks in far less time than he could say any of it that was an explanation it didnt make the loss less acute the second thing was that all his familiar heechee shipmates were dragged away into the roil of newcomers standing packed against each other in knots around each of the heechee from the ship talking and gesticulating and yes smelling the typical ammomacal heechee reek was overpowering with so many of them squeezed into the ship audee had almost forgotten the smell existed through custom and besides the heechee who produced it were friends the new ones were all strangers the third thing was that half a dozen of the new heechee clustered around him twittering and jabbering so fast that he could not make out the words finally he understood that they were asking him to hold still he gave the best imitation he could of the heechee upperarm shrug of assent wondering what he was being asked to hold still for it turned out to be a complete physical examination they had his clothes off in no time and in less time still they were poking prodding peering slipping tiny soft probes into ears and nostrils and anus nicking off imperceptibly tiny specimens of skin and hair and toenails and mucus none of it was painful but it was so damn undignified and already audee knew a lot of time had passed back on earth the clock that ticked so slowly in the core was spinning away days and months at a click in the outside galaxy the last thing that happened or almost the last was the most surprising of all when they had finished giving him the most complete physical exam ination any human being had ever had in so short a time they allowed him to dress again then a short pale female heechee touched his shoulder reassuringly speaking slowly and carefully as to a cat she said we have finished with your ancient ancestor you may have it back now thank you audee growled snatching the pod away from her twice will tell you what you must do next the female heechee smiledthe cheekwrithing that was the heechee smile of course i bet she will audee said bitterly strapping on the pod and bending down twice sounded exhausted she had been drained dry and it had been an ordeal for her then she had been pumped full of instructions and that wasnt easy either you are to make a speech she announced at once dont try to speak our tongue you dont do it well enough why not demanded audee surprised actually he thought he had a pretty good accent by now for a human you only know the language of do not the language of feel twice explained and this is a matter of great emotional importance to all of us so speak in english ill translate for the audience audee scowled what audience why all the heechee of course you must tell them in your own words that humans are going to help the heechee deal with the problem of the foe oh hell audee exploded cursing his undignified position bent double to be near the pod cursing the foe cursing the stupid impulse that had made him volunteer in the first place i hate making speeches anyway what can i tell them that you dont all already know nothing of course twice agreed but it will be good if they hear it from you so for the next ten minutes or so audee made his speech in a way it was a relief because all the dozens of heechee backed away from him to make a space he saw several of them pointing objects at him and deduced that the objects were some sort of cameras in another way that time was worst of all because as he was talking it occurred to him that heechee were literal and when twice said all the heechee she undoubtedly meant all the heechee billions of them all looking with terror and fascination at and making critical judgments on this frightening alien him they were indeed looking at him all of them all of the billions upon billions of them inside the core children in their schoolhalls and nurseries workers stopped at their tasks old ones young onesdead ones too for the massed minds of the ancient ancestors would not miss an experience like this on the domedin surface of planets in the habitats in space from the departing ships climbing up to their ordeal of passage through the schwarzschild barrier all of them were watching audee had stage fright beyond belief he did it though he said i uh i and then he took a deep breath and started again im ah that isim just one person see and i cant speak for everybody but i know what people are like human people i mean and were not going to run away and hide like you guys no offense i mean i know you cant help it he shrugged and shook his head im sorry if im hurting your feelings he said forgetting the cameras forgetting the billions and billions in the audience i just want to tell it like it is were used to struggling you see we thrive on it we catch on quicklook at the way weve learned how to do everything you can do a lot of the time better maybe we cant do anything about the foe but were sure going to try i dont mean im promising thati dont have any right to promise anything for anybody but me all i mean is i know that thats all and he finished thanks a lot for listening he stood there obstinately smiling in silence until the heechee with the cameras at last reluctantly began to put them down a buzz of conversation broke out audee could not tell what they were saying because none of them were saying it to him but then the female heechee who had given twice back to him bent down to her pod for a moment and then approached she said i have this to say audee walthers third i have consulted the ancient ancestors about the translation and i have it right so i will say it in english she took a breath moved her razorthin lips silently for a second in rehearsal and then shaking her wrists at him as she spoke she said courage is not wisdom wisdom is appropriate behavior courage is sometimes suicide that is how the ancestors told me to say to you what i want to say audee waited for a second but there didnt seem to be any more so he said thank you now if youll excuse me i have to go to the bathroom audee took his time about it too he had been a long time being poked and prodded and put on display and besides the fact that his bladder was full he wanted to be by himself for a minute he took off his pod and left it outside the door because he didnt even want twice with him just then as he was filling the tulipshaped toilet receptacle with urine as he was washing his hands as he was peering at his face in the rotating mirror he was thinking there was a current beating time in his head to a different tempo it had taken him ten seconds to get inside and close the dooroutside nearly half a million seconds had passed at the ratio of something like forty thousand to one five seconds to open his fly a minute maybe to urinate two more minutes to wash his hands and look at his face in the mirror he tried to calculate what did all that add up to the numbers eluded him out of weeks of habit he kept trying to convert them into heechee arithmetic and failing but surely he thought something like eight or nine months on the outside had gone by just while he was having a pee it added a curious dimension to the act of relieving his bladder to reflect that while he was doing it a child could have been conceived and born in the outside world he opened the door and announced i want to go home captain burrowed his way through the crowd to confront him yes audee he asked shaking his wrists in the negative in this case it meant failure to understand but audee took it as refusal no i mean it audee said firmly i want to go back before everybody i know is a candidate for a retirement home yes audee said captain again then he reflected oh i see he said you have been thinldng that we wanted you to remain here for an extended period that wont be necessary you have been seen the information has been spread other human beings will be coming before long prepared for a longer stay you mean i can go audee demanded of course you can go there is a ship already en route to us here part of a flotilla of supplies personnel and ancient ancestors on their way outside you can join them by the time they transit the ergosphere the elapsed time in the outside galaxy will have been he ducked his head to communicate with his ancient ancestor in terms of the rotation of your planet around its primary fortyfour and onehalf years up in central park and while i was listening and speaking and doing and being in all those other places engaged in all those other thingshearing audees story fretting about general julio cassata wandering partyingthis was what was happening in slow time between klara and me i marched up to gelleklara moynlin with a wide fond smile on my face hello klara i said she looked up in astonishment robin how nice to see you again she disengaged herself from the men she was with and came toward me as she reached up to kiss me i had to back away there are disadvantages to being a machinestored person who is trying to be affectionate with a meat person and insubstantiality is one of them you can love em you cant kiss em sorry i started to say and at the same moment she looked repentant and said oh hell i forgot we cant do that can we but youre looking really well robin i said i look any way i want to look im dead you know it took her a minute to grin back at my grin but she did it then youve got good taste i hope i do that well when they can me and up from behind her was coming dane metclmikov he said hello robin he said it neutrally not thrilled to see me again not furious either he looked about the way dane metchnikov had always looked at everybody and everythingnot very interested or interested only to the extent that that person or thing might help or hinder whatever dane was planning on i said sorry we cant shake hands sorry seemed to be my favorite word so i used it again sorry you got stuck in the black hole im glad you got out and to set the record straight because metchnikov was always a guy who liked to keep the record straight he said i didnt get out klara came and rescued us it was only then that i recalled what albert had said about metchnikov seeking legal advice you have to remember that i wasnt actually saying any of this my doppel was when youre speaking through a doppel there are two ways to do it one is to start the doppel off and let it carry on the conversation all by itselfit will do that as well as you can the other way is when youre fidgety nervous and impatient and want to hear whats going on as soon as you can that was the way i was and what you do then is you prompt the doppel that meant i was feeding lines to my doppel in a fraction of a millisecond or so and the doppel was saying them at meat speed you get the picture it was something like a singalong where the bunch doesnt know the words and somebody has to line them out in a cavern in a canyon in a cavern in a canyon excavating for a mine excavating for a mine lived a miner fortyniner and so on only i wasnt leading a crowd of boozers around a piano i was feeding sentences to my doppel in between the sentences i had plenty of time to think and observe what i mostly observed was klara but i spared attention for the two men she was with too although their movements were slower than snails i had seen that metchnikov was putting his hand out to be shaken that was a good sign in itself i would have taken it to mean that he was not going to hold it against me that i had abandoned him as well as klara and the others in that black hole if it werent for the fact that he had been talking to lawyers the other man with klara was a total stranger when i took his measure i didnt like the measurements much the son of a bitch was goodlooking he was tall he was bronzed and smiling and paunchless and he was in the process of resting a hand in a familiar way on klaras shoulders again even as she was talking to me i explained to myself that that wasnt important klara had been holding hands with dane metchnikov too and why not theyd been old friendsunfortunately once a little more than friends it was only natural this other guy put his hand on her shoulder well that didnt mean anything at all really it was only a friendly gesture he could have been a relative or even i dont know a psychoanalyst or something there to help her over the shock of encountering me again looking at klaras face didnt clear any of the questions up although i did enjoy looking at it and remembering all the other times id looked at it in love she hadnt changed she still looked exactly like my eternal and deeply loved one true love the present gellekiara moynlin was indistinguishable from the kiara i had left in the space near the kugelblitz just after i diedwho in turn had been hardly a hair different from the one i had dumped in the black hole decades earlier it wasnt just full medical that accounted for the way she looked meatessie was an example of what full medical could do she looked really youthful and adorable too but although they can do marvelous things with meat the clock doesnt stop entirely it just gets set back every once in a while and for most people as long as youre getting restored you might as well get improved a little at the same timea perkier nose or a natural wave in the hair even essie did that a little klara had not the black eyebrows were still just a smidgen too thick the figure stockier than she herself had wished it she hadnt been kept young she had stayed young and there was only one way to do that she had been back in the black hole she had voluntarily returned to the place where i had marooned her where time slowed to a crawl and all the decades that had passed for me had been only weeks or months for her i could hardly take my eyes off her although it had been the better part of a century since klara and i had been lovers i had no trouble at all in seeingin memory only i did nothing rudethe texture of kiaras skin and the dimples at the base of her spine and the touch and taste of her it was a funny sensation i wasnt exactly lusting for her bod i wasnt on the point of ripping her clothes off and bedding her right there on the turf of central park with the cherry tree in full blossom overhead and metchnikov and the paunchless goodlooking other guy gazing on it wasnt like that i didnt really want to make love to her at all at least not in any urgent or tangible sense the reason wasnt just because it was impossible impossibility doesnt matter to hominess the thing was whatever i myself wanted or didnt want to do with klara i certainly didnt want either metchnikov or the other guy doing any of it i know what that is the name for it is jealousy and i have to concede ive had a lot of it in my time dane metchnikov had managed to get a whole sentence out you look a lot different to me he had said he wasnt smiling that didnt mean much because even in the old days on gateway metchnikov had never been a smiley sort of guy and of course i looked different to him because he hadnt seen me in a lot longer time than klaranot since gateway itself i could see that it was just about time to explore this question of lawyers so i did what i always did when i needed advice and information fast i yelled for it albert of course i didnt speak out loudi mean in any way klara or the two men could hear and when albert showed up he was no more visible to them than was the real not doppel me that was a good thing albert was obviously in a playful mood he was a rare old spectacle he had one of those tacky wornout sweaters he affects wrapped around his head like a turban he had been taking liberties with his physical specifications too his eyes were narrower and they seemed to be rimmed with black makeup his features were darker his hair was jet black i hear and obey master he chanted in a reverent singsong why have you summoned your genie out of his nice warm bottle when you have a faithful dataretrieval program like albert einstein you dont need a court jester clown i said ill summon essie to have you reprogrammed if you dont straighten out whats the idea of the comedy master he said bowing his head your humble messenger fears the just wrath of your noble self when he hears evil tidings i said shit but i had to admit he had made me laugh and that was one way of making evil tidings easier to bear all right i said nodding to show that i knew what the evil tidings were going to be tell me about metchnikov he was on the mission to the black hole and now hes back i just figured out that that means hes entitled to a share of the science bonus i got for the mission right albert looked at me curiously then he said unwinding the sweater from his head thats right robin its not just him either when klara went back to the black hole with harbin eskladar hold it who thats harbin eskladar he said pointing to the other man you told me you knew about him albert i sighed rearranging the conjectures and misunderstandings inside my mind to fit the new pattern you should know by now that when i tell you i know anything im lying he looked at me seriously so i feared he said thats the bad news im afraid he paused there as though he hadnt quite made up his mind what to say next so i prompted him you said the two of them went back to the black hole where id dumped them all he shook his head oh robin he sighed but thankfully did not start telling me about my guilt trips again he just said yes thats right he and klara went there together to rescue them only they rescued the whole crew the two dannys susie hereira the girls from sierra leone i know who was on the mission i interrupted my god theyre all back they all are yes robin he nodded and they are all in some sense entitled to full shares that is what dane metchnikov saw a lawyer about now he said thoughtfully reaching into a pocket and pulling out his pipehis complexion had unobtrusively returned to normal his hair was white and unruly againthere are certainly some unusual ethical and legal questions here as you remember from previous litigaton there is the principle that lawyers refer to as the calf follows the cow which means that all your subsequently accumulated fortune can be considered to be in some sense the consequence of that original science bonus from that mission in which of course they would all have shared if they had returned with you so i have to give them money have to is putting it too strongly but thats the general idea robin as you did with klara when she first showed up one hundred million dollars was the amount you settled on her for a quitclaim since i perceived this question would arise ive taken the liberty of having your legal program contact mr metchnikovs that figure seemed acceptable some sort of settlement of the same order of magnitude would be appropriate for each of the others i believe of course they could ask for more but i dont think they would get it there is also a statute of limitations naturally oh i said relieved i never have any real idea how rich i am within several dozen billion dollars but a billion one way or another wouldnt make much difference i thought you said you had bad news he lit the pipe i havent given you the bad news yet robin he said i looked at him he was puffing at the pipe peering at me through the smoke danm it do it he said that other man harbin eskladar what about him damn you kiara met him after leaving us on the true love he was a pilot too the two of them decided to go back to the black hole so klara rented juan henriquette santosschmitzs ship which was capable of the mission and before they leftwellthe thing is robin klara and eskladar were married there are surprises that as soon as you hear them you know instinctively you should have been prepared for this one came out of nowhere thank you albert i said hollowly dismissing him he was sighing as he left but he left i didnt have the heart to go on talldng to klara i instructed my doppel on what to say next to her and to metchnikov and even to this harbin eskladar person but i didnt stay around while it happened i retreated into gigabit space and wrapped it around me i know that albert thinks i spend too much time in my own head i wont deny any of the things he says i dont mean i agree with them i dont im not any smarter than he thinks i am but im not as weird either what i am basically is im human i may really be only the digital transcription of a human being but when i was transcribed all the human parts were transcribed too and i still feel all the things that go with being meat both the good and the bad i do the best i canmostlyand thats about all i can do i know whats important i understood as well as albert did that the foe were scary i would have had nightmares if i had slept about the universe crashing down on our ears and i had a lot more fits of agitation and depression when i thought of the gang of them out there in their kugelblitz ready at any time to come out and do to us what they had done to the sluggards and the starwisp people and the ones buried under the ice but theres important and theres also important i am still human enough to think interpersonal relationships are important even when theyre past tense and all thats left is the need to make absolutely sure there are no longer any hard feelings after albert had gone away to wherever albert goes when i dont have a use for him i floated in gigabit space for a long time doing nothing a long time long enough so that when i peeked once more at the scene in central park klara had just got as far as robin id like you to meet my it was funny i didnt want to hear the word husband so i ran away what i just said isnt exactly true i didnt run away i ran to and the person i ran to was essie she was on the dance floor at the blue hell wildly polkaing with somebody with a beard and when i cut in she caroled oh good to see you dear robin have you heard news embargo is lifted thats nice i said stumbling over my own feet she took a good look at my face sighed and led me off the dance floor went badly with gellekiara moynlin she guessed i shrugged its still going i left my doppel there i let her shove me into a seat and sit herself across from me elbows on table chin propped on elbows looking me over with great care ah she said nodding as she completed her diagnosis gloopy stuff again angst anomie all that good stuff right and most of all gelleklara moynlin i said judiciously not most of all no because it would take forever to tell you all the things that bother me but yes thats one of them shes married you know uh she didnt add so are you so i had to do it myself its not just that shes married because so am i of courseand i wouldnt want it to be any other way honestly essie she scowled at me oh robin never thought it would be possible to find hearing that a bore but how often you do say it i only say it because its true i protested my feelings having suffered a minor flesh wound already know is true well i guess you do at that i admitted i didnt know what to say next i discovered a drink in my hand and took a pull at it essie sighed sure are one big partypooper robin was feeling grand when you were not nearby im sorry but honest essie i dont feel like partying comes more gloopy business she said martyred okay spit out what is now on poor tortured mind what is worst thing of all i said promptly everything and when she didnt look as though that had explained it clearly enough for her i added its just one damn thing after another isnt it ah she said and thought for a while then she sighed what gloomy creature you are dear robin should perhaps talk again with headshrinker program sigfnd von shrink no ah she said again and thought some more then she said tell you what dear old gloom person how about we skip this party a while and look at some home movies okay i had not expected that from her what kind of home movies i demanded surprised but she didnt answer she didnt wait for me to agree either she began showing them the sounds of the spindle and the sights of the partying gateway prospectors faded away we werent there anymore we were in a different place and we were looking at a bench with a child on it now they werent real movies of course any more than anything else in gigabit space is real they were simply computer simulations like everything else either one of us chose to imagine they were quite compellingly real in all appearancessight sound even smell even the chill of cold air and the congestion of sooty air to our breathing it was all very familiar we were looking at methe child me many many decades ago i felt myself shivering not relevant to the temperature of the air the child robinette broadhead was sitting hunched up against the cold air on a park bench it was called a park anyway really it was a pretty lousy excuse for one if things had been different it could have been quite spectacular for the wyoming hills were behind the childme beautiful they were not they were smoggy gray lumps in the dingy air you could actually see hydrocarbon particulates floating in it and the limbs of every scrawny tree were coated with soot and smear ithe child who had been mewas dressed for the climate which was vile it took three sweaters a scarf gloves and a knitted cap pulled down over my ears my nose was running i was reading a book i waswhat oh maybe i was ten years old and i was coughing as i read remember dear robin is good old days for you said essie from her invisible place beside me good old days i snorted youve been snooping around in my memories again i accusedwithout any real anger because of course both of us had invaded all of each others memory stores often and completely before that but just look dear robin she said look how things were i didnt need to be ordered to look i couldnt have stopped i had no trouble in recognizing the scene either it was the food mines where all of my childhood was spent the shale mines of wyoming where rock was quarried and baked into keratogens and then the oil was fed to yeasts and bacteria to make the singlecell protein that fed most of the toonumerous and toohungry human race in those mining towns you never got the smell of oil off you as long as you lived and as long as you lived was generally not very long anyway i added i never said the old days were any good correct robin essie cried triumphantly good old days were distinctly bad much worse than now no are now no children compelled to grow up breathing nasty hydrocarbon air dying because cannot afford proper medical treatment oh sure thats true enough i said but still wait to argue robin is more to see what book do you read there is not hucklyberry finn or little mermaid i think i looked closer to oblige essie and then with a shock i saw the title she was right it was no childrens book it was the users guide to medical insurance programs and i remembered exactly when i had sneaked that copy out of the house when my mother wasnt looking so that i might try to understand just what catastrophe we were facing my mother was sick i groaned we didnt have enough coverage for both of us and sheshe she put off her own surgery so that you might have therapy robin essie said softly yes but that was later not this time this time was only that you needed better food and supplements and could not afford them i was finding this pretty painful look at my buck teeth i said no money fix them either robin was bad time for children correct so youre playing the ghost of christmas past i snapped trying to relieve the pressure by confusing her with a reference she wouldnt understand but when you have gigabit resources you can understand a lot no nor are you scrooge she said but consider in these times not so very far behind us whole earth was overpopulated hungry full of strife and anger terrorists robin remember violence and stupid murdering i remember all that of course now what happened robin i will tell you happened you and hundreds other crazy desperate heecheeship prospectors from gateway found technology of heechee and brought it back to earth found fine new planets to live onlike discovery of america only one thousand times greaterand found ways for people to move there are now no more overcrowded places on earth robin people have gone to newer places built better cities have not even damaged earth to do so air is not destroyed by gasoline engines or rocket exhausts use loop to get into orbit then anywhere no one so poor cannot have medicine now robin even organ transplantsand make organs out of chon material so need not even wait for other person to die to snatch secondhand bits out of corpse correct robin heechee food factory makes organs now developments you have played large part in bringing about have extended meat life always in good health many decades then transcribe mind like us to live very much longerin again development you have partly financed and i have partly helped develop so that not even dying is fatal you see no progress is not because no progress is there is because old gloomy robinette broadhead looks hard at delicious feast of everything now on plate of everyone alive and sees only what will later become namely shit but i said obstinately there are still the foe essie laughed she seemed actually to find it funny the picture disappeared we were back in the spindle and she leaned forward to kiss my cheek foe she said fondly oh yes dear robin foe are one more damn thing after another as you say but will deal with as have always dealt taking one damn thing at a time and now get back to important earlier business we dance she is a wonderful woman my essie real or not she was also quite right in every way that one could logically argue so i succumbed to logic i cant say that i really felt cheerful but the novocaine had at least dulled the painwhatever that real pain was enough so that i could go through the motions of having a good time i did i danced i partied i went whooping from one cluster of old machinestored friends to another and i joined essie and half a dozen others in the blue hell a bunch of people were dancing slowly to music that the rest of us didnt hearjulio cassata was one of them moving zombielike around the floor with a pretty little oriental girl in his arms it didnt seem to bother the dancers when we began singing old songs i sang right along with the rest even when they switched to ancient russian ballads about trolleybuses and the road to smolensk it didnt matter that i hadnt known the words because as i say when youre operating in gigabit space you know just about anything you want to at the moment you want to know about it and if in my case i didnt albert einstein would be sure to come and tell me i felt his tap on my shoulder as we were leaning on the old piano and looked up to see his smiling face very good voice robin he complimented and your russian language has become quite fluent join us i invited i think not he said robin something has happened all of the main broadcasting circuits went off the air about fifteen hundred milli seconds ago oh it took me a moment to understand what he was telling me then i swallowed and said oh theyve never done that before no robin i came here because i thought general cassata might know something about it he glanced over at where cassata and his lady were shuffling aimlessly around shall we ask him albert frowned thoughtfully at that and before he could answer essie had abandoned the singing to come over what she said sharply and when albert had told her said in shock is not possible to break down many independent circuits all multiply redundant i dont think it was a breakdown mrs broadhead said albert then what she demanded more silly jaws nonsense it is certainly a jaws order of course but what caused the order is i think something that happened on earth i cannot guess what it might have been on moore a the passengers on the refugee flight from the watch wheel were almost all children and it was a weepy journey they perked up a little when they reached earth orbit but not very much loop shuttles swarmed up to meet them attaching themselves to the transport ship like sucklings to a sow it was the childrens hard luck that the first ship to reach them was from jaws it was full of intelligence analysts so the next hours were no fun for the children the jaws analysts debriefed them stubbornly asking the same questions over and over in the hope of getting some new datum that might be somehow of use in determining just how false the false alarm had been of course none of the children had any such information to give it took a long time before the jaws agents were convinced of that but ultimately and reluctantly they allowed kinder people and programs to take over the new shift was in charge of finding places for the children to stay on earth for some of the children it was easy because they had families there the remainder went to schools all over the planet sneezy harold and oniko were almost the last to find places they stuck together out of friendship and even more because none of them spoke french or russian which ruled out the schools in paris and leningrad and besides none of them was quite ready to face the confusion of a big city that ruled out sydney new york and chicago and when the billeting program had found places for all the other children they three were left i wish it could be some warm place not too far from japan said oniko sneezy having given up hope of finding a heechee colony to take him added his vote to the request the billeting program was a schoolmarmy woman middleaged brighteyed softspoken although she was human in form sneezy felt kindness emanating from her she peered at her screenwhich did not exist any more than she didpuzzled over the readout for a moment then gave sneezy a pleased smile ive got three vacancies on moorea sternutator thats very near tahiti thank you said sneezy politely looking without recognition at the map she displayed the name of the island meant nothing to him one human place sounded very much like any other human place for they were all equally wildly exotic to a heechee boy but harold glumly reconciled to the fact that he wouldnt be taken to peggys planet right away shouted from behind oh boy im with you on that one okay and if its nice maybe you can buy it like you said oniko the shuttle took them down through the buffeting air to a loop on new guinea then came the longest leg of the trip stratospheric jet to faafaafaa airport in papeete as a special treat for the newcomers the human principal of the school met them and took them across to the neighbor island by boat look there she said holding onikos hand as the children clung to the seats of the open inertialdrive whaler just around the point inside the lagoon you see those white buildings on the beach with the taro patch on one side on the side of the mountain and the papaya plantation on the other thats your school she didnt mention the other grimmer buildings farther up the side of the mountain harold was too busy being sick over the side of the boat to ask about them and sneezy too consumed with tearless homesickness for the distant core and oniko too bludgeoned by earths harsh gravity to respond to anything at all for oniko it was all painful if not indeed threatening to her health she was crushed on earth her slim body did not weigh more than thirty kilos but that was twentyodd more than her unpracticed bones and muscles had ever been required to carry before all of the refugee children had needed preparation for earths gravity after spending time on the watch wheel for the whole long flight to earth they had been made to drink calciumladen things like milk and hot chocolate and weirdest of all cheese soup as well as having to exercise three hours each day in the spinning treadmills and with the springy machines for most of the children it was simply a wise precaution for oniko it was the only alternative to snapping bones the doctor programs had special plans for her and she had spent hours on end on a table while humming sonar coaxed her bones to grow stronger and electric pulses made each muscle twitch and jump as they neared earth orbit the doctorthing assured her that she had recalcified quite a lot she should be safe against fractures if she exercised reasonable care and used a walker and did not jump from any height but if the bones had been propped up for their ordeal not nearly enough had been done for her muscles every step tired her every time she stood up she ached so the exotic thing that gave her most pleasure in her first days at western polynesian preparatory school was the lagoon the water was scary as well as joyous to be sure there were living creatures under those pretty green wavelets but she accepted the schoolthings promise that none of them could hurt her and when she immersed herself in the tepid briny lagoon there was hardly any weight at all on her bones she floated around in it blissfully every chance she got in the morning before class during recess even after dark when the moon lit the ripples for her for sneezy the sea was neither greatly exciting nor any fun at all he had seen seas on his own planet inside the core why not they were not considered particularly recreational because heechee couldnt swim bone and muscle dont float well without a sizable wrapping of fat and there were no fat heechee so to keep oniko company he allowed himself to be tempted into a rubber boat sometimes but only rarely would he let himself drift into waters deeper than his own height harold at first found a home on moorea earth was very much like peggys planet he explained to their classmates no said some of the classmates he had it the wrong way around peggys planet was very much like earth indeed it was actually that was what had made human beings so anxious to colonize it in those early days when the fecundity of human bodies outran the carry ing capacity of the planet well maybe said harold reasonably but any halfwit could see at once that peggys planet was better harold found it disappointing not to say outrageous that other children showed so little interest in hearing that from him the three children from the wheel shared one special handicap they were outsiders they were the newest kids in school entered well after the beginning of the term friendships and alliances had long since formed of course the human principal had invited every student in the school to show special courtesy and consideration to the waifs from intergalactic space the students did for a while it didnt last once the questions had been asked and the lack of satisfying answers had been noted the powerful lines of roommateship and fellowsoccerplayer status tightened up and squeezed them out not meanly or violently but out it was worse for sneezy and oniko sneezy was the only heechee in the school and oniko the only child who had been raised in heechee ways they were simply too alien to easily be best friends with anyone else harold had no such problem at first harold had only the problem of himself he gazed up at mooreas startling central peak and said you call that a mountain why on peggys planet theres a peak fourteen kilometers tall he watched scenes from new york city and brasilia and said disdainfully that on pegjys planet people kept their cities clean after the antiquities class discussed pompeii and the great wall of china harold was heard to say in recess that on peggys planet thank heaven people knew enough to throw old junk away since there were students in the school from khatmandu new york brasilia beijing and naples harolds disparagement of their local tourist attractions did nothing to endear him the schoolthings pleaded benignly but the students were under no obligation to respect their wishes in the long run harold was more of an outsider than either oniko or sneezy those two studied hard when they had spare time they used it at the datamachines learning even things they were not required to learn both were quickly at the top of their classes and harold straining to maintain a respectable average was jealous ultimately he was furious when the schoolthing handed out test results one day the light bulb went on over harolds head and he leaped from his seat and cried schoolmaster it isnt fair naturally those two get better marks because theyre cheating now harold the schoolthing smiled patientlyit was the end of the days lessons and all the students were getting restless if not irritable certainly sternutator and oniko do not cheat well what do you call it theyve got those ai databases with them all the time and they use them ive seen them do it the schoolthing said firmly really harold you know that sternututor like all heechee requires a constant source of lowlevel microwave for his health oniko doesnt the schoolthing shook its head theres no grounds for using words like cheating simply because a student carries his own dataretrieval system on his person you have your own desk console dont you now please go back to your seat so we can discuss this evenings conceptualization assignment and that afternoon down at the lagoon harold sat rigidly on the shelly beach while oniko splashed in the shallows and sneezy dug for bits of coral i am sorry you dont like us sneezy said what are you talking about were friends of course i like you harold lied no i think not oniko called from two meters away why is that harold have i ever harmed you no but youre a human being why do you act like a heechee whats wrong with acting like a heechee sneezy asked hissing in annoyance well said harold reasonably you cant help what you are but youre such cowards you know you ran off and hid from the foe i dont blame you he added looking as though he blamed them very much because my father says its natural for a heechee to be yellow i am actually rather tan sneezy said proudly his color had been changing a sign that he was growing up i dont mean color i mean chicken its because youre not as sexy as people oniko splashed closer to hear better squatting in the wavelets i have never heard such a strange thing she complained its a matter of biology harold explained my father told me all about it human beings are the sexiest creatures in the galaxy thats why theyre so brave and smart if you look at some lower animal say a lion or a gorilla or a wolf ive never seen any of those no but youve seen pictures havent you and sneezy has too well did you ever see a gorilla with boobs like a girls he caught sneezys eye going to onikos flat chest and said irritably oh god i dont mean now i mean when she grows up human women have big breasts all the time not just when theyre feeding a baby like some dumb animal human women can do you know can do sex all the time not just once a year or something that explains it do you see its evolutions way of making us better because human women can get men to hang around them all the time so thats how civilization started like hundreds of thousands of years ago oniko painfully waded out of the water frowning trying to follow harolds line of reasoning she asked what does that have to do with being brave thats how human beings worked out so well my father told me the whole thing the human fathers stayed around all the time because they wanted to like make love you know so they got the food and stuff and the mothers could do a better job taking care of the kids heechee dont have that going for them my parents stay together sneezy said forcefully he wasnt angry he hadnt decided yet whether there was something to get angry with harold about but he found the argument confusing they do because they copied us probably harold said doubtfully and sneezy looked thoughtful because he suspected that part might be almost true in the core he knew heechee lived in conununes not nuclear families anyway they dont uh do sex all the time the way my mom and dad do do they certainly not cried sneezy scandalized heechee women made love only when it was the biologically right time for them to do so his father had explained that to him long before the womans body told her when it was time and then she told the mansomehow or other it didnt seem to need words but bremsstrahlung had been vague about that part of it so you see harold cried in triumph that makes human men like show off for their girlfriends all the time in the old days they maybe hunted or fought some other tribe now they do different kinds of things like they play football or make scientific discoveriesor go exploring dont you see it makes us braver oniko toweling herself said doubtfully my father told me my grandfather was terribly frightened when he went out from gateway harold shrugged there are individual exceptions and women went out too there were almost as many women as men on the artifact oh oniko said harold exasperated im talking about a general law not about individuals see you just dont know what its like in a human world because you never got to live on a good one like peggys planet oniko dragged herself erect on her walker i dont think its really that way on earth either harold sure it is didnt i just tell you no i dont think so i did some research after we came here sneezy hand me my pod i think i have it in my diary she put her pod on and bent down to it then laboriously straightening she said yes thats it listen the oldfashioned nuclear family is less frequent on earth now childless couples are frequent when couples have children it is usual for both parents to work there is also a large proportion of singleparent families so its not exactly the way you say harold harold sniffed disdainfully keeping a diary is a baby thing to do he said when did you start it she looked at him thoughtfully i dont remember exactly when we were on the wheel why i keep one too cried sneezy i guess when you told me you were doing it i decided it sounded like a good idea oniko frowned i thought you were the one who told me she said then she grimaced but right now i want to get back to my dorm so i can lie down for a while before dinner please i feel a little apologetic because ive jerked us around in time so much i think i should pin this time frame down a little more accurately this didnt happen while essie and i were on the wheel not by many millions of milliseconds it happened earlier at a time when essie and i were just beginning to debate whether we were really going to go to the one hundredth reunion on wrinkle rock and my life almost seemed placid i didnt know what was coming of course the kids didnt know what was coming either they were going about their business which was the business of being children when in the normal course of school practice sneezy went for his twicemonthly examination the docthing was pleased to see him it didnt often get a chance to examine a healthy heechee with his double heart almost fatless internal organs and ropy musculature everything is normative it said scanning the test monitors approvingly only you dont seem to be sleeping well sneezy sneezy said reluctantly sometimes i have trouble getting to sleep then i dream oh the docthing had taken the form of a young human male it smiled reassuringly and said tell me about it sneezy hesitated then unwillingly he said i do not have a cocoon you know ah said the program sneezy waited he did not want to have to tell this mechanical program what it was like for a young heechee to have to sleep on a bed with nothing but sheets to pull over his head heechee slept enclosed preferably with some sort of warm soft clumps of material to burrow down into that was the right and proper way to sleep and blankets and sheets were no substitute how right his father had been to forbid him a bed he thought wistfully he did not have to elaborate the docthings databases provided the explanation i have ordered you a cocoon said the program benignly now about those dreams yes said sneezy dismally he did not want to talk about the dreams he never had not even to oniko he didnt even like to remember them when he was awake well what do you dream sneezy hesitated what did he dream what did he not i dream about my parents he began and about home i mean my real home in the core of course you do said the docthing smiling and then there are the other dreams theyredifferent sneezy paused for a moment thinldng theyre scary theyrewell sometimes there are these bugs clouds of them swarming floating ifickering they swooped around him and crept into his clothing into his mouth into his skin stinging without pain theyre like fireflies he finished trembling have you ever seen a firefly the program asked patiently no only in pictures i mean fireffles do not sting sneezy the docthing pointed out and the sort of insects which do sting cause itching and pain do you have any of that oh no nothing like that at least not exactly sneezy corrected himself but there is a kind of i dont know how to say it an itch in the head i mean it makes mei dont knowit makes me want to learn things what sort of things sneezy things the boy said unhappily sneezy knew that he was describing the dreams poorly what else could you do when you tried to put a dream into words dreams were soft and fuzzy and shapeless words were hard and exact the heechee language of feel would have been a little better for the purpose but the program had chosen to speak in english and sneezy was too polite to complain but the program nodded understandingly yes yes sneezy it said kindly such dreams are symbols perhaps they represent your perfectly normal childs interest in the sexuality of your parents perhaps they refer to the traumas you have experienced you may not realize it sneezy but you have gone through more stress in the past few weeks than most adults experience in years oh said sneezy he did actually realize it very well and also the program sighed there is the general apprehension everyone feels these days not just children adults of both races and even machine intelligences no one is exempt you understand that i am referring to the foe they are frightening sneezy agreed and particularly for an impressionable child who has even had some personal experience of the scare apparently baseless though it was on the watch wheel the docthing cleared its throat announcing a change of subject now what about these diaries of yours it beamed sneezy hissed faintly then accommodated himself to the new course they keep me from being homesick he said not because that was truethey didntbut because sneezy had learned what every child learns human or heechee when adults ask hard questions you can satisfy them with the easy answers they expect very good therapy the docthing nodded but such detail sneezy so many pages of data one would think you were trying to compile an encyclopedia dont you think you should spend less time on that sort of thing and more playing with your classmates ill try sneezy promised and when he was released at last he rehearsed entries for his diary all the way back to his dormitory they mostly began with a single observation human programs dont know much about heechee kids but when he did begin writing in his diary again that was not what he wrote at all i dont care what albert says i cant help feeling sorry for sneezy and for oniko andoh hell yes even for harold wroczek harold wasnt really bad he simply hadnt had much practice at being nice the three of them continued to spend more time with each other than with any of the three hundredodd other students though harold hated it when sneezy and oniko insisted on spending hours on end with the databases my god he complained do you think you have to learn everything there is to know we like it oniko said simply harold spread his hands in resignation but then he trailed after them to the study rooms and having nothing better to do studied on his own to everyones astonishment his grades began to climb apart from lonesomeness and the troublesome dreams sneezy rather liked school the beach was neat once you got used to being in water the sportsthing contrived a sort of harness of floats that sneezy could wear and before long he was swimming with the best of them the classes were interesting the other students were at least tolerable if not warmly friendly and the island was beautiful if filled with curious and sometimes worrisome things for example there was the meadow just above the school large horned ruminants grazed there when sneezy looked them up in the databases he discovered they were called cattle and when he found out what cattle were generally raised for he was appalled sneezy had spent all four of his years on the watch wheel resolutely not thinking about where his human schoolmates preferred to get their protein now he was confronted with the mooing defecating source of roasts and hamburgers themselves disgusting ninetyfive percent of sneezys diet like that of any proper heechee came from frozen cometary gasesor from any other handy source of the four basic elements of human nutrition carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen add a few trace elements and chonfood could be made into anything you liked it was cheap it was maximally nutritious being manufactured for all dietary requirements and it did not require murdering anything that could feel pain half the schools meals were chon anyway there was a food factory afloat in the shallow seas off the neighbor island of tahiti sucking its basic raw materials out of the sea and the air but human children like human adults seemed actually to relish the thought that the bloody steaks they ate actually came from living animals though not to be sure the ones on the pasture just above the school because they were a prize herd devoted to special ends he didnt discuss those ends with his schoolmates that was fortunate for sneezy for raising animals to eat was not after all the most repellent use that could be made of them in sneezys second month on the island of moorea two good things happened the first was that his cocoon arrived and was installed in his dormitory cubicle so that from then on he could snuggle down into soft burrowable clumps of foam and pull a lid over his head to sleep like any proper heechee it caused a fair amount of joking from his dormitory mates but sneezy tolerated that all right it didnt seem to stop the dreams either but it was a vast improvement over the sterile and unwelcoming sheets and blankets the poor human kids had to put up with the second thing was that the principal of the school discovered how ifi adjusted the regular medical program was for a heechee child and went to the trouble of acquiring a more suitable one the new program took the form of a handsome young heechee male copperskinned and deepeyed it had a centimeter of down atop its smooth skull and its shoulder and neck tendons twitched amiably as it greeted sneezy he liked the new docthing very much on first encounter and when it came time for the second he actually looked forward to it oniko was scheduled for her checkup at the same time sneezy helped her carefully through the narrow hall though with her cane she was reasonably able to get along by herself by now and greeted the nursething cheerfully to the surprise of both of them the nurse conducted them into a single room sneezys young heechee and onikos middleaged human female were seated together at a desk and there were two chairs for the children we thought we would talk to you together said onikos docthing in heecheebecause you have a lot in common you both have the same sort of dreams the heechee figure chimed in tiny luminous creatures buzzing around you even stinging you but never really causing you pain and they go on and on said the female thing thats true said sneezy looking at oniko she nodded and neither of you seems to take much interest in sports the female added i can understand that about you oniko since you are still not quite physically strong enough for much exertion but you sternutator are in excellent physical condition and neither of you even watch them on the pv do you not football baseball jai alai anything at all i think they are quite boring yes sneezy admitted listen to yourself sternutator said the heechee docthing do you sound like a tenyear old he sounds normal enough to me sniffed oniko the female nodded by your standards yes it said you both seem to have extremely adult interests weve checked your dataretrieval logs we can understand that each of you has spent many hours learning all you can about the foe to be sure anyone might do thatthey are certainly important to us all still very few of your schoolmates seem so motivated in this area but why do you have such an interest in a fasterthanlight transportation oniko she looked puzzled its just interesting i guess isnt everybody interested in that not to the same extent nor in such alien races as the sluggards the quanices and the voodoo pigs but theyre kind of funny oniko said defensively yes said the heechee docthing taking over and the subjects that most interest you sternutator are also both amusing and quite important i would say the locations of heechee outposts and depots the history of heechee exploration the principles involved in penetrating black holes but you see sternutator even a perfectly normal curiosity when carried to extremes can be excuse me it said suddenly glancing at the female beside it and the female said with an abrupt change of tone children there is a very important news broadcast coming in the principal wishes every student to see it so we will terminate this interview to display it and the two of them turned around in their chairs to gaze at the wall behind them it lighted up with a shimmering silvery haze that cleared to display a male human face expression serious far larger than life it was speaking as it appeared and here is another part of the decoded message the face paused listening as another voice disembodied spoke rapidly in a hurried mechanical way it said the total number of species presently existing in the galaxy which are either already technologically capable or give indications of possible future development to that stage is eleven only three of these have mastered interstellar flight and one of the three uses only einsteinlimited propulsion systems two of the remainder may achieve spaceflight within the next few centuries the others are tool users in varying stages of development the voice died and the face eyes narrowed in concern said the entire message when slowed to normal speaking speed is estimated to run more than nine hours only a few portions of it have as yet been rerecorded for realtime study however for the benefit of those who may just have joined us the message was in the form of a burst transmission which lasted only one point oh oh eight three seconds the origin of the transmission has not yet been established except that it was fed into the earth satellite transmission net and beamed in the direction of the kugelblitz apparently from tokyo tower all landlines feeding into the tower are now being investigated the face paused gazing steelyeyed out at its audience of course no transmissions at ftl velocities in the direction of the watch wheel or the kugelblitz are permitted under the emergency rules laid down by the joint assassin watch more than ten weeks ago a movement beside sneezy shook him out of the staring trance the broadcast had caused he looked around oniko had got out of her chair and was hobbling out the door excuse me sneezy muttered and followed outside oniko was leaning against the wall sobbing whats the matter he demanded in alarm itswell certainly its scary but it could be just some technical error or a practical joker or oh sneezy the girl wailed dont you see he opened his mouth to answer but she rushed on that message do you know what it was it was part of my diary o in deep time cassata was doing his dreamy draggy twostep with his eyes closed and the little oriental womans head on his shoulder incredible she looked exactly like a normal human being with any humans common sense and yet she was actually cuddling up to the man i snarled cassata what the hell is going on he gave me a peculiar look i dont know how else to describe it it wasnt apologetic it wasnt arrogant what it seemed to be wasi dont knowmaybe the word is doomed to be sure he was what was waiting for him when he got back to his meattime original was termination but hed known that for a long time and he hadnt looked that way he seemed to be waiting for an ax to fall he courteously released his partner kissed her forehead and turned to me you want to talk to me he said damneye right i he headed me off i suppose we might as well he sighed but not here not your ship either something nice something i can enjoy i opened my mouth to tell him how little i cared what he enjoyed but albert was ahead of me the rue de la paix perhaps general cassata a little openair cafй along the left bank something like that would be fine cassata agreed and there we were seated around a metal table on a sunny boulevard under a striped umbrella that advertised an aperitif while a whiteaproned waiter was taking our orders nice choice albert cassata said appreciatively but i was having none of that cut the crap i barked whyve you blacked out all earthside radio cassata picked a camparisoda off the waiters tray and sniffed at it thoughtfully i dont know he said and added yet but you know why you embargoed my ship oh yes robin it was an order and embargoing ship from core essie put in not waiting her turn i was nowhere near through with cassata he shrugged that was all essie needed she gave him a killing look then turned one on me you believe this even heechee ancient ancestors must report first to jaws then will see if rest of us are grownup enough to hear before releasing data cassata repeated orders then he took a better look at essie and said placatingly its only a technicality mrs broadhead stupid technicality robin send order off to institute these uncultured clowns dont deserve cooperation well now wait a minute he said hastily doing his best to be agreeable this is just an emergency measure later on im sure that if you and robinette want to access any of the information theres not going to be any difficultyi mean real difficulty but they have to be debriefed by the joint assassin watch service before any public disclosure of course not of course no of course involved she turned to me eyes blazing robin tell this soldier man is not a question of personal favor for you and me is information which belongs to all i said its information which belongs to everybody cassata essie wasnt letting it go at that tell him robin she snapped so fiercely that the passersby on the rue de la paix glanced at us curiously they werent real of course just part of the surround but when essie programs surrounds she goes all the way one pretty little dark woman seemed fascinated by usmore so than you would have expected from mere stage dressing i took a second look and it was the woman cas sata had been dancing with evidently cassata had left a trail of bread crumbs so she could sneak into our new surround i stepped up the voltage i told him you dont have a choice look cassata this isnt a question of classifying material so an enemy wont get it there arent any enemies on this matter except the foe themselves do you think were spying for them no of course not he said unhappily trying to please but these are highlevel orders were highlevel people he gave me one of those ijustworkhere shrugs of course you are only he paused having caught a glimpse of the young woman in the fringe of the crowd he shook his head at her she grinned blew him a kiss and ducked away sorry he said friend of mine i told her this was a private meeting what were you saying i snarled you know damn well what i was saying and i would have gone on but cassatas expression suddenly changed he wasnt listening to me anymore his face froze his eyes were vacant as though hearing something none of the rest of us could hear and indeed he was for i recognized the look it was the way someone in machine storage looks when he is being told something on a private band i even had a pretty good idea of what he was going to say he frowned shook himself looked around vacantly for a moment and then said it oh s ill said general julio cassata i felt essies hand slip into mine she knew something bad was coming too tell us i demanded he sighed a deep sigh ive got to get back to jaws he said give me a lift will you that time he surprised me the first thing i said was only a reflexive what and then i got better organized you change your mind pretty fast cassata first you tell me to stay away entirely then you freeze my ship forget that he said impatiently its a new ball game i have to get there right away and youve got the fastest ship will you take me well maybe but but what he said i just got word the blackout isnt an exercise its real i think the foe have a base on earth to give a machinestored intelligence like general cassata a lift somewhere doesnt take much space all you have to do is take the storage chip fan tape or cube and put it in the ship and away you go cassata was in a hurry he had a workthing moving it even as he asked me for permission and as it reached the hatch we buttoned down and went total elapsed time for the transfer less than three minutes long enough i didnt waste the three minutes while we were waiting the long long time for the workthing to get from one bay to another i was paying my last respects to a lost love it didnt take long the word of the blackout had reached even the meat people by now and those stonestatue folks were drifting toward the pv plate where a news program was telling the asteroid that all radio communciation had been cut off my doppel was standing well back from the others looking unhappy i saw why at once there was klara and there was herher husband and they were holding each other tighter than ever i wished i wished mostly that i had had a chance to know harbin eskladar better strange that klara should have married a former terrorist strange that she should ever have married anyone but me i thought and then i thought robin old sod youd better get out of this and i zapped myself back to the true love and zipped myself in and we were gone robin come look cried essie and i swooped into the control room to do as i was ordered julio cassata was looking hangdog and depressed under the viewscreen and essie was pointing at it with fury warships she cried look robin triggerhappy jaws is getting ready to wipe out world cassata glowered at me your wifes driving me crazy he said i didnt look at him i was looking at the screen in that first moment before we went into ffl drive the screens had picked up the jaws satellite a hundred thousand kilometers away even in our farout orbit it was almost hidden by the bulge of the earth but i could see that jaws was not alone midges swarmed around it ships essie was right warships then we were moving into ftl the screen clouded and cassata protested theyre not going to attack anything theyre just a precaution precaution to send out whole fleet with weapons ready essie scolded of such precautions are wars made would you rather have us do nothing he demanded anyway youll be there soon you can complain right to him if you want toi mean he stopped looking glum again because of course the him was himself in his meat version but he was right we right well will complain i told him starting with why this message was kept secret from us albert coughed politely it wasnt robin he said cassata chimed in belligerently you see youre always going off halfcocked the whole message was broadcast in burst transmission just as it was received first time out ill bet albert recorded it albert said apologetically it was only a sort of synoptic report on everything about the heechee and the human race robin theres nothing in it that you couldnt find in the encyclopaedia britannica and so on hah said essie still disgruntled but she stopped there she thought for a moment then she shrugged you fellows you help yourself to drinks et cetera she said remembering her duties as a hostess me i go listen to this burst for self i started to follow because essies company on the worst day of her life was still better than julio cassatas but he stopped me robin he said i didnt want to say anything while she was here i looked at him in astonishment i could not believe there was anything he and i could ever share as a confidence then he said its about that guy your old girlfriend is married to oh i said that didnt seem to satisfy cassata so i added i never met him before but his names harbin eskiadar i think his names esidadar all right cassata said savagely and i know i hate his effing guts i cant deny that that perked me up right away the topic of what a lousy person kiaras husband might be was quite congenial to me have a drink i said he looked hesitant then shrugged just a quick one he said you dont remember him well do you remember me i mean like thirty or forty years ago when we first met i was a brigadier at the time i remember that sure i said producing drinks he took what i offered without looking to see what it was did it ever occur to you to wonder why it took me all these years to be promoted a lousy two grades actually i never had i hadnt even thought about cassata very much far less about how he was doing in his job because he had been nothing but bad news even back in the high pentagon when i was still meat and all the armed forces had to worry about was human terrorists my opinion of cassata at that time was that he was a wart on the face of the human race nothing had changed it since but i said politely i guess i never knew why esidadar eskiadar was why he was my aidedecamp and i damn near got thrown out of the service because of him the son of a bitch was moonlighting and what he did for an afterhours job was terrorism he was part of general beaupre heimats old secret terrorist cell in the high pentagon after a moment i said again oh and this time cassata nodded angrily as though i had said it all in a sense i had because anyone who had been through the days of misery and terrorism needed no discussion of what they were like it was not something you forgot for twenty years and more the whole planet had been bombed raped ravaged and gouged by people whose fury had so exceeded their judgment that the only thing they could think of to do to express their discontent was to kill somebody not just one somebody hundreds of thousands had died one way and another in viruspoisoned water supplies or wrecked buildings or bombed cities and not even any particular somebody because the terrorists had struck at anyone the innocent as well as the guiltyor the ones they considered guilty anyway and the worst part of it was that trusted people highranking military officers and even heads of state had been secret members of terrorist groups a whole nest of them had been uncovered in the high pentagon itself but eskladar broke up the ring i said remembering cassata tried to laugh it came out more like a snarl he turned over to save his own skin he saidand then reluctantly well maybe not just to save himself he was an idealist i guess but as far as i was concerned it didnt matter he was my adc and he cost me promotion for twenty years he finished his drink brightening he said well i dont want to keep her waiting and then he stopped but a little too late keep who waiting i asked and he winced at the way i said it well robin he said abjectly i didnt think youd mind if i uh if besides me there waswell a woman i said cleverly deducing weve got a stowaway on board he looked unrepentant shes just a canned deader like you he saiddiplomacy had never been cassatas strength i just had them put her store on along with mine it wont take up much room for gods sake and ive only got he stopped there without quite saying just what hed only got a little of left he was a little just a very little too proud to beg he didnt have to whats her name i asked alicia lo shes the one i was dancing with well i said its only for this one flight all right go keep your friend company i didnt add just stay out of my sight i didnt have to that was exactly what he was certain to do and if i had been in his position i expect i would certainly have done exactly the same thing myself and then there was nothing to get through but the interminable trip itself in the true love it takes only twentythree minutes for a fasterthanlight trip from wrinkle rock to jaws thats actually real slow in fact it isnt even faster than light because eleven and a half of those minutes go into getting up speed at one end and eleven and a half to slowing down again at the other the actual trip time is oh a wink and a half still twentythree minutes isnt muchby meatperson standards we were not on meat standard time but oh how many milliseconds a single minute holds by the time we were well free of the asteroid and albert was setting course for the satellite i was biting my metaphoric nails we keep true love pretty much in the earth solar system hardly ever very far from the earth itself and so i always have contact with all the many projects ive got going on earth to keep me amusedslow yes but only seconds slow not eternities not this time this time there was the radio blackout i could have sent messages all right but answers i could have none what i had to entertain me was essie and albert and my memories cassata wasnt much good my memories are plentitudinous but the memories on top were largely klara and largely sad essie on the other hand is always rewarding or almost always the only times she isnt rewarding is when im stuck in a tangle of irritation or worry or misery and im afraid thats where i was just then after shed arranged our johore surround pretty palace overlooking the straits and singapore and i just sat glumly ignoring the malaysian meal shed ordered up she gave me one of her searching ohgodishegettinggboopyagain looks something is bothering you she asserted i shrugged not hungry i guess she offered spearing a ball of rice with some kind of black things in it and chewing lustily i made the pretense of picking up something in a leaf and chewing it robin she said have two choices talk to me or talk to albertsigfridany damn body only talk no sense twisting poor old head around alone i guess i will i said because it was true i was getting gloopy again albert found me back on wrinkle rock or anyway the simulation of it i had created to match my mood i was on level tango where the ships docked wandering around and looking at the places where people i knew had departed from and never come back you seemed a little depressed he said apologetically i thought id just see if there was anything i could do not a thing i said but i didnt tell him to go away especially since i was sure essie had sent him there he pulled out his pipe lit it puffed thoughtfully for a while and then said would you like to tell me what is on your mind right now not a bit i said is it because you think im tired of hearing the same old things robin he asked and there was real affection in those makebelieve eyes i hesitated then took the plunge i said whats on my mind is everything albert now wait i know what youre going to say youre going to say which of all the things in everything is right on top okay thats the foe they scare me he said peacefully there is a lot to be afraid of in that context yes robin the foe certainly threaten us all no no i inid impatiently i dont mean the threat exactly i mean its so hard to understand ah he said smoking his pipe and gazing at me i mean i just dont have any good idea of whats going on with the universe i said no robin he agreed kindly you dont you could though if youd let me explain ninedimensional space and a few of the other concepts shut up about that i ordered knowing i was making a mistake i have a right to be humanly capricious everybody agrees to that but sometimes i think i carry it too far you see theres an infinity of knowledge reachable to me because ive been vastened i dont like to speak of what happened to me as being vastened when i talk to meat people because it makes them think i feel superior to them i dont want them to think that especially because of course i really am superior that infinite resource of data is only one part of the difference between me and meat the available datastore wasnt truly infinite of course albert doesnt let me use words like infinite for anything that can be counted and as all of that knowledge existed in chip fan or track storage somewhere certainly someone could have counted the stores someone not me i wasnt about to try to count the quantum bits of data and i wasnt about to try to absorb it all because i was scared oh god i was scared what of not just the foe though they were fearsome i was frightened by my own vastness which i dared not fully explore i feared i hugely feared that if i let myself expand to absorb all that knowledge i would no longer be robinette broadhead at all i feared i would not then be human i feared that the tiny parcel of data that was me would simply be drowned in all that accumulated information when you are only a machinestored memory of a human being you do your best to defend your humanity albert has often got impatient with me about that he says it is a failure of nerve even essie chides me now and then she says things like dear dumb robin why not take what is yours and then she tells me little stories from her own childhood to buck me up when i was young girl at akademy pounding brain over some damn nonsense reference volume on maybe boolean algebra or chip architecture in lenin library would often look around me in horror oh real horror dear robin would see all ten million volumes surrounding me and feel sick i mean robin sick almost physical sickness almost to point of throwing up at thought of swallowing all those gray and green and yellow books to know all that could know was impossible for me i said eagerly thats exactly it essie i but is not impossible for you robin she cut in severely chew robin open mouth swallow but i couldnt at least i wouldnt i held tightly to my physical human shape and to my meathuman limitations however selfimposed naturally i dipped into that vast store from time to time just dipped i only nibbled at the feast when i wanted as you might say one particular volume i would access that file i kept my eyes resolutely fixed on that single volume and ignored the endless shelves of books all around or better still i would call on my retinue of savants kings used to do that i had all the prerogatives of any king i did what kings did when they wanted to know something about counterpoint they would send for handel or salieri if they had a moments curiosity about the next eclipse tycho brahe would come running they kept on hand a lavish retinue of philosophers alchemists mathematicians and theologians the court of frederick the great for instance was almost a university turned upside down there was a faculty of all the experts in all the disciplines he could afford to feed and a student body of one him more kingly than any king who ever lived i could afford better than that i could afford every authority on every subject they were cheap enough because i didnt have to feed them or pay off their mistresses and it wasnt even a them they were all subsumed into my one allpurpose dataretrieval program albert einstein so when i complained to essie i wish i understood what all this talk about shrinking the universe meant she simply looked at me for a moment then she said ha no i mean it i said and i really did ask albert she said sunnily oh hell you know what that means hell tell me anything i want to know but hell go on telling me until its a lot more than i want to know dear robin she said is it not possible that albert knows better than you how much is enough oh hell i said but standing there with albert in the gloomy metal tunnel of the asteroid ship docks it seemed to me that the time had come there wasnt any help for it anymore i said albert okay open my head dump everything into it i guess i can stand it if you can he gave me a sunny smile it wont be that bad robin he promised and then corrected himself it wont be wonderful though i admit its going to be hard work maybe he glanced around maybe we should start out by getting a little more comfortable with your permission he didnt wait for the permission of course he just went ahead and surrounded us with the study in our house on the tappan sea i began to relax a little i clapped my hands for the butlerthing to bring me a tall drink and i sat back in comfort albert was watching me quizzically but he didnt say a word until i said to him im ready he sat down puffing on his pipe as he regarded me for what exactly for you to tell me all the things youve been wanting to tell me for the last million years ah but robin he smiled there are so many of them can you be specific which particular thing are you willing to let me explain now i want to know what the foe have to gain from collapsing the universe albert thought that over for a moment then he sighed oh robin he said sorrowfully no i said no oh robin no telling me i should have done this long ago no explaining to me that i have to learn quantum mechanics or something before i can understand i want to know now what a hard taskmaster you are robin he complained do it please he paused to reflect tamping tobacco into his pipe i suppose i could just tell you the whole enchilada he said as i have tried to do before and you have refused to listen i braced myself youre going to start with your ninedimensional space again arent you that and many other things robin he said firmly they are all involved the answer to your question is meaningless without them make it as easy on me as you can i begged he looked at me in some surprise youre serious this time arent you of course ill try to do that my dear boy do you know what i think i think the best way to start isnt to tell you anything at all ill just show you the pictures i blinked pictures i will show you the birth and death of the universe he said pleased with himself thats what you asked for you know it is it is the difficulty is that you simply refuse to grasp what a complicated question you are asking it will take quite a while several thousand milliseconds at least even if you try not to interrupt ill interrupt whenever i want to albert he nodded in acceptance yes you will thats one of the reasons it will take so long but if you are willing to take the time required oh do it for heavens sake but i already am doing it robin just a moment it takes a little work to set up the displaythere we are he finished beaming and then he disappeared beam and all the last thing i saw was alberts smile it lingered for a moment and then there was nothing youre playing alice in wonderland games with me i accused accused nothing and no one because there was nothing to taste see feel or smell but there was something to hear because alberts reassuring voice said only a bit of fun to start off with robin because it gets very serious from now on now what do you see nothing i said quite right that is what you see but what you are looking at is everything it is the entire universe robin it is all the matter energy time and space there ever was or will be it is the primordial atom robin the monobloc the thing in the big bang that banged i dont see a goddamn thing naturally not you cant see without light and light hasnt been invented yet albert i said do me a favor i hate this feeling of being nowhere at all cant you let me see a little something silence for a moment then alberts beaming face came shadowily back i dont suppose it would do any real harm if we could at least see each other he admitted is that better worlds better fine only please remember theres no real light yet there is no light without photons and all the photons are stifi in that single invisible point not only that he went on enjoying himself but if you could see thered be no place to see it from because there isnt any space to have a place in space hasnt been invented yet eitheror to put it a bit more precisely all the space and all the light and all the everything else is still in that single point right there in that case i said sulking what do you mean by there ah robin he cried in gratification youre not so dumb after all thats a really good questionunfortunately like many of the best questions its meaningless the answer is that the question is wrong there isnt any there there there is only the appearance of a there because i am trying to show you what by definition cannot be shown i was beginning to lose heart albert i said if thats the way this show is going to go now hang on he ordered dont quit now the show hasnt started yet robin i am only setting the stage to understand the beginning of the universe you must throw off all your preconceptions of time and space and seeing none of them exist at this point some eighteen billion years ago if time doesnt exist yet i said cleverly how do you know it was eighteen billion years ago another fine question and the same fine answer it is true that before the big bang there was no such thing as time so what you are looking at could be eighteen billion years ago it could also be eighteen billion trillion quadrillion quintillion whateveryoulike years ago the question does not apply but thisobjectdid exist robin and then it blew up i flinched back it did blow up right in front of my eyes nothing suddenly became something a point of intolerably bright light and the point exploded it was like an hbomb going off in my lap i could almost feel myself shriveled vaporized turned into plasma and dispersed roffing thunders of sound battered my nonexistent ears and pounded my incorporeal body my god i yelled albert said thoughtfully possibly so the idea seemed to please him not in the sense of a personal deity i meanyou know me too well for that but there surely was a creation and this was it what happened why the big bang just banged said albert in surprise thats what you saw i thought youd recognize it the universe has started it has also stopped i said beginning to recover because the great burst had frozen ive stopped it yes because i want you to see this point the universe isnt very old yetapproximately tentotheminusthirty seconds later i cant say much about anything earlier because i dont know anything much i cant even tell you how big the universe or that whatdoyoucallit that existed before the universe was bigger than a proton probably smaller than a pingpong ball maybe i can tell youi thinkthat the dominant force in there was probably the strong nuclear force or possibly gravity maybebecause it was so compact the gravity was of course high very high so was the temperature how high i dont know exactly probably as high as possible there is some theoretical reason to believe that the highest possible temperature is something of the order of tentothetwelfth kelvini could give you the argument if you like only if absolutely necessary please he said reluctantly i dont suppose that particular point is absolutely necessary all right let me tell you what else i cant say i cant even say anything much about the stage you are looking at now except to point out a few things that may not be apparent to you for instance that fireburst you are looking at contains everything it contains the atoms and particles that now constitute you and me and the true love and the watch wheel and the earth and the sun and the planet jupiter and the magellanic clouds and all the galaxies in the virgo clusters and and everything right i said to stop him i get the picture its big ah he said in satisfaction but you see you dont it isnt big ive taken a few liberties you see ive magnified it a lot because the big bang wasnt very big at all how big would you say that fireball was i have no way of telling a thousand lightyears across he shook his head and said thoughtfully i dont think so smaller maybe before the bang it had no size at all because space hadnt been invented yet and its not far from that now but its definitely small and yet it contained everything have you got that so far i just looked at him and he relented i know this is dreary for you robin but i want to make sure you understand now about the bang there wasnt any sound of course there wasnt any medium to carry sound for that matter there wasnt any place to carry it to that was just another little liberty i took more important the big bang wasnt the kind of explosion that starts from a firecracker and spreads out into the air as the gases expand because because there wasnt any air right or even space very good robin but theres another way in which that bang was different from all other bangs it didnt expand like a balloon or a chemical or a nuclear explosion it was something quite different youve seen those japanese paper flowers that you put into an aquarium as they soak up water they expand it was more like that robin but what crept in between the parts of the originalthing whatever you want to call it primordial atom or whateverwasnt water it was space the universe didnt explode it swelled very fast and very far and its still doing it i said oh albert looked at me searchingly for a moment then he sighed and the burst began to go on bursting it surrounded us i thought it would consume us it didnt but we were drenched in a sea of terrible light from the middle of it came alberts voice i am going to back us away some lightyears he said i dont know how many just enough so we can see it at a respectable distance the great ball of fire contracted and fled from us until it was no larger than the full moon now the universe is pretty old he said about a hundredth of a second its hot the temperature is around tentotheeleventh degrees kelvin and its dense i dont mean dense as matter is dense there wasnt any matter it was too dense for that the universe was a mass of electrons positrons neutrons and photons its density was about four times tentotheninth times as dense as water do you know what that means i think i know how dense dense is but how hot is hot albert said reflectively theres no good way to tell you because there isnt anything that hot to compare it with now i have to use one of those terms you hate the whole thing was in thermal equilibrium well albert i began no listen to me he snapped that just means that all those particles were interacting and changing think of it like a billion trillion light switches all going on and off at random but at any time there are as many going on as there are going off so the total balance is always preserved thats equilibrium it wasnt light switches of course it was electrons and positrons annihilating each other to produce neutrinos and photons and so on but as many events went one way as went the other result equilibrium even though inside that state of equilibrium everything was constantly bouncing around like crazy i said i guess so albert but youre taking a hell of a long time over the first hundredth of a second if were going to go eighteen billion years oh he said were going to go much farther than that dont anticipate please robin here we go and the distant puff of flame expanded a tenth of a secondnow the temperatures dropped to three times tentothetenth kelvin one second its dropped by another factor of three nowhere let me stop it for a moment this is fourteen seconds after the big bang it has cooled by another factor of three its only three times tentotheninth kelvin now this means that equilibrium is upset for a while because the electrons and positrons now can annihilate each other faster than theyre recreated in the opposite reaction well come back to around this point robin because thats where the answer to your question is well i said as tactfully as i could actually if its all the same to you why dont you just give me the answer now and we can skip the rest of the show it is not the same to me he said severely and you wont understand well speed up though here we are a few minutes after the bang the temperatures fallen by twothirds again its only tentotheninth kelvin its so cool in fact that actual protons and neutrons exist theyve even begun to combine in nuclei of hydrogen and helium actual matteror almost theyre only nuclei not whole atoms and all that socalled matter put together is only a tiny fraction of the mass of the universe most of it is light and neutrinos there are a few electrons but hardly any positrons how come i asked surprised what happened to all the positrons there were more electrons than positrons in the first batch so when they annihilated each other there were electrons left over why ah robin he said seriously thats the best question of all i will give you an answer that i dont expect you to understand since electrons and positrons and all the other particles for that matter are only harmonics of closed strings the numbers that were created are essentially random do you want to get into superstring theory i didnt think so just remember the word random and lets get on with it wait a minute albert i said where are we now about two hundred seconds after the big bang uhhuh i said albert weve still got billions and billions of years to go more than that robin much more oh wonderful and its taken us this long to go a couple of minutes so really robin he said you can call it off any time you like but then how can i answer the questions you will certainly keep on asking we can take a break if you want a little time to assimilate all this or better still i can just speed things up yeah i said staring without pleasure at that fuzzy blinding glob of everything there was i didnt really want to take a break what i wanted was for this to be over i admit that albert always knows whats good for me what he doesnt understand is that good is an abstract concept and there are lots of times when what is good for me is something i really dont want i was nearly sorry id brought the whole thing up because i wasnt enjoying this so i knew exactly what i wanted of alberts three alternatives i would much have preferred the first because i was getting really tired of heat and pressure and most of all of sitting nowhere in the middle of nothing second choice would have been to take a break and maybe relax a little with essie so i picked the third just speed it up a little okay albert sure thing robin here we go the glob swelled menacingly it still was really nothing but a glob there werent any stars or planets or even lumps in the pudding it was just an unsorted mass of stuff very bright it did however seem a little less eyedestroyingly bright than it had been now were a good long jump ahead albert said happily about half a million years have gone by the temperature has gone way down its only about four thousand kelvin nowthere are plenty of stars hotter than that but of course were not talking about isolated points of heat here were talking about the average temperature of the whole thing notice that its not quite as bright anymore up until now robin the universe was radiationdominated the dominant thing was photons now matter dominates radiation because there arent so many photons anymore right wrong im afraid albert said apologetically there are still plenty of photons but the overall temperature is lower which means the average energy per photon is lower therefore its mass is lower from now on matter outweighs radiation in the universe andhere we gothe glob inflated and darkened now were a couple hundred thousand years later and the temperature has dropped another thousand degrees this is according to weinbergs law the time it takes for the universe to cool from one temperature to another is proportional to the difference in the inverse squares of the temperatures i dont suppose you really need to understand that robin he added wistfully although theres a really neat demonstration in tendimensional supersymmetry cut it out albert whys the damn thing so dark ah he said gratified thats an interesting point there are so many nuclear and electronlike particles now that they get in the way of the light so the universe is opaque but that will change up to now weve had electrons and weve had protons but the universe was so hot that they just stayed that way as free particles they couldnt combine or rather they kept combining all the time to make atoms but the heat just blew them apart again now we roll the camerasand the glob enlarged itself again and suddenly brightenedand all of a sudden look robin the mixture has cleared light shines through the electrons and protons have combined to make atoms and the photons can move freely again he paused his shadowy face was beaming in pure pleasure i thought hard for a moment staring at the glob it was beginning to showoh no real structure but at least hints that maybe something was happening somewhere inside there like the planet uranus seen from afar albert i said thats all fine but look there are still plenty of photons right so why dont they collide and make more particles to make it all opaque again oh robin he said affectionately sometimes i think youre not really stupid after all ill give you the answer remember my famous e equals rncsquared the photons have energy e if two of them collide and their combined energy equals the mass of any particle m times the square of the speed of light then they can create that particle in their collision when the universe was youngthe threshold temperature is somewhere around tentotheninth kelvinthey had plenty of energy and they could create hellish big particles but it has cooled down now they cant they just dont have it anymore robin oh wow i said you know i almost have the illusion that i nearly understand dont put yourself down he chidedmeaning i supposed that i should leave that sort of thing to him he was silent for a moment then he fretted i havent told you about the creation of quarks and hadrons i havent even said anything about acceleration and thats important you see for the model to work you have to account for the fact that at some point in the big bang the outward expansion got faster i can give you an analogy its as though you had an explosion that kept on exploding for a time so instead of slowing down it expanded faster the actual explanation is more complicated and albert do i have to know this not really robin he said after a moment his tone was wistful but not insistent so why dont you just roll the camera some more oh very well i suppose every kid loves electric trains watching alberts model of the universe grow was almost like having the most hellishly huge set of trains to play with that any boy could imagine i couldnt make them run of course but just watching was a lot of fun the glob roiled and swirled and began to break up our camera zoomed in tight on one particular smudge in the swarm and i saw that too breaking up into smaller blobs clusters and metagalaxies formed and actual galaxies began to pinwheel into their familiar spiral forms individual points of light blew up and died new ones formed in the center of clouds of gas we have actual stars now robin albert announced from beside me this is the first generation clouds of hydrogen and helium fall together and contract and start nuclear fusion in their interiors thats where they cook all the heavier elements the ones your meat body was made ofcarbon nitrogen oxygen iron all the elements higher than helium then when they blow up as supernovae he pointed to one particular star that obligingly exploded in a tiny torrent of light all those elements float around in space until they happen to contract into another star and its planets and then they form other things like you robin i yelped you mean all the atoms that make me up used to be in the core of a star that made up your meat body he corrected yes robin in fact our own galaxy is in there now see if you can pick it out he froze the expanding cloud so i could peer around they all look alike i complained most of them do pretty much he conceded but theres m and there are the magellanic clouds and that spiral there thats us he was pointing to a glowing whirlpool of firefly light surrounded by other firefly patches in a vast thinly sprinkled darkness i dont see you and me anywhere in there i said trying for a joke he took it seriously he coughed im afraid i let it run a little past present time he apologized all of human history including the formation of the solar system and the expansion of the sun into a red giant has already taken place you missed it i turned to look at his shadowy face i dont know if i want to hear this i said and very nearly meant it he looked gently chiding but its only reality robin he said its a truth whether you want to know it or not i suppose that in a sense it might shake your notions of your own personal importance in the universe damn right it does well he said thats not a bad thing but dont get too crushed remember it is thisall of thisthat the foe are trying to change oh fine is that supposed to make me feel better he studied me for a moment not better exactly no but more in touch with reality after all remember that you and i and all the rest of the human race and the heechee and the machine intelligences have only two choices we can let the foe do what theyre doing or we can try to oppose them and how exactly are we supposed to do that he looked thoughtfully at the frozen model shall i run it a little further he asked youre changing the subject i know i am robin im going to run the model perhaps if you understand what all this entails you may in some way contribute to the solution of this problem perhaps not perhaps it cant be solved but in any case i dont see that we or someone else sooner or later have any choice but to try and you cant effectively even try without knowledge but im scaredl youd be crazy if you werent robin now do you want to see what happens next or not i dont know if i do i meant it i was beginning to get really nervous i gazed at that patchy glow that had once held me and essie and klara and all the pharaohs and kings and saviors and villains and heechee explorers and sluggard singers and dinosaurs and trilobitesall once there and now goneall gone long gone as far behind us as the birth of the sun itself i was scared all right it was all too big i felt tinier and more helpless and unreal than i had felt ever before in my life in either of my lives it was worse than dying worse even than when i had been vastened that had certainly been terrifying but it had had a future now the future was past it was like looking at my own grave albert said impatiently you do want to see ill go ahead the galaxy spun like a top i knew it was taking a quarterbillion years to the turn but it whirled madly and something else was happening the surrounding satellite galaxies crept away theyre spreading out i cried yes albert agreed the universe is expanding it cant make any more matter or energy but it keeps on making more space everything gets farther apart from everything else but the stars in the galaxy arent doing that not yet not exactly anyway just watch were heading for a hundred billion years in the future the galaxy spun faster still so fast that i couldnt make out the actual motion only a blur what i did see was that even the local group was beginning to move almost out of sight ill stop it for a moment albert said there do you notice anything about our own galaxy somebody turned off a lot of stars exactly it is dimmer yes what turned the stars off is time they got old they died you will note that the galaxy is reddish in color now rather than white the big white stars die first the old red ones die slowly even the little f and stars the yellow dwarfs no bigger than our own sun have already burned up all their nuclear fuel the dim red ones will go soon too watch slowly slowly the galaxy went out there was nothing visible anywhere but the shadowy outlines of our imaginary bodies and alberts imaginary face gazing pondering sad as to myself the word sad does not begin to describe it everything else that had ever happened to me every formless fear that had ever kept me awake at nightthey were all nothing i was looking at the end or so i thought and so it felt and all human concerns dwindled to nothingness by comparison but when i said is this the end of the universe then albert looked surprised oh no robin he said whatever gave you that idea but theres nothing there he shook his shadowy head wrong everything is still there it has grown old and the stars have died yes but theyre there they even still have their planets most of them the planets are dead of course theyre not much above absolute zero theres no more life if thats what you mean thats exactly what i mean yes robin he said patiently but thats just your anthropomorphic view the universe has kept right on cooling as it kept on making space to expand into but its dead and it will keep on being dead forever unless unless what i barked albert sighed lets get comfortable again he said i blinked as i found myself again in the world that awesome blackness was gone from around us i was sitting on the lanai of my house on the tappan sea with my still cold drink still unfinished in my hand and albert was calmly stoking his pipe in the wicker armchair my god i said faintly he just nodded deep in thought i finished my drink in a single gulp and rang for another albert said out of his reverie thats how it would be if the universe kept on expanding its scary yes he agreed it is frightening even to me robin he struck a wooden kitchen match on the sole of his scuffed shoe and puffed i should point out to you that this demonstration has taken quite a bit longer than i planned we are almost ready to dock at the joint assassin watch satellite if you would like a closer look it can wait i snapped you took me this far now what about the rest of it what does all this stuff youve been showing me have to do with the foe ah yes he said reflectively the foe he seemed lost in thought for a moment sucking the pipestem staring blanidy into space when he spoke it sounded as though he were discussing something else entirely you know he said when i wasalivethere was considerable argument among cosmologists about whether the universe would go on expanding as i have just displayed for you or only expand to a certain point and then fall back on itself like the water in a fountain you understand that basically that depends on how dense the universe is i think so i said trying to keep up with what he was telling me please be sure so he said sharply thats the cornerstone of the argument if there is enough matter in the universe its combined gravitation will stop the expansion and then it will fall back on itself again if there isnt it wont then it will go on expanding forever as you have seen i sure have albert yes well the critical densitythat is the total mass of everything in the universe divided by the total volume of the universeturns out to be about five times tentotheminusthirtieth power grams per cubic centimeter in more familiar terms that amounts to about one atom of hydrogen in a space equal to your body thats not much is it unfortunately he sighed thats an awful lot the universe isnt that dense there arent that many atoms in an average volume people have been looking for mass for a long time but nobody has ever been able to find enough stars dust clouds planets physical bodies of any kind or photons of energy to add up to that much mass there would have to be a least ten times as much as we can find to close the universe maybe a hundred times as much more than that we cant even find enough mass to account for the observed behavior of galaxies rotating around their own cores thats the famous missing mass the heechee worried about that a lot and so did a lot of my own colleagues but now he said somberly i think we know the answer to that problem robin the deceleration parameter measurements are right the mass estimates are wrong left to itself the universe would go on expanding forever an open universe but the foe have closed it i was floundering badly still numb from the spectacle of that terrible history the housething came with my next margarita and i took a deep swallow before i asked how could they do that he shrugged reprovingly i dont know i could guess that somehow theyve added mass but thats only an idle speculation in any case that isnt relevant to your question i mean your original question do you remember what it was of course i do then i qualified that is it had something to do with oh right i wanted to know what the foe had to gain by collapsing the universe again and instead of answering you took me about a zillion years in the future he looked faintly apologetic but only faintly perhaps i got carried away he conceded but it was interesting wasnt it and it does have a bearing here lets take another look at the universe at about the onetrillionyear mark let me finish my damn drink damn it of course you can he said soothing me ill just display it for you you can stay right where you are and i wont suppress the ambience now a great frame of blackness spread itself across the view of the tappan sea the windsailers and fishermen disappeared along with the hills on the opposite shore replaced by that hatefully familiar black void sprinkled with faint red dots were looking at a time about a million million years from now he said comfortably gesturing with the stem of his pipe and what are those little pimply things let me guessred dwarf stars i said cleverly because all the big ones are burned out but why are we going into the future again anyhow he explained because even for the foe the universe has a lot of momentum it cant stop on a dime and turn around it has to go on expanding for a while until the extra drag of the missing mass that they havesomehowadded can begin to draw it back but now watch we are at the limit of expansion and im going to show what happens next we will see the universe shrink and ill speed it up so well go back pretty rapidly watch what happens i nodded sitting back comfortably and sipping my drink perhaps the unreal alcohol was having its soothing effect on my unreal metabolism or perhaps it was only that i was sitting in a comfortable chair in pleasant surroundings one way or another it didnt seem as scary this time i stretched out my bare feet and wriggled my toes in front of that vast black backdrop that blotted out the sea marking the progression of the galaxies as they began to creep back together they didnt seem very bright no more big stars i asked somehow disappointed no how could there be theyre dead but watch as i speed things up a little the black backdrop began to gray and brighten though the galaxies themselves didnt i yelped theres more light whats happening are there stars i cant see no no its the radiation robin its getting brighter because of the blue shift do you understand that all the time the universe was expanding the radiation from distant objects was shifted into the red the old doppler effect remember because they are going away from us but now theyre coming toward us as the universe contracts so what must then happen light shifts toward the blue end of the spectrum i hazarded wonderful robin exactly the light shifts in the direction of the blueall of it way beyond the visible range that means that the photons become more energetic the temperature of spacethe average temperature of the universeis already a good many degrees above absolute zero and its getting rapidly warmer do you see those little dark blobs floating together they look like raisins in jello yes all right only what they really are is whats left of the galaxies really theyre mostly enormous black holes theyre falling together even beginning to coalesce do you see that robin theyre eating each other up and the whole things getting a lot brighter i said shading my eyes i couldnt even see the sailboats beyond the edges of the picture now the brightness blanked them out oh much brighter the background temperatures in the thousands of degrees now as hot as the surface of the sun all those old dead stars are getting a kind of new life again like zombies because the external heat is warming them up most of them will simply be vaporized but othersthere a point of light rushed toward us and past that was a big old one big enough to have a little fusible matter left the heat started its nuclear fires again a little i flinched from theunrealheat albert shook his pipe at me back in the lecture mode whats left of all the stars and galaxies are racing together the black holes are merging all the photons are now far into the ultraviolet and pastthe temperature is now in the millions of degreeshiminelgott he shouted and i cried out too as the whole scene shrank and brightened to one intolerable ultimate flare of light then it was gone the windsurfers were still on the tappan sea the mild breeze stirred the leaves on the azaleas my sight began to return albert wiped his eyes i should have slowed it down a little at the end i think he said reflectively i could do it overno of course not but you get the idea i do indeed i said shakily and now what and now it rebounds robin the universe explodes and starts up all over again newand different he looked around at the pleasant scene wonderingly then he turned toward me do you know he said i think i would like a little something myself perhaps some dark beer swiss or german i said seriously you never fail to astonish me albert i clapped my hand of course quite unnecessarily and in a moment the workthing appeared with a tall ceramic stein golden froth humped over the top and thats what the foe want to do make a new universe a djfferent universe albert corrected wiping foam off his lip he looked at me repentantly robin im neglecting my other duties to you were approaching the jaws sateffite perhaps you wish to join your friends at the viewscreens what i wish i said is to get this the hell over with finish up what do you mean a different universe he inclined his head thats where my old friend ernst mach comes in he explained do you remember what i told you about the positrons and electrons annihilating each other only electrons were left because there had been more of them to start out well suppose the universe started with an equal number so that at the end of the process there were no electrons left and no protons or neutrons either what would we have i shook my head a universe without matter robin pure radiation nothing to perturb or upset the free flow of energyor of energy beings and is that what the foe want i asked i dont know he said it is one possibility perhaps but if mach was correct there are other more serious possibilities at that same point in the history of the universe when the balance of electrons and positrons was determined by random events what sort of random events i demanded i dont know that either all particles are really only harmonics of closed strings though i suppose the properties of the strings can produce any kind of harmonics you like please be patient with me here robin because as you know i have some difficulty with this concept of indeterminacy or random eventsit was always a difficulty for me in my meat life you remember he twinkled dont twinkle dont be cute at all oh very well but if mach is correct such random fluctuations determined not only the balance of particles but many other things including the physical constants of the universe how can that be albert i mean those are laws they are laws arising from facts and the facts themselves are what mach says were generated at random im not sure how many fundamental facts are really fundamental in any universal senseperhaps i should say in any multiuniversal sense did it ever occur to you to ask yourself why for example bolzmanns constant should equal zero point zero zero zero zero eight six one seven electron volts per degree kelvin and not some other number i said truthfully the thought never crossed my mind he sighed but it has mine robin there should be a reason why this number is what it is mach says sure there is a reason it is that at some early point things just happened to go that way so indeed all of the physical constants might be different if those random fluctuations had fluctuated just a bit differently he took another pull at his beer thinldng this point where things can changethe heechee call it the phase locus because it represents a phase change like the transformation of water into ice it is where random events became frozen and all the gosh numbers were established i dont mean the trivial or manmade ones i mean the ones that are fundamental to the laws we know but that we cannot account for from basic principles pi the base of the natural logarithms the speed of light the finestructure constant plancks numberi dont know how many others robin perhaps in a different universe arithmetic would be noncommutative and there would be no law of inverse squares i cannot believe this is likelybut then none of this sounds so does it and you think the foe are just going to keep on remaking the universe until they get it right i dont know he said perhaps they have some hope of being there to make it rightright for them i mean change the laws of the universe create new laws construct a universe which will be more congenial to life like theirs i was silent for a long time trying to grasp it all failing i said well what would that universe be like albert took a long pull of his stein and set it down carefully his eyes were on infinity in his left hand was his pipe he was scratching his wrinkled forehead slowly with the stem i blinked and shifted position would it have ninedimensional space no answer nothing but that vacant look directed at nothing i was feeling alarm i said albert i asked you a question what sort of universe would the foe want to create he looked at me without recognition then he sighed he reached down reflectively to scratch his bare anlde and he said very seriously robin i dont have a clue heima t ive told you about some good people and some flawed people and now it is time to tell about a really bad person you wont like him but you need to know him i mentioned him briefly when i was talking about terrorists but i didnt do him justice i would certainly have liked to do him justiceplenty of justice preferably at the end of a ropebut that hadnt happened unfortunately his name was beaupre heimat and once he had been a twostar general on the high pentagon it was heimat who had persuaded klaras new husband that the only way to achieve peace and justice was to blow a lot of people up that was one of the least of his crimes among other bad things he once tried to kill me personally it may have been twice because not everything came out at his trial with me he failed with several hundred others thoughat least several hundredhe was more efficient heimat refused to plead guilty to murder at his trial he wouldnt call it murder he called it revolution ary justice because he was a terrorist the court on the other hand had no trouble calling it murdercalling each individual case of it murderand they gave him a life sentence for each one of the deaths and as heirnat had been not just any mixedup moke but a trusted general in the american space forces they made the sentences consecutive altogether heimats sentences added up to an aggregate minimum stay in jail of years but time had passed and now heimat had only yet to serve he had every reason to believe that he would serve every day of those years too because even felons were entitled to machine storage his prison term would not automatically end with his death actually i rather enjoy talking about general beaupre heimat now it makes a welcome relief after alberts soulnumbing display of immensity and eternity it is relaxing to think about a mere person who is merely despicable one day for heimat was much like every other this is how he started his days when he woke up the bedthing was still and curled beside him but he knew she wasnt asleep he also knew she was not a she but an it but as heimat had almost nothing but its for company anymore he had stopped recognizing the difference as heirnat threw his legs over the side of the bed she started to get up too he pushed her back down gently enough after the violence of the night before not all that gently because she was very strong she watched him dress for a moment before she asked where are you going why said heimat i think i will walk down to the beach then swim across the channel and catch a plane to los angeles where i propose to blow up a few buildings he waited a moment for a response and got none he hadnt expected any typically she had no sense of humor it was a chronic disappointment heimat would have enjoyed his life a great deal more if he could have made some of his bedthings laughthough not of course as much as if he had been able to make them weep in pain the authorities gave him female constructions that looked and felt and smelled and tasted like humans why couldnt they be considerate enough to make them fret it did not occur to heimat that he had not earned much consideration from the authorities or from anyone else outside the door his guardthing winked and whispered what do you say heimat was she all right not really heimat kept walking and finished the conversation without turning his head i told you i like blondes little young ones fragile the guard called after him ill see what i can do tonight but heimat didnt answer he was thinking of the word he had just used fragileand the way it made him feel fragile a tiny fragile blonde a live one a real female human one with her fragile little limbs twisted and broken and her mouth screaming and her face contorted in pain he stopped the thought at that point he didnt stop because what he was thinking shamed him because heimat was long past shame he stopped because he was enjoying it so much with such desperate yearning that he was afraid his face might give away something of what he was feeling and the only victory heimat ever had anymore was to keep some secrets to himself heimats island prison was very far from any continent or any major city it had been built to hold thirtyeight hundred desperate convicts and keep them inside no matter what they planned or did now all that construction was overkill because the only active survivor in the prison was heimat himself there werent thirtyeight hundred desperate prisoners left in his prison there werent that many in the whole world recruitment had fallen off greatly since the bad old days of terrorism and famine oh sociopaths turned up every now and then of course but what albert called the preconditions for opportunistic crime were scarce the thing was conditions had got a lot better nowhere in the human galaxy were there places where whole generations grew up to mug or murder or destroy because they had no easier way to ease their miseries most of the worst of the prisoners still somewhere jailed were veterans of the days of terrorism and mass crime and there werent many of those left many of the malcontents had long since let themselves be pleabargained into a different kind of imprisonment in one of the hardservice colonies most of the others had finally become either sufficiently rehabilitated or sufficiently dead heimat himself was quite an old manolder than i a hundred and thirty at least of course he got full medical he might go on another fifty years in the flesh because the prisoners were repaired and reconditioned as often as necessary it wasnt usually age sickness or accident that they died of when they died it was almost always simple terminal boredom on one morning just like every other morning they would wake up and look around and decide that enough was at last enough and machine storage could be no worse then they would find the right chance and kill themselves but not heimat the only other living meat inmate of the prison was a former soviet marshal named pernetsky like heimat he had been a mole for the terrorists using his military position to help them kill and wreck the two had been colleagues in the secret underground then fellow prisoners for hells own years not friends exactly neither of them had any real friends but close enough as inmates that heimat had been really surprised when he heard one day that pernetsky had eaten out his entire digestive system with cleaning fluids it was not an efficient suicide attempt the guardthings had spotted it at once and now pernetsky was in intensive care in the prison hospital one destination is as good as any other for a man who has none and heimat decided to look in on pernetsky the prison hospital was on the same scale as the great penitentiary complex itself the hospital had a hundred and thirty beds each one capable of being isolated with partitions of shatterproof glass and steel pernetsky was the only patient heimat crossed the warm wide lawn with its hibiscus and palm trees to the hospital ignoring the workthings that picked the blossoms for his table and tidied up the fallen fronds he could not ignore the medic in the reception room though as he entered she peered out at him and called with a smile of professional cheer good morning general heimat youre looking a little flushed would you like me to check your blood pressure no chance sneered heimat but he stopped within conversational range of her he was always more courteous to the medics than to any other prison personnelit was his theory which he never chose to put to the test that some of them sometimes were living humans it was also his habit because in the presence of the medical staff he could think of himself as hospital patient rather than jailbird role playing was important to heimat he had acted well in consecutive roles as west point cadet grunt lieutenant company commander division twostar generalsecret soldier in the liberation forcesconvict i dont want you to take my blood pressure he said because you already know perfectly well what it is and you just want to give me some medication i dont want but ill tell you if you were about six centimeters shorter and ten years younger id let you raise it a little especially if you were blond the nurses professional smile stayed professional you want a lot from me she murmured youre supposed to give me everything i need he said the conversation had begun to bore him he decided this one wasnt really human anyway and moved on no one stopped him what was the point the shatterproof walls were not up around pernetskys bed either there was even less point in that because pernetskys transplants were a long way from healed and he was tied to his lifesupport systems more firmly than by any chains heimat looked down on his last living companion trussed in his bed with the tubes in his nose and the tiny pumps whirring away well pyotr he said are you going to get up from there or is your next stop the dead file the russian didnt respond he hadnt responded to anything for weeks it was only the traitorous crt at the foot of his bed with its telltale sine waves billowing and sometimes erupting that showed he was not only alive but sometimes even awake i almost miss you heimat said meditatively and lit a cigarette heedless of the signs that warned of oxygen and risks of fire a wardthing moved unobtrusively closer but did not interfere once this had been the military ward of the prison beyond the glass doors of the wardrobes heimat could see the racks of uniforms american blue and khaki russian white and drab that would never be worn again if you get up heimat wheedled ill take off this stupid hospital robe and put on my class as you can too well have a war game or something remember how you used to nuke new york and washington and id wipe out your whole missile complex there was no response from the patient this was beginning to be boring too heimat decided ah well he said blowing smoke in pernetskys face we knew all along that the winners always put the losers on trial foolish of us to lose as heimat turned to leave the soviet marshals head moved ever so slightly and one eye winked ah pyotr cried heimat youve been fooling them the marshals lips opened last night he whispered the hovertrucks find out why and then he closed lips and eyes and would not open either again naturally none of the prisonthings would answer heimats questions he had to go and find out what pernetsky had been talking about for himself he roamed the prison compound all the three square kilometers of it on the side of the mountain with its heartbreaking view of the sea no prisoner could ever reach most of the cell blocks were empty and sealed the engineering buildingsthe power sources and the disposal units and the laundrieswerent empty because they had to keep on chugging away at their tasks but they were sealed to heimat anyway everything else was open but there wasnt much of everything else the prison had a farm it had been work for the inmates when there were enough inmates to matter and it was kept going by the workthings even now because it produced a number of valuable if sometimes peculiar crops but there was nothing there that hadnt always been there nor around the pool nor in the gymnasium nor in the vast empty recreation hall with its games and books and screens so what had pernetsky meant about trucks heimat wondered if it would be worth the trouble to look at the dead file it was trouble because the building was off all by itself upslope near the outer barriers of the prison and it was quite a climb it had been some time since heimat had made the effort when he realized this he decided promptly to do it now it was always a good idea to keep checking the prison perimeters one day just for a moment someone might slip up and then there would be a chance of of what heimat grinned sourly to himself as he climbed the flowerbordered walk to the dead file of escape of course even after all these years that hope was what kept him going hope was too strong a word heimat had no real hope of escaping or at least not of staying escaped even if somehow he were able to get out of the prison itself with all the wise and watching computer programs in the world it would not be long before one or another of them penetrated any disguise on the other hand on the other hand thought heimat careful not to show any expression on his face lest some nearby workthing catch a glimpse of iton the other hand a man who was sufficiently courageous and daring a natural leader gifted with charisma and powera man like himself in factmight easily overturn the odds think of napoleon back from elba the people flocking to him armies springing out of nowhere once free he would find followers and then the hell with their machines and spies the people would shield him of this heimat had no doubt he was certain in his heart that whatever people pretended to themselves most of the human race was as greedy and arrogant as himself and what they really wanted most was a leader to tell them that greed and arrogance were permissible even admirable behavior but first one had to escape heimat stopped at the fork in the walk panting slightly it was a hard climb for a man a hundred and some years old even with so many new parts that he had long lost count and the sun was hot he surveyed the perimeter walls of the prison resignedly they had not changed they werent even walls there was a barrier of bushes handsomely ornamental but filled with sensors then a space and another barrier equally beautiful to the eye but this time filled with paralyzing circuits and just to make sure a third line behind them and this one was lethal the late major adrian winterkoop had proven that for all of them because that was the way he had chosen for his own suicide the experiment had worked well and in any case those industrious gardenerthings that were never out of sight somewhere in the area could quickly become guardthings because you were never out of their sight either heimat sighed and took the lefthand fork toward the dead file heimat didnt go there often it was not a place a living prisoner enjoyed visiting because a living prisoner knew that sooner or later he would be a dead one and there he then would be no well person enjoys looking at his own grave of course the five or six thousand true incorrigibles stored in the dead file werent really dead they were only dead major winterkoop was still there for instance or at least the machinestored analog of him was there because the guardthings had recovered his body in time not in time to revive it no but before the quick processes of decay had made the contents of that angry brain unrecoverable being dead had not changed winterkoop he was still the same reckless heedless person who had been heimats adjutant in the glory days when they used their position to bomb and kill and destroy for the sake of the glorious new world to come and this thought heimat sourly was the new world and neither he nor major winterkoop had any part in it as he walked toward the low pastel building that held the dead file he thought briefly of accessing winterkoop or one of the other dead men just for the sake of a chat and a change but they were all so damned dull imprisonment didnt stop with death none of them would ever leave the dead file and none of them had changed a bit since their deaths heimat stopped short gaping at the dead file around the corner just out of sight from the path was the main cargo entrance that he had never once seen used it was being used now two huge trucks sat on their bellies outside it their fans silent as a dozen workthings busily carried racks of datafans and coils inside please general heimat said a gardenerthing from behind him dont go any closer it is not allowed they came in last night while i was asleep said heimat staring but what is it consolidation the gardenerthing said apologetically the pensacola facility is being closed and all the inmates moved here heimat recovered himself it was the first rule of his prison existence that he never let any of the watchthings know what he was thinking or feeling so he simply said with a pleasant smile not enough of us enemies of society left to keep you all busy i suppose do you fear for your job oh no general heimat said the workthing seriously we will simply be assigned to other tasks as needed of course but it is only pensacola that is being terminated here as you see we are accepting their cases ah yes their cases said heimat beaming at the workthing as he wondered if it would be worth the trouble to try to destroy it it had been given the form of a young polynesian male even to the beads of sweat on the hairless chest so i suppose all of the pensacola cases are now in our dead file oh no general there is one live one according to your records you know him cyril basingstoke heimat lost his calm for a moment basingstoke he gaped at the workthing cyril basingstoke had been one of the major terrorist leaders the only one perhaps who commanded a network as big as and almost as deadly as heimats own but basingstoke was paroled a year ago he said it was on the news he was general heimat yes the workthing nodded but he is a recidivist while he was on parole he killed thirtyfive people to understand they tell me is to forgive but i dont believe it i think i do pretty nearly understand people like heimat and basingstoke like every other terrorist from the stone age on they killed and destroyed for a principle and convinced themselves that the principle they killed for justified the bloodshed and agony they caused they never convinced me though i saw some of the casualties essie and i barely missed being two of them ourselves when heimats hit squads blew up a lofstrom loop they thought we were on and because we were witnesses to that one we were there for heimats trial and i heard all about the others most of all i heard heimat and saw him erect and military in the prisoners dock looking the very model of a modern major general in his dress whites and strong rightstuff face he listened with polite attention as the witnesses detailed how in his proper person as a major general in the united states defense forces he had secretly organized the bands that blew up launch loops struck down satellites poisoned water supplies and even managed to steal a dream couch to sicken the entire world with mad fantasies of course he had been caught in the end but he had fooled them all for nearly ten years sitting straightfaced in staff meetings discussing antiterrorist measures before people like eskladar had come to their senses and through them the worlds police forces at last succeeded in linking heimat with the massacres and bombings none of these were crimes to him they were simple strategies heimats trial was a peculiar experience for me i had died not long before and that was the first time i had appeared in public in a holographic body with my essential self stored in gigabit space that was still a rather unusual situation and heimats lawyers tried to keep me from testifying because i wasnt a person they failed of course it wouldnt have mattered if they had succeeded because there were plenty of other witnesses heimat obviously didnt care his arrest and prosecution he regarded as an unfortunate misadventure cynically and confidently he resigned himself to the verdict of history because he could have had no doubt what the verdict of the court would be but when i was on the stand he insisted on taking the crossexamination himself while his lawyers fumed you broadhead he said you dare to accuse me of treason while you associate with the enemies of the human race we shouldnt parley with the heechee kill them take them prisonersurround that place in the core where they hide out shoot them down it was an incredible performance when the court finally stopped it heimat bowed courteously to the bench smiled said i have no further questions of this contraption that calls itself robinette broadhead and returned to look proud and confident for the rest of the trial that was heimat cyril basingstoke was if anything worse than he the meeting of the two retired monsters was wary on both sides they knew each other heimat hurried back to the recreation hall and found basingstoke there already idly glancing through the pv stores to see what entertainments this new place had to offer they shook hands gravely then stepped back to look at each other cyril basingstoke was a curacaon a rich purpleblack in color as old as heimat but fully cosseted by the medics so that he looked maybe fortyfive it is good to see you beau he said voice deep and rich and friendly basingstoke had no accentwell maybe a touch of what sounded german and was probably dutch from the good frisian monks who had taught him english in the catholic school basingstoke was islandsborn but there was nothing eyelunds mon about the way he talked if you could not see him you would not guess it was a black man speaking although he said each word larger than an american wouldvowels more resonant and rounded intonation more marked basingstoke glanced out the window toward the distant lagoon this is no bad place beaupre he said when they told me i was to be transferred i thought it would be to some far worse one that planet aphrodite perhapsthe one that goes around a flare star so that one can live only in tunnels under the surface heimat nodded though in fact he did not much care where he was anymore remembering that he was in a sense the host he ordered drinks from the waiterthing unfortunately he smiled they dont allow alcohol they did not in pensacola either said basingstoke that is why i was so pleased to be paroled although if you remember i was never a harddrinldng man heimat nodded studying him cyril he ventured yes beau you were out then you violated ptrole why did you kill those people ah well said basingstoke courteously accepting his ginger ale from the waiterthing they angered me you see i thought that was the case heimat said dryly but you must have known theyd just put you back here yes but i have my pride or habit i think it is a matter of habit heimat said severely thats the kind of thing a prosecutor might say perhaps in some sense a prosecutor might be right for people like you and me beau i didnt need to kill those people i was not used to crowds you see there was pushing and shoving to board a bus i fell they all laughed there was a policeman with a machinepistol and he was laughing too i got up and took it away from him and shot thirtyfive people oh no beau i shot nearly ninety but only thirtyfive died or so they tell me he smiled i did not count the corpses he nodded courteously to heimat who sat silent for a moment sipping his own drink while basingstoke idly summoned up pictures of martinique and curaзao and the virgins what lovely places they are he sighed i almost wish i had not killed those people heimat laughed out loud shaking his head oh cyril is it true that we have the habit of killing basingstoke said politely for a matter of pride or principle it is perhaps so so we should never be released ah beau basingstoke said fondly we never will you know heimat brushed the remark aside but do you think it is true we are incorrigible basingstoke said reflectively i think no let me show you he whispered to the control and the pv views ifickered and returned to a scene of curacao you see beau he said settling himself down comfortably for a nice long chat in my case it is pride we were very poor when i was a child but we always had pride we had nothing else seldom even enough to eat we would open a snack shop for the tourists but all the neighbors had snack shops too and so we never made money from it we had only the things that were freethe beautiful sun the sands the lovely colibri hummingbirds the palm trees but we had no shoes do you know what it is like to have no shoes well actually you do not basingstoke smiled because you were american and rich do you see that bridge he pointed to the pv vista a bay with two bridges across it not that ugly high thing the other one the one on pontoons that floats with the outboard motors that open and close it there at the end what about it asked heimat already beginning to wonder if having a companion would relieve boredom or add to it that is a matter of pride without shoes beau this i learned from my grandfather heimat said look basil im glad to see you and all that but do you really have to patience beau if you have pride you must also have patience this is what my grandfather taught me he too was descamisadowithout shoes so on this bridge when it was new they had a toll two cents to walk across it but only for rich people that is the people who wore shoes people who were barefoot they crossed free so the rich people who wore shoes were not stupid they would take them off and hide them and cross and put them back on at the other side heimat was beginning to get angry but your grandfather had no shoes no but he had pride like you like me so he would wait at the bridge until someone with shoes came along then he would borrow his shoes so he could pay his two cents and cross the bridge with his pride still safe do you see what i am saying beau pride is expensive it has cost us both very much i didnt want to stop talking about the children because they were appealing i can hardly stop talking about heimat and basingstoke either but for quite other reasons if ever two persons were hateful to me they are the ones it is the attraction of the horrible when cyril basingstoke came to join beaupre heimat the children on the wheel were just getting the word that they were being evacuated it made the news both basingstoke and heimat took an interest probably they were rooting for the foe if anything though it must have been a conflict for them both but they had other conflicts not least with each other for neither heimat nor basingstoke cared much for the society of equals they bored each other in fact when heimat found basingstoke dreaming in front of the pv views of curaзao or sint maarten or the coast of venezuela he would say why do you let your mind rust out i have made use of my prison time learn something a language as i have done indeed he had a new language perfectly every few years with all the time he had had to do it he was now fluent in mandarin heechee russian tamil aassical greek and eight other languages and who will you speak them to basingstoke would ask not taking his eyes from the tropic scene before them that isnt the point the point is to keep sharp and basingstoke would look up at last and say for what if basingstoke was tired of heimats nagging heimat was tired of basingstokes interminable reminiscences every time the black man started a story the general knew how to finish it when i was a boy basingstoke would begin and heimat would chime in you were very poor yes heimat very poor we would sell snacks to the tourists but there was no money in it because all your neighbors had snack shops too precisely none at all so sometimes we boys would catch an iguana and try to find a tourist to buy that none of them wanted an iguana of course but once in a while one would buy it because he was sorry for you he would so then we would follow the tourist to see where he let it go and then wed catch it and sell it again and after a while youd eat it why yes beau iguana is very good like chicken have i told you this story before it was not just the boredom there was each found something about the other that really grated on the nerves basingstoke found heimats sexual habits revolting why must you try to hurt the things beau they are not alive anyway because it gives me pleasure the keepers have to take care of my needs that is one of them and its none of your business basil it does not affect you while that ifithy stuff you eat stinks up the whole prison but that is one of my needs beau said basingstoke he had given the cookthings exact instructions and they had of course obliged heimat had to admit that some of the things werent bad there was an uglylooking fruit that tasted splendid and some kinds of shellfish that were divine but some were awful the worst was a sort of green pepper and onion stew made with salt dried codfish that tasted and smelled exactly like the garbage cans outside a seafood restaurant after they have ripened all night it was called a chiki and when it wasnt made with the rotten fish it was made with something only marginally less repulsive like goat heimat tried diluting basingstokes presence by introducing him to pernetsky but the soviet marshal would not even open his eyes much less speak to the newcomer outside the prison hospital basingstoke asked but why is he doing this beaupre he is certainly conscious after all i think he has some idea of escape maybe he thinks if he continues to pretend to be asleep they will take him to another hospital somewhere outside of the prison and then he can make a try they wont i know said heimat looking around well cyril do you want to explore the grounds some more today basingstoke glanced down the hill toward the sparkling distant lagoon and the broad pacific beyond it then back wistfully at the recreation hall but heimat had finally refused to look at any more pictures with him and heimat at least was an audience oh i suppose so he said what are those buildings down by the shore a school i think and there is a little port there where they have dredged out the lagoon so small ships can come in yes i see the port said basingstoke we had such a port in curacao away from the big one it was for slaves beau in the old days when they brought a shipload of slaves in they would not parade them through the town they would bring them in a few kilometers away at the slave port heimat finished for him where the auction block was yes lets walk down toward the baby farm i do not like such things basingstoke sulked but as heimat started down the path without him he added but i will go with you the baby farm was within the outer perimeter of the prison but only just it was a separate fencedoff enclave green meadow with a few handsome cows grazing and the prisoners were not allowed inside it heimat was amused to find how much it offended cyril it is decadent beau the old man muttered oh how i wish we had not failed in our cause we should have forced them to forget such things we should have made them scream we did said heimat we should have done more i am revolted to think that a human child should be in the womb of a cow when i was a tiny child perhaps heimat cut in to head oft the reminiscence if you were a woman the idea of extrauterine childbirth would not be so revolting to you cyril pregnancy is not without suffering of course suffering why shouldnt they suffer we suffered when i was a boy yes i know what it was like when you were a boy said heimat but that didnt stop cyril from telling him all over again heimat tuned the voice out it was comfortably hot on the island but there was a breeze coming up the hill from the sea he could smell the faint wisp of cattle aroma from the meadow where the herdthings were moving about checking the temperatures and conditions of their charges actually heimat thought surrogate childbearing was a good thing assuming childbearing was a good thing in the first place anyway his own sexual pleasures went in quite different lines but for a couple who wanted to be a family it made sense they started the baby in the usual way with frolicsome and slippery pokings heimat was broadminded enough to accept that that was what turned most people on so if that was their pleasure why should the pleasure then turn to pain for one of them it was so easy to take the fertilized ovum away it had already received all it would ever need of ancestry the dna spirals had al ready danced apart and recombined the heredity was established the chef as you might say had assembled the soufflй that was his piиcederйsistance now all it needed was a warm oven to rise in and the oven did not have to be human anything that was vertebrate and mammalian of human size or larger would do cows were perfect there were not many cows in the baby farm because there werent very many human families left on the island to require them but heimat counted ten twelve fifteenaltogether eighteen surrogate mothers placidly cropping grass while the herdthings poked thermometers into them and gazed into their ears it is most disgusting breathed cyril basingstoke no why heimat argued they dont do drugs or smoke or do any of the other things human women might do to hurt the babies no if we had won i would have instituted this system myself i wouldnt said basingstoke pleasantly they grinned at each other two old gladiators amused at the thought of the final conflict that would never have to take place old fool heimat thought comfortably it would of course have been necessary to get rid of him tooif the revolution had succeeded beau said basingstoke look one of the mothers was lowing in mild distress her temperature was being taken but the herdthing was apparently holding the thermometer in an uncomfortable way the cow shook its rear end free trotted a few steps away and began to graze again it isnt moving said heimat perplexed basingstoke looked around at the four or five herders in the baby farm then back up the hill toward the gardenerthings and the distant workthings on the paths all were frozen motionless even the sounds of fans from the hoverbarrows had stopped basingstoke said none of them are moving beau theyre all dead the pasture that was the baby farm was at the very lowermost edge of the prison compound the slope steepened there and heimat looked at it with distaste when you are an old man you are an old man even with every possible replacement of tissue and recalcification of bone if we go down he said we will just have to come up again will we man said basingstoke softly have a look ah some momentary power failure muttered heimat theyll be back on in a moment yes and then the moment for us will be past but basil heimat said reasonably all right suppose the mobile units are out of service for a moment the barriers are still there basingstoke looked at him carefully he didnt speak he just turned away lifted a strand of the wire that kept the cattle on their meadow and ducked under it heimat stared irritably after him the guards would be back on in a moment of course and even if that moment lasted long enough for the two prisoners to for example cross the wide cow pasture what he had said about the barriers was still true perhaps it wasnt the guards that kept the prisoners inside but the sophisticated and unthwartable electronic pen it came in three courses pain stun death it was difficult to get past the first and almost impossible to pass the secondalso pointless because there was the third he told himself that basingstoke simply didnt know not having had the experience for heimat had in fact actually tried he only once got past the terrible heartstopping pain line and then only to be knocked out at the second and awaken in his own bed with a guardthing grinning down at him the simple fact that the workthings were temporarily powered down meant nothing at all about the barriers he told himself what a fool basingstoke was and while he was thinking all this beaupre heimat was lifting the wire for himself and hurrying after the other man fastidiously dodging the cowflops on the grass pausing only to kick at a herdthing to make sure it would not respond it did not he caught up with basingstoke panting at the very edge of the compound the pain wires were quite visible herefor the sake of the cattle not the prisonersagainst a row of pretty hibiscus and torch flowers a gardenerthing was toppled motionless against a torchflower shrub its hand was raised and frozen to a trowel heimat spat on it thoughtfully the power is off man basingstoke said softly said heimat swallowing you go first cyril ill drag you back if youre caught basingstoke laughed oh beau what a hero you are come along well do it together jaws what you must remember at all times is that all things endso albert keeps telling me i think he thinks it is some kind of consolation its true though even the interminable trip from wrinkle rock to jaws ended at last jaws lives in a geostationary satellite or actually its five satellites tumbling around each other in parasitic orbits a few tens of thousands of kilometers over conakry in africa it used to be in a different place just about over the galapagos islandsbut then it was for a different purpose it was called the high pentagon then when we came out of orbit i wasnt looking at it i was looking down at the earth big and broad below us sunrise had passed the gulf of guinea but the western bulge of africa was still all dark i took pleasure in the sight i still think the earth is about the prettiest planet there is i could see sunlight hitting the tops of mountains off to the west and that wonderfully blue atlantic just below and i was feeling quite affec tionate toward the troublesome old place when i heard essie cry have ruined it it took a moment to realize that she wasnt talking about the planet sorry i said i wasnt looking at the screen she hadnt been either as a matter of fact generally we only use the screen out of habit when we really want a good look at something its just as easy for us to use the true loves own external sensors direct so i switched and saw what essie saw there were a lot more than five objects in common orbit now not even counting the flotilla of jaws cruisers moving restlessly about in formation people had been flocking to jaws and their spacecraft were in mooring orbits there must have been a dozen of those shuttle ships but the thing that essie was talking about was a huge crumpled mass of film it took a moment to recognize it it had once been the main propulsive power for an interstellar photonsailship i had seen it once before when it was in its glory and then it had carried a crew of sluggards on an exploration trip to some other star why is it such a mess i demanded of julio cassata he gave me an irritated look he was busy on the communications channels and the person he was irritated with wasnt me it was the watch officer on jaws and there wasnt much use in being irritated with him or it because it wasnt a him he said i say again this is major general julio cassatas doppel and i request immediate landing clearance effing machines he snarled looking at albert before he looked at me then you mean the sailship but it was your damn institute that brought it here for study what did you think we were going to do with the sail keep pulling it back when the sun was pushing it out of orbit yes thank you he said to the commset and nodded to alicia lo to take us in it wasnt that easy the particular section of jaws we were headed for was delta a soup can that weighed forty thousand tons you could tell it was the command satellite for the convenience of the high brass or anyway the meat portions of it it rotated more rapidly than the others that gave them a little better upanddown orientation for their comfort but it wasnt a convenience for alicia lo still she corkscrewed us neatly into the dock it was a virtuoso performance and she deserved a better audience than essie and me we werent watching her we were looking at that sharkship fleet of jaws cruisers obviously ready for actionany kind of action i murmured i hope they arent going to do anything foolish if do anything at all essie said soberly will be foolish is no nonfoolish thing to do and then we were aboard the jaws satellite the way people like essie and me come aboard a spacecraft or satellite is to bridge in to the internal communications facilities after that we can go anywhere the cables go and maybe a little bit beyond on deltajaws we went as far as the hatch chamber and stopped there were no comm facilities or at least none we were allowed to use the watch officer a machine program in the form of a callow young lieutenant said with military courtesy but no give general cassata may proceed sirs and madams but the rest of you must remain in the secure lounge of course we didnt want to do that not at all it wasnt what i had come to jaws for if cassata had lingered a moment i would have asked him to explain all this as he hadnt i explained it myself the lieutenant listened politely and then took appropriate action he bucked it to higher authority higher authority was a short stocky woman named mohandan dar havandhi when she appeared she stared at us silently for so long that i had the sudden conviction she was a meat person but it was only her manner when she opened her mouth she revealed herself to be as machinestored as the rest of it but all she opened her mouth to say was no but commandant havandhi essie purred soothingly is mr robinette broadhead i am aware of that said the commandant then must also be aware that mr robinette broadhead is executive of broadhead foundation with full clearance for all extrasolar matters that is true the commandant said but we are under condition red peacetime clearances are suspended of course she said with a smile that showed gold teethhow faithful some of us are to our meat originalsyou need not be confined to the secure lounge if you prefer well i said smiling forgivingly in that case well just you may alternatively return to your ship she said and would not be budged military minds you cant reason with them we tried of course we pointed out that security was a laughable anachronism condition red or no condition red because the only enemy who might need keeping out was fifty thousand lightyears away in the kugelblitz she didnt bother telling us that wasnt true since the message had come from much nearer she just shook her head we tried threatening to call marshals and heads of state she just said we certainly could do that all right if we wanted to as soon as the embargo on civilian radio messages was lifted she did not offer any guess as to when that might be we tried to be chummy with her we asked what all those spaceships were doing at jaws she didnt answer at all no we werent going to get any military secrets out of her it really wasnt as interminable as it seemeda few thousand milliseconds at mostbecause julio cassata or anyway his doppel came back surprisingly cassata was looking faintly pleased my meat guy is in conference he told us so it will be a little while before i can uh see him he favored us with a smilenot favoring us all equally the young woman named alicia lo got most of the smile so what would you like to do while we wait take a look around jaws we cant i said pointing to the commandant of course you can he said secure in rank he addressed her commandant havandhi i relieve you of these guests i will personally escort them around the base the five satellites of jaws make up nearly two hundred thousand tons mass and are inhabited by something like thirty thousand people meat and machinestored two of the satellites are nothing but communications and dataprocessing centers theres nothing to see there gamma is all hardware military hardware its full of buster bombs and heechee tunneling machines converted to dig holes in ships or fortresses rather than rock we didnt expect to be allowed there either apart from the fact that albert already knew all about every last piece of ordnance anyway alpha is crew quarters and r r facilities and there wasnt any reason for us to go therewe didnt need any of their ideas of rest and recreation all the same when the electronic barriers that kept unauthorized machine intelligences out of jaws were let down for us the fact that we were confined to delta annoyed me cassata tried to soothe forgive the old lady he said grinning she was an exchange officer here when this was the high pentagon and she thinks everything has gone downhill since he glanced at his watchas nonexistent as my own weve got at least ten thousand milliseconds and theres a lot of interesting stuffsluggards quancies voodoo pigs besides all the other stuffi mean the parts of the other stuff i can let you into what do you want to see i said i dont want to see anything i didnt come here to take the twodollar tour i want to talk to people i want to find out whats going on and then said cassata you want to get in on the action yourself right i shrugged angrily i had had plenty of time in the secure lounge to build up a head of steam and julio cassata wasnt making it go away there were a lot of things i wanted to say but i held myself to one word yes cassata was still edgy himself hed been given a reprieve from termination by his meat original but that was all he said you make trouble broadhead ive got the power to make a lot of it i agreed he looked at me narrowly then shrugged it isnt up to me he said it isnt even up to me the combined chiefs make the rules around here so whats it to be the twodollar tour or the secure lounge essie and i had seen jaws before back when the combined chiefs were a little more respectful to the guy who controlled the broadhead foundation so had albert alicia lo was a lot more interested to her it was one of those secret places that you hear about but never expect to see like the inside of fort knox or the mormon temple in salt lake city you understand we didnt actually go anywhere we didnt have to cassata fed us into jawsdeltas communications system and we saw what he wanted us to see he was a polite host so he did better than that he created a sort of officers club lounge for us to sit in with a fire blazing at one end of the room and a table laid out with drinks and snacks the other end of the room waswhatever we were being shown when cassata offhandedly proposed a look at a nest of sluggards alicia was thrilledas of course he had intended she should be the sluggards were a historic first for human beings because they were the first alien intelligent race any member of the human race had ever seen or not seen exactly fell audee walthers fooling around with a dream couch had detected their pathetic huge lumbering sailship in interstellar space decades before that was a most important event but what it led to was more important by a whole lot because the slugs detected audee too and that was what told the heechee that people like us were abroad in the gal axy and that was what brought the heechee kicking and screaming out of their hideyhole in the core i thought the heechee kidnaped this sluggard ship back to its own planet alicia offered they did cassata agreed but old broadhead here kidnaped them back here for study or his institute did the slugs dont mind they were expecting another thousand years or so on their trip their sail is still in orbit just outside jaws saw looks seriously mashed essie said severely well what else were we going to do spread out the damn things forty thousand kilometers long anyway they wont need it again do you want to see them or not oh yes said alicia lo cutting through the argument cassata waved a hand and there they were sluggards arent pretty some people say they sort of look like some kind of tropical flower others think they look like one of those deepsea things with a lot of tentacles its hard to say what they resemble because they dont very much resemble anything on earth the males are considerably bigger than the females but that isnt the females only problem the females have nothing but problems because theres no such thing as womens rights among sluggards a female sluggard may not worry about this much though since they are not intellectual their lives are entirely taken up with birthing one infant comes out every cyclethe cycle runs a little less than four months if the lucky lady has been visited by a male at the right time the infant is male if not its female sluggard males do not seem to be particularly horny and so usually the female has not been sexually favored lately so there are endless numbers of female sluggards being born all the time they dont go to waste though from time to time one of the males picks out a particularly fat and appealing female then he eats her one supposes the females dont like that no female sluggard has ever complained though they cant they dont talk at all males on the other hand talk incessantlyor singor anyway make some sort of sounds continuously throughout their lives you might not know that though if you happened to be sitting right next to a sluggard in full cryassuming you could since what they live in is both cold and heavy and poisonous to meat people you might be aware of a faint pulsing like a heavy truck going by outside your house the slugs are slow so are their voices the shrillest coloratura soprano among the slugs might get way up to twenty or twentyfive hertz so you couldnt hear what they were singing there were several dozen of the creatures male and female floating around in the slush of their spaceship one male was in a small compartment by himself the rest were in a common tank surrounded by all sorts of curious slug devices that floated with them the furnishings and gadgets i supposed that made up a comfortable sluggard home and the only way i could tell the people from the furniture was that i had seen pictures of slugs before i couldnt see anything move they looked funny in another way too i didnt remember exactly what the natural hues of a sluggard should be but they looked as though they had been colored by someone who didnt remember even as well as i did one is moving cried essie it was clever of her to have noticed it the one in the separate chamber was barely extending a tentacle it was terribly slow even by meathuman standards in the slugs own terms however he was writhing in great agitation and high speed you could see little ripply lines in the sludge all around him where he had made pressure waves thats one of the new ones said cassata they finished debriefing the original crew so they imported six more males from the slug planet a few weeks ago why is he off by himself asked alicia lo hes in highspeed mode so he can be interviewed they thrash around so you know if he were in with the others in high mode hed mess up their living quarters albert said professorially i observe we are not viewing them by visible light no right its tomography because you couldnt see in visible light in that slush they live in want to hear what hes singing he didnt wait for an answer but cut in an audio feed it wasnt the sluggard we heard but a machine translator it declaimed great blinding blistering brutes thrashed and harmed with much cavitation and many deaths and highly painful injuries thats just the latest stanza cassata explained hes only been going for about an hour this time we have to let them rest up between sessions they cant stand high mode very long and we cant deal with them at all when theyre in normal want to keep on watching them for a while i said what i want general cassata is to talk to somebody in authority around here how the hell much longer do we have to stall around but essie put her soft sweet hand on my lips general will let us know soonest possible is that not so julio so have nothing better to do also to females the sluggards translation finished and i began to think of causing some death and highly painful injuries myself see there we were again caught in the disparity between gigabit time and meat i dont think that i am basically a very patient man but oh how much patience this machinestored analog of me has had to learn especially in dealing with meat people not to mention with that particularly infuriating and exceptionally immovable section of the meat population the military i stated my views on this matter for julio cassatas benefit he only grinned some more he was enjoying it of course from his point of view the longer we waited here the longer he had left to livethat is to say the longer his doppel had and his doppel was obviously reluctant to get itself terminated i was a little surprised that he didnt suggest that he take pretty alicia lo off for another little private sightseeing tripi could well imagine what sights he had in mindand perhaps he would have if albert hadnt come up with an idea he coughed politely and said i believe general cassata that the sluggards are not the only aliens of whom specimens are present here cassata raised his eyebrows you dont mean the voodoo pigs the voodoo pigs yes also the quancies the institute has provided colonies of both for study might we see them as well if there is anything less interesting to look at than the quancies it is the voodoo pigs but of course you dont know that until you try oh julio cried alicia lo could we and then of course it was certain that we would cassata shrugged and changed the scene we were looking at a rocky pool of graygreen water where half a dozen fishylooking creatures were basking under a pale orange light we got sound too the honking of quancies chatting among themselves since i had seen all the quancies i ever wanted to see i turned to the table of snacks it wasnt that i was hungryor even hungry i just wished we would get on with it i called on all my long training in patience i didnt like it but i had no alternative that i could see realcassata was still in his meeting and doppelcassata was just being a good host to usif i thought mostly to his new girl but the sky was falling and it was no time for a trip to the zoo while the whitejacketed waiterthing was handing me a sandwich of chopped chicken liver and onionall of course as simulated as the waiterthing itselfalbert wandered over to join me a good german bock please he said to the waiter and smiled at me you dont care to hear what the quancies are saying to each other rob quancies never have anything to say i took a sullen bite of my sandwich it was delicious but it wasnt what i wanted it is probably futile to interview them albert agreed accepting the stein of dark beer you have to admit that quancies are intelligent more or less because at least they have language what they dont have is hands they live in the sea and their tiny flippers are no more use than a seals if they werent airbreathing we probably never would have known they existed because they dont have cities or tools or what is most important writing therefore they have no written history neither do the sluggards but their life span is so long that their bards remember eddas that are as trustworthy at least as homers songs i do have some news that may interest you said albert when he had finished his first deep swallow of the beer good old albert finish that up and ill buy you another i cried and tell me it is nothing much he said but of course i still have access to the datastore facilities on the true love there were a number of ifies that i thought might have some bearing on the present situation it took quite a while to access them all and there was very little useful data in the first few thousand then i checked out the immigration records for the past few months you found something i said to help him along it isnt only meat people who have taught me patience i did yes he said most of the children who were evacuated from the watch wheel you remember were relocated on earth according to the immigration records at least seven of them are presently in the area served by the westernpacific communications net of course it is from that net that the communication to the kugelblitz originated i gave him a shocked and unbelieving stare why would human children work for the assassins i demanded i dont think they did said albert thoughtfully accepting his second stein although the possibility cannot be ruled out but we do know that they were present on the wheel when the watchers suspected they had detected something and are now on earth it is at least possible that the assassins have traveled with them i felt myself shiver we have to tell jaws yes of course albert nodded i have already done so i fear though that this will have the result of prolonging the meeting the original general cassata has been conducting i said shit however albert smiled i do not think it will be by very much as i had already summed the data and presented it to commandant havandhi for transmittal to the meeting so what am i supposed to do now gape at the quancies some more i think said albert that the others are also losing interest in the quancies and ready to go on to the voodoo pigs ive seen voodoo pigs there is nothing better to do is there he hesitated and then added also i would like you to observe the carvings of the voodoo pigs they are i think of some special interest i could not tell looking at the voodoo pigs just what it was about them that albert thought might be of interest all i felt was disgusti mean not counting the impatience i worked so hard to quell the voodoo pigs lived in slop i had never understood why they didnt drown in their own filth but they didnt seem to mind it that was the piggishness of the voodoo pigs they didnt really look porcine more than anything else they looked like blueskinned anteaters they tapered to a point fore and aft they really were piggy though what they lived in couldnt be called a cage it was a sty they lived in their own waste the mud was not merely mud plus pigshit it was stuck full of little garnishes like raisins in a pudding of rotten fruit and excrement and the garnishes were the carvings albert had mentioned since albert had made a point of it i took a careful look at the voodoo pig carvings i didnt see what had interested him the carvings werent anything new the museums all had them id even once held one in my handgingerly because the smell of the sty had survived even boiling and polishing they were just carved bits of woody plant matter or of tooth or bone they ran about ten or twelve centimeters long and when they were carved out of teeth the teeth were not the voodoo pigs own the pigs didnt have any teeth all they had were abrasive and very hard rasping surfaces at the skinny ends of their noses or trunks or mouths depending on how you chose to describe them the teeth came from their food animals several dozen of which had been imported along with the pigs when the colony was established the fact that they used the teeth of other animals for their carvings didnt prove any delicate sensibilities on the part of the pigs though because when they used bones the bone was as likely as not to have come from their deceased nearest and dearest once they had passed on and been eaten carvings isnt exactly the right word either the pigs nibbled the pieces into shape because they didnt have tools to carve anything with they didnt have any language either in fact take them all in all they had about the iq of a gopher only they created and obsessively went on creating these works of art art too may be too strong a word because they had only one subject the carvings were like dolls they resembled as close as i can describe it a sixlimbed creature with the body of a lion and the head and torso of a gorilla and there was nothing remotely resembling it anywhere on the planet they came from so whats special about them i asked albert he countered why do you think the pigs carve them the rest of the party got into the guessing game religious objects said cassata dolls said alicia lo they need something to cuddle and visitors said my dear portableessie and albert beamed at her approvingly as is so often the case between albert and me i had no idea what was on his mind it would have been interesting to follow that up just then but cassata jerked upright message he said excuse me and vanished he didnt exactly come back what happened was that we lost the sight and sound of the little nook he had created for us we just heard a voice not his at first at first we got what i recognized as a pickup from the sluggards translator huge they were and harmfully hot and the people lashed each other in fear and then cassatas voice full of excitement come on you can come into the staff meeting and then cassata himself appeared glowing with the happiness of a soldier who sees a chance to do some fighting theyve done it folks he cried theyve tracked down the source of the message to the assassins theyre shutting that whole sector down and well be moving in kids in captivity the schools principal was not only human she was good at dealing with children she had four degrees and nineteen years of experience in that time she had encountered nearly every problem kids could provide which was roughly one problem per child per semester for all the thousands of children she had supervised over the years none of that helped now she was out of her depth when she arrived in the waiting room of the counseling section she was breathless and unbelieving but that is fantastic my dear she told the sobbing oniko how could they possibly to be able to read your diary but why in the world she flung herself into a chair scowling at the incredibility of it all maam said sneezy and when he got a glance from the principal went on its not just oniko i kept a diary too and thats part of the transmission the principal shook her head helplessly she waved at the wall screen which promptly displayed the schools private beach work things were tending barbecue fires and students were beginning to assemble she looked from the children to the screen and back again i should be there she said fretfully its luau night tonight you know yes maam said sneezy and harold nodded vigorously beside him roast pig said harold dancing the principal looked glum she thought for a moment then made her decision youll have to tell the whole thing to the counselors she said all three of you i didnt keep any diary harold wailed but you see we cant be sure of that no the principal said firmly thats the way it will have to be youll all have to tell your stories the machines will have questions im sure just tell the truth dont leave anything outim afraid youll miss the luau but ill instruct the cookthings to save you something and she rose waved the door open and was gone harold gazed stonily at his friends you two he snarled in condemnation im sorry sneezy said politely sorry making me miss the luau listen said harold thinking fast ill tell you what ill go first then maybe i can get through and down to the beach before the dancing starts anyway i mean thats the least you two can do isnt it after all this trouble of course at this point none of the kids knew just how much trouble all this trouble was they were kids they were not used to being at the center of events that shook the entire universe there was sneezy supposed a certain amount of justice in what harold said though there was a second level of unfairness that was not dealt with at all neither he nor oniko had done anything no one had told them they shouldnt spend their time investigating earth conditions in every way possible no one had even hinted that there was anything wrong with synopsizing and organizing the data in their diarieswhich to be sure were not really diaries at all in the sense of little giltedged books that you wrote your latest crushes and enmities in they had simply played all the information they could gather into their pods as any rightthinking heechee would have done they had done nothing at all that was in any way reprehensiblebut oh how terrifying it was that their innocent activities had somehow been converted into that most forbidden of all possible actions a transmission to the foe it was too scary a thought for sneezy to deal with oniko was nearer her fears were easier to handle he said theres another booth oniko would you like to go in now she shook her head her dark eyes were darker still with recent tears but she had stopped sobbing you go sternutator he hesitated then said all right but ill wait until youre through we can go down to the beach together no please sternutator you go ahead when youre done im not hungry anyway sneezy hissed in thought he did not like the idea of oniko missing the beach party and liked even less the thought of her trying to hobble her way walker and all down the sands by herself it was difficult enough for oniko to get around on a level surface with her muscles still unhardened to the full crush of earth then it occurred to him that he need promise nothing he could wait for her whether she asked him to or not very well oniko he started to say and then the whole question became moot the lights went out the lounge was in twilight the only illumination coming from the picture window that looked out on the mountain but the mountain was already hiding the setting sun from the counseling booth harolds enraged roar came now what the devil the door to the cubicle shook then gradually slid wide enough for a boy to squeeze through as harold shoved it open manually whats going on he demanded glaring at sneezy and oniko the stupid program just cut off in the middle of asking me a question sneezy said helpfully i would guess that the power has gone off oh dopey what a fool you are the power never goes off sneezy looked around at the wall screen now blank at the lounge lighting fixtures all dark at the door that would no longer open at anyones approach but it has harold he said reasonably so what are we going to do now when the power was off the lights were off and the corridors of the school buildings were now dark and disturbing when the lights were off the elevators were off and so their only way down to the main buildings and thence to the beach was to climb down the neverused stairs that was not a practical choice for oniko and her rubbery legs well have to walk said harold accusingly and sneezy agreed but it will be better to go outside and use the road he pointed out harold scowled out the mountainside window then at the smaller one that let them see down onto the beach although the school was dead the students were not nearly all of them were there tiny in the distance milling about the beach the scene on the beach didnt look frightening it looked rather like fun and harold sighed oh good lord i suppose we have to go by the road to take care of oniko well lets get on with it he didnt mention that with the school out of service the alternative was to slip and slide down the hillside which wouldnt be much easier for him than for the girl he walked toward the door having had little experience with doors that did not open when desired he nearly bumped his nose before he stopped short and angrily wrestled it open it was nearly full dark now and of course even the streetlights were out that didnt matter much there would be a quarter of a moon before long and even the pacific starlight would be nearly enough to see by what worried sneezy more than the power blackout was oniko she had rarely cried on the wheel even when bigger children had teased her now she seemed unable to stop for long the tears had begun again slow drops forming in the corners of her eyes as one rolled down her chin another was ready to take its place please oniko sneezy begged it is only a problem with the electricity nothing is serious its not the electricity she sobbed its my diary how silly you are said sneezy dismally wishing he could at least convince himself if not oniko that must be a coincidence do you think the foe would bother with a childs compositions she shifted on her crutches to gaze at him but they did she wailed my exact words and yours too yes dopey harold cut in roughly dont try to get out of it its all your faultand hers i mean including the power failure sneezy inquired but he got no satisfaction from the retort in some sense he acknowledged to himself it was their fault the odds against coincidence were frightful the heechee had no analogy of forty million monkeys typing out the complete works of william shakespeare but that wasnt necessary to convince sneezy coincidence was to all intents and purposes impossible just about as impossible as the only alternative he could see namely that somehow the foe had been watching over their shoulders as they completed their notes confronted with two equally preposterous alternatives sneezy did what any sensible child heechee or human would have done he put it out of his mind he pointed along the road to the winding driveway used by the hovertrucks lets go down to the beach that way he suggested but its kilometers harold groaned very well said sneezy you take a shortcut if you like oniko and i will use the road oh lord sighed harold adding one more charge to the indictment against sneezy and oniko i guess we might as well all stick together but its going to take all night he turned and led the way sneezy and oniko following the girl was tragicfaced and silent limping along and refusing sneezys help after a dozen meters harold looked around and scowled he was already far ahead cant you go any faster he called you may go without us said sneezy wishing he would not for reasons he could not identify sneezy was ill at ease when harold irritably came back to walk with exaggerated patience next to them he was glad of the company was there really anything to be afraid of sneezy could think of nothing real it was true that it was dark and that they could easily be run over by some speeding vehiclebut it was also true that there werent any vehicles on the road their power too was off all the same he was very nearly afraid sneezy had never felt fear of the island before of course it was human and remote and therefore wholly strange to a heechee boy but it had not occurred to him that there was anything to be afraid of certainly not of the few polynesian natives who remained they were almost all old people who kept to their homes and ways while most of the young ones had gone off to more exciting places than moorea he had not even been afraid of the prison buildings because it had been explained to the children that there were almost no living convicts still there in any case although the couple who remained had done terrible things they were not only securely confined but very old there was sneezy assured himself absolutely nothing to be afraid of beyond the chance that they might be late for the luau as a rational heechee he allowed the logic to convince him and thus he was only startled but not really afraid when he heard a sudden squawk from harold and saw two old men step out of the uphill path to confront the children youre a heechee said the smaller of the two men with a pleased smile of recognition of course hes a heechee harold blustered who the dickens are you the old man beamed at him and reached out a hand to his arm it looked like a pat of reassurance but the man didnt let go he said i am general beaupre heimat and this is my colleague cyril basingstoke what a pleasant surprise to meet you here i suppose you are students at the school yes said sneezy my name is sternutator but im generally called sneezy as he introduced his companions according to diligently mastered earth protocol he tried to make out the expressions on the mens faces the general was a tall man though not as tall as his companion and he had a broad face that wore a not very reassuring grin sneezy was not particularly attuned to the subtle ethnic differences that distinguished one sort of human from another but it was apparent that the second old man was noticeably darkskinned they did not seem especially threatening although the expression on the black mans face was concerned as the general moved toward oniko basingstoke said worriedly man we are so lucky to be out please dont do anything to start trouble heimat shrugged what sort of trouble i just wanted to tell this pretty young lady how glad i am to see her sooner or later theyll get the power on again cyril said heimat mildly flick off there was no palpable threat in the look he gave his companion but the black mans eyes narrowed then he turned toward sneezy and took him by the arm basingstokes grip was strong under those layers of human blubber and the dried tough skin of age there was a good deal of strength you are also the first heechee i have seen in person he announced the subject changed are your parents here harold chose that moment to cut in his parents are important watchers on the wheel he boasted so are mine and onikos and besides hers are very wealthy you better not try anything with any of usr certainly not said heimat virtuously but he didnt let go of harolds arm he looked thoughtful for a moment you do not need wealthy parents to make you attractive my dear he said to oniko but i wont deny that that is a big plus i am delighted to know you we are going down to the beach why dont we all walk down together no chance snapped harold we dont needouch without releasing his grip the old man had backhanded him across the side of the face its what we need that matters he said conversationally and that seemed to settle that heimat looked about getting his bearings over toward the point dont you think cyril he asked i remember there was a road there toward the breadfruit plantation lets goand while were walking my dear oniko why dont you tell us all about how rich your parents are it seemed to sneezy that strong as the old man was it might not be impossible to jerk free and run away sneezy weighed the prospect carefully while oniko answered leadenly to the probing jovial questions of the old general he decided against it although basingstoke was old he seemed quite quick and sneezy thought it likely he would react unpleasantly to an attempt at escape and anyway even assuming that he himself might break away how could he get oniko free although the party was walking slowly on the dark roads the girl was having trouble keeping up for her to run away was simply impossible nor was it likely that harold could make it either because the human boy seemed crushed by the weight of the slap across his face he moped forward never turning his face but from the way his shoulders moved sneezy suspected he was crying as they turned off the perimeter road to the downward trail sneezy could see the luau on the beach the students had improvised torches stuck in the sand and although they were now nearly a kilometer away sneezy could hear the sounds of singing he envied them considerably he wished they would stop singing so that if he or one of the others had to scream for help they might be heard but realistically he did not think any of them should dare that anyway behind them the islands great central mountain blocked out the stars though overhead the constellations were bright even so walking was difficult without warning oniko stumbled on the path tripped over her walker and almost fell headlong what saved her was cyril basingstokes hand thrust out as quickly as a striking snake he set her on her feet again and general heimat turned around to look ah the young lady is having trouble he said sympathetically do you know cyril i think that if you would take charge of harold i could carry oniko down basingstoke didnt answer directly with a quick motion he hefted oniko to set her on his shoulder never releasing sneezy in the process you take her crutches boy he ordered the general turned and regarded him without speaking sneezy hissed softly to himself in foreboding there was something humanly nasty hovering around them in the warm tropic air evidently oniko perceived it too because she said in a shaky attempt to make neutral conversation oh look across the water papeetes lights are on it was true on the other side of the strait the sprawling lights of tahitis principal city were bright gold moreover whatever had been about to happen between the two men was at least postponed their power is on said basingstoke thoughtfully and heimat chimed in we could go there yes we could if we had a plane or a boat but what would we do then theres an airport cyril planes go to auckland honolulu los angeles indeed they do man said basingstoke for people who have money to pay for the tickets are you carrying a credit card why cyril heimat said reprovingly you havent been listening these children have credits especiallyhe smiledyoung oniko here is very rich i am sure she will do something nice for an old man one way or another basingstoke stood silent for a moment sneezy could feel the tension in the mans grip and wondered just what peculiar earthhuman nuances he was missing then the man said beaupre what you do for your own pleasure is no business of mine but if it interferes with getting off these islands for me then it becomes a personal matter then man i will kill you he paused letting the words hang there then he said now let us see if there is a boat there were boats all right there were at least a dozen drawn up along the beach where the school kept its small fleet but four of them were kayaks and six were windsurfing boards and the only big one nearby was the sailing yawl which none of them were skilled enough to operate you cant do it harold said boldness returning so just let us go we wont say anything heimat looked at him without speaking then he turned to cyril basingstoke they must have something we can use he said each of the children looked as blank and ignorant as possible because of course the school did there is a pier said basingstoke softly pointing down toward the point of land and all three children sighed at once in resignation as they crunched over the shelly sand toward the schools dock sneezy hoped against hope that the entire little flotilla had been taken in for repairs or drifted out to sea or sunk and then when they reached the dock and heimat uttered a roar of rage his hopes rose no power he snarled theyre all dead but basingstoke raised his chin as though sniffing the wind listen man he commanded over the sound of the breeze that came down from the mountain there was a mild insistent hum he leaped to the end of the dock where the schools glassbottomed boat lay moored to the power takeoff flywheel drive he crowed they mustve been revving it up overnight get in there wasnt any help for it the old terrorists shepherded the boys in first then basingstoke handed oniko in to heimat who stroked her head promissorily before setting her down with basingstoke at the tiller heimat cast off the lines and the little boat purred out into the mirrorcalm lagoon sneezy and oniko holding hands on the bench over the dark glass gazed sadly back at the looming mountain and the dark buildings of the school no not entirely dark sneezy saw with a quick flicker of hope but it died as quickly as he saw that only a few windows had faint glows behind them someone had rediscovered candles most of the students were still on the beach sneezy could see the shapes moving around in the torchlight but as the glassbottomed boat angled out toward the passage through the reef they maintained their distance from the beach then just at a time when he needed all the alertness and strength he could find sneezy felt his eyes growing heavy how odd he thought shaking himself awake it was no time to be falling asleepand no reason for it either he made a great effort to wake up and put his thoughts in order the first question was what were his options to begin with he calculated the boat was still only a few hundred meters from the beach to swim that distance in the warm shallow lagoon would have been childs play for almost any childalmost any other child he thought regretfully than either oniko or himself she lacked the strength he the buoyancy a pity probably if they had been able to swim for it the old men wouldnt even follow sneezy thought wistfully since all they really wanted was escape he hissed softly to himself as he confronted the fact that one of them seemed to want something more at least from oniko it was not a thought sneezy could easily come to terms with the concept of rape was strange to any heechee especially rape of an immature female ancestors it was all but impossible not to mention thoroughly repugnant he had heard theoretical discussions of such things as related to human conduct to be sure he hadnt believed any of them even among humans such queer perversities were surely unreal but then he had never before been in a situation like this no he told himself the risk was too great such things might after all be true they would have to escape was it possible that harold could get away and somehow summon help he at least would have no difficulty swimming to shore but harold was wedged firmly beside the huge old black man at the tiller sneezy did not think it likely that basingstoke would ever let himself be taken off guard weariness and depression settled in again and once more sneezys eyes began to droop the old black man was humming to himself as he skillfully guided the boat toward the exit channel do you know beaupre he called to the other man i think we almost can succeed in this venture unfortunately i have no way of telling how much energy is stored in the flywheel of this contraption it is possible we will run out of power before we reach tahiti in that case said heimat well just hang these kids over the stern to be outboard motors and kick us intwo of them anyway he added patting onikos bowed head basingstoke chuckled the possibility of running out of power didnt seem to worry him nor sneezy perceived did he seem as concerned about heimats plans for oniko as he had been before sneezy felt his abdominal muscles writhe in apprehension if only he werent so inexplicably fatigued it was almost as though he were breathing oxygendepleted air or had swallowed some enervating drug in fact it was almost like that deprivaton that no heechee ever voluntarily permitted as though he had stupidly left his pod somewhere and was lacking the lifegiving radiation it provided sneezy hissed loudly in alarm heimat turned from gazing fondly at omko and snapped whats the matter with you but sneezy could not answer it was too frightening to talk about his pod was emitting nothing heechee could survive for days even for weeks without the constant flow of microwave radiation from their pods it was never a problem on their home worlds for of course there was always a steady microwave flux in the environment they had evolved in that was how they had come to evolve to need it as humans needed sunlight and fish needed water but survival was not all there was to life after an hour or two without the microwave the lack began to be felt it had now been more than that since the power went off and the pod stopped radiating sneezy was feeling the effects it was a sensation likewhat could you compare it to in human terms thirst exhaustion a sensation of need at least as a human being on a desert might feel unmet needs after the same length of time he could go on for quite a while without a drink of water but he could not go on forever as the shallowdraft boat passed through the gap in the reef they struck the waves of the strait they were not huge waves but the boat was now in the pacific ocean although it was not stormy the swells that lifted the boat and set it down again had started as ripples five thousand kilometers away and they had been growing as they traveled oniko gasped and struggled to the gunwale where she began to retch violently into the sea after a short hard struggle inside himseli sneezy joined her he was not subject to seasickness in the same way as a human boy would have beenthe architecture of the heechee inner ear was vastly different in designbut the motion the stress above all the draining of all energy with the loss of his pods radiation combined to make him physically ill from forward in the rocking boat heimat laughed tolerantly you poor kids i promise when we get to shore ill give you something to take your minds off it she is only frightened beau rumbled basingstoke throw it all up oniko it will do you no harm the old black man seemed positively jubilant as he steered the boat into the waves when i was a boy he said settling himself for a travelers tale to make the time pass we had storms around the island that you would not believe children yet we must go out in them for the fish because we were very poor my father was an old mannot in years but from breathing the hydrocarbons in the air petrochemicals they made us all sick and then when we went out in the fishing boats sneezy having exhausted everything in his digestive system that could exit by mouth lowered himself to the bottom of the boat hardly listening he pressed his face against the glass bottom cooled by the water just on the other side and felt oniko slump beside him he took her hand apathetically he knew he must think and plan but it was so hard and in the water basingstoke rolled on there were great sharks almost as huge and ferocious yes as the ones in the pacific hereeven in his fatigue sneezys hand tightened convulsively on onikos sharks they were another nasty phenomenon of the human planet that he had heard of only in theory he strained his huge eyes to peer into the black water but of course there was nothing to see many times he had looked through that glass at glittering schools of tiny fish wheel lug in unison and at creepycrawly crustaceans on the shallow sand those things had been scary too but pleasingly scary like one child jumping out of concealment to startle another but sharks sneezy firmly stopped thinking about sharks instead he listened to the old black man going on with his interminable reminiscences for fifty years they pumped the oil wells dry stinking up the fresh sweet air of our island they said they needed it to grow protein so that no one would starve but we did starve you know and it was that that made me turn to the struggle for there was no other way to justice justice sneezy thought fuzzily how strange for this terrorist murderer kidnaper to speak of justice how human as they neared the tahiti side of the strait sneezy forced himself to sit up and look around there was a great black shape in the water ahead of them moored and lighted the size of a football field although sneezy had known it was there it took him a moment to recognize it as the floating chonfood factory day and night it sucked oxygen and nitrogen from the air hydrogen from the seawater of the strait and carbon from the straits luckless inhabitants to feed the people of tahiti and the neighbor islands he wondered that old basingstoke had dared pass so near it and then realized that of course it was fully automated no human being would be on it and the workthings would be unlikely to pay attention to a small boat passing nearby and then sneezy realized two other things the first was that the lighted food factory was lighted there was power there and the second was that spreading up from his loins was a warm gentle wash of good feeling they were out of the power blackout zone and his pod was operating once more as they skirted the shore the waves were choppier there was no lagoon here no reef to shelter them from the pacific and the glassbottomed boat rolled worrisomely dont drown us now you old fool heimat snarled at his partner and harold squawked in fear as water came in over the side sneezy understood the humans fear as his head cleared he began to share it the little boat was broadside to the waves and the risk of capsizing it was real but their concern did not dampen his mood the pod radiation was as refreshing as a cold drink on a hot dayno better than that as refreshing as a rum toddy after being out in a blizzard warmth and pleasing numbness stole volition from him the dreamy lassitude would last only a short time until his body had soaked up enough microwave to be content again but while it lasted he was simply too relaxed to worry so he sat docilely while cyril basingstoke searched the shore for a refuge he listened uncaring while the two old men argued over what to choose he obediently tried to help scoop water out of the bottom of the boat with his skinny bare heechee handsso ill adapted to such a task as they settled on a beach house with its own floating dock and basingstoke ran the craft to a mooring next to it out of the boat up the beach to the dwelling gathering before the screened porch of the beach housethere were a dozen times when sneezy might have broken free and run the old men were tiring now because the night was well advanced and they had been taxing themselves a great deal but sneezy didnt take the chance neither did harold though perhaps the human boys chances were worse general heimat never once let go of his arm and of course omko had never had a chance to escape on her own and so sneezy docilely helped oniko and waited patiently as the old men argued there will be a watch system man basingstoke warned heimat smiled all he said was take this boys arm and turned to his work the skills that a dozen times had been pitted against the prisons multiply redundant guard programs were not to be defeated by some householders burglar alarm in two minutes they were inside the house the door was locked behind them the chances of escape were gone and tardily sneezy realized what opportunities he had let slip away on your bellies my dears heimat ordered cheerfully and put your hands behind your necks if you move you are deadexcept you of course sweet oniko obediently the children lowered themselves to the floor and sneezy heard the sounds of the old men ransacking the house muttering to each other the lassitude was wearing off now that it was too late but he was beginning to be aware of something else he hardly heard what the kidnapers were saying or doing he wanted something he had a need to do something without intending it in the least he got up and moved toward the bungalows pv communications set it happened to be basingstoke who saw him first which perhaps saved sneezys life the old man was beside him in a second swatting him away sneezy landed halfway across the room blinking at him boy boy rumbled the old man chidingly what in the world do you think youre doing i have to make a call sneezy explained standing up again nothing was broken he started toward the set once more basingstoke grabbed him the old man was stronger than sneezy had thought the boy struggled for a moment then let himself go limp what you have to do basingstoke scolded is exactly what we tell you to do boy and nothing more you will sit quietly or heimat watch the girl for oniko too had struggled to her feet and was advancing doggedly toward the set the expression on her face determined heimat had an arm around her in the first step whats the matter with you two he snarled didnt you think we were serious perhaps we should kill the heechee brat to convince you we will just tie them up beaupre basingstoke corrected then observing the look on heimats face and the way he was holding the girl he sighed oh give it a rest man there is plenty of time for what you want later the beach house was a treasure trove for the old terrorists there was food there was power they even found weapons of a sorta springwound shark gun for scubadiving and a flat meanlooking stun gun apparently designed for the times when a sportflsher had brought aboard a large game fish that still had enough life left to thrash dangerously around in the boat sneezys lassitude wore off and he looked at the guns with astonishment and more than a little horror they were weapons they could kill someone what typically human devices they were when they had located food the two men ate first muttering to each other over the table but when they were finished they untied oniko and allowed her to feed the others she had to spoon soup into the boys mouths as though they were babies once she rose awkwardly and started once more toward the pv commset but heimat was ahead of her she didnt try it again sneezys own uncontrollable urge to do the same thing departed leaving him puzzling over just what it was he was so anxious to do call someone of course but whom the police yes certainly that would have been logical but he did not think that was what had been in his mind when everyone was fed and the children had even been allowed one by one to make escorted visits to the toilet heimat came over and draped his arm fondly over onikos shoulders the girl shuddered without looking at him heimat man said cyril basingstoke warningly the general looked surprised what have i done he asked carelessly toying with the girls bobbed black hair weve eaten were in a nice safe place weve earned the right surely to rest for a moment and enjoy ourselves basingstoke said patiently we are still on an island in the middle of the pacific ocean man we are not safe until we are off it sooner or later the people who own this house will come back or some neighbor will see the lights and come to call and what will we do then heimat sighed tolerantly and stood up wandering about the room but weve got a long night ahead of us and there wont be any flights until morning he pointed out morning is not very far basingstoke countered and there is also the flywheel boat if we leave it where it is it will lead people to us i think you and i beau should go down and send it off to sea before it gets light oh said heimat but why two of us cyril he sat down at a desk in the corner watching the other man and though no ones expression changed sneezy was suddenly aware of a new tension in the room heimat went on thoughtfully let me see if i can read your mind old comrade you are thinking that it will be harder for two to book passage than one you are also thinking that if i and these nice young people were dead our bodies could be left here in this house for maybe quite a long time oh beaupre what an imagination you have basingstoke said tolerantly yes heimat agreed i imagine you are making a calculation cyril of whether my help or my dead body would be of more use to you i even think you are considering some plan in which all four of our bodies could be found in some way that would be helpful to you perhaps in the boat set adrift so that people would think you had most likely drowned while crossing the strait am i very close to what you were thinking basingstoke gave his partner a tolerant smile oh perhaps in general terms he conceded one has such idle thoughts now and then but it was only a thought man then think of this heimat smiled raising his hand from the desk to reveal the flat mean fishkilling gun oniko shrieked and collapsed against sneezy he wished he could pat her shoulder reassuringly but the ropes did not allow that he compromised by rubbing his leathery cheek against the top of her head basing stoke gazed at the children for a moment then turned earnestly back to heimat beaupre he said what i think is only what you yourself have surely been thinking too it is only sensible for each of us to consider alternatives but i do not want your body found off the island as far as anyone knows we are still on moorea i hope no one will think otherwise until it is too late so do not be a great fool man let us get rid of the boat then let us arrange transportation away from here heimat studied him scratching his chin with his thumbnail he didnt speak also said basingstoke there is something else to think of no sensible person leaves a loaded gun in a drawer when he goes away do you think the owner of this house was so careless how sure are you you havent checked to see if it was empty or i would have seen you do it heimat gave him a respectful nod he put his hands in his lap for a moment looking down at the gun what he saw was concealed from the others by the desk there was a snick of metal opening and a snap as it closed heimats expression didnt change as he looked up now i know whether it is loaded or not he observed but you dont is it then basingstoke inquired politely he didnt wait for an answer in any case let us stop this nonsensical debate we will both go and get rid of the boat the children will be safe enough here then we will come back and see about finding a way off this island then beaupre while we wait until it is time for our plane you may entertain yourself in any fashion you like it had been general beaupre heimat who tied them up and sneezy acknowledged that the old man knew what he was doing in the few minutes they were out of the house he strained against the ropes uselessly he was not helped by harolds complaining whine what the dickens is the matter with you dopey youre so skinny you should be able to slide right out of those things then you could untie us and then harold stopped there because not even he could visualize a good and then in any case the old men were back almost at once hovering over the pv commset they accessed the reservations clerk at faafaafaa airport at once it wasor looked to bea pretty polynesian girl in a sarong with flowers in her hair she appeared both friendly and real as she gazed out of the pv tank for a moment sneezy thought of crying out for help but the hope did not justify the risk she was undoubtedly only a simulation and probably a very rudimentary one display all flights nonstop for more than two thousand kilometers departing between now and noon heimat ordered oui m sieur the girl smiled and disappeared the pv showed a list ua honolulu ja tokyo af los angeles nz auckland qu sydney ut san francisco heimat said at once i want the los angeles flight basingstoke sighed yes beaupre i suppose you do so do i heimat looked displeased you could take san francisco he argued its only a couple hours later and its better if were not on the same flight isnt it or you could go to honolulu or tokyo i do not want to be on another island or in a place where i will not speak the language and i dont want to wait a couple of hours i will be on that plane to los angeles heimat sighed and gave in very well we can be quit of each other there reservations the girl reappeared politely inquiring msieur we want space for two on air france this morning mr j smith and mr r jones heimat improvised first class or coach sir oh by all means first class heimat smiled our dear little niece has been good enough to fly us here for a little vacation and she is very generous one moment he said signaling to basingstoke to bring the little girl forward out of range of the pv pickup the old black man swiftly untied the girls hands then he nodded to heimat and lifted her to the commset oniko my dear heimat went on kindly give this nice young computer program your credit id sneezy held his breath would oniko try to call for help she did not in a clear voice she gave the program her credit data and submitted her thumb to the pickup for verification sneezy felt a moments disappointment where was this vaunted human courage when it was needed and then he was ashamed of himself certainly if oniko had said the wrong word it would have been very unpleasant for her as soon as the old terrorist could get her out of range of the pv that was all there was to it there were no questions the polyne sianlooking program verified the account in a second and announced you have confirmed space for two mr j smith and mr r jones nonstop from faafaafaa airport departing at ninethirty for los angeles intercontinental will there be any continuing or return flights from there not just now basingstoke said and snapped off the commset wait a minute heimat protested whats the hurry we will want to move on from los angeles you know but not on her credit man its too risky youll have to find your own way from there heimats eyes narrowed dangerously you take a lot on yourself cyril he said softly have you forgotten that i still have the gun and then suddenly he yelped what is she doing stop her cyril for oniko with basingstokes hand still on her had reached out doggedly to the cominset once more basingstoke jerked her away now now he chided this can get quite tiresome child oniko didnt respond she only gazed at the commset now out of reach tie her heimat ordered sneezy watched anxiously as basingstoke did setting her down again in the row of captives along the wall as soon as oniko was bound she relaxed again her body leaning against sneezys for comfort i had to she whispered to him and he hissed agreement she had to just as he too had had to try to reach the commset as soon as they got into the house sneezy puzzled over that compulsive attempt he could not remember just why it had seemed to be so important only that it had in the same way he thought he had wanted to find and record every bit of data he could get on heechee history and activities for his diary it seemed likely to him that the urges were related but he could not understand them they will be gone soon he whispered to oniko offering the only reassurance he could find she looked at him without speaking she didnt have to speak what she would have said would have been only not soon enough the old men were doing what they were always doing they were arguing how strange humans were to decide even the simplest questions only by fierce dispute this time the argument was over whether or not they should sleep and which should do it first heimat was saying we might as well rest cyril an hour or two each so well be alert when we go to the airport why dont you go first ill stay awake to entertain our young guests if you entertain that little one the way you want snapped basingstoke she will probably die of it heimat shook his head sadly old age has weakened you what do you care what happens to the little charmer old age has made you a fool there is a whole world of little girls out there once we are off this island you can do what you like with all of them for all i care but this one has credit we can use can she pay our bills dead what bills weve already got plane tickets and how do we get to the airport basingstoke inquired shall we walk heimat looked thoughtful then glum perhaps you are right this time he conceded grudgingly then he brightened so let us order a limousine now and there will be time for other things while we are waiting for it to come how much of this oniko was following sneezy couldnt tell her body was limp as she slumped against him she lay with her eyes closed but those slow tears were still trickling down her cheeks one after another from her apparently inexhaustible supply sneezy closed his own eyes it wasnt so much weariness although there was plenty of weariness too as an effort at concentration was there any possibility at all of escape suppose he told the old men that he had to go to the toilet again suppose they untied him for that could he then break free catch oniko up in his arms and run out of the building with her could harold help was there any chance that such a plan or any other plan could succeed or would they simply solve the problem of sneezy and harold who had neither credit nor sexual victimization to offer by terminating their lives at the first inconvenience for the first time in his young life sneezy contemplated the real possibility that it would end within the next few hours at most it was quite frightening to a young heechee it was not merely a question of deathdeath came to everyone sooner or later but death under these circumstances could well be total death since there was no one nearby to do what was necessary to take the dead brain of sneezy and empty it into storage it was not death he feared so much as the prospect of his brain irretrievably decaying before he could be transformed into an ancestor he became aware that the old men were quarreling again this time more violently what is the matter with the damned thing cried basingstoke in exasperation and heimat chimed in youve done something wrong you old fool here let me try try as much as you like growled basingstoke it simply will not go on he stood back glowering as the paler old man bent to the commset then heimat sat back his expression bleak what did you do he demanded i did nothing i simply turned it off then i tried to turn it on again and it will not work for a quick moment sneezy felt a rush of hope if the communications set had really been somehow broken then perhaps the old mens plans would have to change perhaps they must walk to the airport sneezy had no idea how far it was or even in what direction but probably the men didnt either they would not dare waste time perhaps they would need to start immediately for the sun was almost rising outside the sky in the windows brightening and if they left at onceand if for some reason they failed to kill the possible witnesses they would leave behindand if they did not decide to take the children somehow with themand if there were too many ifs but then none of the ifs mattered sneezy saw the beginning glow in the pv tank so did basingstoke and he cried we need not accuse each other any longer beau look it is coming on at last so it was so it did but the face that looked out of the pv at them was not the smiling polynesian girl with the hibiscus in her hair it was a mans face a man of indeterminate age rather handsome smiling out at them in a friendly way sneezy didnt recognize it one human looked much like another to any heechee except for the few they happened to have spent a fair amount of time with cyril basingstoke and beaupre heimat however knew the face at once robinette broadhead basingstoke cried and heimat snarled what the hell is that son of a bitch doing here watching it all in gigabit space essie chuckled nervously are quite famous robin she said even wicked old terrorists recognize you at once albert said that is not astonishing mrs broadhead general heimat on at least two occasions tried to assassinate robinette and probably every terrorist on earth would have done the same if they had the chance do not give them chance at anything bad now robin essie begged go on do thing and dear robin be very careful wicked old terrorists are nothing compared to other dangers you insist on encountering now stowa ways i think i should review a little at this point when word of the transmission to the kugelblitz reached jaws they sprang into action programs and people in gigabit time tracked down the source of the message and located it on an island called moorea in the pacific ocean and that happened fast enough to suit even me then they put the brakes on because meat people had to make the next decision they did it as fast as meat people possibly could ill give them that but meat people just arent in the running when you want real speed it took many many milliseconds before they took the next step and a lot longer than that before they could put it into effect they isolated moorea from the power grid they cut off every kind of electromagnetic energy anywhere on the island moorea was in quarantine no further messages could get out that was the right thing to do and i agreed with them but it took them so long and then it took long long longer for the next step not to know what to do because albert and essie and i figured that out for them in no time at all but interminably long to convince the meat people we were right and to get them to do the right thing about it it was clear from the beginning that there were foe loose on earth albert and i went round and round that for thousands of milliseconds and there simply was no other explanation those false alarms on the watch wheel had not been false at all we managed to spell that out millisecond by millisecond for the meat people damn their souls they argued you dont know that general halverssen objected and i yelled of course we do and albert put in reasonably it is true general halverssen that we do not know it for a certainty but science is not built on certainties it is only a question of probabilities and the probability that this is an accurate statement of reality is overwhelming really there is no more convincing competing hypothesis can you image how much time just that kind of thing took and then we had to convince them of the next statement that the foe had human beings working for them there we got into a long hassle because the generals of jaws got bogged down on whether any human being however vile or insane would cooperate with the enemies of all organic life everywhere it took forever to explain to them that we didnt mean voluntary cooperation well what did we mean then well we didnt know what we meant only that the fact that the transmission had been in the english language however speeded up was an unarguable bit of evidence that some human being somewhere had interfaced between the foe and the transmission and of course the contents of the transmission further supported the theory that it was foegenerated and foeaimed if you were a scout for the foe on earth albert inquired politely what would you do your first mission would be to learn everything you could about what human beings and heechee were like about what sort of technology they had and where it was deployed about everything that could be useful in the event of a conflict that is precisely what the transmission contained generals there can really be no doubt the arguments didnt just take milliseconds they took minutes and the minutes stretched into hours because the meat generals were not spending all their time talking to us they had other things on their minds they were acting moorea was isolated so no message traffic could go in either direction so their only way of establishing any sort of control there was to insert new warm bodies with instructions to take over take over what we asked in vain take over the island of course was all the answer we got so longrange aircraft on nandu and oahu were loaded with parachute soldiers and launched for moorea they were brave men and women in those aircrafta lot braver than i would have been since their status as soldiers had been purely honorary for at least as long as most of them had been alive but they flew over the island and dropped in in the darknessonto the slopes of that great central mountain some of them others into the waters of the lagoon a few lucky ones onto taro patches or beaches their mission was to arrest everybody they could find and when that was done to signal by mirror to the watch satellites overhead so that moorea could be put back into the power grid and the serious investigators could land there can you imagine how much time all that took can you imagine how much trouble it was two hundred soldiers dropped on moorea and nearly seventy of them broke arms legs or heads when they came down it was a miracle that none of them died of it and all for nothing because while that was going on the faster ones among us like albert and me were doing the homework that would have saved all the effort it took a lot longer than it should have beciuse we couldnt go to the records on the island of moorea itself due to the blackout we had to reconstitute the information from other sources so we did we accessed every datum we could find about traffic to and from the island of moorea we studied the census reports on everyone who lived there we looked for some clue some linkage to something somehow related to the foe and the names of oniko sneezy and harold popped out of the files as soon as we saw who they were and where theyd been we knew it was the answer who else had been on the watch wheel during the latest false alarm when we had explained all that to the meatheads they agreed it was important it was also pretty useless because they had no good way of communicating with the paratroops that were even then flopping down all over the island to tell them where to concentrate their efforts but they did the next best thing they made the satellite watch records available to us and when we played these tapes we saw the little glassbottomed boat slipping out of the lagoon on its way across the strait unfortunately by the time we saw it it was history but there they were the three children scrambling up onto the floating dock of the beach house belonging to a mr and mrs henri becquerel now visiting grandchildren on peggys planet and when we took the next step monitoring all communications that had gone in or out of the beach house we had no trouble identifying the two old loonies who had been with the children on the boat then we stored the images and thought it over ahha said albert wisely puffing on his pipe look at the children two of them are wearing pods julio cassata announced a moment before i would have exactly albert beamed and what better place for an energy being like the foe to hide away than in a pod i said but could they i mean how could they puff puff it might be difficult for them yes robin said albert thoughtfully because surely the storage systems are not anything they would be used to but neither were heechee ancestorstorage and our own gigabit net compatible at first we simply had to devise ways of transcribing one to the other do you think the foe are stupider than we robin and before i could answer in any case there is no better hypothesis we dare not assume anything else the foe are in the pods and pods are on children said essie and children are captives of two known murderers robin whatever do must be absolutely sure children are not harmed of course my dear i said wondering just how to do that the data file on basingstoke and heimat had not been comforting even if we overlooked heimats known obsession with young and helpless girls i made an effort the first thing to do i said is to persuade jaws to isolate the house we dont want foe getting into gigabit space and wandering around theyve had plenty of time to do that already albert pointed out but perhaps they havent maybe they cant leave the podsor didnt think they needed to i shook my head your trouble albert is that youre a machine construct you dont know how natural beings behave if i were one of the foe in what is surely a strange and bewildering place i would find a nice hole to hide in and stay there until i was sure i knew what was safe albert sighed and rolled his eyes upward you have never been a natural energy creature so you know nothing about their behavior he reminded me but if im wrong nothings lost is it so lets cut them out oh he said i have already suggested this to the organic leaders of jaws the house will be totally isolated in a few thousand milliseconds then what oh i said easily then i pay them a call it took a lot of milliseconds actually i not only had to persuade the jaws meatheads that i was the best person to negotiate i had to satisfy them and albert that i could negotiate in some way that wouldnt give either the old men or the foe any chance to escape fine cassatas doppel said forcefully i agree i braced myself for the next part it came somebody must do that but not you broadhead youre a civilian i yelled now listen stupid but albert raised a hand general cassata he said patiently the situation in that house is unstable we cant wait for some meat person to get there and negotiate of course not he said tightly but that doesnt mean it has to be broadhead oh said albert then who it must be someone like ourselves must it not someone who is familiar with what is going on really one of us here wouldnt you say not necessarily said cassata stalling but albert wouldnt let him i think it must be he said gently because time is of the essence and the only question is which i dont think i should be the one im only a rude mechanical after all essie cut in certainly not me and you yourself general said albert politely are simply not good enough for the job which leaves only robinette im afraid he was afraid cassata gave in but not in his own person he ordered something expendable and thats final so it was not precisely i who was grinning out of the commset at the two old monsters and their captive kids it was only a doppel of me because that was all albert and the jaws people would allow but they also had to allow me one tightly constrained channel of contact with my doppel they had no choice about that because otherwise none of us could either know or affect what happened in that little house by the beach on the island of tahiti so i peered out of the pv at the old monsters i said at onceor my duplicate didgeneral heimat mr basingstoke youre caught again dont do anything ridiculous well let you go freeunder certain conditionsprovided you cooperate start by untying the children and at the same time the other i safe a hundred thousand kilometers away on the true love was complaining bitterly but it takes so long essie said cant be helped dear robin and albert cleared his throat and offered do be careful general heimat will try some violent act no doubt but basingstoke is more subtle watch him closely please do i have a choice i grumbled i did not they were meat people and i was i while my doppel was delivering that interminably long first speechsix thousand milliseconds it tooki was observing and displaying every person item of furniture wall hanging window particle of sand and fluff of dust in that pleasant little room it took an eternity for me to activate my image and say my words of greeting and then for heimat to respond took forever see i didnt have the zippy perceptors and actuators that were part of the real me back on the true love i had a simple piezovision cominset the kind people put in their living rooms theyre designed to be used by meat people therefore they are meatpeople slow they dont have to be fast because meat people arent the commsets scanning system takes a look at what is before it point by point one by one it examines each of those points and registers its propertiesso much luminance at suchandsuch a wavelengthand then one by one it plots them in its memory store for transmission we were not about to let the set transmit of course the only transmissions from that room went from doppelme to realme kilometers out in space the sets scanners were quick enough for the purpose by meatperson standards they looked at every point twentyfour times a second and meat persistence of vision filled in the gaps what meat people saw was the illusion of realtime presence i did not what both doppelme and realme saw was this painfttl buildingup of images point by point we were on gigabit time orders of magnitude faster we could see each individual data point come in it looked as though someone were filling in a paintbynumber canvas in each onetwentyfourth of a second a dot of red here a darker scarlet next to it another scarlet and so painstakingly point by point we saw displayed a single line of onikos red skirt then there were a thousand points for the next line and the next and the next while i and doppeli sat fidgeting and metaphorically gnawing our metaphorical thumbnails waiting for the whole picture to show sound was no better the median frequency of human speech say the middle a is hertz so what i heard was a putt putt putt of sound each individual putt coming a couple of milliseconds after the last whereupon i had to take note of the amplitude of each pulse and the elapsed time between them less or more as the tone was raised or lowered and identify them as frequencies and constitute them as sound spectrograms and translate them into syllables and finally words oh i could interpret them all right but my god it was tedious it was frustrating in all the ways there were to be frustrating because it was urgent the urgency was the foe to be sure but i had some private urgencies of my own curiosity for instance this crazy old man named heimat i well knew had tried very hard to murder both me and my wife i really wanted to talk to him about that then there were the kids they were a very special urgency because i had a clear picture of what they had been through and how terrified worn out and demoralized they had to be i wanted to rescue them from that ordeal within the next millisecond no time for meatperson haggling and dealmaking with the old killers and i couldnt i also couldnt wait so while heimat and basingstoke were still opening their mouths expressions shattered in astonishment i cut in to say directly to the kids oniko sneezy harold youre safe now these two men cant hurt you and where we all sat in the control room of the true love albert sucked his pipe meditatively and said i dont blame you for that robin but please dont forget that the foe are the first order of business i didnt get a chance to answer essie was in there before me crying indignantly albert are just a machine after all these poor children are scared out of wits hes right though argued cassata the children will be all right the papeete police are on their way and will arrive when demanded essie it was a rhetorical question we all knew the answer she furnished it about one million milliseconds is not right how much can happen even in meatperson time my doppel was just finishing saying oure safe so there was plenty of time for debate i said to albert what do you think heimat will do he has that gun said albert judiciously he will think perhaps of using oniko as a hostage that we can take care of cassata said grimly no way julio i said you crazy if you go throwing beam weapons around in that little room somebody could get hurt only the somebody we aim at albert coughed deprecatingly the accuracy of your weapons is undoubted general however there is also the question of the integrity of the faraday cage we have that space completely isolated except for the single channel between mr broadhead and his doppel if you puncture it what will happen with the stowaways cassata hesitated we all hesitated because that was really where the ultimate worry was the stowaways the foe looking at three decent little kids held hostage by two ancient thugs you almost forgot where the real terror lay heimat and basingstoke were amateurs between the two of them they had murdered a few tens of thousands maybe of innocent men women and children wrecked some billions of dollars worth of property upset the lives of tens of millions of people why how trivial they were when you compared them with the race that shifted stars annihilated whole planets dared disturb the immense universe itself terror no human terrorist was more than a naughty pipsqueak brat compared with the foenot these two no nor hitler nor jenghiz khan nor assurbanipal and there were foe there in that room and i was proposing to try to confront them my doppel finally finished its reassurance to the children cyril basingstoke opened his mouth to say something through my doppel i could see his expression his eyes were on me with curiosity and a kind a respect it was the sort of respect one gladiator might give another when they met in the arenaa gladiator who recognized the difference in weapons between his opponents and his own but still thought there was a pretty good chance that his trident could prevail over the other guys net it was not at all the kind of look you would expect from someone ready to concede defeat measured by the slow tick of meatperson clocks what happened next must have seemed to happen very fast the two ancient outlaws were way past their prime but there were a lot of new parts in their organs and musculature and the wicked old brains were still alert beaupre basingstoke snapped cover the girl and he himself made a dash for the table where the springloaded spear gun had been sitting all this while from the screen i called anxiously hold everything we can make a deal with you heimat already with one hand wrapped in onikos hair and the other pressing the fishkiller gun against her temple snarled triumphantly you damn well will you want to hear our terms freedom complete freedom transportation to a planet of our choice andand a million dollars each and more guns man added cyril basingstoke practically he was always the shrewder of the two i thought with a certain amount of admiration and i really admired the quick thinking and precise actions of the two old monsters i mean consider they must have been startled considerably by my sudden appearance on the commset screen it had taken them no more than ten seconds to answer make a plan and carry it out so that now they had the children covered and their demands stated ten seconds however are ten thousand milliseconds i said from the screen freedom you can have both of you that is you can be out of prison and you can be set free on another planetnot earth not peggys but a rather nice one the only thing is youll be the only two people there it was a sound and fair offer i even had a specific planet in mind because albert had found a good one true it was inside the core one of the extras the heechee had prudently included for expansion purposes but it was certainly a livable place they could do what they liked thereespecially since being in the core they would be doing it forty thousand times slower than on the earth the hell you say snapped heimat well pick the planet and dont forget the money ill give you the money i said politely a million each you can use it to buy programs for yourselves for company think it over you guys you know we really cant let you kill off any more cities and then i saw heimats eyes narrow as he heard sounds from the other room so i added quickly you dont have any other choice because otherwise youll both be dead look at what we have for you i invited and displayed on the screen some of nashs orbital particlebeam weapons they looked it took them only a second or two to register what was on the screen but by then it was too late for albert had found something else for me out of the contents of the house the workthing he had located and i had taken over came through the door its cleaner hoses elevated a workthing isnt a weapon when designed as a houseboy it can scrub and mend and tidy up it can even do windows and take out the garbage but it doesnt kill it does however have jets that can blast detergent into cracks and pumps that can put extra muscle behind the jets and when it has pumped up its charge to maximum and slipped paring knives into the nozzles of the jets as i had commanded this one to do while i was talking it can then project the knives with great force and considerable accuracy i didnt kill the old men or at least not permanently but before they could look around heimat had a knife in his throat and basingstoke one in his heart and they were no longer a problem for the children just for the technicians who would pump what remained of their minds into storage for the dead files i wonder i said watching the second slow knife gradually bury itself in basingstokes chest if we shouldnt have done that in the first place albert theyll be a lot less trouble as machinestored intelligences wont they why should they be albert smiled you arent you know but now take care of the children please children cassata cried youve got foe there theyre the ones you have to pay attention to but in this case said albert politely it is the same thing you see i didnt need to be reminded of that i was sufficiently scared already a workthing isnt any better at untying knots than at overcoming criminals but it has its scrapers and cutters it simply chewed through the ropes it freed oniko first then sneezy and harold and i talked to them while it was still doing it i said soothingly youre all right now kids except for one important thing i want you two to take your pods off without any argument or discussion because it is very important and i want you to do it right away they were good kids it wasnt easy for them nothing would have been easy for them after what theyd been throughespecially for oniko exhausted as she was and terrified as she had beenharder still for sneezy i guess because a heechee is almost never without his pod from the age of three up they did it all the same and they did it without any argument or discussion but oh how many milliseconds it took for them to do it while i waited on tenterhooks for the next step that was the one i feared but there was no choice i said now i want the two of you to bring the pods to the commset and plug them in to the data receptors it wasnt that easy pod terminals werent meant for any such use but albert had already been figuring out ways and means so sneezy saw how an adapter could fit and harold rummaged something that would do out of the beach houses junk drawers and with the help of the workthing they manhandled and wrestled it into shape stepping carefully around the two grisly things on the floor and all that time millisecond after millisecond i watched them doing the thing that would make it possible for me to do what i dreaded and wanted most of anything in the world to come face to facehowever metaphorically since i had no real face and didnt suppose the foe had ever had anywith the creatures who had upset the tranquillity of the never very tranquil universe i lived in and then oniko touched the terminals of her pod to the terminals of the commset and there they were i cant really tell you what the foe looked like how do you describe in terms of physical attributes what has none i could not tell you how big the foe were or what color or what shape they didnt have any of those things if they had gender or anything at all that distinguished one of them from another i wasnt aware of it i was not even sure there were two of them more than one yes less than many i suppose my assumption was that there were two because in the time between oniko putting her pod against the terminals of the commset and sneezy following with his i thought there was only a single being sharing gigabit space with me and after that i thought there were more i tried to speak to them it wasnt easy i didnt know how to go about it first i tried a question who are you that wasnt precisely what i said because i didnt say anything in words it was more like a vast soundless hmmm there wasnt any answer i tried again this time in pictures i recalled a picture of the kugelblitz the dozen turdcolored smears turning restlessly by themselves in intergalactic space nothing came back i made a picture of the wheel and put it in the frame with the kugelblitz i wiped that and showed sneezy and oniko and then their pods then i tried another hmmm no answer nothing just the knowledge that somebody somehow was sharing that space with me no there was an answer because i had shown the pods as they were opaque dull topshaped metal things and in my own picture they were luminous they were radiating although all my attention was focused tightly on my doppel there was still the other me half a second away in the true love with essie and albert and general cassata i was aware of stirrings there even questions even comment but the real me was always a couple of seconds behind the doppel and by the time albert cried sharply theyre telling you they were in the pods i had already been told it was after all an answer of sorts communication had begun i tried a hard picture i tried to show the entire universefrom outside from the place that had never existed because there was no outside of what was by definition everywhere the only picture that conveyed any of that to me was simply a great glowing featureless blob whether it would mean anything to the foe i could not say but it was the best i could approximate of the things albert had showed me in deep time then as albert had i zoomed in on it the blob approached and spread out and displayed one section of the universe a few thousand galaxies ellipticals and spirals and odd pairs crashing through each other and singles spewing out arms of starlets and gas was that right something was nagging at me that said i was doing something wrong right i thought i was i had been making an assumption i had no right to make i was showing the universe as it appeared to human eyes in the optical frequencies of light bad assumption i had no reason to assume the foe had eyes even if they did in some sense what right had i to assume that they saw only the familiar human rainbow frequencies from violet to red so i added to the picture the halos and gas clouds that showed up only in infrared or microwave and even the clouds of particles that we supposed were the foes own contribution to the universe we lived in actually that is to say i showed my unseen audience the pictures albert had showed me in deep time i let it hang there for a moment and then i made it move in reverse just as albert had done for me i shrank the picture galaxies came closer together as they approached they spread out so that i was showing less structure and less more and more tightly compacted together i shrank it still farther catastrophically i crushed the universe down to a single terrible point of light and then i reenacted the big bang and froze the whole scene at that moment in time when all options were open and then i tried another of those wordless questioning feelings hmmm and then i had my answer of course the answer didnt come in words of course the answer seemed hardly like an answer at all i had not expected that it would i hadnt expected anything really or at least i had had no idea what to expect what i had was a picture and of all the possible responses i might have thought likely this was the least the picture was me grinning at the other me my own face angular ugly but recognizable perhaps as i had looked to oniko and sneezy as i peered out of the commset it did not seem an appropriate response to the burning question i had tried to ask probably the reason for that i told myseli was that i had failed to ask a proper question perhaps my picture of what the foe were trying to doat least what we thought the foe were trying to dolacked some essential feature in their eyes i didnt know how to remedy that all our assumptions about the foe were based on the conjecture that as pure energy beings they found our present universe less hospitable than they liked and so they had resolved to create enough missing mass to cause it to fall back together into the primeval atom from which it would explode in a second or a third or an nth big bang to create a new one more to their liking reshaping the universe foeforming it as you might say in the same way that both the heechee and ourselves had terraformed planets that was the sense of what i wanted to convey but i didnt know how to picture it in their terms except that it seemed i just had how long i hung in there staring at the caricature of my own face and wondering what to try next i cannot guess it was a long time even by meat standards it was long enough to matter because i was aware that the glacial movements of the people in the room were actually making changes there were more people there now there were other human beings in the room and a lot of machines when i took time to flash a question to albert and essie through the other me back on the true love albert said reassuringly its the police robin and the physics people to make sure conilnement is still working and the deathreversal teams for basingstoke and general heimat dont worry youre doing fine fine and yes perhaps i was because the pictures changed i didnt know what i was seeing at first an odd ball of nastylooking fire that opened up to show stars and planets crowded close together and zoomed in on one of the planets to show stick figures bounding about that were recognizably meant to be heechee their hideaway in the core of course and as soon as i recognized that there was another picture it was almost like a documentary or a travelogue life among the heechee i saw heechee worldships hanging near the schwarzschild barrier and heechee cities under their glassedin domes i saw heechee factories producing heechee consumer goods and heechee persons working and marrying and giving birth and growing i saw more about the heechee in that long gigabittime display than i had known about them before in all my long life i will put it mildly i was astonished and i was horribly hopelessly confused i had no idea why i was seeing what i saw and then the picture changed again it was another travelogue it wasnt the heechee anymore it was us i dont know perhaps i saw every human being there ever was in that eternalbrief display some of them i recognized i saw oniko being born on the heechee artifact and the death of her grandparents i saw her rescued with all her little colony and i saw her brought to the watch wheel i saw the human race maybe all the hundred billion members of it there were on all the twenty inhabited planets and in ships between i even saw history i saw armies and space navies and weapons practice and ships being launched that were armed to kill a world if they chose to i saw cities bombed and obliterated i saw a gateway prospector in a five stealthily slitting the throats of his four companions i saw my dear wife essie with the tubes in her throat and nose and the lifesupport machines chugging all around hera picture i remembered because once she had been just like that i saw basingstoke in tights and air mask swimming through lucid tropical waters to fix a limpet bomb to the hull of a cruise ship i saw general beaupre heimat press a button that destroyed a spacecraft and i saw him again doingoh doing vile and terrible things to a tiny female childit was only a minuscule relief from the stomachtwisting sight to realize that the child was only a robot the flood of pictures went on forever and then they forever ended i saw nothing i did not even see the room or oniko and the other children or the newcomers who were going about their business in it i saw nothing at all my senses had been blacked out and then i realized that i was indeed getting answers to my questions only they were not the questions i had asked i was not being told what i was only being told why the other i back on the true love was watching it all but i couldnt see him i couldnt see anything at all and then i saw everything all at once all the pictures i had seen before floating before me at once like a storm of confetti they danced around and blended heechee became half human humans began to look like heechee and they blurred into computer constructs and sluggards and voodoo pigs and into things that bore no resemblance at all to anything the universe had ever known and then it all began to dissolve in a torrent of multicolored sparks all of it even me i felt myself dissolving i felt my very own person melting and coruscating into nothingness it took quite a long time for me to understand what was happening im dying for gods sake i shouted into empty gigabit space just as i did i died i screamed in terror to albert and my dear portableessie and the officers of jaws gathered solicitously around me in the true love i felt essies warm arms around me oh shoo shoo dear robin she soothed is all right now are not dead anymore not here cassata cried exultantly but you did the job robin you talked to them now we can go out to the watch wheel and general cassata said albert politely please shut up how do you feel robin it is true that in a sense yes you did die at least that copy of you is gone forever and maybe the foe with it i think they neutralized you robin even though it cost them themselves im sorry it was so traumatic for you sorry i screamed do you know what its like to die to know that you are disappearing and there wont be any you ever again anywhere essie hugged me tighter than ever murmuring comfort in my ear but is still a you robin is here with me was only duplicate that entered gigabitisolate with foe you know i wrenched myself free and glared at my two nearest and dearest i wasnt even aware of the jaws officers its fine for you to say i said bitterly you didnt have to feel it i died and its not the first time i remind you both ive had the experience before and i am so terribly tired of dying if theres one thing i want in all the world its to do it again i stopped because they were looking at me in a peculiar way oh i said managing to grin i mean i want not to do it again but which i meant really was very unclear even to me scared rats running when a stored personality in gigabit space has had a terrible shock you dont give him a stiff drink and a place to lie down but sometimes it helps if you pretend you do you should rest for a moment robin said albert let me make comfortable doveheart murmured essie and a moment later i was comfortable indeed essie made it so i was lying in a hammock on the lanai outside my home overlooking the tappan sea with dear portableessie hovering over me and pressing a drink in my hand it was an icy margarita with just enough salt on the rim of the glass and it tasted quite as good as if it had been real i was the center of attention essie was sitting next to the hammock stroking my hair lovingly and looking worried albert was seated on the edge of a chaise longue scratching his ear meditatively with the stem of his pipe as he watched my face that was all homely and familiar enough but there were other people there i wasnt surprised to see julio cassata who was pacing up and down on the grass just below the steps but stopping at the end of each patrol to look searchingly in my direction even alicia lo sitting quietly on a rocker at the edge of the lanai was no surprise but there was someone else there the someone was a heechee i was not ready for surprises i sat up and said what the hell i didnt say it meanly if anything i think i said it beseechingly essie took it in the right way i dont know if you remember doublebond she said she was right i didnt he was a heechee representative to jaws essie added and vaguely i did remember there had been a heechee or two there and yes one of them had been an ancient ancestor like this one and had had the sparse headfuzz and deepset eyes of age like this one im pleased to see you again i said i gulped the last of the tequila and looked around and then i said again what the help but this time it was in a quite different tone because i had looked past the simulated friendly tappan sea surround i expected to find that we were in the true love and we were but the screen was showing only mottled gray when i looked through the true loves skin sensors i saw we were in fasterthanlight travel when i peered at the retrolog i saw the jaws satellites dwindling behind us jaws looked different to me in some way i wasnt sure what and didnt take the time to figure it out what was more important was what true love was doing we were en route somewhere and i had not expected that at all where are we going i cried albert coughed there were some developments while you were working through your doppel he said didnt dare disturb your concentration essie said worriedly sorry about that but is all right honest dearest robin are safe and sound in true love as you see you didnt answer my question she laid the hand that had been stroking my hair alongside my cheek it felt warm and caring we go to source she said soberly to kugelblitz to home of foe fast as we can i let myself return to the pleasant tappan sea surround feeling very disoriented essie had another margarita ready and i reached out for it automatically i held it in my hand trying to figure out what was happening we had left jaws then i remembered what was different about the way the jaws satellites had looked when we departed the fleet is gone i cried exactly said albert we are following them against orders added julio cassata cannot give orders to us snapped essie they can give orders to me said cassata and were going against them the fleet movement is a military operation after all military i stared at the man wondering if it was at all possible that he meant what i thought he meant he shrugged i translated the shrug easily enough it was yes that was indeed what he meant this is crazy i shouted he shrugged again but i said but but i wasnt ready to go on a long trip just now essie leaned over and kissed me dear robin she said is no choice after all is there jaws fleet is not to be trusted by itself who knows what idiocy they may try but but back on wrinkle rock she said lovingly is nothing on wrinkle rock for you anymore dear robin farewells are said after all party is now over the long voyage all the time i was messing around with the kids and their captors on the island of tahiti was meat time there had been time for meat people to do things meat people had the meat people who ran jaws had decided the threat on earth was nothing they needed a fleet there for so they had sent the cruisers off to the watch wheel meatcassata hadnt bothered to terminate doppelcassata whose datastore was still on true love along with the store for alicia lo albert was the one who had insisted on taking along the prayer fan that was the store for the heechee ancient ancestor doublebond it wasnt the only store he had put aboard and he had his reasons when i realized what they were i could only approve and of course doppelcassata approved very much he hadnt been terminated not only that he couldnt be terminated as long as he was aboard true love in transit because there was no one there to terminate him for cassata it was not only a reprieve it was practically an eter nityweeks and weeks of travelthe equivalent for him of decades and decades of added life thats what is was for julio cassata for me it was something quite different the first thing i had to do was get over the terrible shocks that had come from my mind mingling with the foe and the foe entering into my mind as well as that other shock of feeling myself die yet once again one of the advantages of being a stored intelligence is that you can edit the stores if you want to if something hurts you can just take it out seal it up put it on a shelf marked warning not to be opened unless necessary and go about your business painfree like many of those many advantages it carries a penalty with it i know this because id tried it long and long agooh something like tentotheeleventh milliseconds agoi was really really screwed up i had just died then too only that time it was my real meat body that had died and albert and essie had just poured me into machine storage that is a real jolt there was more i had just encountered klara the woman i loved before i loved the woman who was my wife essie and there were the two of them in my life not only that but i had actually thought i had murdered that other woman gelleklara moynlin and oh yes i had just met a live heechee for the first time put them all together it was bloody shattering so to get me through the worst of it albert and essie had restructured the program that was all that remained of me they had isolated the datastores that had to do with klara and the terrible crush of guilt that had cost me years of psychoanalysis to ease and they had encapsulated them in a readonly file and given it back to me with a seal on it so i wouldnt open it until i was ready i dont think i ever was ready but after a while i opened it anyway see the way you remember things is associative i had lost some associations i could remember that something else had been on my mind but i couldnt remember what i could say gee sure at that time i was really shaken up because but i couldnt remember what the because was and that i finally decided was worse than having the whole thing right in front of me all the time because if i had to stew and fret and worry at least i could know what i was worrying about to give you an idea of how i felt after my little adventure with the foe on moorea i seriously considered asking essie to put that one away for me in mothballs too but i couldnt i had to face it and live with it and oh my god it was scary i kept going over and over that long wordless meeting of minds and the more i thought about it the huger and more terrifying it was i little robinette broadhead had been in the presence of the thingsthe creatures the monsters maybe one might even say the peoplewho were busy turning the entire universe upside down for their own pleasure what was a feckless fragile little kid like me doing in the same league as superstars like them i need to try to put something into perspective it isnt going to be easy it isnt even going to be possible in any real sense because the perspective is too immensealbert would probably say incommensurable meaning that you cant measure the things involved on the same scale its likelikewell suppose you were talking to one of those early australopithecines of half a miffion years ago or so you could probably find a way to explain to him that where you had come from was a hell of a long way from where he was bornsay somewhere in africa you might even be able to tell him that alaska and australia were a hell of a lot farther still that much he might understand but is there any conceivable way in which you could tell him how much farther away were say the core of the galaxy of the magellanic clouds impossible after a certain pointfor australopithecine or modernday human or even machinestored intelligence like mebig is simply indistinguishably big for that reason i dont know how to describe just how long it took for me to experience that long tedious fasterthanlight trip from jaws to the watch wheel it was forever i can put the numbers in measured by gigabit time it was well over tentotheninth milliseconds which is about as much time by meat standards as my whole meat life had been before i was vastened but that doesnt really convey the slow draggy way the time passed on the long trip from wrinkle rock to jaws i had made albert show me the entire history of the universe now i had begun a trip that was a good thousand times longer and what could he do for an encore i needed a whole lot of things to do to keep busy i had no trouble finding the first one albert had persuaded general cassata to persuade jaws to let us access every bit of data they had on the foe there was a hell of a lot of it the trouble was that as far as what was going on right now was concerned it was all negative it didnt answer the questions i really wanted answered which were mostly questions i didnt have enough background knowledge to ask optimistic old albert denied that we have learned much robin he lectured chalk in hand before his blackboard for example we now know that the galaxy is a horse the dog did not bark and the cat is among the pigeons albert said essie levelly she was speaking to him but she was looking at me i supposed i had been looking confused at alberts undesired playfulness but that was not odd i was confused not to mention stressed worried and generally unhappy albert got his stubborn look yes mrs broadhead have thought for some time program may need routine overhaul albert is this now necessary i dont think so he said looking uncomfortable whimsy she said is useful and even desirable in albert einstein program for robin wishes it so however he said uncomfortably i take your meaning mrs broadhead what you want is a simple and lucid synoptic report very well the data is as follows first we have no evidence that any other bits pieces pseudopods or extrusions of the foe other than the ones robin encountered on tahiti exist anywhere else in the galaxy second we have no evidence that they still exist third as to those units themselves we have no evidence that they are in any significant way different from ourselves which is to say patterned organized and stored electromagnetic charges in some suitable substrate specifically in this case the pods of oniko and sneezy he looked directly at me are you following this robin not a lot i said making an effort you mean theyre just electrons like you and me just some other kind of dead men not some subnuclear particles like albert winced robin he complained i know you know better than that not only as to particle physics but as to grammar you know what i mean i flared trying not to be on edge and making myself more so by the effort albert sighed indeed i do very well i will spell it out with all of the instrumentation we were able to bring to bear which was probably all that would have been of use we were able to detect no field ray energy emission or other physical effect associated with the foe which was not compatible with the assumption that they are yes composed of electromagnetic energy just like us no gamma rays even definitely no gamma rays he said looking irritated also no xrays cosmic rays quark flows or neutrinos also in another category no poltergeists nrays psychic auras fairies at the bottom of the garden or indications of the adeledicnander force albert cried essie youre patronizing me albert i complained he gazed at me for a long moment then he stood up his hair had turned woolly and his complexion had darkened straw hat in hand he strutted a few steps in a cakewalk and chanted deedy ah is suh yassuh yassuh yuk yuk yuk damn it albert i shouted he resumed his normal appearance you have no sense of fun in your heart anymore robin he complained essie opened her mouth to speak then she closed it again looking at me in an inquiring way then she shook her head and to my surprise said only go on albert thank you he said as though it had been no more than he expected in spite of her earlier threats to put it all more prosaically since you are determined to be a wet blanket let me return to my previous points which if you remember i put in semihumorous fashion to make them more palatable and as a mnemonic device the galaxy is a horse yes a trojan horse every external appearance indicates that it is just as it always has been in our lifetimes but i infer that it is full of enemy troops or to put it more simply there are a whole lot of those foe emissaries around robin and we cant detect them but theres been no evidence i cried and then as he gazed at me well yeah i see what youre saying if we dont see them its because theyre hiding right i follow that but how do you know they are hiding there has been only one single transmission that we can blame on the foewhat he was shaking his head no robin we have detected one the only reason we did is that the foe used the standard earth communications facilities and so that particular burst transmission which the children on moorea originated turned up on the logs as an anomaly but we dont monitor everything robin if there were foe on say peggys planet where things are a lot looser would anyone have noticed one more transmission or from a ship in space or for that matter from the watch wheel itself say a few months ago before we tightened everything up i dont think so robin i think we have to assume that all the false alarms on the wheel were not false that the foe penetrated it some time ago that they have gone wherever they wanted to go in our space and seen everything they wanted to see and no doubt reported back to the kugelblitz that he said smiling cheerfully is what i meant by the cat is among the pigeons why he finished looking around in mild curiosity it would not surprise me a bit if there were a few of them right here with us on the true love i jumped i couldnt help it i was still bruised and shaken from that terrible hurtful experience i looked around wildly and albert chided oh you wouldnt see them robin i dont expect to see them i snarled but where could they hide he shrugged if i were forced to speculate he said why i would try to put myself in their place where could i hide if i wanted to stow away on the true love without being seen it would not be difficult we have a great deal of stored data here there are thousands of files that we havent opened any one of them might have a couple of stowaways or a thousand of them i mean assuming the concept of number of individuals has any meaning to what may well be a collective intelligence robin he said seriously i do not think that creatures capable of reversing the expansion of the universe can be discounted lightly if i can think of one place to hidein the programs for penetrating black holes for example or in some of the subroutines for translating say polish into heecheebelieve me they will no doubt be able to think of thousands i would not even assume they were destroyed on tahiti simply because you he stopped and cleared his throat glancing apologetically at me go on i growled you dont have to worry about reminding me that i died i havent forgotten he shrugged at any rate he finished as to whether some of them are watching us right now we simply have no evidence at all so we search the ship shouted general cassata who had been listening without talking for a long time mrs broadhead most of these programs are yours arent they fine you tell us what to do and she was looking at albert as she said moment please general tricky weird program has not finished its foolingaround report i think thank you mrs broadhead albert beamed perhaps you have forgotten the other main heading in my brief synoptic report the dog did not bark i couldnt help laughing oh hell albert i said youll be the death of me with your silly literary references whats that sherlock holmes meaning the important thing is that something did not happen and what something is that why simply that were still here robin he said smiling approvingly at me for my sagacity i stopped laughing i did not think i understood him exactly and was afraid that perhaps i did that is to say he amplified comfortably sucking on his pipe although we must assume that the foe have been able to roam more or less at will around the galaxy for some time and although they certainly have the capacity to wipe out entire civilizations at will since they have done so in the past and although we have no effective way known to me of interfering with this if they should choose to do itwe have not been wiped out i was sitting straight up by then and laughter was nowhere in my feelings go on i barked he looked mildly surprised why robin he said peaceably i think the conclusion follows rather inescapably from all of that maybe they just havent gotten around to it i saidor whimpered because to be truthful i was no longer feeling even as good as i had when the discussion began yes thats possible he said solemnly sucking on his pipe then for gods sake i yelled what the hell have you got to look cheerful about he said gently robin i know this is upsetting to you but do try to think it out logically if they have the intention of wiping us out and we have no way of preventing it then what is there for us to do nothing at all it is a fruitless hypothesis because it does not lead to any useful course of action i prefer the opposite assumption which is what that they have at least reserved decision he said that at some future point we may be able to take some action we dont yet know about until then i think we might as well just relax and enjoy ourselves dont you mrs broadhead wait a goddamned minute i yelled what kind of future action are we talking about why are we going out to the kugelblitz anyway you dont for one moment think that one of us is going to try to get into the kugelblitz and talk to these i stopped they were all looking at me with an expression i recognized i had seen it a long long time ago on the gateway asteroid it was the kind of look the other prospectors gave you after you had signed up for a mission that might make you rich and was a lot more likely to kill you dead but i didnt even remember volunteering we had at that point i guess been on the way for maybe an hour or so meat time and already it had been a long long trip see although all this was was i guess the only way i can say it is was a great pain in the ass it wasnt unique in human history human beings had gotten out of the habit of long travel times thats all we had to learn about them all over again our ancestors of a couple of centuries back wouldnt have had that problem they knew all about the relationship between space and time long before albert einstein go a long space take a long time that was the rule it wasnt until jet airplanes came in that people began to forget it think of admiral nelson playing one last game of bowls before getting into his ship to meet the spanish armada napoleon invading russia like a package tour with a dinner a ball and an entertainment at every nights stopoh that was the way to fight a war old ways were best when alexander the great came out of macedonia to conquer the world it wasnt any blitzkrieg he took his time he stopped off here to sit out the winter there to set up a puppet government this other place to get some lovely local lady pregnantoften enough hanging around until the baby was born if youve been in a battle and then are sitting around your troop transport to dawdle toward the next one youve got a weird unreal time in between we werent fighting a war exactly at least we hoped we werent but we were on our way to something just as decisive and dangerous and oh did we have time do you know how long fifty days is it is roughly milliseconds and we spent them the way our distinguished predecessors did we feasted feted and fucked our way across the galaxy we did it in all the style of any napoleon or alexander too because albert einstein has great resources he provided us with some of the neatest surrounds i have ever seen for hours essie and i hid away from our traveling companions sunbathing and snorkeling on the great barrier reef we dragged ourselves out of the soft salt shallows onto a quarterhectare sand island where we made love in a shady silk tent with its skirts raised to let the breezes through there was a bar and a picnic table and a hot freshwater jacuzzi and thats how we passed the first day then we could face our traveling companions and realityfor a while and when that began to get stale albert came up with a grape arbor in an oasis in the big sandy of peggys planet it was on the side of a fault escarpment icecold springs trickled down the rock face white grapes black grapes and red plums and berries melons and peaches grew all around we lay talking and touching under the leafy shade of the vines overhead essie and i and so passed another fine day we hardly thought of where we were going at all for moments at a time alberts infinite variety kept turning up wonderful surrounds a tree house in an african forest with lions and elephants sliding silently among the trees below at night a houseboat on an indian lake with turbaned servants bringing us floweryfresh sherbets and spicy tidbits of lamb and pastry among the water lilies a penthouse a hundred stories over chicago looking out at thunderclouds strobing the wide lake with lightning a night in rio at carnival time and another in new orleans for the mardi gras a hoverplatform vibrating restlessly on the crater rim of the planet persephones mount hell with boiling lava fountains reaching up almost to where we sat albert had a million of them and they were all good what wasnt quite so good was me said essie panting and regarding me critically as she hoisted herself up the last halfmeter to sit on a ledge over the grand canyon is all right everything my robin everything is fine i said voice as firm as it was false ah she said nodding ha she added studying me closely is enough sightseeing for now i think all play no work has made robin dull boy albert where are you im right here mrs broadhead said albert leaning over the lip of the canyon to look down on us essie squinted up at his friendly face outlined against the bright simulated arizona sky do you think she said can find us setting less ah epicene and uh sybaritic for dear husband who is capable of doing anything but nothing at all i certainly can said albert in fact i was about to suggest that we give up the simulated surrounds for a while i think it might be interesting to spend a little more time with our guests on the true love after all im afraid theyre getting a little bored by now too over all the millions of milliseconds i have experienced ive spent time with a lot of people and some of them were heechee this time with doublebond was special what was special about this time was that there was so much of it soothed by all those long days of beachcombing with essie i was ready to get serious so was doublebond i hope he said courteously the muscles on the backs of his skinny hands rippling in apology that you will forgive me for stowing away on your ship robinette broadhead it was thermoclines suggestion he is very wise im sure he is i said repaying courtesy with courtesy but whos thermocline exactly he is one of the other heechee representatives on the joint assassin watch system council said doublebond and julio cassata put in and a royal pain in the ass he is too he was smiling as he said it and i looked at him curiously that had been a very cassata thing to say but he hadnt said it in a cassata way not only that but he wasnt even behaving in a cassata fashion he was sitting next to alicia lo and they were holding hands doublebond took the remark in a friendly spirit we have had differences yes very often with you general cassata or at least with your organic original old bloodandslaughter cassata said his copy grinning you heechee dont like it when we talk about blowing up the kugelblitz indeed they didnt doublebonds neck tendons tensed it was the equivalent of a human shudder albert cleared his throat and said peaceably doublebond there is something i have had on my mind for some time perhaps you can help clear it up with great pleasure said the heechee while you were still organic you were one of the great authorities on the sluggard planet i wonder do you remember well enough to be able to show us some of the sluggard material visually no i do not remember said doublebond smiling however we have incorporated some of your own storage systems into our fans and yes i do have a selection of such material available i thought you did said albert meaning of course that he had known that was so all along let me show you something first when we were on the jaws satellite we visited the voodoo pigs mrs broadhead and i had a similar notion do you remember he asked looking at me sure i said because albert had displayed the voodoo pig muck before us all but the smell one of the pigs was nibbling away industriously at one of their voodoo dolls or whatever they were and in the foreground was one of the little figures itself washed clean of ifith and slop essie said something funny alicia lo said she thought they were dolls just to play with and then you saidwhat was it you said essie she said visitors she said it in a voice that was half argumentative as though she thought she would be challenged and halfwellscared albert nodded exactly mrs broadhead visitors aliens to the planet this was a logical deduction since all the figures were the same and quite detailed and there was nothing like that ever on that planet to use as a model theyre probably extinct i said offhandedly maybe the voodoo pigs ate them all albert gave me one of those tolerant fatherly looks it would be more likely to judge from their appearance that they would have eaten the voodoo pigs indeed i suspect perhaps they may have but thats not what i am driving at trust me robin those creatures were never indigenous to the planet of the voodoo pigs i believe doublebond will agree that is true said doublebond politely we made extensive paleontological investigations they were not native therefore albert began essie finished for him therefore was right visitors creatures from another planet left such an impression on pigs have been carving voodoo dolls to keep them away ever since yes said albert nodding something like that i think now doublebond but the heechee was ahead of him too i believe you now wish to see the creatures that attacked the sluggards he waited politely for albert to dismiss his own construct then substituted a new one it was a sluggard arcology and it was being destroyed creatures the size of great blue whales but with squidlike tentacles that held weapons were systematically blowing it apart the simulation said doublebond regretfully is only very approximate but it is probably correct in its gross features the weapons are quite well documented the lack of limbs other than the tentacles is highly probable the sluggards would not have failed to note arms or legs since their own anatomy has neither and the size said albert oh yes said doublebond shaking his wrists affirmatively that is quite definite the relative sizes of the assassins and the sluggards are well established and they are much bigger than the voodoo pigs said albert assuming the dolls they made are of creatures about their own size they could not be the same creatures alicia lo stirred but i thought she hesitated i thought the foe were the only other spacetraveling race there was yes said albert nodding i looked at him waiting he stopped there i said come on albert yes they were or yes everybody thought so because everybody else was dumber than you are he said i dont really know robin ill tell you what i think though i think neither the creatures that nearly destroyed the sluggards nor the creatures that the voodoo pigs keep depicting were actually space travelers i think they were brought there said doublebond i also think that albert i believe that the assassins were not actually assassins that is they themselves did not physically attack other races though perhaps they transported the beings who did for this reason i like better the name you call them by the foe it is more accurate i think he said looking at albert but albert did not respond guests are no trouble at all when they dont have to be fed and their bed linen doesnt have to be changed i discovered to my surprise that i actually liked having alicia lo around besotted though she seemed to be with a man i had little use for what was even more surprising was that cassata himself seemed to be coming almost close to being nearly tolerable for one thing he hardly ever wore the uniform anymore that is i didnt think he did most of the time i had no idea what he wore doubted actually that he was wearing much at all because he and alicia were off in some private surround of their own but when we were all together he was generally wearing something casual shorts and a tank top a safari suit once elegant in white tie and tails but as albert might have said thermal equilibrium was maintained because as julio cassata became more bearable i became more restless itchy ill at ease yes gboopy i tried to hide it waste of time who can hide anything from my dear portableessie finally she confronted me you want to talk about it she demanded i tried to give her a bright smile it turned itself into a morose shrug not to me dammit to albert ah honey i objected what about i dont know what about maybe albert will know what about have nothing to lose you know nothing at all i said meaning to agreemeaning also to give a sort of sardonic agreement maybe with a twitch of the eyebrows but the look i got back discouraged me i said hastily ill do it albert and when albert appeared i just sat and looked at him he patiently looked back puffing on his pipe waiting for me to speak essie had taken herself away out of courtesyi wanted to think it was courtesy and not contempt or boredom so we just sat for a while and then it occurred to me that indeed there was something i wanted to talk to him about albert i said pleased to have a topic of conversation whats it like whats what like robin to be where you were before you were here i mean i said whats it like to you know dissolve when i tell you to go away for a while when youre not doing anything when you go back to being part of the gigabit store when you stop being well you and just be a bunch of distributed bits and pieces floating around in the great electronic bin of buildingblock parts albert didnt groan he only looked as though he wanted to he said with patience sticking out all over him i have told you i think that when i am not actively programmed to be your dataretrieval source the various bits of memory that the albert einstein program employs exist in the common store of course the common store in the true love is much smaller than that in the worlds gigabit net though still quite large and performing many functions is that what youre talking about thats it albert what does it feel like he pulled out his pipe which was the sign that he was thinking it over i dont know if i can tell you that robin why not because the question is wrongly put you presuppose that there is a me who can feel what it is like there isnt a me when my parts are distributed to other tasks for that matter there isnt a me now but i see you i said oh robin he sighed weve had these discussions so many times before havent we youre simply dodging around some real issue that concerns you if i were your psychoanalytic program would ask you to youre not i said smiling but feeling the smile grow tight so dont lets do it over again this time ill try to stay with you you know go back to where i say but i see you and then you tell me about niagara falls again he gave me a look that was part exasperation and part concern i understood both very clearly i know albert is often exasperated with me but i know even better that he cares a lot about me he said very well well play your game again you see me in the sense that you see a waterfall if you look at niagara falls today and come back a week later and look at it again you will think youre seeing the same waterfall in fact not one atom of the waterfall is the same the waterfall exists only because it is constrained to do so by the laws of hydraulics surface tension and newtons laws as they bear on the fact that one body of water is at a higher elevation than another i appear to you only because i am constrained to do so by the rules of the albert einstein program written for you by your wife s ya lavorovnabroadhead the water molecules are not niagara falls they are only what niagara falls is made of the bytes and bits that allow me to function when my program is activated are not me have you understood that because if so you will then see that it is pointless to ask how i feel when i am not me because then there is no me to feel anything now he said leaning forward earnestly suppose you tell me what you yourself are feeling that brings this on robin i thought it over listening to him talk in that soft sweet accent of his had been soothing and so it took me a moment to remember what the answer was then i remembered and i was lulled no more i said scared he pursed his lips as he regarded me scared i see robin can you tell me what frightens you well which of the four or five hundred no no robin the top thing i said im just a program too ah he said i see he dumped his pipe regarding me i think i understand he qualified because you too are machinestored you think whatever happens to me might happen to you or worse oh robin he said shaking his head you worry about so many things you are afraid i think that somehow you will forget and turn yourself off is that it and then you can never get yourself together again but robin that cant happen i dont believe you i said that stopped him at least for a moment methodically and slowly albert refilled his pipe struck a match on the sole of his foot lit it and puffed thoughtfully never taking his eyes off me he didnt answer then he shrugged albert almost never leaves me until i let him know i want him to but it looked to me as though he had that in mind dont go away i said all right robin he said looking surprised talk to me some more its been a long trip and im getting kind of irritable i guess oh are you he asked arching his brows it was as close to judgmental as albert usually gets then he said you know robin you dont have to remain awake for all of it would you like to power down until we get there no but robin its nothing to worry about when youre in standby mode its just as though no time at all were passing ask your wife no i said again i didnt even want to discuss it standby mode sounded very much like that other mode they call dead no i just want to talk for a while i thinki really think i said full of the new idea that had just occurred to me that this would be a good time for me to let you tell me about ninedimensional space for the second time in a few milliseconds albert gave me that look not astonished exactly but at least skeptical you want me to explain ninedimensional space to you he repeated you bet albert he studied me carefully through the pipe smoke well he said i can see that just the idea perks you up a little probably you figure youll have some pleasure out of making fun of me who me albert i grinned oh i dont mind if you do im just trying to understand what the ground rules will be the ground rules i said is that you tell me all about it if i get tired of it ill let you know so start please ninedimensional space is and then you fill in the blanks he looked pleased if still skeptical we should take these long trips more often he commented anyway thats not the way to start this is the way first we consider normal threedimensional space the kind you grew up in or thought you were growing up in when you were still meatwhat already i had my hand up i said i thought that was fourdimensional what about the dimension of time thats fourdimensional spacetime robin im trying to make it simple for you so lets stick to three dimensions at first ill give you an illustration suppose for instance that when you were a young man sitting with your girlfriend watching a pv show you just happened to put your arm around her the first thing you do is stretch your arm across the back of the couchthats the first dimension call it breadth then you crook your elbow at a right angle so your forearm is pointing forward and resting on her shoulderthats the second dimension which we will call length then you drop your hand onto her breast thats depth the third dimension thats depth all right because im getting in pretty deep by then i grinned he sighed and ignored the remark you comprehend the image you have so far demonstrated the three spatial dimensions there is also as you pointed out the dimension of time five minutes ago your hand was not there now it is at some time in the future it will be elsewhere again so if you want to specify the coordinates of any familiar system you must add that dimension in too the threedimensional where and the fourthdimensional when thats spacetime i said patiently im waiting for you to get to the part where it turns out that all this stuff that i already know is wrong i will robin but to get to the hard part i have to make sure you have the easy part under control now we get to the hard part it involves supersymmetry oh good are my eyes beginning to glaze over he peered inquiringly into my face just as solemnly as though i really had eyes and he had something to peer at them with hes a good sport albert is not yet he said pleased ill try not to glaze them supersymmetry sounds terrible i know but it is just the name given to a mathematical model which fairly satisfactorily describes the main features of the universe it includes or is related to things like supergravity and string theory and archeocosmology he peered at me again still not glazed all right now we start to understand the implications of those words the implications are easier than the words are these are pretty good fields of study taken together they explain the behavior of both matter and energy in all their manifestations more than that they dont just explain them the laws of supersymmetry and the others actually drive the behavior of all things by that i mean that from these laws the observed behavior of everything that makes up the universe follows logically even inevitably but he was in full course he waved me down stay with it he corn manded these are basic if the early greeks had understood supersymmetry and its related subjects they could have deduced newtons laws of motion and universal gravitation and planck and heisenbergs quantum rules and even he twinkled my own relativity theory both special and general they would not have had to experiment and observe they could have known that all these other things must be true because they followed just as euclid knew that his geometry must be true because everything followed from the general laws but it didnt i cried surprised did it i mean youve told me about noneudidean geometry he paused looking thoughtful thats the catch he admitted he looked at his pipe and discovered that it was out so methodically he began tapping it empty again while he talked eudidean geometry is not untrue it is simply true only in the special case of a flat twodimensional surface there arent any of those in the real world theres a catch in supersymmetry too the catch there is that it too is untrue in the real worldor at least the world of threedimensional space we perceive for supersymmetry to work nine dimensions are required and we can only observe three what happened to the other six i said with pleasure i dont have the faintest idea but youre doing this a lot better than usual im not lost yet ive had a lot a practice he said dryly ive got good news for you too i could demonstrate to you mathematically why nine dimensions are necessary oh no no of course not he agreed the good news is that i dont have to in order to let you understand the rest of it im grateful im sure he lit his pipe again now about the missing six dimensions he puffed for a while thoughtfully if nine spatial dimensions had to exist in order for the universe to be formed as it is in the first place why can we find only three now does it have something to do with entropy i hazarded albert looked aghast entropy certainly not how could it well with machs hypothesis then or some of the other things you were talking about in deep time he said reprovingly dont guess robin youre just making it harder than it is what happened to the other dimensions they just disappeared albert gazed at me happily puffing his pipe with as much satisfaction as though he had explained something significant i waited for him to go on when he didnt i began to feel nettled albert i know you like to tweak me every now and then just to keep my interest up but what the hell is they just disappeared supposed to mean he chuckled he was having a good time i could see that he said they disappeared from our perception at least that doesnt mean they were extinguished it probably just means that they got very small they shriveled up to where they just werent visible anymore i looked at him with outrage can you explain how a dimension can just shrivel up he smiled at me fortunately not he said i say fortunately because if i could it would probably get very mathematical and then youd be cutting me off right here however i can shed a little bit of light on what probably happened anyway by shrivel up i mean they just dont register anymore let me give you an illustration think of a pointsay the tip of your nose oh come on albert we already did threedimensional space the tip of your nose he repeated relate that point to some other point say your adams apple your nose is so many millimeters up and so many millimeters out and so many millimeters acrossthat is to say you specify its location on the x y and z axes when we talk about ninedimensional space instead of three you can also say that it is at a specific point on the p d q r w and k axesor whatever letters you want to use to specify thembut he took a deep breath but you dont have to specify those coordinates for any normal purpose because the distances are so small they dont signify thats it robin got it so far i said happily i almost think so fine he said because thats almost right it isnt quite as simple as that those missing six dimensionstheyre not only small theyre curved theyre like little circles like little coiledup spirals they dont go anywhere they just go around he stopped there sucking his pipe and gazing approvingly at me he was twinkling again there was something about the look in those guileless eyes that made me ask albert one question is all this stuff youve been telling me true he hesitated then he shrugged truth he said weightily is a really heavy word im not ready to talk about reality yet and thats what you mean by true this is a model that explains things very very well it may as well be taken as true at least until a better model comes along but unfortunately if you remember he said perking up the way he always does when he gets a chance to quote from himself as my meat original said long ago mathematics is most true when it is least real and vice versa there are many elements i have not characterized here we have not yet considered the implications of string theory or of heisenbergs uncertainty principle or give it a rest please i begged i gladly will robin he said because youve been very good about all this i appreciate your listening now there is some hope of your understanding the foe and more important the basic structure of the universe more important i repeated he smiled in an objective sense oh yes robin it is much more important to know than to do and it doesnt much matter who does the knowing i got up and walked around it seemed wed been talking for a very long time and then it occurred to me that that was good because that was exactly what i wanted i said albert how long did this little lecture of yours take you mean in galactic time let me see yes a little under four minutes and he saw my face and hurriedly added but were nearly a third of the way robin only a couple more weeks and well be at the watch wheel a couple of weeks he looked at me with concern there is still the option of powering down no of course not he said watching my face he looked irresolute for a moment then he made up his mind in a different tone he said robin when we were talking about what it is like for me when i am not in being as your program you said you didnt believe me im afraid you were justified i have not beez i entirely truthful with you nothing he ever said shocked me more albert i yelped you havent lied to me you cant he said apologetically thats correct robin i have never lied to you but there are truths i havent said you mean you do feel something when youre turned oft no i told you that theres no me to feel then what for gods sake there are things i doexperiencethat you never have robin when i am merged into another program i am that program or him or her he twinkled or they but youre not the same you anymore no thats true not the same but perhaps something better at the throne and time passed and time passed and the endless voyage went on i did everything there was to do then i did it twice then i did it some more then i even began to think seriously about alberts notion of a few weeks in standby mode and that scared me enough to make essie take notice she wrote a prescription for me will have essie announced a party and when essie tells you youre going to have a party you might as well relax and enjoy it that doesnt mean that that is what i did not right away anyhow i was not in a party mood i hadnt got over the shock of my death in the house on tahiti i hadnt quite nerved myself up to confront the prospect of meeting more of those assassin creaturesmillions more of themand on their home ground at that hell i hadnt even got all the way over everything else that had ever happened to me in my life from my nasty little mental breakdown when i was a kid through my mothers death and klaras wreck in the black hole right up to the present moment everybodys life is full of tragedies disasters and lousy breaks you keep on living it because now and then there are good times that make up for it or at least you hope they will but my god the number of miseries we all go through and when you live so much longer not only longer but in my case faster you just multiply the bad things grizzly grouch laughed essie planting a big kiss on my mouth cheer up wake up have a good time what the hell because tomorrow we die right or maybe not you know she is a living doll my essie is all of her the meat one that was the model and the portable one who shares my life and lets not get into any tricky debates about what i mean by living so i did my best to smile and to my astonishment i made it and then i looked around me whatever essie had said to albert about the luxurious surrounds he had been providing for us she didnt mean to let such strictures cramp her own style her ideas of a party have changed a lot since weve been machinestored in the old days we could do pretty much anything we liked because we were ifithy rich now its even better there is just about nothing that would give us pleasure that we cant do not after weve got on a plane or a spaceship to get there not after weve invited a bunch of people to join us and waited for them to arrive what we want to do we do right now and we dont even have to worry about hangovers harm to others or getting fat so to start essie provided us with a party room it wasnt anything outrageous actually if wed wanted one like it when we were still meat people we could easily have had it probably it wouldnt have cost more than a million dollars or so neither essie nor i had ever had a ski lodge but wed been in a couple at one time or another and liked the combination of the huge ceilinghigh fireplace at one end and the bear and moosehead trophies on the wall and the dozen manypaned windows along the walls with the snowy mountains crisp in the sunlight outside and the comfortable chairs and couches and tables with fresh flowers and and i realized a lot of things neither she nor i had ever seen in any ski lodge there was a wine fountain on a table by the windows and it was bubbling champagne next to the champagne fountain was a long buffet table with whitejacketed waiters standing by to fill our plates i saw a carved turkey and a ham and hollowedout fresh pineapples filled with kiwi fruit and cherries i looked at it and i looked at essie smoked oysters i ventured god robin she said in disgust of course smoked oysters not to mention caviar for me and albert and ribs for old julio and dim sum for his girl and whole big bucket of crummy stuff you like so much what is it tunafish salad she clapped her hands the leader of the little band on the dais at the far end of the room nodded and they began to play that gentle nostalgic stuff our grandparents went crazy over eat first or dance asked essie i made the effort i played up to her what do you think i asked in my sexiest and most vibrant moviestar voice looking deeply into her eyes with my hand cupped firm and strong on her bare shoulder because of course by then she was wearing a lowcut evening dress think eat dear robin she sighed but dont forget dance soon and often and you know it turned out not to be all that much of an effort there was all the tunafish salad i could ever hope to eat and the waiter piled it high on slices of rye bread and squashed it flat to make a sandwich just the way i liked the champagne was perfectly chilled and the bubbles pleasingly tickled my nose while we were eating albert cavalierly waved the orchestra oft the stand and pulled out a violin and entertained us with a little unaccompanied bach a little solo kreisler and then as members of the band started to come back to join him wound up with a couple of beethoven string quartets now you know none of the other players that made up his chambermusic group were reali mean not even as real as we were they were only quite limited programs taken out of alberts stock of surround furnishings but for what they were they did very well the good food and the great champagne werent real either but they tasted just as good going down the onions in the tuna fish satisfactorily reminded me of themselves every now and then afterward and the unreal alcohol in the simulated champagne activated my motion and sensory centers just as much and in just the same way as the real things would have done to the real thingswhat im trying to tell you is the drinking and dancing and eating were doing their work and i was getting horny and when essie and i were dreamily circling the floor and her head was on my shoulder and my fingers were gently kneading her soft sweet back i could feel that she was in a real receptive mood as i led her off the floor in the general direction of where i was sure she would have provided a bedroom albert looked up to wave a fond goodbye he and general cassata were chatting by the fire and i heard albert say that little impromptu minstrel show of mine gen eral i was only trying to cheer robin up you know i hope i didnt offend you general cassata looked puzzled he scratched his chocolatecolored cheekbone just next to his closecropped woolly sideburn and said i dont know what youre talking about albert why would i be offended i dont have to have a real body or real food to eat i dont have to have a real chair to sit i dont have to have any of the things you generally require to make love either and we did what we did with finesse devotion and a whole lot of fun simulated well sure it was simulated but it felt just as good as it ever had which was fine and when it was over my simulated heart was pounding a little faster and my breath was coming in simulated pants and i wrapped my arm around my love and pulled her close to soak in the simulated smell and feel and warmth of her am so glad said my simulated darling drowsily that i made our programs interactive she tickled my ear with her breath i turned my head enough to tickle hers my dearest essie i whispered you write one hell of a program could not have done it without you she said and yawned sleepily into the satin pillow i was kind of sleepy because that was part of the whole subroutine but i knew i could shake it off if i chose because thats part of the subroutine too and i did choose just for a moment anyway i thought because there were after all a few things on my mind i said i recognize the bed honey she giggled nice bed she commented she didnt deny what i knew that it was an exact or maybe even somewhat improved copy of the anisokinetic bed wed had in rotterdam years and years ago but that wasnt exactly what i wanted to talk about so i tried again honey do you think there were just two foe in there with me in the room in tahiti i mean essie lay silent a moment then she gently pulled free of my arm and got up on one elbow looking down at me she studied me silently for a moment before she said is no real way for us to tell is that not so albert says may be collective intelligence if so what you saw in tahiti was only perhaps quite small detached packets of foe stuff numbers in that case meaningless uhhuh essie sighed and rolled over through the closed door we could hear the music from the other room they were playing oldfashioned rock now probably for general cassatas benefit she sat up naked as the day we first made love and clapped her fingertips together for light light came gentle amber lights from concealed fixtures in the ceiling for essie had spared nothing in furnishing our little haven are still upset dear robin she commented neutrally i thought it over i guess so i said as a first approximation to what would be a much more emphatic description if i had chosen to give it you want talk i want i said suddenly wide awake to be happy why the hell does it have to be so goddamned hard essie reached over and brushed my forehead with her lips i see she said she didnt say anything else well what i mean i went on after a moment is i dont know whats going to happen have never known that have we and maybe that i said a lot louder than i had intended and maybe a lot nastier is why ive never been happy to that i got a silence when youre talking in the megabaud range even a twentieth of a millisecond is a significant pause and this was a lot longer than that then essie got up picked up a robe from beside the bed and pulled it on dear robin she said sitting on the edge of the bed and looking at me think maybe this long trip is quite bad for you gives you too much time to be gloopy in but we didnt have any choice did we and thats part of it i never have any choice ah she said nodding we get to heart of question fine open up tell me what is matter i didnt answer her i gave her the electronic equivalent of a sniff of exasperation she didnt deserve it of course she had been going far out of her way to be loving and kind and there was no reason for me to be getting unpleasant but unpleasant was how i felt tell me dammit she barked i barked back oh hell you ask some dumb questions you know that i mean you are the truest of true loves and i adore you and all butbutbut jesus essie how can you ask a question like that whats the matter you mean outside of the fact that the whole universe is at risk and i died a while agoagainand i might very likely die again pretty soon only this time forever because i have to go up against some people i dont even want to think about and ive got two wives and i dont really exist and all that you mean outside of that how did you like the play mrs lincoln oh robin she sighed dismally cannot even add right she took me by surprise what point one she said all brisk and businesslike have not got two wivesunless of course count meat original of me separate from me here who has just been most enjoyably making love with you i mean know very well what you mean robin she said firmly mean love me and also love gelleklara moynlin who keeps showing up every once in while to remind you have discussed this before is no problem have exactly one wife that matters robinette broadhead namely me portableessie s ya lavorovnabroadhead who is not in least jealous of feelings toward moynlin lady thats not the real i began but she waved me to silence second she said firmly taking in reverse orderno taking actually first point as second in present discussion essie youre losing me no she said never lose you or you me that is subset of first point which we will deal with third pay attention as to threat to entire sidereal universe yes granted is so is great problem is however problem with which we are dealing as best we can now leaves only remaining point maybe fifth or sixth in original presentation i forget i had begun to catch the rhythm the fact that we dont really exist you mean i said helpfully exactly glad are on your toes robin are not dead you know keep making this point are merely in fact discorporated quite something else are no longer meat but are still very much alive have just demonstrated that dammit i said tactfully it was wonderful and i know that what you say is true no dont know it well i know it logically anyway cogito ergo sum right exactly right the difficulty i said wretchedly is that i just dont seem able to internalize it ah she cried oh i see internalize is that it to be sure internalize first we get descartes now get headshrinker talk is blowing smoke robin smokescreen behind which to hide real concerns but dont you see i didnt finish because she placed her hand on my lips to cut me off then she got up and went to the door robin dearest person give you word i do see she picked another robe from a chair by the door and rolled it in her hands see that it is not me you should be talking to now but him him what him that psychoanalytic him robin here put this on she tossed me the robe and while i was dazedly doing as i was told she went out the door leaving it open and a moment later in through it came a gentle sadlooking elderly man hello robin its been a long time said my old headdoctor program sigfrid von shrink sigfrid i said i didnt ask for you he nodded smiling as he went around the room he was drawing blinds extinguishing lights making the bedroom less a passion pit and more a reasonably close approximation to his old consulting room i didnt even want you i yelled and besides i liked this room just the way it was he sat down in a chair by the bed looking at me it was almost as though nothing had changed the bed was no longer a playpen it was the agony couch i had lain on for so many tormented hours sigfrid said comfortably since you are obviously in need of some sort of easing of tensions robbie i thought i might as well reduce the extraneous distractions its not important i can put it back the way it was if you like but truly rob it would be more productive if you would tell me about your feelings of unease or worry instead of discussing the way the room is decorated so i laughed i couldnt help myself i laughed out loud big bellybusting laughter that went on for a long timemany microseconds at leastand when i stopped laughing i wiped my streaming eyes and i said you kill me sigfrid you know you havent changed a bit he smiled and said you on the other hand have you have changed very much from that insecure guiltridden selfdoubting young man who did his best to manipulate our sessions like parlor games youve come a long way robin im very pleased with you aw shecks i said grinningwarily on the other hand he went on in a lot of ways you havent changed at all do you want to spend our time in idle conversation and parlor games or would you like to tell me about whats worrying you talk about games youre playing one right now you know everything ive said already you probably know everything ive even thought he said seriously what i know or dont know doesnt matter you know that its what you know particularly the things you know but dont want to admit to yourself that are important you have to get them out in the open start by telling me why youre worried i said because im a wimp he looked at me and he was smiling you dont really believe that do you well im certainly no hero how do you know that robin he asked dont jerk me around heroes dont sit and brood heroes dont worry about whether theyre going to die heroes dont get all snarled up in guilt and worries and headcrap isnt that true it is true that heroes dont do any of those things sigfnd agreed but you left one trait out theres one other thing heroes dont do heroes dont exist do you really think all those people you call heroes are any better than you are i dont know if i believe it i sure as hell hope it but robin he said reasonably you really havent done that badly have you youve done what no one else has ever done not even a heechee youve talked with two of the foe i fucked it up i said bitterly do you think that sigfrid sighed robbie you often simultaneously hold quite contradictory views of yourself but given a choice in the long run you adopt the least flattering one why is that do you remember that for many sessions when we first met you kept telling me what a coward you were but i was god sigfrid i stalled around on gateway forever before i got up the guts to ship out that could be described as cowardice yes said sigfrid it is true that that was your behavior yet there were other times when you behaved in ways that can only be called extraordinarily brave when you jumped into a spaceship and headed for the heechee heaven you faced terrible odds you endangered your lifein fact you very nearly lost it there was big money involved that time it made me rich you already were rich rob he shook his head then he said thoughtfully it is interesting that when you do something praiseworthy you ascribe venal motives to yourself but when you do something that appears bad you jump to agree that the appearances are correct when do you win robin i didnt answer i didnt have an answer maybe i didnt want to look for one sigfrid sighed and changed position all right he said lets get back to basics tell me why youre worried why im worried i cried dont you think ive got plenty to worry about if you dont think the entire basic universewide situation is something to worry any sane person then maybe you just havent caught on to whats happening he said with visible patience the foe certainly are a sufficient cause for worry yes but but if that isnt enough consider my personal situation im in love with two womenthree actually i mean i corrected myself remembering essies arithmetic he pursed his lips is that a worry robbie in any practical sense i mean for example do you have to do anything about itchoose among them for instance i think not no reason for conflict exists really and i burst out no youre goddamned right and do you know why no reason for conflict exists because i dont exist im just a damned datastore in gigabit space im no more real than you are he said mildly do you really think i dont exist damn straight you dont some computer programmer made you up sigfrid studied his thumbnail there was another of those long multimicrosecond pauses and then he said tell me robinette what do you mean by exist you know effing well what it means to exist it means to be real i see are the foe real of course theyre real i said in disgust they werent ever anything else theyre not copies of something that was real once ah all right is the law of inverse squares real robbie call me robinette damn it i flared he raised his eyebrows but nodded and just sat there waiting for an answer i collected my thoughts the law of inverse squares yes is real not in a material sense but in its ability to describe material events you can predict its functioning you can see its effects but i can see your effects robinrobinette he corrected himself hastily one illusion recognizes another illusion i sneered yes he conceded one might say that but others see your effects too was general beaupre heimat an illusion but the two of you certainly interacted as he would not deny are your banks an illusion they hold your money the people who work in your employ the corporations that pay you dividendstheyre all quite real are they not hed given me time to collect my thoughts i smiled i think youre the one whos playing games now sigfrid or else you just miss the point you see the trouble with you i said patronizingly is that youve never been real so you dont know the difference real people have real problems physical problems little ones at least thats how they know theyre real i dont in all the years ive beendiscorporatedive never once had to grunt and strain on the toilet because i was constipated ive never had a hangover or a runny nose or a sunburn or any other of the ills the flesh is heir to he said in exasperation you dont get sick is that what youre pissing and moaning about i looked at him in shock sigfrid you never used to talk to me like this in the old days you werent as healthy as this in the old days robinette i really wonder if this conversation is doing either of us any good perhaps im not the one you should be talking to well i said beginning almost to enjoy myself at least ive heard you sayoh jesus now what i finished because i wasnt talking to sigfrid von shrink anymore what the hell are you up to now albert einstein fumbled with his pipe leaned over to scratch his bare ankle and said you see robin perhaps your problem isnt psychoanalytic after all so perhaps id be a better person to handle it i sank back on the bed and closed my eyes in those old days when sigfrid and i went round and round every wednesday afternoon at four i sometimes came away thinking id scored points in the game i thought we were playing but id never ever had the experience of having him simply give up that was a real victory of a kind i had never expectedand of a kind that made me feel worse than ever i still felt like hell if my problem wasnt psychoanalytic then it was real and real i thought translated to insoluble i opened my eyes albert had been busy we werent in the twohour adultery special anymore we were in alberts plain old princeton study with the bottle of skrip on the desk and the blackboard full of indecipherable mathematics behind him nice place youve got here i said sourly if were back to playing games again games are real too robin he said earnestly i hope you dont mind my cutting in if you were just going to talk about tears and traumas dr von shrink would have been your best program but metaphysics is more my line metaphysics but thats what youve been talking about robin he said surprised didnt you know the nature of reality the meaning of life such things are not my main line or at least not the subjects for which my name became famous but i think i can help you if you dont mind and if i do why then you can dismiss me whenever you like he said mildly lets at least try i got up off the bedit had become a worn leather couch with the stuffing sticking out of one cushionand walked around the study shrugging one small shrug that meant all right what the hell you see he said you can be as real as you want to be robin i lifted a stack of journals off the chair by his desk and sat down to face him dont you mean i can be as good an imitation as i want to be we come to the turing test maybe if you are such a good imitation that you can fool even yourself isnt that a kind of reality for instance if you really want to have things like constipation and the common cold thats easy enough dr lavorovna and i can easily write into your program all the minor ills you like and montecarlo them so that they appear at randomhemorrhoids today perhaps and maybe tomorrow a wart on the side of your nose i cant believe youd really want that theyd still be ifiusions albert considered the matter then conceded in a certain sense yes i suppose they would but remember the turing test forgive my impertinence but when you and dr lavorovna are together dont you sometimes well make love you know damn well we do we just did is it any less pleasurable because it too as you would say is an illusion it is extremely pleasurable maybe thats whats wrong with it because damn it essie cant get pregnant ab he said just as essie had done oh is that really what you want i thought for a moment to be sure i dont exactly know its something ive thought of wanting sometimes but it isnt really impossible you know robin it would not even be very difficult to program dr lavorovna if she wished could surely write a program in which she would experience all the physical aspects of pregnancy even coming to term with an actual child robin actual that is in the sense that you yourself are actual he added hastily but in that same way it could be your and her child complete with a montecarloed assortment of your hereditary traits with a personality that would develop as you reared itthe product like all human beings of nature plus nurture with a dash of happenstance thrown in and when it grew up to be our age wed still be our age ak albert nodded satisfied we come now to growing old is that what you want because i should tell you he went on seriously that you will age robin not because anyone programs you to but because you must there will be transcription errors you will change and probably you will deteriorate oh you have a great deal of redundancy in your storage so the errors will not cumulate very quickly at least not in any large matters but in infinite timeoh yes robin the robinette broadhead of tentothetwentieth milliseconds from now will not be the same as the robinette broadhead of today oh wonderful i cried i cant die but i can grow old and feeble and stupid do you want to die i dont know i see said albert thoughtfully i covered my face in my hands as close to crying as i have been for a long time every bit of fear and depression and worry and selfdoubt was flooding in on me then and these stupid conversations were doing no good at all i see said the voice again but this time it wasnt albert einsteins voice it was deeper and huger and even before i looked up i knew whose voice it was oh god i whispered yes exactly god smiled if you have never happened to appear before the throne of judgment you probably dont really know what it would be like i didnt i only had hazy ideas of grandeur but the grandeur all around me was far grander than i had dreamed i had expected oh i dont knowawesome splendid frightening even it wasnt frightening but it was certainly all the other things the immense throne was gold i dont mean your tacky everyday common gold it was luminous warm even almost transparent gold it wasnt drab metal but the essence of goldenness made real the immense throne towered above me surrounded by drapes of pearly marble that looked as though phidias and praxiteles had joined forces to carve them the chair i sat in was warm carved ivory and i was wearing a white penitential shift staring straight up into the great and allseeing eyes of the almighty as i said it wasnt frightening i stood up and stretched nice illusion i complimented tell me god which one are you jehovah allah thor whose god are you yours robin rolled the majestic voice i smiled up at him but i dont actually have one you see ive always been an atheist the idea of a personal god is a childish one as was pointed out by my friendand doubtless your friend tooalbert einstein that does not matter robin im enough of a god even for an atheist you see i judge i have all the godly attributes i am the creator and the redeemer i am not merely good i am the standard by which goodness is measured youre judging me isnt that what gods are for for no real reason i was beginning to feel tense well buti mean what am i supposed to do here should i confess my sins examine every moment of my life well no robin god said reasonably actually youve been confessing and examining for the last hundred years or so theres no need to go through all that again but what if i dont want to be judged that doesnt matter either you see i do it anyhow this is my judgment he leaned forward gazing down at me with those sorrowful kind majestic loving eyes i couldnt help it i squirmed i find that you robinette broadhead he said are stubborn guiltridden easily distracted vain incomplete and often foolish and i am well pleased in you i wouldnt have you any other way against the foe you may well fail disgracefully because you often do but i know that you will do what you always do and i stammered and whats that why you will do the best you can and what more can even i ask so go forth robin and with you goes my blessing he raised his hands in a grand gesture of grace then his expression changed as he peered down at me you cannot say that god is annoyed but at least he looked displeased now whats the matter he demanded i said stubbornly im still discontented of course you are discontented god thundered i made you discontented because if you werent discontented why would you bother to try to become better better than what i asked trembling in spite of myself better than me cried god journeys end even the loneliest river winds somewhen to the sea and at lastat long lastat long long lastalbert appeared on the deck of the cruise ship simulation where essie and i were playing shuffleboard and pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say one minute to arrival i thought youd like to know we did like to know lets look at once essie cried and disappeared i took a little longer studying albert he was wearing a brassbuttoned blue blazer and a yachting cap and he smiled at me i still have a lot of questions you know i told him and unfortunately i have not nearly that many answers robin he said kindly thats good though whats good to have many questions as long as you know there are questions there is some hope of answering them he nodded approval in that way he has that would drive me right up the wall if it didnt make me feel so good he paused for a moment to see if we were going to get into metaphysics again and then added shall we join mrs broadhead and the general and his lady and the others theres plenty of time theres no doubt of that robin indeed there is plenty of time he smiled and i shrugged permission and the alaskan fjord disappeared we were back in the control cabin of the true love alberts jaunty cap was gone along with his natty blue blazer his slickeddown hair was flying in all directions again and he was back in his sweater and baggy pants and we were alone whered everybody go i demanded and then answered for myself they couldnt wait theyre scanning through the ships instruments but theres nothing to see yet he shrugged amiable agreement watching me as he puffed on his pipe albert knows that i dont really like looking directly through the ships skin sensors the good old viewscreen over the controls is usually good enough for me when you slide into the instrumentation of the true love and look in all directions at once it is a disorienting experienceespecially for people who still cling to their meatperson habits like me so i dont do it often what albert says is that its just one of my old meatperson hangups thats true i grew up as a meat person and meat people can only see in one direction at a time unless theyre crosseyed albert says i should get over it but i usually dont want to this time i did but not just yet a minute is after all quite a long stretch in gigabit time and there was still something i wanted to ask him albert told me a story once the story was about one of his old meattime buddies a mathematician named bertrand russell a lifelong atheist like albert himself of course my albert was not really that albert and so they werent actual buddies but albert often talked as though they were he said that once some religious person had cornered russell at a party and said professor russell dont you realize what a grave risk you are taking with your immortal soul suppose you have guessed wrong what will you do if when you die you find there really is a god and he really does call you to judgment and when you arrive at the throne of judgment he looks down on you and asks bertrand russell why did you not believe in me what will you say according to albert russell didnt turn a hair he simply replied i would say god you should have given me better evidence so when i said to albert do you really think youve given me enough evidence he simply nodded understanding the reference and leaned down to scratch his ankle and said i thought youd come back to that robin no i havent given you any evidence at all the only evidence one way or the other is in the universe itself then youre not god i burst out finally daring he said gravely i wondered when you were going to ask me that and i wonder when youre going to answer why right now robin he said patiently if you are asking if the display you interacted with came from the same datastores as the simulation i generally display why yes in that limited sense but if you are asking a larger question thats harder whats god more specifically what is your god robin no no i snarled im the one whos asking the questions here then i must try to answer for you mustnt i very well he pointed the pipestem at me i would take god in your sense to be a sort of vector sum of all the qualities you believe to be just and moral and loving and i suppose that among all sentient beings humans and heechee and machine intelligences and all there is a sort of consensus of what these virtuous things are and that a mutually shared god would be a sum of all the vectors does that answer your question not a bit he smiled again glancing at the viewscreen all it showed was the usual pebbly gray nothing of a ship in fasterthanlight travel i didnt think it would robin it doesnt satisfy me either but then the universe is not necessarily in business to make us happy now i opened my mouth to ask him the next question but it took me a moment to formulate it and by then he was ahead of me with your permission robin he said we are really almost back into normal space now and i am sure we would both like to look and he didnt wait for that permission he was gone but first he gave me one of those sweet sad compassionate smiles that like so much else about my very dear friend albert einstein drives me ape but of course he was right i showed him who was boss though i didnt follow right away i took oh maybe eight or nine milliseconds towell to do what essie would have called be gloopy but what i thought of as pondering what he had said there wasnt all that much to ponder or more accurately there was one hell of a huge lot to ponder but not enough detail to make pondering on it satisfactory maddening old albert if he made up his mind to play godeven an admitted imitation godhe could at least have been specific i mean that was what the rules called for when jehovah spoke to moses out of the burning bush when the angel morom handed over graven tabletsthey said what they expected i had i felt with aggravation a right to specifics from my very own source of all wisdom but i obviously wasnt going to get any so i sulkily followed just about in time the pebbly gray nothing was splotching and curdling even as i slid into the ships sensors and in only another millisecond or two the splotches froze up into sharp detail i could feel essies hand steal into mine as we looked in all directions at once the old vertigo hit me but i put it behind me there was too much to see more spectacular than the alaskan fjords more aweinspiring than anything i had ever perceived we were well out beyond the good old galaxy itselfnot just the friedegg galactic disk with its pearly lump of yolk in the middle but way out past even the tenuous halo below us was a thin scattering of halo stars like sparse little bubbles popping out of the galactic wine above was black velvet that someone had spilled tiny faint curls of luminous paint on very near to us were the bright lights of the watch wheel and off to one side were the dozen sulfuryellow blobs of the kugelblitz they didnt look dangerous they just looked nasty like some unattractive little mess left on a livingroom floor that somebody should get busy and clean up i wished i knew how to do that cried essie triumphantly look dear robin no hooligan jaws ships on wheel have beat them here and when i looked at the wheel it seemed she was right the wheel rolled silently in solitude not a single ship in its dock not a jaws cruiser anywhere around it but albert sighed im afraid not mrs broadhead what the hell are you talking about cassata demanded i couldnt see himnone of us were bothering with visual simulationsbut i could feel him bristling only that we have not beat them here general cassata said albert we really could not you know the true love is an admirable spacecraft but it does not have the speed of a jaws vessel if they are not here it is not that they have not yet arrived it is that they have been here and left already left where i barked he was silent for a moment then the vista before us began to swell albert was readjusting the ships sensors the below grew shadowy the abovethe direction toward the kugelblitz itselfgrew closer tell me said albert thoughtfully have you ever formed a visual impression of what it might be like when the foe came out i dont mean a rational conjecture i mean the sort of halfdozing fantasy a person might have imagining that moment albert he disregarded me i think he said that somewhere in everybody lurks a kind of primitive notion that they might suddenly erupt from the kugelblitz in a fleet of immense invulnerable space battleships conquering everything before them irresistible rays blazing missiles pouring out damn you albert i yelled he said somberly but robin see for yourself and as the magnification increased we did the last space fight even when you see for yourself you dont always believe what youre seeing i didnt it was insane but it was there the jaws ships in stl flight hurtling toward the kugelblitz and from the kugelblitz hurtling toward them little bits of somethings that spurted out of the swirling mustardcolored blurs the little somethings were not blurred at all they were bright metal they looked very much like spaceships there really could not be very much doubt of that we were at extreme range for such tiny objects but the true love had firstrate instrumentation what we saw we saw in optical and ir and xray and all the other photon frequencies there were and we saw it as well through magnetometers and graydetectors and all confirmed unmistakably the terrible fact the kugelblitz had launched an armada i might have expected almost anything else but not that i mean what use did the foe have for spaceships i could not answer that question but ships they were big ones armored ones a thousand and more of them it looked like and every one of them slipping into an immense cone formation and bearing directly down on the game tiny hopelessly outnumbered clutch of jaws cruisers blow their goddamn rocks off yelled general julio cassata and you know i yelled along with him i couldnt help it it was a fight and i was rooting for my side there was no doubt the fight had commenced you cant see rays in space not even the converted heechee digger rays that were the jaws fleets main armament but there were bright flashes of chemical explosions and worse startlingly visible as the jaws ships launched their secondary missiles the myriad foe vessels bored on they were untouched considered purely as spectacle it was my god tremendous even though at the same time it was terrifying even if i didnt know exactly what was going on it was my very first space battle for that matter it was everybody elses first too because the last fight between ships in space had been between the brazilians and the ships of the peoples republic of china nearly a century before in that last bloody and inconclusive struggle that led to the foundation of the multinational gateway authority so i was no expert on what should have happened next but what did happen was a lot less than i could have expected ships should have exploded or something bits and pieces of wreckage should have flown all over there wasnt any of that what happened was that the cone of foe ships opened up and surrounded the battling jaws vessels they englobed them and then they well what they did they vanished they just disappeared leaving the jaws cruisers huddled together in space and then the cruisers disappeared too and then just below us the watch wheel itself ffickered and was gone space was empty around us there was nothing to be seen except the pearly whirl of the galaxy below the distant external firefly galaxies the smoky yellow blobs of the kugelblitz we became visible to each other it was too lonesome otherwise we looked at each other uncomprehendingly i wondered if something like this might happen said albert einstein soberly sucking his pipe cassata roared damn you if you know whats going on tell us albert shrugged i think youll see for yourself he said because i imagine it will be our turn next and it was we looked at each other and then there was nothing else to see nothing outside the ship i mean nothing but the pebbly gray of fasterthanlight travel it was like looking out of an airplane window into dense fog and then it wasnt fog vanished the ships sensors could see clearly again and what we suddenly saw without warning was solid familiar black space and stars and even a planet and a moon and yes i knew what they were that planet and that moon were the ones human eyes had looked at for half a million years we were in orbit around the earth and so were a good many other artifacts i recognized as jaws cruisers and even the immense watch wheel itself it was more than i could handle i thought i knew what to do about that though because when things are too much for me there is always one thing i can do to get help i did it albert i cried but albert just went on gazing out at the earth and the moon and the other objects outside the true love and smoking his pipe and didnt answer back home albert einstein was not the only appliance that seemed to have stopped functioning the jaws ships had problems of their own every control system for weaponry of any kind had been simply fried they didnt work everything else was fully operational communications were fine and busy with everyone asking everyone else just what the hell had happened nothing nondestructive was damaged the lights on the wheel still worked and so did the airchangers the workthings prepared meals and tidied up spills the bunks in the commodores cabin in the jaws flagship continued to make themselves and the trash receptacles emptied themselves into the recycling pools the true love which had never had any arms was as good as new we could have started it and flown right off to anywhere at all but where should we go we went nowhere alicia lo took the controls and kept us in a safe orbit but that was it i didnt bother i was focused one hundred per cent on my faithful dataretrieval system and very dear friend i said desperately albert please he took the pipe out of his mouth and looked at me absently robin he said i must ask you to be patient for a while but albert i beg you whats going to happen next he gave me what is called an unfathomable lookat least i certainly couldnt fathom it please are we in danger are the foe going to come down and kill us all he looked astonished kill us what an idea robin after they met you and me and mrs broadhead and miss lo and general cassata no of course not robin but i must excuse myself im quite busy now and that was all he would say and after a while the shuttles began to come up from the launch loops and we had our datastores taken back down to the good old earth and we triedoh for a long time we triedto sort things out endings i didnt know how to begin this and now i find i dont know how to end it either you see that was the ending theres nothing else to tell except what happened i know that to linear meat ears that must sound odd just as so many of the other things i have said sounded odd i cant help that the odd cannot be expressed nonoddly and i have to tell it like it is what happened next didnt really matter because what happened had done so already of course even vastened folks like myself are somewhat linear and so it took us a while to find that out what essie and i wanted more than anything else we agreed was breathing spaceto rest up to try to find out just what was going on above all to collect our awry thoughts we actually had our physical datastores taken to the old house on the tappan sea the first time we had done that in a fairish number of years and we settled down to get our heads straight alberts datastore came with us albert himself was another question albert no longer responded to my call if albert was still in the datastore he did not show himself essie was not about to admit defeat from one of her own programs the first thing she did was to busy herself with program checks and debugging routines then essie gave up can find nothing wrong with albert einstein program she said except does not work she looked angrily at the datafan that had held albert einstein is only corpse she said fretfully is body whence the life has died you know what can we do i asked it was a rhetorical question i just was not used to having my machines fail me essie shrugged she offered a consolation prize can write new albert program for you she said i shook my head i didnt want a new program i wanted albert then she said practically can rest and cultivate our gardens how about nice swim and then scrumptious huge fattening lunch who can eat essie help me i want to know i complained i want to know what the hell he was talking about when he told us not to worrywhat do you and cassata and alicia lo have to do with it what do the three of you have in common she pursed her lips then she brightened how about ask them ask them what ask them all about selves invite them herethen can all have nice lunch it didnt happen quite that fast in the first place neither of them was physically on earth both were still in orbit i didnt want to settle for doppels because i didnt want even that infuriating quartersecond delay in the actual conversation so they had to be shipped to the tappan sea and that took a long time it took longer than that because for some reason cassata couldnt get away at first i didnt waste the time without albert life was a little harder for me that didnt make it really difficult because after all there was not much that albert could do that i couldnt do for myself if i had to now i had to so it was i not albert who roamed the world to see what was going on a lot was though not much of it seemed helpful to me there had been a flurry of panic at first jaws issued alarming tightlipped bulletins about the damage to its fleet and then even more alarming urgent demands to build a new fleet bigger and better than ever on the principle that if you try something that doesnt work you should keep on trying it forever but that in itself had a reassuringly normal sound the populace at large after that first shock of terror realized that after all no one was dead foe spaceships did not appear in the skies over san francisco and beijing to blast them to cinders our planet was not hurled into the sun nothing seemed to be happening at all in fact and slowly the panic trickled away people went back to their lives like any peasants on a volcano slope the mountain had erupted no one had been hurt it would erupt again to be surebut not yet a while pray god the institute scheduled a hundred new workshops pondering the events at the watch wheel half of them spent all their time analyzing and reanalyzing the battle between the foe ships and jaws there was not much to analyze what we had seen was what we knew there wasnt anything else there was nothing in any of the other sensory records to contradict or even to embellish what we had seen with our eyes the foe ships had come out and neutralized our cruisers then the foe had temperately picked us up and put us back in the playpen we belonged in that was all the workshops on the foe themselves argued and discussed but added nothing new panels of eminent scientists agreed that what they had thought all along was probably what they should go on thinking the foe had been born shortly after the big bang they had found the climate congenial when the weather got worsewhen matter intruded into their cosy soup of space and energythey resolved to change it they set the change in motion then returned to their kugelblitzes to wait patiently for a nicer day as to the brief engagement around the watch wheelwell if you woke a bear from hibernation he would probably swat at you out of irritation but then he would go back to hibernate and the swat of this particular disturbed bear had been really quite gentle oh yes there were plenty of speculationsgod were there ever speculations facts no there were not even any plausible theories or at least none that offered any useful prospects for experiments to test them out or that suggested any worthwhile steps to be taken everyone agreed that jawss plan for building a huger and fiercer fleet was probably a silly idea but as no one had a better one it looked as though that were likely to happen and when cassata and alicia lo were due to arrive i went into the datastore files and put my hand on alberts store and said please albert as a personal favor to me wont you tell me whats going on albert didnt answer but when i went into the drawing room to greet our guests there was a scrap of paper on my favorite chair it said robin im really sorry about all this but i cant interrupt what im doing just now youre doing the best you can arent you just carry on with love albert julio cassata was out of uniform againshirt shorts sandalsand he looked positively pleased to see me when i asked him about it he said oh its not you broadheadhe hadnt totally changedits just that that bastard was finally getting around to terminating me which bastard me naturallythe meat me doesnt like having copies of himself around wouldve done it long ago but he was busy with the rebuilding program hated to let me come down here because he was afraid youd get the institute to declare me essential or something i know a hint when i hear one so i said with some reservations right the institute does after all the institute could change its mind later on if it wanted to but after i had said that it did make him seem more human thanks he said and essie said lets go out on lanai is beautiful and i said what would you like to drink and all in all it was more like a little party than a workshop on justwhatthehellisfundamentallygoingon then i got down to it according to albert einstein the reason the foe arent going to kill us is because they encountered the three of you plus me and albert einstein not any other machinestored person just you three cassata and lo looked surprised then slightly flattered any idea why i asked then they only looked blank essie started out have been thinking about this she announced question is what do we three have in common to begin with are all machinestored but as robin points out so are umpteen zillion others not mentioned second thing am personally machine duplicate of still surving meat person so is julio im not said alicia lo yes said essie regretfully already know this checked first thing your meat body died of peritonitis eight years ago so thats not it third thing are all quite bright by standard measurements have all certain skills piotage navigation et ceterabut so here too have many many others have long since ruled out all obvious linkages so must dig deeper for instance am personally of russian heritage im americanhispanic black said cassata shaking his head and alicias chinese no good and im male but you two are female julio and i both used to play handball a lot alicia lo offered but it was essies turn to shake her head did not play such games in leningrad dont think athletic prowess would be of interest to foe anyway i said the trouble is we dont know what would interest them you are as so often right dear robin sighed essie hell wait can do this in less boring way you know im not in any real big hurry said cassata quickly thinking of what he would be when he was no longer essential did not say faster only less boring you people have more drinks maybe windsurf a little i will run up quick crosscheck program on all three stores matching subroutines is easy enough and will not interfere with other activities she grinned might tickle a little she added and was gone to her programming office and left me to be the host thats a congenial enough occupation for me i made them drinks i offered them the facilities of the house for entertainment which were considerableincluding a private bedroom which was what i had had at the back of my mind but which they didnt seem to require just then they were content just to sit and talk it was pleasant to be there and do that out on the lanai with the broad sea and the hills on the other shore in front of us and thats what we did i verified the fact that essie had once again made a shrewd character diagnosis doppelcassata was so much more tolerable than his meat original that i actually found myself listening with interest to his anecdotes and laughing at his jokes alicia lo was a doll i had not failed to notice that she was pretty slim and small and quick or that she had a naturally sweet personality i discovered that she was very well informed too as one of the last of the gateway prospectors she had taken her chances on four hairy science missions and after she was vastened she wandered all over the galaxy she had seen places i had explored only at second hand and a few i hadnt even heard of i was only beginning to have an idea of what she saw in julio cassata but i could easily see why cassata had fallen for her he was even beginning to be jealous when she talked about some of the shipmates shed gone out with from gateway he paid particular attention to the talk about the men i bet you made a big hit with them he said dourly alicia laughed didnt i wish that surprised me were they gays or maybe blind she said thanking me demurely for the implied compliment you dont know what i looked like then before my appendix burst i was tall and gawky andwell what they called me was the human heechee what you see isnt what i was born with mr broadhead she said speaking to me but looking at cassata to see how he would take it he took it well you look grand he said how come you died of appendicitis no doctors around there was full medical around and naturally they wanted to fix me up they even wanted to do cosmetic worktake out some of the excess bone in the spine and the limbs make some changes in the facei didnt want it julio i wanted to be really goodlooking not just the closest approximation they could manage there was only one way they had machine storage available i took that and from the corner of the lanai where it had been bending over to sniff at essies flowers a figure rose up and beamed at us now you know the reason it said essie i yelled come quick because the figure was albert einstein my god albert i said where have you been oh robin he said pleasantly have we come to metaphysics again not on purpose i sank down in a chair looking at him he had not changed the pipe was still unlit the socks down around his ankles the mop of hair flying in all directions and his manner was still oblique he came sedately up to take a seat on the rocker facing us but you see robin there are metaphysical answers to that question i was not any where and it is not merely i who is here i dont think i understand i said it wasnt entirely true i just hoped i didnt understand he said patiently i have accessed the foe robin more accurately they accessed me more precisely still he said apologetically the i who is now speaking to you is not your dataretrieval program albert einstein then who i demanded he smiled and by the smile i knew that i had after all understood him very well and not endings when i was a threeyearold child in wyoming i was not discouraged from believing in santa claus my mother never said to me that santa claus was real but she wouldnt tell me that he wasnt either in all my long life since there has never been a question that i wanted answered more badly than i did that question then i pondered it seriously especially toward the last half of the month of december i was burning to know i could not wait to grow upat least as far as say the teens because when i was that old i believed i would be wise enough to know the answer to that question for sure when i was an adolescent sickie in the nut wards of the hospital at the food mines the doctors told me i would eventually get well i would be able to deal with my fears and confusions i would be selfconfident sure of myselfat least enough so they promised that i could hold a job or anyway cross a street by myself i couldnt wait for that either when i was a shitscared prospector on gateway when i was a horrified survivor of the mission to a black hole when i was a sobbing mass of jelly on sigfrid von shrinks analysis couch when i was all those things i promised myself that sooner or later the time would come when i would be wiser and more sure when i was thirty i thought that might come at fifty when i was fifty i was positive it would happen by sixtyfive or so when i was seventy i thought that well at least when i died there would be anyway some sort of final resolution of all the worries and uncertainties and doubts and then when i was older than i had ever thought possible with all the worlds data available to me why i had the doubts and worries still then albert came back from the foe with all the knowledge they had given him and offered to share it with me and now what i want to know is how much older can i grow without feeling grown up at last and how much more can i learn without being wise at least i know now why i have trouble with endings its because there isnt any end to endlessness people like me dont have ends we dont have to the galaxy is our wrinkle rock and the reunion party goes on forever we have changes we have interludes when we do something else for a while maybe even a very long while we have ends to conversations but each end is a beginning of a new one and the beginnings never stop because that is what eternity means i can tell you about some of the ends as for example alberts conversation with essie i apologize to you mrs broadhead he said because i know it must have been upsetting for you to find a program of your own writing not responsive damn true she said indignantly but you see im no longer just your program part of me is now contributed by the others others what youve been calling the foe he explained what the heechee called the assassins they are certainly not assassins or at least oh essie interrupted can convince sluggards of this not to mention any other races benign creatures who are not assassins may have wiped out mrs broadhead he said gently what i was about to say was that they were not assassins on purpose the sluggards were made of matter it was not within the experience of weof these others that is to say to suspect that bound protons and electrons could possibly produce intelligence consider please suppose your grandfather had discovered that one of his primitive computers was doing something that might potentially at some time in the future have interfered with his own plans what would he have done smash it up essie agreed grandfather had one hellish short temper he would not i am sure albert smiled have considered that a machine intelligence might havewhat can i call it soul at any rate what we machine intelligences have sothe otherssmashed them up as you put it it was no problem for them they observed that most matter creatures enjoyed destruction so they simply encouraged them to do so to each other i put in are you saying that the assassins love us now that is not one of their terms albert said politely and actually youmyself included im afraidare rather rudimentary creatures by comparison but when it was discovered in a routine check that there were machinestored intelligences on the watch wheel an investigation was ordered he smiled again you passed the test so they do not wish to be foe to you they only wish that no one do anything to interfere with their planand he added seriously i do urge robin that you do your best to see that no one does you mean their plan to make the universe go back to where it started the plan to make a better one albert corrected ha said essie shaking her head better for them you mean i mean better for all of us albert smiled because by the time the expansion stops and the failback begins we will all be like they are we almost are already you knowthose of us who are machinestored at least thats why they were able to communicate with me holy smoke whispered my dear wife essie and i can tell you about his conversation with julio cassata you know of course albert said to him conversationally that weapons can never harm the others the foe and thats what were going to find out einstein albert puffed gravely on his pipe he shook his head dont you know why you must fail yet your very best hope is to find some way of destroying the kugelblitz that the watch wheel was set up to guard just outside our own galaxy tell me general cassata do you have any reason at all to believe that our galaxy is in any way special its got us in it cassata barked yes albert agreed it uniquely has us but what makes you think it uniquely has the foe do you suppose that our galaxy is special oh jesus albert cassata began if youre trying to tell me what i think youre trying to tell me thats exactly what im telling you general cassata the others were not concerned about a single galaxy it is the whole universe that they are planning to rebuild a universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies about almost all of which we know nothing at all yes of course he said desperately but we know theyre here because we know theyve intervened in this galaxy that said albert somberly is how we can be certain that they are not just here you cant possibly believe that only our galaxy is capable of evolving intelligent life any galaxy could perhaps even gas clouds in intergalactic space could if the others were intent on keeping organic intelligence from interfering with their project they would surely be wise enough to cover all the bases so even if we could wipe the kugelblitz out you cant but if you could said albert it would be like swatting one tsetse fly and thinking that encephalitis was wiped out forever he puffed smoke in silence for a while looking at julio cassata then he smiled thats the bad news he said the good news is that youre out of a job out of a unemployed yes albert nodded there is of course no further need for the joint assassin watch service which implies that it can no longer give orders which implies that you need not return to be terminated which implies that you are quite at liberty to remain in your present state indefinitely like the rest of us cassatas eyes went wide oh wow he said looking at alicia lo and i can tell you about alberts conversation with alicia lo im sorry if i was cryptic ms lo he began but when the others studied you on our flight to the watch wheel dr einstein i didnt know there were f were others with us on that flight he smiled neither did i at the time though of course i realize i should have presumed it they were there theyre here now in my program theyre anywhere they want to be ms lo and i suppose they will be for the indefinite future since we are very interesting to them you more than the rest of us me why me because you were a volunteer albert explained i had no choice i was created as a computer program and thats all i ever was robinette died machine storage was his only remaining option both gen eral cassata and mrs broadhead were doppels of living personsbut youwhy you chose machine storage you abandoned your material body deliberately just because my material body was sick and fairly ugly and because you perceived that machine storage was better albert said nodding and the others found that quite reassuring since it is better and they have little doubt that long before the question becomes critical all the rest of the human and heechee races will follow your example alicia lo looked at julio cassata she said the same thing he had said wow and i can tell you about alberts conversation with meor at least about one last part of it it was an ending that was also a beginning because he had something for me i do regret that i couldnt attend to your questions when you wanted me to robin he said but it wasnt possible while i was learning i said forgivingly i suppose it took a long time to learn everything they know everything oh robin i learned next to nothing do you have any idea how old they are and how much theyve learned no he said shaking his head i didnt learn the whole history of their race or how to go about causing a universe to fall back on itself in fact i didnt learn any of those practical things at all hell i said why not i didnt ask he said simply i thought that over i said well i suppose when the time is ripe theyll have all sorts of things to tell us i doubt that very much albert said why should they would you try to teach space navigation to a cat maybe some day when everyone has progressed to the next stage of evolution you mean like you i mean like us robin he said gently when all the humans and heechee who are alive decide to be more alive and permanently alive as we arethen maybe therell be a chance to carry on a real dialogue but for the next few million years i think theyll just leave us aloneif we leave them alone i shuddered that i said i will certainly be happy to do im glad said albert there was something about his voice that made me turn and look at him it wasnt alberts voice anymore it was another voice one that i had heard before and it wasnt albert speaking to me anymore it was someone quite different after all he added smiling the others are my children too so maybe i never will reach that wonderful time of wisdom and maturity when i know the answers to all the questions that continue to worry at me but maybe just to go on asking them is enough
