 prologue cameron quinn wasnt quite drunk he could get there if he put his mind to it but at the moment he preferred the nice comfortable buzz of the nearly there he liked to think it was just the twostepsshortofsloppy state that was holding his luck steady he believed absolutely in the ebb and flow of luck and right now his was flowing fast and hot just the day before hed raced his hydrofoil to victory in the world championship edging out the competition by the point of the bow and breaking the standing record for time and speed he had the glory and the hefty purse and hed taken both over to monte carlo to see how they held up they held up just dandy a few hands of baccarat a couple of rolls of the dice the turn of a card and his wallet weighed heavier between the paparazzi and a reporter from sports illustrated the glory showed no signs of dimming either fortune continued to smile no make that leer cameron thought by turning him toward that little jewel in the med at the same time that popular magazine was wrapping its swimsuitedition shoot and the leggiest of those longstemmed gifts from god had turned her highsummer blue eyes on him tipped her full pouty lips up in an invitational smile a blind man could have spotted and opted to stay on a few days longer and shed made it clear that with very little effort he could get a whole lot luckier champagne generous casinos mindless nostrings sex yes indeed cameron mused luck was definitely being his kind of lady when they stepped out of the casino into the balmy march night one of the ubiquitous paparazzi leaped out snapping frantically the woman pouted it was after all her trademark look but gave her endless mane of ribbonstraight silveryblond hair an artful toss and shifted her killer body expertly her redisthecolorofsin dress barely thicker than a coat of paint made an abrupt halt just south of the gates of paradise cameron just grinned theyre such pests she said with a hint of a lisp or a french accent cameron was never sure which she sighed testing the strength of that thin silk and let cameron guide her down the moondappled street every place i look is a camera im so weary of being viewed as an object for the pleasure of men oh yeah right he mused and because he figured the pair of them were as shallow as a dry creek after a drought he laughed and turned her into his arms why dont we give him something to splash on page one sugar he brought his mouth down to hers the taste of her tickled his hormones engaged his imagination and made him grateful their hotel was only two blocks away she skimmed her fingers up into his hair she liked a man with plenty of hair and his was full and thick and as dark as the night around them his body was hard all tough muscle and lean disciplined lines she was very choosy about the body of a potential lover and his more than met her strict requirements his hands were just a bit rougher than she liked not the pressure or movement of them that was lovely but the texture they were a working mans hands but she was willing to overlook their lack of class because of their skill his face was intriguing not pretty she would never be coupled much less allow herself to be photographed with a man prettier than she there was a toughness about his face a hardness that had to do with more than tanned skin tight over bones it was in the eyes she thought as she laughed lightly and wiggled free they were gray more the color of flint than smoke and they held secrets she enjoyed a man with secrets as none of them were able to keep them from her for long youre a bad boy cameron the accent was on the last syllable she tapped a finger against his mouth a mouth that held no softness whatsoever so ive always been told he had to think for a moment as her name skimmed along the edges of his memory martine maybe tonight ill let you be bad im counting on it sweetie he turned toward the hotel slanted a glance over at six feet she was nearly eye to eye with him my suite or yours yours she all but purred it perhaps if you order up another bottle of champagne ill let you try to seduce me cameron cocked an eyebrow asked for his key at the desk ill need a bottle of cristal two glasses and one red rose he told the clerk while keeping his eyes on martine right away yes monsieur quinn ill take care of it a rose she fluttered at him as they walked to the elevator how romantic oh did you want one too her puzzled smile warned him humor wasnt going to be her strong point so theyd forget the laughs and conversation he decided and shoot straight for the bottom line the minute the elevator doors closed them in he pulled her against him and met that sulky mouth with his own he was hungry hed been too busy too focused on his boat too angled in on the race to take any time for recreation he wanted soft skin fragrant skin curves generous curves a woman any woman as long as she was willing experienced and knew the boundary lines that made martine perfect she let out a moan that wasnt altogether feigned for his benefit then arched her throat for his nipping teeth you go fast he slid his hand down the silk up again thats how i make my living going fast every time every way still holding her he circled out of the elevator down the corridor to his rooms her heart was rapping hard against his her breath catching and her hands well he figured she knew just what she was doing with them so much for seduction he unlocked the door shoved it open then closed it by bracing martine against it he pushed the two stringwidth straps off her shoulders and with his eyes on hers helped himself to those magnificent breasts he decided her plastic surgeon deserved a medal you want slow yes the texture of his hands was rough but god exciting she brought one milelong leg up wrapped it around his waist he had to give her full marks for a sense of balance i want now good me too he reached up under her excuse for a skirt and ripped away the whisper of lace beneath her eyes went wide her breath thickened animal beast and she fastened her teeth in his throat even as he reached for his fly the knock sounded discreetly on the door behind her head every ounce of blood had drained out of his head to below his belt christ service cant be that good here leave it outside he demanded and prepared to take the magnificent martine against the door monsieur quinn i beg your pardon a fax just came for you it was marked urgent tell him to go away martine wrapped a hand around him like a clamp tell him to go to hell and fuck me hold on i mean he continued unwrapping her fingers before his eyes could cross wait just a minute he shifted her behind the door took a second to be sure he was zipped then opened it im sorry to disturb no problem thanks cameron dug in his pocket for a bill didnt bother to check the denomination and traded it for the envelope before the clerk could babble over the amount of the tip cameron shut the door in his face martine gave that famous head toss again youre more interested in a silly fax than me than this with an expert hand she tugged the dress down wiggling free of it like a snake shedding skin cameron decided whatever shed paid for that body it had been worth every penny no believe me baby im not thisll just take a second he ripped the envelope open before he could give in to the urge to ball it up toss it over his shoulder and dive headlong into all that female glory then he read the message and his world his life his heart stopped oh jesus goddamn all the wine cheerfully consumed throughout the evening swam giddily in his head churned in his stomach turned his knees to water he had to lean back against the door to steady himself before reading it again cam damn it why havent you returned a call weve been trying to reach you for hours dads in the hospital its bad as bad as it gets no time for details were losing him fast hurry phillip cameron lifted a hand one that had held the wheel of dozens of boats planes cars that raced one that could show a woman shuddery glimpses of heaven and the hand shook as he dragged it through his hair i have to go home you are home martine decided to give him another chance and stepped forward to rub her body over his no i have to go he nudged her aside and headed for the phone you have to go i need to make some calls you think you can tell me to go sorry rain check his mind just wouldnt engage absently he pulled bills out of his pocket with one hand picked up the phone with the other cab fare he said forgetting she was booked in the same hotel pig naked and furious she launched herself at him if he had been steady hed have dodged the blow but the slap connected and the quick swipe his ears rang his cheek stung and his patience snapped cameron simply locked his arms around her revolted when she took that as a sexual overture and carted her to the door he took the time to scoop up her dress then tossed both the woman and the silk into the hall her shriek rattled the teeth in his head as he threw the bolt ill kill you you pig you bastard ill kill you for this who do you think you are youre nothing nothing he left martine screaming and pounding at the door and went into the bedroom to throw a few necessities into a bag it looked like luck had just taken the nastiest of turns chapter one contents prev next cam called in markers pulled strings begged favors and threw money in a dozen directions hooking transportation from monaco to marylands eastern shore at one oclock in the morning wasnt an easy matter he drove to nice bulleting down the winding coastal highway to a small airstrip where a friend had agreed to fly him to paris for the nominal fee of a thousand american dollars in paris he chartered a plane for half again the going rate and spent the hours over the atlantic in a blur of fatigue and gnawing fear he arrived at washington dulles airport in virginia at just after six am eastern standard time the rental car was waiting so he began the drive to the chesapeake bay in the dark chill of predawn by the time he hit the bridge crossing the bay the sun was up and bright sparkling off the water glinting off boats already out for the days catch cam had spent a good part of his life sailing on the bay on the rivers and inlets of this part of the world the man he was racing to see had shown him much more than port and starboard whatever he had whatever hed done that he could take pride in he owed to raymond quinn hed been thirteen and racing toward hell when ray and stella quinn had plucked him out of the system his juvenile record was already a textbook study of the roots of the career criminal robbery breaking and entering underage drinking truancy assault vandalism malicious mischief hed done as hed pleased and even then had often enjoyed long runs of luck where he hadnt been caught but the luckiest moment of his life had been being caught thirteen years old skinny as a rail and still wearing the bruises from the last beating his father had administered theyd been out of beer what was a father to do on that hot summer night with the blood still drying on his face cam had promised himself he was never going back to that rundown trailer to that life to the man the system kept tossing him back to he was going somewhere anywhere maybe california maybe mexico his dreams had been big even if his vision courtesy of a blackened eye was blurry he had fiftysix dollars and some loose change the clothes on his back and a pisspoor attitude what he needed he decided was transportation he copped a ride in the cargo car of a train heading out of baltimore he didnt know where it was going and didnt care as long as it was away huddled in the dark his body weeping at every bump he promised himself hed kill or hed die before he went back when he crept off the train he smelled water and fish and he wished to god hed thought to grab some food somewhere his stomach was screamingly empty dizzy and disoriented he began to walk there wasnt much there a twobit little town that had rolled up its streets for the night boats bumping at sagging docks if his mind had been clear he might have considered breaking into one of the shops that lined the water front but it didnt occur to him until he had passed through town and found himself skirting a marsh the marshs shadows and sounds gave him the willies the sun was beginning to break through the eastern sky turning those muddy flats and that high wet grass gold a huge white bird rose up making cams heart skip hed never seen a heron before and he thought it looked like something out of a book a madeup one but the wings flashed and the bird soared for reasons he couldnt name he followed it along the edge of the marsh until it disappeared into thick trees he lost track of how far and what direction but instinct told him to keep to a narrow country road where he could easily tuck himself into the high grass or behind a tree if a blackandwhite cruised by he badly wanted to find shelter somewhere he could curl up and sleep sleep away the pangs of hunger and the greasy nausea as the sun rose higher the air grew thick with heat his shirt stuck to his back his feet began to weep he saw the car first a glossy white vette all power and grace sitting like a grand prize in the misty light of dawn there was a pickup beside it rusted rugged and ridiculously rural beside the arrogant sophistication of the car cam crouched down behind a lushly blooming hydrangea and studied it lusted after it the son of a bitch would get him to mexico all right and anywhere else he wanted to go shit the way a machine like that would move hed be halfway there before anybody knew it was gone he shifted blinked hard to clear his wavering vision and stared at the house it always amazed him that people lived so neatly in tidy houses with painted shutters flowers and trimmed bushes in the yard rockers on the front porch screens on the windows the house seemed huge to him a modern white palace with soft blue trim theyd be rich he decided as resentment ground in his stomach along with hunger they could afford fancy houses and fancy cars and fancy lives and a part of him a part nurtured by a man who lived on hate and budweiser wanted to destroy to beat all the bushes flat to break all the shiny windows and gouge the pretty painted wood to splinters he wanted to hurt them somehow for having everything while he had nothing but as he rose the bitter fury wavered into sick dizziness he clamped down on it clenching his teeth until they too ached but his head cleared let the rich bastards sleep he thought hed just relieve them of the hot car wasnt even locked he noted and snorted at their ignorance as he eased the door open one of the more useful skills his father had passed on to him was how to hotwire a car quickly and quietly such a skill came in very handy when a man made the best part of his living selling stolen cars to chop shops cam leaned in shimmied under the wheel and got to work it takes balls to steal a mans car right out of his own driveway before cam could react even so much as swear a hand hooked into the back of his jeans and hauled him up and out he swung out and his bunched fist seemed to bounce off rock he got his first look at the mighty quinn the man was huge at least sixfive and built like the offensive line of the baltimore colts his face was weathered and wide with a thick shock of blond hair that glinted with silver surrounding it his eyes were piercingly blue and hotly annoyed then they narrowed it didnt take much to hold the boy in place he couldnt have weighed a hundred pounds quinn thought if hed fished the kid out of the bay his face was filthy and badly battered one eye was nearly swollen shut while the other dark slate gray held a bitterness no child should feel there was blood dried on the mouth that managed to sneer despite it pity and anger stirred in him but he kept his grip firm this rabbit he knew would run looks like you came out on the wrong end of the tussle son get your fucking hands off me i wasnt doing nothing ray merely lifted a brow you were in my wifes new car at just past seven on a saturday morning i was just looking for some loose change whats the big fucking deal you dont want to get in the habit of overusing the word fuck as an adjective youll miss the vast variety of its uses the mildly tutorial tone was well over cams head look jack i was just hoping for a couple bucks in quarters you wouldnt miss it no but stella would have dearly missed this car if youd finished hotwiring it and my name isnt jack its ray now the way i figure it youve got a couple of choices lets outline number one i haul your sorry butt into the house and call the cops how do you feel about doing the next few years in a juvenile facility for badasses whatever color cam had left in his face drained away his empty stomach heaved his palms suddenly covered in sweat he couldnt stand a cage was sure he would die in a cage i said i wasnt stealing the goddamn car its a fourspeed how the hell am i supposed to drive a fourspeed oh i have a feeling youd manage just fine ray puffed out his cheeks considered blew out air now choice number two ray what are you doing out there with that boy ray glanced toward the porch where a woman with wild red hair and a ratty blue robe stood with her hands on her hips just discussing some life choices he was stealing your car well for heavens sake somebody beat the crap out of him recently id say well stella quinns sigh could be heard clearly across the dewy green lawn bring him in and ill take a look at him hell of a way to start the morning hell of a way no you get inside there idiot dog fine one you are never one bark when my cars being stolen my wife stella rays smile spread and glowed she just gave you choice number two hungry the voice was buzzing in cams head a dog was barking in high delighted yips from miles and miles away birds sang shrilly and much too close by his skin went brutally hot then brutally cold and he went blind steady there son ill get you he fell into the oily black and never heard rays quiet oath when he woke he was lying on a firm mattress in a room where the breeze ruffled the sheer curtains and carried in the scent of flowers and water humiliation and panic rose up in him even as he tried to sit up hands held him down just lie still a minute he saw the long thin face of the woman who leaned over him poking prodding there were thousands of gold freckles over it which for some reason he found fascinating her eyes were dark green and frowning her mouth was set in a thin serious line shed scraped back her hair and she smelled faintly of dusting powder cam realized abruptly that hed been stripped down to his tattered jockeys the humiliation and panic exploded get the hell away from me his voice came out in a croak of terror infuriating him relax now relax im a doctor look at me stella leaned her face closer look at me now tell me your name his heart thundered in his chest john smith i imagine she said dryly well if you have the presence of mind to lie youre not doing too badly she shined a light in his eyes grunted id say youve got yourself a mild concussion how many times have you passed out since you were beat up that was the first he felt himself coloring under her unblinking stare and struggled not to squirm i think im not sure i have to go yes you do to the hospital no terror gave him the strength to grab her arm before she could rise if he ended up in the hospital there would be questions with questions came cops with cops came the social workers and somehow before it was over hed end up back in that trailer that stank of stale beer and piss with a man who found his greatest relief in pounding on a boy half his size im not going to any hospital im not just give me my clothes ive got some money ill pay you for the trouble i have to go she sighed again tell me your name your real one cam cameron cam who did this to you i dont dont lie to me she snapped and he couldnt his fear was too huge and his head was starting to throb so fiercely he could barely stop the whimper my father why because he likes to stella pressed her fingers against her eyes then lowered her hands and looked out of the window she could see the water blue as summer the trees thick with leaves and the sky cloudless and lovely and in such a fine world she thought there were parents who beat their children because they liked to because they could because they were there all right well take this one step at a time youve been dizzy experienced blurred vision cautious cam nodded maybe some but i havent eaten in a while rays down taking care of that better in the kitchen than me your ribs are bruised but theyre not broken the eyes the worst of it she murmured touching a gentle finger to the swelling we can treat that here well clean you up and doctor you and see how you do i am a doctor she told him again and smiled as her hand blissfully cool smoothed his hair back a pediatrician thats a kid doctor you still qualify tough guy if i dont like how you do youre going in for xrays she reached into her bag for antiseptic this is going to sting a little he winced sucked in his breath as she began to treat his face why are you doing this she couldnt stop herself with her free hand she brushed back a messy shock of his dark hair because i like to theyd kept him it had been as simple as that cam thought now or so it had seemed to him at the time he hadnt realized until years later how much work effort and money theyd invested in first fostering then adopting him theyd given him their home their name and everything worthwhile in his life theyd lost stella nearly eight years ago to a cancer that had snuck into her body and eaten away at it some of the light had gone out of that house on the outskirts of the little water town of st christophers and out of ray out of cam and out of the two other lost boys theyd made their own cam had gone racing anything anywhere now he was racing home to the only man hed ever considered his father hed been to this hospital countless times when his mother had been on staff and then when shed been in treatment for the thing that killed her he walked in now punchy and panicked and asked for raymond quinn at the admissions desk hes in intensive care family only im his son cameron turned away and headed for the elevator he didnt have to be told what floor he knew too well he saw phillip the moment the doors opened onto icu how bad phillip handed over one of the two cups of coffee he held his face was pale with fatigue his normally wellgroomed tawny hair tousled by his hands his long somewhat angelic face was roughened by stubble and his eyes a pale golden brown shadowed with exhaustion i wasnt sure youd make it its bad cam christ ive got to sit down a minute he stepped into a small waiting area and dropped into a chair the can of coke in the pocket of his tailored suit clunked for a moment he stared blindly at the morning show running brightly on the tv screen what happened cam demanded where is he what do the doctors say he was heading home from baltimore at least ethan thinks hed gone to baltimore for something he hit a telephone pole dead on he pressed the heel of his hand to his heart because it ached every time he pictured it they say maybe he had a heart attack or a stroke and lost control but theyre not sure yet he was driving fast too fast he had to close his eyes because his stomach kept trying to jump into his throat too fast he repeated it took them nearly an hour to cut him out of the wreck nearly an hour the paramedics said he was conscious on and off it was just a couple miles from here he remembered the coke in his pocket opened the can and drank he kept trying to block the image out of his head to concentrate on the now and the what happened next they got ahold of ethan pretty quick phillip continued when he got here dad was in surgery hes in a coma now he looked up met his brothers eyes they dont expect him to come out of it thats bullshit hes strong as an ox they said phillip closed his eyes again his head felt empty and he had to search for every thought massive trauma brain damage internal injuries hes on life support the surgeon he dads a registered organ donor fuck that cams voice was low and furious do you think i want to consider it phillip rose now a tall rangy man in a wrinkled thousanddollar suit they said its a matter of hours at most the machines are keeping him breathing goddamn it cam you know how mom and dad talked about this when she got sick no extreme measures they made living wills and were ignoring his because because we cant stand not to you want to pull the plug cam reached out grabbed phillip by the lapels you want to pull the goddamn plug on him weary and sick at heart phillip shook his head id rather cut my hand off i dont want to lose him any more than you do youd better see for yourself he turned led the way down the corridor where the scent was hopelessness not quite masked by antiseptics they moved through double doors past a nurses station past small glassfronted rooms where machines beeped and hope hung stubbornly on ethan was sitting in a chair by the bed when they walked in his big calloused hand was through the guard and covering rays his tall wiry body was bent over as if hed been talking to the unconscious man in the bed beside him he stood up slowly and with eyes bruised from lack of sleep studied cam so you decided to put in an appearance strike up the band i got here as soon as i could he didnt want to admit it didnt want to believe it the man the old terrifyingly frail man lying in the narrow bed was his father ray quinn was huge strong invincible but the man with his fathers face was shrunken pale and still as death dad he moved to the side of the bed leaned down close its cam im here he waited somehow sure it would take only that for his fathers eyes to open to wink slyly but there was no movement and no sound except the monotonous beep of the machines i want to talk to his doctor garcia ethan scrubbed his hands over his face back into his sunbleached hair the brain cutter mom used to call magic hands the nursell page him cam straightened and for the first time he noticed the boy curled up asleep in a chair in the corner whos the kid the latest of ray quinns lost boys ethan managed a small smile normally it would have softened his serious face warmed the patient blue eyes he told you about him seth dad took him on about three months ago he started to say more but caught phillips warning look and shrugged well get into that later phillip stood at the foot of the bed rocking back and forth on his heels so how was monte carlo at cams blank stare he shrugged his shoulder it was a gesture all three of them used in lieu of words the nurse said that we should talk to him to each other that maybe he can they dont know for sure it was fine cam sat and mirrored ethan by reaching for rays hand through the bed guard because the hand was limp and lifeless he held it gently and willed it to squeeze his own i won a bundle in the casinos and had a very hot french model in my suite when your fax came through he shifted spoke directly to ray you should have seen her she was incredible legs up to her ears gorgeous manmade breasts did she have a face ethan asked dryly one that went just fine with the body i tell you she was a killer and when i said i had to leave she got just a little bitchy he tapped his face where the scratches scored his cheek i had to toss her out of the room into the hall before she tore me to ribbons but i did remember to toss her dress out after her she was naked phillip wanted to know as a jay phillip grinned then had his first laugh in nearly twenty hours god leave it to you he laid his hand over rays foot needing the connection hell love that story in the corner seth pretended to be asleep hed heard cam come in he knew who he was ray had talked about cameron a lot he had two thick scrapbooks filled to busting with clippings and articles and photos of his races and exploits he didnt look so tough and important now seth decided the guy looked sick and pale and holloweyed hed make up his own mind about what he thought of cameron quinn he liked ethan well enough though the mand work your butt raw if you went out oystering or clamming with him he didnt preach all the time and hed never once delivered a blow or a backhand even when seth had made mistakes and he fit seths tenyearold view of a sailor pretty well rugged tanned thick curling hair with streaks of blond in the brown hard muscles salty talk yeah seth liked him well enough he didnt mind phillip he was usually all pressed and polished seth figured the guy must have six million ties though he couldnt imagine why a man would want even one but phillip had some sort of fancy job in a fancy office in baltimore advertising coming up with slick ideas to sell things to people who probably didnt need them anyway seth figured it was a pretty cool way to run a con now cam he was the one who went for the flash who lived on the edge and took the risks no he didnt look so tough he didnt look like such a badass then cam turned his head and his eyes locked onto seths held there unblinking and direct until seth felt his stomach quiver to escape he simply closed his eyes and imagined himself back at the house by the water throwing sticks for the clumsy puppy ray called foolish knowing the boy was awake and aware of his gaze cam continued to study him goodlooking kid he decided with a mop of sandy hair and a body that was just starting to go gangly if he grew into his feet hed be a tall one before he was finished sprouting he had a kissmyass chin cam observed and a sulky mouth in the pretense of sleep he managed to look harmless as a puppy and just about as cute but the eyes cam had recognized that edge in them that animal wariness hed seen it often enough in the mirror he hadnt been able to make out the color but theyd been dark blue or brown he imagined shouldnt we park the kid somewhere else ethan glanced over hes fine here nobody to leave him with anyhow on his own hed just look for trouble cam shrugged looked away and forgot him i want to talk to garcia theyve got to have test results or something he drives like a pro so if he had a heart attack or a stroke his voice trailed off it was simply too much to contemplate we need to know standing around here isnt helping you need to do something ethan said his soft voice a sign of suppressed temper you go on and do it being here counts he stared at his brother across rays unconscious form its always what counted some of us didnt want to dredge for oysters or spend our lives checking crab pots cam shot back they gave us a life and expected us to do what we wanted with it so you did what you wanted we all did phillip put in if something was wrong with dad the last few months ethan you should have told us how the hell was i supposed to know but he had known something just hadnt been able to put his finger on it and had let it slide that ate at him now as he sat listening to the machines that kept his father breathing because you were there cam told him yeah i was there and you werent not for years and if id stayed on st chris he wouldnt have run into a damn telephone pole christ cam dragged his hands through his hair that makes sense if youd been around if either of you had he wouldnt have tried to do so much on his own every time i turned around he was up on a damn ladder or pushing a wheelbarrow or painting his boat and hes still teaching three days a week at the college tutoring grading papers hes almost seventy for christs sake hes only sixtyseven phillip felt a hard iceedged chill claw through him and hes always been healthy as a team of horses not lately he hasnt hes been losing weight and looking tired and wornout you saw it for yourself all right all right phillip scrubbed his hands over his face felt the scrape of a days growth of beard so maybe he should have been slowing down a little taking on the kid was probably too much but there wasnt any talking him out of it always squabbling the voice weak and slurred caused all three men to jolt to attention dad ethan leaned forward first his heart fluttering in his chest ill get the doctor no stay ray mumbled before phillip could rush out of the room it was a hideous effort this coming back even for a moment and ray understood he had moments only already his mind and body seemed separate things though he could feel the pressure of hands on his hands hear the sound of his sons voices and the fear and anger in them he was tired oh god so tired and he wanted stella but before he left he had one last duty here the lids seemed to weigh several pounds apiece but he forced his eyes to open struggled to focus his sons he thought three wonderful gifts of fate hed done his best by them tried to show them how to become men now he needed them for one more needed them to stay a unit without him and tend the child the boy even the words had weight it made him wince to push them from mind to lips the boys mine yours now keep the boy whatever happens you see to him cam youll understand him best the big hand once so strong and vital tried desperately to squeeze your word on it well take care of him at that moment cam would have promised to drag down the moon and stars well take care of him until youre on your feet again ethan ray sucked in another breath that wheezed through the respirator hell need your patience your heart youre a fine waterman because of them dont worry about seth well look after him phillip right here he moved closer bending low were all right here such good brains youll figure how to make it all work dont let the boy go youre brothers remember youre brothers so proud of you all of you quinns he smiled a little and stopped fighting you have to let me go now im getting the doctor panicked phillip rushed out of the room while cam and ethan tried to will their father back to consciousness no one noticed the boy who stayed curled in the chair his eyes squeezed tightly shut against hot tears chapter two contents prev next they came alone and in crowds to wake and to bury ray quinn hed been more than a resident of the dot on the map known as st christophers hed been teacher and friend and confidant in years when the oyster crop was lean hed helped organize fundraisers or had suddenly found dozens of odd jobs that needed to be done to tide the watermen over a hard winter if a student was struggling ray found a way to carve out an extra hour for a oneonone his literature classes at the university had always been filled and it was rare for one to forget professor quinn hed believed in community and that belief had been both strong and supple in deed he had realized that most vital of humanities he had touched lives and he had raised three boys that no one had wanted into men they had left his gravesite buried in flowers and tears so when the whispering and wondering began it was most often hushed quickly few wanted to hear any gossip that reflected poorly on ray quinn or so they said even as their ears twitched to catch the murmurs sexual scandals adultery illegitimate child suicide ridiculous impossible most said so and meant it but others leaned a bit closer to catch every whisper knit their brows and passed the rumor from lip to ear cam heard none of the whispers his grief was so huge so monstrous he could barely hear his own black thoughts when his mother had died hed handled it hed been prepared for it had watched her suffer and had prayed for it to end but this loss had been too quick too arbitrary and there was no cancer to blame for it there were too many people in the house people who wanted to offer sympathy or share memories he didnt want their memories couldnt face them until hed dealt with his own he sat alone on the dock that hed helped ray repair a dozen times over the years beside him was the pretty twentyfourfoot sloop theyd all sailed in countless times cam remembered the rig ray had had that first summer a little sunfish an aluminum catboat that had looked about as big as a cork to cam and how patiently ray had taught him how to sail how to handle the rigging how to tack the thrill cam thought now of the first time ray had let him handle the tiller it had been a lifealtering experience for a boy whod grown up on hard streets salty air in his face wind snapping the white canvas the speed and freedom of gliding over water but most of all it had been the trust here ray had said see what you can do with her maybe it had been that one moment on that hazy afternoon when the leaves were so full and green and the sun already a whitehot ball behind the mist that had turned the boy toward the man he was now and ray had done it with a grin he heard the footsteps on the dock but didnt turn he continued to look out over the water as phillip stood beside him most everybodys gone good phillip slipped his hands into his pockets they came for dad hed have appreciated it yeah tired cam pressed his fingers to his eyes let them drop he would have i ran out of things to say and ways to say them yeah though he made his living with clever words phillip understood exactly he took a moment to enjoy the silence the breeze off the water had a bit of a bite and that was a relief after the crowded house overheated with bodies grace is cleaning up in the kitchen seths giving her a hand i think hes got a case on her she looks good cam struggled to shift his mind to someone else anything else hard to imagine her with a kid of her own shes divorced right a year or two ago he took off right before little aubrey was born phillip blew out a breath between his teeth weve got some things to deal with cam cam recognized the tone and the tone meant it was time for business resentment bubbled up instantly i was thinking of taking a sail theres a good wind today you can sail later cam turned his head face bland i can sail now theres a rumor going around that dad committed suicide cams face went blank then filled with redhot rage what the fuck is this he demanded as he shot to his feet there phillip thought with dark satisfaction that got your attention theres some speculation that he aimed for the pole thats just pure bullshit who the hells saying that its going around and some of its rooting it has to do with seth what has to do with seth cam began to pace long furious strides up and down the narrow dock what do they think he was crazy for taking the kid on hell he was crazy for taking any of us on but what does that have to do with an accident theres some talk brewing that seth is his son by blood that stopped cam dead in his tracks mom couldnt have kids i know that fury pounded in his chest a hammer on steel youre saying that he cheated on her that he went off with some other woman and got a kid jesus christ phil im not saying it cam stepped closer until they were face to face what the hell are you saying im telling you what i heard phillip said evenly so we can deal with it if you had any balls youd have decked whoever said it in their lying mouth like you want to deck me now is that your way of handling it just beat on it until it goes away with his own temper bubbling phillip shoved cam back an inch he was my father too goddamn it you were the first but you werent the only then why the hell werent you standing up for him instead of listening to that garbage afraid to get your hands dirty ruin your manicure if you werent such a damn pussy youd have phillips fist shot out caught cam neatly on the jaw there was enough force behind the punch to snap cams head back send him staggering for a foot or two but he regained his balance quickly enough with eyes dark and eager he nodded well then come on hot blood roaring in his head phillip started to strip off his jacket attack came swiftly quietly and from behind he barely had time to curse before he was sailing off the dock and into the water phillip surfaced spat and shoved the wet hair out of his eyes son of a bitch you son of a bitch ethan had his thumbs tucked in his front pockets now and studied his brother as phillip treaded water cool off he suggested mildly this suit is hugo boss phillip managed as he kicked toward the dock that dont mean shit to me ethan glanced over at cam mean anything to you means hes going to have a hell of a drycleaning bill you too ethan said and shoved cam off the dock this isnt the time or place to go punching each other so when the pair of you haul your butts out and dry off well talk this through i sent seth on with grace for a while eyes narrowed cam skimmed his hair back with his fingers so youre in charge all of a sudden looks to me like im the only one who kept his head above water with this ethan turned and sauntered back toward the house together cam and phillip gripped the edge of the dock they exchanged one long hard look before cam sighed well throw him in later he said accepting the apology phillip nodded he pulled himself up on the dock and sat dragging off his ruined silk tie i loved him too as much as you did as much as anyone could yeah cam yanked off his shoes i cant stand it it was a hard admission from a man whod chosen to live on the edge i didnt want to be there today i didnt want to stand there and watch them put him in the ground you were there thats all that would have mattered to him cam peeled off his socks his tie his jacket felt the chill of early spring who told you about who said those things about dad grace shes been hearing talk and thought it best that we knew what was being said she told ethan and me this morning and she cried phillip lifted a brow still think i should have decked her cam heaved his ruined shoes onto the lawn i want to know who started this and why have you looked at seth cam the wind was getting into his bones that was why he suddenly wanted to shudder sure i looked at him cam turned headed for the house take a closer look phillip murmured when cam walked into the kitchen twenty minutes later warm and dry in a sweater and jeans ethan had coffee hot and whiskey ready it was a big familystyle kitchen with a long wooden table in the center the white countertops showed a bit of age the wear and tear of use thered been talk a few years back of replacing the aging stove then stella had gotten sick and that had been the end of that there was a big shallow bowl on the table that ethan had made in his junior year in high school wood shop it had sat there since the day hed brought it home and was often filled with letters and notes and household flotsam rather than the fruit it had been designed for three wide curtainless windows ranged along the back wall opening the room up to the yard and the water beyond it the cabinet doors were glassfronted and the dishes inside plain white stoneware meticulously arranged as would be cam thought the contents of all the drawers stella had insisted on that when she wanted a spoon by god she didnt want to search for one but the refrigerator was covered with photos and newspaper clippings notes postcards childrens drawings all haphazardly affixed with multicolored magnets it gave his heart a hitch to step into that room and know his parents wouldnt ever again be there coffees strong ethan commented sos the whiskey take your choice ill have both cam poured a mug added a shot of johnnie walker to the coffee then sat you want to take a swing at me too i did may again ethan decided he wanted his whiskey alone and neat and poured a double dont much feel like it now he stood by the window looking out the untouched whiskey in his hand maybe i still think you should have been here more the last few years maybe you couldnt be it doesnt seem to matter now im not a waterman ethan i do what im good at thats what they expected yeah he couldnt imagine the need to run from the place that was home and sanctuary and love but there was no point in questioning it or in holding on to resentments or he admitted casting blame the place needs some work i noticed i should have made more time to come around and see to things you always figure theres going to be plenty of time to go around then theres not the back steps are rotting out need replacing i kept meaning to he turned as phillip came into the room grace has to work tonight so she cant keep seth occupied for more than a couple hours you lay it out phil itll take me too long all right phillip poured coffee left the whiskey alone rather than sit he leaned back against the counter it seems a woman came to see dad a few months back she went to the college caused a little trouble that nobody paid much attention to at the time what kind of trouble caused a scene in his office a lot of shouting and crying on her part then she went to see the dean and tried to file sexual molestation charges against dad thats a crock the dean apparently thought so too phillip poured a second cup of coffee and this time brought it to the table she claimed dad had harassed and molested her while she was a student but there was no record of her ever being a student at the college then she said shed just been auditing his class because she couldnt afford full tuition but nobody could verify that either dads rep stood up to it and it seemed to go away he was pretty shaken ethan put in he wouldnt talk to me about it wouldnt talk to anybody then he went away for about a week told me he was going down to florida to do some fishing he came back with seth youre trying to tell me people think the kids his for christs sake that he had something going on with this bimbo who waits what ten twelve years to complain about it nobody thought too much of it then phillip put in he had a history of bringing strays home but then there was the money what money he wrote checks one for ten thousand dollars another for five and another for ten over the last three months all to gloria delauter somebody at the bank noticed and mumbled to somebody else because gloria delauter was the name of the woman whod tried to hang him up on the sexual misconduct charges why the hell didnt somebody tell me what was going on around here i didnt find out about the money until a few weeks ago ethan stared down into his whiskey then decided it would do him more good inside than out he downed it hissed once when i asked him about it he just told me the boy was what was important not to worry as soon as everything was settled hed explain he asked me for some time and he looked so defenseless you dont know what it was like seeing him scared and old and fragile you didnt see him you werent here to see him so i waited whiskey and guilt paired with resentment and grief to burn a hole inside him and i was wrong shaken cam pushed back from the table you think he was paying blackmail that he diddled some student a dozen years ago and knocked her up and now he was paying so shed keep quiet so shed hand over the kid for him to raise im telling you what was and what i know ethans voice was even his eyes steady not what i think i dont know what i think phillip said quietly but i know seths got his eyes you only have to look at him cam no way he fucked with a student and no way he cheated on mom i dont want to believe it phillip set down his mug but he was human he could have made a mistake one of them had to be realistic and he decided he was elected if he did im not going to condemn him for it what we have to do is figure out how to do what he asked we have to find a way to keep seth i can find out if he started adoption proceedings they couldnt be final yet were going to need a lawyer i want to find out more about this gloria delauter deliberately cam unclenched his fists before he could use them on something or someone i want to know who the hell she is where the hell she is up to you phillip shrugged his shoulders personally i dont want to get near her whats this suicide crap phillip and ethan exchanged a look then ethan rose and walked to a kitchen drawer he pulled it open took out a large sealed bag it hurt him to hold it and he saw by the way cams eyes darkened that cam recognized the worn green enameled shamrock key ring as their fathers this is what was inside the car after the accident he opened it took out an envelope the white paper was stained with dried blood i guess somebody one of the cops the tow truck operator maybe one of the paramedics looked inside and read the letter and they didnt trouble to keep it to themselves its from her ethan tapped out the letter held it out to cam delauter the postmarks baltimore he was coming back from baltimore with dread cam unfolded the letter the handwriting was a large loopy scrawl quinn im tired of playing nickel and dime you want the kid so bad then its time to pay for him meet me where you picked him up well make it monday morning the blocks pretty quiet then eleven oclock bring a hundred and fifty thousand in cash cash money quinn and no discounts you dont come through with every penny im taking the kid back remember i can pull the plug on the adoption any time i want a hundred and fifty grands a pretty good bargain for a goodlooking boy like seth bring the money and im gone youve got my word on it gloria she was selling him cam murmured like he was a he stopped himself looked up sharply at ethan as he remembered ethan had once been sold as well by his own mother to men who preferred young boys im sorry ethan i live with it he said simply mom and dad made sure i could shes not going to get seth back whatever it takes she wont get her hands on him we dont know if he paid her he emptied his bank account here phillip put in from what i can tell and i havent gone over his papers in detail yet he closed out his regular savings cashed in his cds he only had a day to get the cash that would have come to about a hundred thousand i dont know if he had fifty more if he had time to liquidate it if he did she wouldnt have gone away hed have known that cam put the letter down wiped his hands on his jeans as if to clean them so people are whispering that he killed himself in what shame panic despair he wouldnt have left the kid alone he didnt ethan moved to the coffeepot he left him with us how the hell are we supposed to keep him cam sat again whos going to let us adopt anybody well find a way ethan poured coffee added enough sugar to make phillip wince in reaction hes ours now what the hell are we going to do with him put him in school put a roof over his head food in his belly and try to give him something of what we were given he brought the pot over topped off cams coffee you got an argument couple dozen but none of them get past the fact that we gave our word we agree on that anyway frowning phillip drummed his fingers on the table but weve left out one pretty vital point none of us knows what seths going to have to say about it he might not want to stay here he might not want to stay with us youre just looking to complicate things as usual cam complained why wouldnt he because he doesnt know you he barely knows me phillip lifted his cup and gestured the only one hes spent any time with is ethan didnt spend all that much with me ethan admitted i took him out on the boat a few times hes got a quick mind good hands doesnt have much to say for himself but when he does hes got a mouth on him hes spent some time with grace she doesnt seem to mind him dad wanted him to stay cam stated with a shrug he stays he glanced over at the sound of a horn tooting three quick beeps thatll be grace dropping him back off on her way to shineys pub shineys cams brows shot up whats she doing down at shineys making a living i expect ethan returned oh yeah a slow grin spread does he still have his waitresses dress in those little skirts with the bows on the butt and the black fishnet stockings he does phillip said with a long wistful sigh he does indeed grace would fill out one of those outfits pretty well id imagine she does phillip smiled she does indeed maybe ill just mosey down to shineys later grace isnt one of your french models ethan pushed back from the table took his mug and his annoyance to the sink back off whoa behind ethans back cam wiggled his brows at phillip backing off bro didnt know you had your eye aimed in that particular direction i dont shes a mother for christs sake i had a really fine time with the mother of two in cancun last winter cam remembered her ex was swimming in oil olive oil and all she got in the divorce settlement was a mexican villa a couple of cars some trinkets art and two million i spent a memorable week consoling her and the kids were cute from a distance with their nanny youre such a humanitarian cam phillip told him dont i know it they heard the front door slam and looked at each other well who talks to him phillip wanted to know im no good at that kind of stuff ethan was already edging toward the back door and ive got to go feed my dog coward cam muttered as the door shut at ethans back you bet me too phillip was up and moving you get first crack ive got those papers to go through wait just a damn minute but phillip was gone and cheerfully telling seth that cameron wanted to talk to him when seth came to the kitchen door the puppy scrambling at his heels he saw cam scowling as he poured more whiskey in his coffee seth stuck his hands in his pockets and lifted his chin he didnt want to be there didnt want to talk to anybody at graces hed been able to just sit on her little stoop be alone with his thoughts even when shed come out for a little while and sat beside him with aubrey on her knee shed let him be because she understood hed wanted to be quiet now he had to deal with the man he wasnt afraid of big hands and hard eyes wouldnt couldnt let himself be afraid he wouldnt care that they were going to kick him loose toss him back like one of the runt fish ethan pulled out of the bay he could take care of himself he wasnt worried his heart scrambled in his chest like a mouse in a cage what the single word was ripe with defiance and challenge seth stood his legs locked and waited for a reaction cam only continued to frown and sip his doctored coffee with one hand he absently stroked the puppy who was trying valiantly to climb into his lap he saw a scrawny boy wearing jeans still stiff and obviously new a screwyou sneer and ray quinns eyes sit down i can stand i didnt ask you what you could do i told you to sit down on cue foolish obediently plopped his fat butt on the floor and grinned but boy and man stared at each other the boy gave way first it was the quick jerk of the shoulders that had cam setting his mug down with a click it was a quinn gesture through and through cam took a moment to settle tried to gather his thoughts but they remained scattered and elusive what the hell was he supposed to say to the boy you get anything to eat seth watched him warily from under girlishly thick lashes yeah there was stuff ah ray did he talk to you about things plans for you the shoulders jerked again i dont know he was working on adopting you making it legal you knew about that hes dead yeah cam picked up his coffee again let the pain roll through hes dead im going to florida seth burst out as the idea slammed into his mind cam sipped coffee angled his head as if mildly interested oh yeah i got some money i figured id leave in the morning catch a bus south you cant stop me sure i can more comfortable now cam leaned back in his chair im bigger than you what do you plan to do in florida i can get work i can do lots of things pick some pockets sleep on the beach maybe cam nodded that had been his plan when his destination had been mexico for the first time he thought he might be able to connect with the boy after all i guess you cant drive yet i could if i had to harder to boost a car these days unless youve got some experience and you need to be mobile to keep ahead of the cops floridas a bad idea thats where im going seth set his jaw no it isnt youre not sending me back seth lurched up from the chair his thin frame vibrating with fear and rage the sudden move and shout sent the puppy racing fearfully from the room you got no hold over me you cant make me go back back where to her ill go right now ill get my stuff and im gone and if you think you can stop me youre full of shit cam recognized the stance braced for a blow but ready to fight back she knock you around thats none of your fucking business ray made it my fucking business you head for the door he added as seth shifted to the balls of his feet ill just haul you back cam only sighed when seth made his dash even as he caught him three feet before the front door he had to give seth credit for speed and when he caught the boy around the waist took the backhanded fist on his already tender jaw he gave him credit for strength get your goddamn hands off me you son of a bitch ill kill you if you touch me grimly cam dragged seth into the living room pushed him into a chair and held him there with their faces close if it had just been anger he saw in the boys eyes or defiance he wouldnt have cared but what he saw was raw terror you got balls kid now try to develop some brains to go with them if i want sex i want a woman understand me he couldnt speak all hed known when that hard muscled arm had wrapped around him was that this time he wouldnt be able to escape this time he wouldnt be able to fight free and run theres nobody here whos going to touch you like that ever without realizing it cam had gentled his voice his eyes remained dark but the hardness was gone if i lay hands on you the worst it means is i might try to knock some sense into you you got that i dont want you to touch me seth managed his breath was gone panic sweat slicked his skin like oil i dont like being touched okay fine you sit where i put you cam eased back then pulled over a footstool and sat since foolish was now shivering in terror cam plucked him up and dumped him in seths lap we got a problem cam began and prayed for inspiration on how to handle it i cant watch you twentyfour hours a day and if i could im damned if i would you take off for florida im going to have to go find you and haul you back thats really going to piss me off because the dog was there seth stroked him gaining comfort while giving it what do you care where i go i cant say i do but ray did so youre going to have to stay stay it was an option seth had never considered certainly hadnt allowed himself to believe here when you sell the house whos selling the house i seth broke off decided he was saying too much people figured you would people figured wrong nobodys selling this house it surprised cam just how firm his feelings were on that particular point i dont know how were going to manage it yet im still working on that but in the meantime youd better get this into your head youre staying put which meant cam realized with a jolt so was he it appeared his luck was still running bad were stuck with each other kid for the next little while chapter three contents prev next cam figured this had to be the weirdest week of his life he should have been in italy prepping for the motocross hed planned to treat himself to most of his clothes and his boat were in monte carlo his car was in nice his motorcycle in rome and he was in st chris babysitting a tenyearold with a bad attitude he hoped to christ the kid was in school where he belonged theyd had a battle royal over that little item that morning but then they were at war over most everything kitchen duty curfews laundry television picks cam shook his head as he pried off the rotting treads on the back steps hed swear the boy would square up for a bout if you said good morning and maybe he wasnt doing a fabulous job as guardian but damn it he was doing his best he had the tension headache to prove it and mostly he was on his own phillip had promised weekends and that was something but it also left five hideous days between ethan made a point of coming by and staying a few hours every evening after he pulled in the days catch but that left the days cam would have traded his immortal soul for a week in martinique hot sand and hotter women cold beer and no hassles instead he was doing laundry learning the mysteries of microwave cooking and trying to keep tabs on a boy who seemed hellbent on making life miserable you were the same way hell i was i wouldnt have lived to see twelve if id been that big an idiot most of that first year stella and i used to lie in bed at night and wonder if youd still be here in the morning at least there were two of you and cams hand went limp on the hammer his fingers simply gave way until it thudded on the ground beside him there in the old creaking rocker on the back porch sat ray quinn his face was wide and smiling his hair a tousled white mane that grew long and full he wore his favored gray fishing pants a faded gray tshirt with a red crab across the chest his feet were bare dad cams head spun once sickly then his heart burst with joy he leaped to his feet you didnt think id leave you fumbling through this alone did you but cam shut his eyes he was hallucinating he realized it was stress and fatigue grief tossed in i always tried to teach you that lifes full of surprises and miracles i wanted you to open your mind not just to possibilities cam but to impossibilities ghosts god why not the idea seemed to cheer ray immensely as he let loose with one of his deep rumbling laughs read your literature son its full of them cant be cam mumbled to himself im sitting right here so it looks like it can i left too many things unfinished around here its up to you and your brothers now but who says i cant give you a little help now and again help yeah im going to need some serious help starting with a psychiatrist before his legs gave out on him cam picked his way through the broken stairs and sat down on the edge of the porch youre not crazy cam just confused cam took a steadying breath and turned his head to study the man who lazily rocked in the old wooden chair the mighty quinn he thought while the air whooshed out of his lungs he looked solid and real he looked cam decided there if youre really here tell me about the boy is he yours hes yours now yours and ethans and phillips thats not enough of course it is im counting on each of you ethan takes things as they come and makes the best of them phillip wraps his mind around details and ties them up you push at everything until it works your way the boy needs all three of you seths whats important youre all whats important i dont know what to do with him cam said impatiently i dont know what to do with myself figure out one youll figure out the other damn it tell me what happened tell me whats going on thats not why im here i cant tell you if ive seen elvis either ray grinned when cam let out a short helpless laugh i believe in you cam dont give up on seth dont give up on yourself i dont know how to do this fix the steps ray said with a wink its a start the hell with the steps cam began but he was alone again with the sound of singing birds and gently lapping water losing my mind he murmured rubbing an unsteady hand over his face losing my goddamn mind and rising he went back to fix the steps anna spinelli had the radio blasting aretha franklin was wailing out of her milliondollar pipes demanding respect anna was wailing along with her deliriously thrilled with her spankingnew car shed worked her butt off budgeted and juggled funds to afford the down payment and the monthly installments and as far as she was concerned it would be worth every carton of yogurt she ate rather than a real meal despite the chilly spring air shed have preferred to have the top down as she sped along the country roads but it wouldnt have looked professional to arrive windblown above all else it was essential to appear and behave in a professional manner shed chosen a plain and proper navy suit and white blouse for this home visit what she wore under it was nobodys business but her own her affection for silk strained her ever beleaguered budget but life was for living after all shed fought her long curling black hair into a tidy bun at the nape of her neck she thought it made her look a bit more mature and dignified too often when she wore her hair down she was dismissed as a hot number rather than a seriousminded social worker her skin was pale gold thanks to her italian heritage her eyes big and dark and almondshaped her mouth was full with a ripe bottom lip the bones in her face were strong and prominent her nose long and straight she wore little makeup during business hours wary of drawing the wrong kind of attention she was twentyeight years old devoted to her work satisfied with the single life and pleased that shed been able to settle in the pretty town of princess anne shed had enough of the city as she drove between long flat fields of row crops with the scent of water a hint on the breeze through her window she dreamed of one day moving to such a place country lanes and tractors a view of the bay and boats shed need to save up to plan but one day she hoped to manage to buy a little house outside of town the commute wouldnt be so hard not when driving was one of her greatest personal pleasures the cd player shifted the queen of soul to beethoven anna began to hum the ode to joy she was glad the quinn case had been assigned to her it was so interesting she only wished shed had the chance to meet raymond and stella quinn it would take very special people to adopt three halfgrown and troubled boys and make it work but they were gone and now seth delauter was her concern obviously the adoption proceedings couldnt go forward three single men one living in baltimore one in st chris and the other wherever he chose to at the moment well anna mused it didnt appear to be the best environment for the child in any case it was doubtful they would want guardianship so seth delauter would be absorbed back into the system anna intended to do her best by him when she spotted the house through the greening leaves she stopped the car deliberately she turned the radio down to a dignified volume then checked her face and hair in the rearview mirror shifting back into first she drove the last few yards at a leisurely pace and turned slowly into the drive her first thought was that it was a pretty house in a lovely setting so quiet and peaceful she mused it could have used a fresh coat of paint and the yard needed tending but the slight air of disrepair only added to the hominess a boy would be happy here she thought anyone would it was a shame hed have to be taken away from it she sighed a little knowing too well that fate had its whims taking her briefcase she got out of the car she hitched her jacket to make certain it fell in line she wore it a bit loose so it wouldnt showcase distracting curves she started toward the front door noting that the perennial beds flanking the steps were beginning to pop she really needed to learn more about flowers she made a mental note to check out a few gardening books from the library she heard the hammering and hesitated then in her practical low heels cut across the lawn toward the back of the house he was kneeling on the ground when she caught sight of him a black tshirt tucked into snug and faded denim from a purely female outlook it was impossible not to react and approve of him muscles the long and lean sort rippled as he pounded a nail into wood with enough anger anna mused enough force to send vibrations of both into the air to simmer phillip quinn she wondered the advertising executive highly doubtful cameron quinn the globetrotting risktaker hardly so this must be ethan the waterman she fixed a polite smile on her face and started forward mr quinn his head came up with the hammer still gripped in his hand he turned until she saw his face oh yes the anger was there she realized fullblown and lethal and the face itself was more compelling and certainly tougher than shed been prepared for some native american blood perhaps she decided would account for those sharp bones and bronzed skin his hair was a true black untidy and long enough to fall over his collar his eyes were anything but friendly the color of bitter storms on a personal level she found the package outrageously sexy on a professional one she knew the look of an alley brawler when she saw one and decided on the spot that whichever quinn this was he was a man to be careful with he took his time studying her his first thought was that legs like that deserved a better showcase than a drab navy skirt and ugly black shoes his second was that when a brown that beautiful she probably got whatever she wanted without saying a word he set the hammer down and rose im quinn im anna spinelli she kept the smile in place as she walked forward hand extended which quinn are you cameron hed expected a soft hand because of the eyes because of the husky purr of her voice but it was firm what can i do for you im seth delauters caseworker his interest evaporated and his spine stiffened seths in school id hope so id like to speak with you about the situation mr quinn my brother phillips handling the legal details she arched a brow determined to keep the small polite smile in place is he here no well then if i could have a few moments of your time i assume youre living here at least temporarily so what she didnt bother to sigh too many people saw a social worker as the enemy shed done so once herself my concern is seth mr quinn now we can discuss this or i can simply move forward with the procedure for his removal from this home and into approved foster care itd be a mistake to try that miz spinelli seth isnt going anywhere her back went up at the way he drawled out her name seth delauter is a minor the private adoption your father was implementing wasnt finalized and there is some question about its validity at this point mr quinn you have no legal connection to him you dont want me to tell you what you can do with your legal connection do you miz spinelli with some satisfaction he watched those big dark eyes flash i didnt think so i can resist seths my brother the saying of it left him shaken with a jerk of his shoulder he turned i need a beer she stood for a moment after the screen door slammed when it came to her work she simply didnt permit herself to lose her temper she breathed in breathed out three times before climbing the halfrepaired steps and going into the house mr quinn still here he twisted the top off a harp want a beer no mr quinn i dont like social workers youre joking she allowed herself to flutter her lashes at him i never would have guessed his lips twitched before he lifted the bottle to them nothing personal of course not i dont like rude arrogant men thats nothing personal either now are you ready to discuss seths welfare or should i simply come back with the proper paperwork and the cops she would cam decided after another study she might have beengiven a face suitable for painting but she wasnt a pushover you try that and the kids going to bolt youd pick him up sooner or later and hed end up in juvie then hed end up in a cell your system isnt going to help him miz spinelli but you can maybe he frowned into his beer my father would have when he looked up again there were emotions storming in his eyes that pulled at her do you believe in the sanctity of a deathbed promise yes she said before she could stop herself the day my father died i promised him we promised him that wed keep seth with us nothing and no one is going to make me break my word not you not your system not a dozen cops the situation here wasnt what shed expected to find so she would reevaluate id like to sit down anna said after a moment go ahead she pulled out a chair at the table there were dishes in the sink she noted and the faint smell of whatever had been burnt for dinner the night before but to her that only meant someone was trying to feed a young boy do you intend to apply for legal guardianship we you mr quinn she interrupted im asking you if that is your intention she waited watching the doubts and resistance sweep over his face then i guess it is yeah god help them all he thought if thats what it takes do you intend to live in this house with seth on a permanent basis permanent it was perhaps the only truly frightening word in his life now i have to sit down he did so then pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger to relieve some of the pressure christ how about we use for the foreseeable future instead of permanent she folded her hands on the edge of the table she didnt doubt his sincerity would have applauded him for his intentions but you have no idea what youre thinking of taking on youre wrong i do and it scares the hell out of me she nodded considering the answer a point in his favor what makes you think you would be a better guardian for a tenyearold boy a boy i believe youve known for less than two weeks than a screened and approved foster home because i understand him ive been him or part of him and because this is where he belongs let me lay out some of the bigger obstacles to what youre planning youre a single man with no permanent address and without a steady income ive got a house right here ive got money whose name is the house in mr quinn she only nodded when his brows knit i imagine you have no idea phillip will good for phillip and im sure you have some money mr quinn but im speaking of steady employment going around the world racing various forms of transportation isnt stable employment it pays just fine have you considered the risk to life and limb of your chosen lifestyle when you propose to take on a responsibility like this believe me the court will what if something happens to you when youre trying to break land and speed records i know what im doing besides there are three of us only one of you lives in this house where seth will live so and the one who does isnt a respected college professor with the experience of raising three sons that doesnt mean i cant handle it no mr quinn she said patiently but it is a major obstacle to legal guardianship what if we all did excuse me what if we all lived here what if my brothers moved in what a damn mess cam thought but he kept going what if i got a now he had to take a deep swallow of beer knowing the word would stick in his throat a job he managed she stared at him youd be willing to change your life so dramatically ray and stella quinn changed my life her face softened making cam blink in surprise as her generous mouth curved in a smile as her eyes seemed to go darker and deeper when her hand reached out closed lightly over his he stared down at it surprised by a quick jolt of what was surely pure lust when i was driving here i was wishing i could have met them i thought they must have been remarkable people now im sure of it then she drew back ill need to speak with seth and with your brothers what time does seth get home from school what time cam glanced at the kitchen clock without a clue its sort of flexible youll want to do better than that if this gets as far as a formal home study ill go by the school and see him your brother ethan she rose would i find him at home not at this time of day hell be bringing in his catch before five she glanced at her watch gauged her time all right and ill contact your other brother in baltimore from her briefcase she took a neat leather notebook now can you give me names and addresses of some neighbors people who know you and seth and who would stand for your character the good side of your character that is i could probably come up with a few thats a start ill do some research here mr quinn if its in seths best interest to remain in your home under your care ill do everything i can to help you she angled her head if i reach the opinion that its in his best interest to be taken out of your home and out of your care then ill fight you tooth and nail to make that happen cam rose as well then i guess we understand each other not by a long shot but youve got to start somewhere the minute she was out of the house cam was on the phone by the time hed been passed through a secretary and an assistant and reached phillip his temper had spilled over there was a goddamn social worker here i told you to expect that no you didnt yes i did you dont listen ive got a friend of mine a lawyer working on the guardianship seths mother took a hike as far as we can tell shes not in baltimore i dont give a damn where the mother is the social worker was making noises about taking seth the lawyers putting through a temporary guardianship it takes time cam we may not have tune he shut his eyes tried to think past the anger or maybe i bought us some who owns the house now we do dad left it well everything to the three of us fine good because youre about to change locations youre going to need to pack up those designer suits of yours pal and get your butt down here were going to be living together again like hell and ive got to get a goddamn job im going to expect you by seven tonight bring dinner im sick to death of cooking it gave him some satisfaction to hang up on phillips vigorous cursing anna found seth sullen and smartmouthed and snotty and liked him immediately the principal had given her permission to take him out of class and use a corner of the empty cafeteria as a makeshift office it would be easier if youd tell me what you think and feel and what you want why should you give a damn they pay me to seth shrugged and continued to draw patterns on the table with his finger i think you should mind your own business i feel bored and i want you to go away well thats enough about me anna said and had the pleasure of seeing seth struggle to suppress a smile lets talk about you are you happy living with mr quinn its a cool house yes i liked it what about mr quinn he thinks he knows everything thinks hes a bfd because hes been all over the world he sure as hell cant cook let me tell you she left her pen on the table and folded her hands over her notebook he was much too thin she thought do you go hungry he ends up going to get pizza or burgers pitiful i mean whats it take to work a microwave maybe you should do the cooking like hed ask me the other night he blows up the potatoes forgets to poke holes in them you know and bam seth forgot to sneer laughing out loud instead what a mess he swore a streak then man oh man so the kitchen isnt his area of expertise but anna decided he was trying youre telling me hes better off when hes going around hammering things or fiddling with that coolass car did you see that vette cam said it was his moms and she had it for like ever drives like a rocket too ray kept it in the garage guess he didnt want to get it out do you miss him ray the shoulder shrugged again and seths gaze dropped he was cool but he was old and when you get old you die thats the way it is what about ethan and phillip theyre okay i like going out on the boats if i didnt have school i could work for ethan he said i pulled my weight do you want to stay with them seth i got no place to go do i theres always a choice and im here to help you find the one that works best for you if you know where your mother is i dont know his voice rose his head snapped up his eyes darkened to nearly navy against a pale face and i dont want to know you try to send me back there youll never find me did she hurt you anna waited a beat then nodded when he only stared at her all right well leave that alone for now there are couples and families who are willing and able to take children into their home to care for them to give them a good life they dont want me do they the tears wanted to come hed be damned if hed let them instead his eyes went hot and burning dry he said i could stay but it was a lie just another fucking lie no she grabbed seths hand before he could leap up no they do want you as a matter of fact mr quinn cameron was very angry with me for suggesting you should go into another home im only trying to find out what you want and i think you just told me if living with the quinns is what you want and whats best for you i want to help you to get that ray said i could stay he said id never have to go back he promised if i can ill try to help him keep that promise chapter four contents prev next since there seemed to be nothing cold to drink in the house but beer carbonated soft drinks and some suspiciouslooking milk ethan put the kettle on to boil hed brew up some tea ice it and enjoy a tall glass out on the porch while evening moseyed in he was in hour fourteen of his day and ready to relax which wasnt going to be easy he decided while he hunted up tea bags and overheard cam and seth holding some new pissing match in the living room he figured they must enjoy sniping at each other or they wouldnt spend so much time at it for himself he wanted a quiet hour a decent meal then one of the two cigars he allowed himself per day the way things sounded he didnt think the quiet hour was going to make the agenda as he dumped tea bags in the boiling water he heard feet stomping up the stairs followed by the bulletsharp sound of a slamming door the kids driving me batshit cam complained as he stalked into the kitchen you cant say boo to him without him squaring up for a fight mmhmm argumentative smartmouthed troublemaker feeling grossly put upon cam snagged a beer from the fridge must be like looking in a mirror like hell dont know what i was thinking of youre such a peaceable soul moving at his own relaxed pace ethan bent down to search out an old glass pitcher lets see you were just about fourteen when i came along first thing you did was pick a fight so youd have the excuse to bloody my nose for the first time in hours cam felt a grin spread that was just a welcometothefamily tap besides you gave me a hell of a black eye as a thankyou there was that kids too smart to try to punch you ethan continued and began to dump generous scoops of sugar into the pitcher so he razzes you instead he sure as hells got your attention doesnt he it was irritating because it was true you got him pegged so neatly why dont you take him on because im on the water every morning at dawn kid like that needs supervision that ethan thought was his story and hed stick to it through all the tortures of hell of the three of us youre the only one not working im going to have to fix that cam muttered oh yeah with a mild snort ethan finished making the tea thatll be the day the days coming up fast social worker was here today ethan grunted let the implications turn over in his mind whatd she want to check us out shes going to be talking to you too and phillip already talked to seth which is what i was trying to diplomatically ask him about when he started foaming at the mouth again cam frowned now thinking more of anna spinelli of the great legs and tidy briefcase than of seth if we dont pass shes going to work on pulling him he isnt going anywhere thats what i said he dragged his hand through his hair again which for some reason reminded him hed meant to get a haircut in rome seth wasnt the only one not going anywhere but bro were about to make some serious adjustments around here things are fine as they are ethan filled a glass with ice and poured tea over it so that it crackled easy for you to say cam stepped out on the porch let the screen door slap shut behind him he walked to the rail watched ethans sleek chesapeake bay retriever simon play tag and tumble with the fat puppy upstairs seth had obviously decided to seek revenge by turning his radio up to earsplitting screaming headbanger rock blasted through the windows cams jaw twitched hed be damned if hed tell the kid to turn it down too clichéd too terrifyingly adult a response he sipped his beer struggled to loosen the knots in his shoulders and concentrated on the way the lowering sun tossed white diamonds onto the water the wind was coming up so that the marsh grass waved like a field of kansas wheat the drake of a pair of ducks that had set up house where the water bent at the edge of the trees flew by quacking lucy im home was all cam could think and it nearly made him smile again under the roar of music he heard the gentle rhythmic creak of the rocker beer fountained from the lip of the bottle when he whirled ethan stopped rocking and stared at him what he demanded christ cam you look like youve seen a ghost nothing cam swiped a hand over his face then carefully lowered himself to the porch so he could lean back against the post nothing he repeated but set the beer aside im a little edgy usually are if you stay in one place more than a week dont climb up my back ethan just a comment and because cam looked exhausted and pale ethan reached in the breast pocket of his shirt took out two cigars it wouldnt hurt to change his smokeafterdinner routine cigar cam sighed yeah why not rather than move he let ethan light the first and pass it to him leaning back again he blew a few lazy smoke rings when the music shut off abruptly he felt hed achieved a small personal victory for the next ten minutes there wasnt a sound but the lap of water the call of birds and the talk of the breeze the sun dropped lower turning the western sky into a soft rosy haze that bled into the water and blurred the horizon shadows deepened it was like ethan cam mused to ask no questions to sit in silence and wait to understand the need for quiet hed nearly forgotten that admirable trait of his brothers and maybe cam admitted hed nearly forgotten how much he loved the brother ray and stella had given him but even remembering he wasnt sure what to do about it see you fixed the steps ethan commented when he judged cam was relaxing again yeah the place could use a coat of paint too well have to get to that they were going to have to get to a lot of things cam thought but the quiet creak of the rocker kept taking his mind back to that afternoon have you ever had a dream while you were wide awake he could ask because it was ethan and ethan would think and consider after setting the nearly empty glass on the porch beside the rocker ethan studied his cigar well i guess i have the mind likes to wander when you let it it could have been that cam told himself his mind had wandered maybe even gotten lost for a bit that could have been why hed thought he saw his father rocking on the porch the conversation wishful thinking he decided that was all remember how dad used to bring his fiddle out here hot summer nights hed sit where youre sitting and play for hours he had such big hands he could sure make that fiddle sing you picked it up pretty well ethan shrugged puffed lazily on his cigar some you ought to take it hed have wanted you to have it ethan shifted his quiet eyes locked them on cams neither spoke for a moment nor had to i guess i will but not right yet im not ready yeah cam blew out smoke again you still got the guitar they gave you that christmas i left it here didnt want it banging around with me cam looked at his fingers flexed them as though he were about to lay them on the strings guess i havent played in more than a year maybe we should try seth on some instrument mom used to swear playing a tune pumped out the aggression he turned his head as the dogs began to bark and race around the side of the house expecting somebody phillip ethans brows lifted thought he wasnt coming down till friday lets just call this a family emergency cam tapped out the stub of the cigar before he rose i hope to christ he brought some decent food and none of that fancy pea pod crap he likes to eat phillip strode into the kitchen balancing a large bag on top of a jumbo bucket of chicken and shooting out waves of irritation he dumped the food on the table skimmed a hand through his hair and scowled at his brothers im here he snapped as they came through the back door whats the damn problem were hungry cam said easily and peeling the top from the bucket he grabbed a drumstick you got dirt on your im an executive pants there phil goddamn it furious now phillip brushed impatiently at the pawprints on his slacks when are you going to teach that idiot dog not to jump on people you cart around fried chicken dogs going to see if he can get a piece makes him smart if you ask me unoffended ethan went to a cupboard for plates you get fries cam poked in the bag snagged one cold somebody better nuke these if i do it theyll blow up or disintegrate ill do it get something to dish up that coleslaw phillip took a breath then one more the drive down from baltimore was long and the traffic had been ugly when you two girls have finished playing house maybe youll tell me why i broke a date with a very hotlooking cpa the third date by the way which was dinner at her place with the definite possibility of sex afterward and instead just spent a couple hours in miserable traffic to deliver a fucking bucket of chicken to a couple of boobs first off im tired of cooking cam heaped coleslaw on his plate and took a biscuit and even more tired of tossing out what ive cooked because even the pup who drinks out of the toilet with regularity wont touch it but thats only the surface he took another hefty bite of chicken as he walked to the doorway and shouted for seth the kid needs to be here were all in this fine great phillip dropped into a chair tugged at his tie no use sulking because your accountant isnt going to be running your figures tonight pal ethan offered him a friendly smile and a plate tax seasons heating up with a sigh phillip scooped out slaw ill be lucky to get a warm look from her until after april fifteenth and i was so close none of us is likely to be getting much action for the next little while cam jerked a head as seths feet pounded down the stairs the patter of little feet plays hell with the sex life cam tucked away the urge for another beer and settled on iced tea as seth stepped into the kitchen the boy scanned the room his nose twitching at the scent of spicy chicken but he didnt dive into the bucket as he would have liked to whats the deal he demanded and tucked his hands in his pockets while his stomach yearned family meeting cam announced with food sit he took a chair himself as ethan put the freshly buzzed fries on the table sit cam repeated when seth stayed where he was if youre not hungry you can just listen i could eat seth sauntered over to the table slid into a chair its got to be better than the crud youve been trying to pass off as food you know ethan said in his mild drawl before cam could snarl seems to me id be grateful if somebody tried to put together a hot meal for me from time to time even if it was crud with his eyes on seth ethan tipped down the bucket contemplated his choices especially if that somebody was doing the best he could because it was ethan seth flushed squirmed then shrugged as he plucked out a fat breast nobody asked him to cook all the more reason might work better if you took turns he doesnt think i can do anything seth sneered over at cam so i dont you know its tempting to toss this little fish back into the pond cam dumped salt on his fries and struggled to hold onto a simmering temper i could be in aruba this time tomorrow so go seths eyes flashed up full of anger and defiance go wherever the hell you want as long as its out of my face i dont need you smartmouthed little brat ive had it cam had a long reach and used it now to shoot a hand across the table and pluck seth out of his chair even as phillip opened his mouth to protest ethan shook his head you think ive enjoyed spending the last two weeks babysitting some snotnosed monster with a pisspoor attitude ive put my life on hold to deal with you big deal seth had turned sheetwhite and was ready for the blow he was sure would come but he wouldnt back down all you do is run around collecting trophies and screwing women go back where you came from and keep doing it i dont give a shit cam watched the edges of his own vision turn red fury and frustration hissed in his blood like a snake primed to strike he saw his fathers hands at the end of his arms not rays but the man who had used those hands on him with such casual violence throughout his childhood before he did something unforgivable he dropped seth back into his chair his voice was quiet now and the room vibrated with his control if you think im staying for you youre wrong im staying for ray have you got any idea where the system will toss you if one of us decides youre not worth the trouble foster homes seth thought strangers or worse her because his legs were trembling badly he locked his feet around the legs of his chair you dont care what they do with me thats just one more thing youre wrong about cam said evenly you dont want to be grateful fine i dont want your goddamn gratitude but youll start showing some respect and youll start showing it now its not just me whos going to be hounding your sorry ass pal its the three of us cam sat down again waited for his composure to solidify the social worker who was here today spinelli anna spinelli has some concerns about the environment whats wrong with the environment ethan wanted to know the nasty little altercation had cleared the air he decided now they could get to the details its a good solid house a nice area schools good crimes low i got the impression im the environment at the moment im the only one here supervising things the three of us will go down as guardians phillip pointed out he poured a glass of iced tea and set it casually next to the hand seth had fisted on the table he imagined the boys throat would be burning dry right about now i checked with the lawyer after you called the preliminary paperwork should go through by the end of the week therell be a probationary period regular home studies and meetings evaluations but unless theres a serious objection it doesnt look like a problem spinellis a problem cam refused to let the altercation spoil his appetite and reached for more chicken classic dogooder great legs serious mind i know she talked to the kid but hes not inclined to share their conversation so ill share mine she had doubts about my qualifications as guardian single man no steady means of employment no permanent residence there are three of us phillip frowned and poked at his slaw a trickle of guilt was working through and he didnt care for it which i pointed out miz spinelli of the gorgeous italian eyes countered with the sad fact that i happen to be the only one of the three of us actually living here with the kid and it was tactfully implied that of the three of us im the least likely candidate for guardian so i tossed out the idea of all of us living here what do you mean living here phillip dropped his fork i work in baltimore ive got a condo how the hell am i supposed to live here and work there thatll be a problem cam agreed bigger one will be how youll fit all your clothes into that closet in your old room while phillip tried to choke out a response ethan tapped a finger on the edge of the table he thought of his small and to him perfect house the quiet and solitude of it and he saw the way seth stared down at his plate with dark baffled eyes how long you figure it would take i dont know cam dragged both hands back through his hair six months maybe a year a year all phillip could do was close his eyes jesus you talk to the lawyer about it cam suggested see whats what but we present a united front to social services or theyre going to pull him and ive got to find work work phillips misery dissolved in a grin you doing what there arent any racetracks in st chris and the chesapeake god bless her sure aint the med ill find something steady doesnt mean fancy im not looking at something ill need an armani suit for he was wrong cam realized this damn business was going to spoil his appetite the way i figure it spinellis going to be back tomorrow the next day at the latest we have to hammer this out and it has to look like we know what the hell were doing ill take my vacation time early phillip bid farewell to the two weeks hed planned to spend in the caribbean that buys us a couple of weeks i can work with the lawyer deal with the social worker ill deal with her cam smiled a little i liked the looks of her and i ought to get some perks out of this of course all this depends on what the kid said to her today i told her i wanted to stay seth mumbled tears were raw in his stomach the food sat untouched on his plate ray said i could he said i could stay here he said hed fix it so i could and were whats left of him cam waited until seth lifted his gaze so well fix it later when the moon was up and the dark water was slashed by its luminous white beam phillip stood on the dock the air was cold now the damp wind carrying the raw edge of the winter that fought not to yield to spring it suited his mood there was a war raging inside him between conscience and ambition in two short weeks the life he had planned out plotted meticulously and implemented with deliberation and simple hard work had shattered now still numb with grief for his father he was being asked to transplant himself to compromise those careful plans hed been thirteen when ray and stella quinn took him in most of those years hed spent on the street dodging the system he was an accomplished thief an enthusiastic brawler who used drugs and liquor to dull the ugliness the projects of baltimore were his turf and when a driveby shooting left him bleeding on those streets he was prepared to die to simply end it indeed the life hed led up to the point when he wound up in a gutter choked with garbage ended that night he lived and for reasons he never understood the quinns wanted him they opened a thousand fascinating doors for him and no matter how often how defiantly he tried to slam them shut again they didnt allow it they gave him choices and hope and a family they offered him a chance for an education that had saved his soul he used what theyd given him to make himself into the man he was he studied and worked and he buried that miserable boy deep his position at innovations the top advertising firm in the metropolitan area was solid no one doubted that phillip quinn was on the fast track to the top and no one who knew the man who wore the elegant tailored suits who could order a meal in perfect french and always knew the proper wine would have believed he had once bartered his body for the price of a dime bag he had pride in that perhaps too much pride but he considered it his testament to the quinns there was enough of that selfish selfserving boy still inside him to rebel at the thought of giving up one inch of it but there was too much of the man ray and stella had molded to consider doing otherwise somehow he had to find the compromise he turned looked back at the house the upstairs was dark seth was in bed by now phillip mused he didnt have a clue how he felt about the boy he recognized him understood him and he supposed resented just a bit those parts of himself he saw in young seth delauter was he ray quinns son there phillip thought as his teeth clenched more resentment at even the possibility of it had the man hed all but worshiped for more than half his life really fallen off his pedestal succumbed to temptation betrayed wife and family and if he had how could he have turned his back on his own blood how could this man who had made strangers his own ignore for more than a decade a son whod come from his own body weve got enough problems phillip reminded himself the first was to keep a promise to keep the boy he walked back using the back porch light to guide him cam sat on the steps ethan in the rocker ill go back into baltimore in the morning phillip announced ill see what the lawyer can firm up you said the social worker was named spinelli yeah cam nursed a cup of black coffee anna spinelli shed be county probably out of princess anne ill pass that on details he thought hed concentrate on the facts the way i see it were going to have to come off as three model citizens i already pass phillip smiled thinly the two of you are going to have to work on your act i told spinelli id get a job even the thought of it disgusted cam id hold off on that a while this came from ethan who rocked quietly in the shadows i got an idea i want to think on it a while more seems to me he went on that with phil and me around both of us working you could be running the house oh jesus was all cam could manage it goes like this ethan paused rocked continued youd be what theyd call primary caregiver youre available if the school calls with a problem if seth gets sick or whatever makes sense phillip agreed and feeling better he grinned at cam youre mommy fuck you thats no way for mommy to talk if you think im going to be stuck washing your dirty socks and swabbing the toilet you wasted that fine education youre so proud of just temporarily ethan said though he enjoyed the image of his brother wearing an apron and hunting up cobwebs with a feather duster well work out shifts seth ought to have some regular chores too we always did but its going to fall to you for the next few days anyway while phillip figures out how we handle the legal end and i see how i can juggle my time ive got business of my own to deal with the coffee was beginning to burn a hole in his gut but cam drank it down anyway my stuffs scattered all over europe well seths in school all day isnt he absently ethan reached down to stroke the dog snoring beside his chair fine great cam gave up you he said pointing at phillip bring some groceries back with you were out of damn near everything and ethan can throw whatever you bring in together into a meal everybody makes their own bed goddamn it im not a maid what about breakfast phillip said dryly youre not going to send your men off in the morning without a hot meal are you cam eyed him batefully youre enjoying this arent you might as well he sat on the steps beside cam leaned back on his elbows somebody ought to talk to seth about cleaning up his language oh yeah cam merely snorted thatll work he swears that way in front of the neighbors the social worker his teachers its going to give a bad impression hows his schoolwork anyway how the hell should i know now mother phillip grunted then laughed when cams elbow jabbed his ribs keep it up and youre going to end up with another ruined suit ace let me change and we can go a couple rounds or better yet phillip arched a brow slid his gaze over toward ethan then back to cam approving the plan cam scratched his chin set down his empty cup they shot off the steps in tandem so fast that ethan barely had a chance to blink his fist shot out was blocked and he was hauled out of the chair by armpits and ankles cursing all the way simon leaped up to bark delightedly and raced circles around the men who hauled his struggling master off the porch inside the kitchen the pup wiggled madly and yipped in answer to keep him close seth pulled off a chunk of the chicken hed come down to forage and dropped it on the floor while foolish gobbled seth watched in puzzled amazement as the silhouettes headed for the dock hed come down to fill his empty belly he was used to moving quietly hed stuffed his mouth with chicken and listened to the men talk they acted like they were going to let him stay even when they didnt know he was there to hear they talked as if it was a simple fact at least for now he decided until they forgot theyd made a promise or no longer cared he knew promises didnt mean squat except rays hed believed ray but then hed gone and died and ruined everything still every night he spent in this house between clean sheets with the puppy curled beside him was an escape whenever they decided to ditch him hed be ready to run because hed die before he went back to where hed been before ray quinn the pup was nosing at the door drawn by the sound of laughter and barking and the shouts seth fed him more chicken to distract him he wanted to go out too to run across the lawn and join in that laughter that fun that family but he knew he wouldnt be welcome theyd stop and theyd stare at him as if they wondered where the hell hed come from and what the hell they were supposed to do about it then theyd tell him to get back to bed oh god he wanted to stay he just wanted to be here seth pressed his face against the screen yearning with all his heart to belong when he heard ethans long laughing oath the loud splash that followed it and the roars of male satisfaction that came next he grinned and he stayed there grinning even as a tear escaped and trickled unnoticed down his cheek chapter five contents prev next anna got in to work early odds were her supervisor would already be at her desk you could always count on marilou johnston to be at her desk or within hailing distance marilou was a woman anna both admired and respected when she needed advice there was no one whose opinion she valued more when she poked her head around the open office door anna smiled a little as expected marilou was there buried behind the files and paperwork on her cluttered desk she was a small woman barely topping five feet she wore her hair closecropped for convenience as much as style her face was smooth like polished ebony and the expression on it could remain composed even during the worst crises a calm center was how anna often thought of marilou though how she could be calm when her life was filled with a demanding career two teenage boys and a house that anna had seen for herself was constantly crowded with people was beyond her anna often thought she wanted to be marilou johnston when she grew up got a minute sure do marilous voice was quick and lively ripe with that southern shore accent that caught words between a drawl and a twang she waved anna to a chair with one hand and fiddled with the round gold ball in her left ear the quinndelauter case right the first time there were a couple of faxes waiting for me yesterday from the quinns lawyer a baltimore firm what did our baltimore lawyer have to say the gist of it is theyre pursuing guardianship hell be pushing through a petition to the court theyre very serious about keeping seth delauter in their home and under their care and its an unusual situation marilou uptil now ive only spoken with one of the brothers the one who lived in europe until recently cameron impressions he certainly makes one and because marilou was also a friend anna allowed herself a grin and a roll of her eyes a treat to look at i came across him when he was repairing the back porch steps i cant say he looked like a happy man but he was certainly a determined one theres a lot of anger there and a lot of grief what impressed me the most other than his looks other than his looks anna agreed with a chuckle was the fact that he never questioned keeping seth it was simply fact he called seth his brother he meant it im not sure he knows exactly how he feels about it but he meant it she went on while marilou listened without comment detailing the conversation cams willingness to change his life and his lifestyle his concerns that seth would bolt if he were taken out of the home and she continued after speaking with seth i tend to agree with him you think the boys a runner when i suggested foster care he became angry resentful and afraid if he feels threatened hell run she thought of all the children who ended up on the mean streets of inner cities homeless desperate she thought of what they did to survive and she thought of how many didnt survive at all it was her job to keep this one child this one boy safe he wants to stay there marilou maybe he needs to his feelings about his mother are very strong and very negative i suspect abuse but hes not ready to discuss it at least not with me is there any word on the mothers whereabouts no we have no idea where she is or what shell do she signed papers allowing ray quinn to begin adoption proceedings but he died before they were finalized if she comes back and wants her son anna shook her head the quinns would have a fight on their hands you sound as though youd be in their corner im in seths anna said firmly and im going to stay there i spoke with his teachers she pulled out a file as she spoke i have my report on that im going back today to speak with some of the neighbors and hopefully to meet with all three of the quinns it may be possible to stop the temporary guardianship until i complete the initial study but im inclined against it that boy needs stability he needs to feel wanted and even if the quinns only want him because of a promise its more than hes had before i believe marilou took the file set it aside i assigned this case to you because you dont look just at the surface and i sent you in cold because i wanted your take now ill tell you what i know about the quinns you know them anna i was born and raised on the shore she smiled beautifully it was a simple fact but one she had great pride in ray quinn was one of my professors at college i admired him tremendously when i had my two boys stella quinn was their pediatrician until we moved to princess anne we adored her when i was driving out there yesterday i kept wishing id had the chance to meet them they were exceptional people marilou said simply ordinary even simple in some ways and exceptional heres a case in point she added leaning back in her chair i graduated from college sixteen years ago the three quinns were teenagers you heard stories now and again maybe they were a little wild and people wondered why ray and stella had taken on halfgrown men with bad tendencies i was pregnant with johnny my first working my butt off to get my degree and help my husband ben pay the rent he was working two jobs we wanted a better life for ourselves and we sure as hell wanted one for the baby i was carrying she paused turned the double picture frame on her desk to a closer angle so that she could see her two young men smile out at her i wondered too figured they were crazy or just playing at being samaritans professor quinn called me into his office one day id missed a couple of classes had the worst case of morning sickness known to woman it still made her grimace i swear i dont understand how some women reminisce over that kind of thing in any case i thought he was going to recommend me dropping his class which meant losing the credits toward my degree with me an inch away an inch away and i would be the first in my family with a college degree i was ready to fight instead he wanted to know what he could do to help i was speechless she smiled remembering then beamed over at anna you know how impersonal college can be the huge lectures where a student is just one more face in the crowd but hed noticed me and hed taken the time to find out something about my situation i burst into tears hormones she said with a wry grin well he patted my hand gave me some tissues and let me cry it out i was on a scholarship and if my grades dropped or i blew a class i could lose it i only had one more semester he said for me not to worry wed work it all out and i was going to get my degree he started talking about this and that to calm me down he was telling me some story about teaching his son to drive made me laugh it wasnt until later i realized he hadnt been talking about one of the boys hed taken in because thats not what they were to him they were his a sucker for a happy ending anna sighed and you got your degree he made sure i did i owe him for that which is why i didnt tell you about this until youd formed some impressions of your own as for the three quinns i dont really know them ive seen them at two funerals saw seth delauter with them at professor quinns for personal reasons id like to see them have a chance to be a family but she laid her hands palm to palm the best interest of the boy comes before that and the structure of the system youre thorough anna and you believe in structure and in the system professor quinn would have wanted whats best for seth and to repay an old debt i gave him you anna blew out a long breath no pressure huh pressures all weve got around here as if on cue her phone began to ring and the clocks running anna rose id better get to work then looks like ill be in the field most of today it was nearly one pm when anna pulled up in the quinns drive shed managed to conduct interviews with three of the five names cam had given her the day before and she hoped to expand on that before too much more time passed her call to phillip quinns office in baltimore had given her the information that he was on leave for the next two weeks she was hoping she would find him here and be able to file an impression of another quinn but it was the pup who greeted her he barked ferociously even as he backed rapidly away from her anna watched with amusement as he peed on himself in terror with a laugh she crouched down held out a hand come on cutie i wont hurt you arent you sweet arent you pretty she kept murmuring to him until he bellied over to sniff her hand then rolled over in ecstasy as she scratched him for all you know hes got fleas and rabies anna glanced up and saw cam in the front doorway for all i know so do you with a snort of a laugh and his hands tucked in his pockets he came out on the porch it was a brown suit today he noted for the life of him he couldnt figure why shed pick such a dull color i guess youre willing to risk it since youre back didnt expect you so soon a boys welfare is at stake mr quinn i dont believe in taking my time under the circumstances obviously charmed by her voice the puppy leaped up and bathed her face the giggle escaped before she could stop it a sound that made cam raise his eyebrows and defending herself from the puppys eager tongue she rose tugged down her jacket and her dignity may i come in why not this time he waited for her even opened the door and let her go in ahead of him she saw a large and fairly tidy living area the furniture showed some wear but appeared comfortable and colorful the spinet in the corner caught her eye do you play not really without realizing it cam ran a hand over the wood he didnt notice that his fingers left streaks in the dust my mother did and phillips got an ear for it i tried to reach your brother phillip at his office this morning hes out buying groceries because he was pleased to have won that battle cam smiled a little hes going to be living here for the foreseeable future ethan too you work fast a boys welfare is at stake he said echoing her anna nodded at a distant rumble of thunder she glanced outside frowned the light was dimming and the wind beginning to kick id like to discuss seth with you she shifted her briefcase glanced at a chair is this going to take long i couldnt say then lets do it in the kitchen i want coffee fine she followed him using the time to study the house it was just neat enough to make her wonder if cam had been expecting her they passed a den where the dust was layered over tables the couch was covered with newspapers and shoes littered the floor missed that didnt you she thought with a smirk but she found it endearing then she heard his quick and vicious oath and nearly jumped out of her practical shoes goddamn it shit what the hell is this what next jesus christ he was already sloshing through the water and suds flowing over the kitchen floor to slap at the dishwasher anna stepped back to avoid the flood id turn that off if i were you yeah yeah yeah now ive got to take the bitch apart he dragged the door open an ocean of snowywhite suds spewed out anna bit the inside of her cheek cleared her throat ah what kind of soap did you use dish soap vibrating with frustration he yanked a bucket out from under the sink dishwasher soap or dishwashing soap what the hells the difference furious he started to bail outside the rain began to fall in hard driving sheets this keeping her face admirably sober she gestured to the river running over the floor this is the difference if you use the liquid for handwashing dishes in a dishwasher this is the inevitable result he straightened the bucket in his hand and a look of such pained irritation on his face she couldnt hold back the laugh sorry sorry look turn around why because im not willing to ruin my shoes or my hose so turn around while i take them off and ill give you a hand yeah pathetically grateful he turned his back and even did his best not to imagine her peeling off her stockings his best wasnt quite good enough but it was the effort that counted ethan handled most of the kitchen chores when we were growing up i did my share but it doesnt seem to have stuck with me you seem to be out of your element she tucked her hose neatly in her shoes set them aside get me a mop ill swab you get the coffee he opened a long narrow closet and handed her a string mop i appreciate it her legs he noted as he sloshed over for mugs didnt need hose they were a pale and fascinating gold in color and smooth as silk when she bent over he ran his tongue over his teeth hed had no idea a woman with a mop would be quite so attractive its so amazingly pleasant he realized to be here with the rain drumming the wind howling and a pretty barefoot woman keeping him kitchen company you seem to be in your element he commented then grinned when she turned her head and eyed him balefully im not saying its womans work my mother would have skinned me for the thought im just saying you seem to know what youre doing as shed worked her way through college cleaning houses she knew very well i can handle a mop mr quinn since youre mopping my kitchen floor you ought to make it cam about seth yeah about seth do you mind if i sit down go ahead she caught herself before she began to hum the mindless chore the rain the isolation were just a tad too relaxing im sure you know i spoke with him yesterday yeah and i know he told you he wanted to stay here he did and its in my report i also spoke with his teachers how much do you know about his schoolwork cam shifted i havent had a lot of time to get into that yet mmmhmm when he was first enrolled he had some trouble with the other students fistfights he broke one boys nose good for him cam thought with a surprising tug of pride but he did his best to look disapproving who started it thats not the point however your father handled the situation at this point im told that seth keeps mostly to himself he doesnt participate in class which is another problem he rarely turns in his homework assignments and those he does bother to turn in are most often sloppily done cam felt a new headache begin to brew so the kids not a scholar on the contrary anna straightened up leaned on the mop if he participated even marginally in class and if his assignments were done and turned in on time he would be a straight a student hes a solid b student as it is so whats the problem anna closed her eyes a moment the problem is that seths iq and evaluation tests are incredibly high the child is brilliant though he had his doubts about that cam nodded so thats a good thing and hes getting decent grades and staying out of trouble okay she would try this a different way suppose you were in a formula one race been there he said with wistful reminiscence done that right and you had the finest fastest hottest car in the field yeah he sighed i did but you never tested its full capabilities you never went fullout you never punched it on the turns or popped it into fifth and poured down the straights his brow lifted you follow racing no but i drive a car nice car too what have you had it up to eightyeight she thought with secret glee but she would never admit it i consider a car transportation she said lying primly not a toy no reason it cant be both why dont i take you out in the vette now thats a fine mode of entertaining transportation while she would have loved to indulge in the fantasy of sliding behind the wheel of that sleek white bullet she had a point to make try to stick with the analogy here youre racing a superior machine if you didnt drive that car the way it was meant to be driven youd be wasting its potential and maybe youd still finish in the money but you wouldnt win he got her point but couldnt help grinning i usually won anna shook her head seth she said with admirable patience were talking about seth hes socially stunted and he defies authority consistently hes regularly given inschool suspension he needs supervision here at home when it comes to this area of his life youre going to have to take an active roll in his schoolwork and his behavior seems to me a kid gets bs he ought to be left the hell alone but he held up a hand before she could speak potential i had potential drummed into my head by the best well work on it good she went back to mopping i had communications from your lawyer in regard to the guardianship its likely youll be granted that at least temporarily but you can expect regular spot checks from social services meaning you meaning me cam paused a moment do you do windows she couldnt help it she laughed as she dumped sudsy water into the sink ive also talked to some of your neighbors and will talk to more she turned back from this point on your lifes an open book for me he rose took the mop and to please himself stood just an inch closer than was polite you let me know when you get to a chapter that interests you on a personal level her heart gave two hard knocks against her ribs a dangerous man she thought on a personal level i dont have time for much fiction she started to step back but he took her hand i like you miz spinelli i havent figured out why but i do that should make our association simpler wrong he skimmed his thumb over the back of her hand its going to make it complicated but i dont mind complications and its about time my luck started back on an upswing you like italian food with a name like spinelli he grinned right i could use a quiet meal in a decent restaurant with a pretty woman how about tonight i dont see any reason why you shouldnt have a quiet meal in a decent restaurant with a pretty woman tonight deliberately she eased her hand free but if youre asking me for a date the answers no first it wouldnt be smart second im booked damn it cam didnt you hear me honking anna turned and saw a soaking wet and bitterly angry man cart two heaping bags of groceries into the room he was tall bronzed and very nearly beautiful and spitting mad phillip shook the hair out of his eyes and focused on anna the shift of expression was quick and smooth from snarling to charming in the space of a single heartbeat hello sorry he dumped the bags on the table and smiled at her didnt know cam had company he spied the bucket the mop held between them and leaped to the wrong conclusion i didnt know he was going to hire domestic help but thank god phillip grabbed her hand kissed it i already adore you my brother phillip cam said dryly this is anna spinelli with social services you can take your ferragamo out of your mouth now phil the charm didnt shift or fade ms spinelli its nice to meet you our lawyers been in touch i believe yes he has mr quinn tells me youll be living here now i told you to call me cam he walked to the stove to top off his coffee its going to be confusing if youre calling all of us mr quinn cam heard the rattle at the back door and got out another mug especially now he said as the door burst open and let in a dripping dog and man christ this bitch blew in fast even as ethan dragged off his slicker the dog set his feet and shook furiously anna only winced as water sprayed her suit barely smelled her before he spotted anna and automatically pulled off his soaked cap then scooped a hand through his damp curling hair seeing woman bucket mop he thought guiltily about his muddy boots maam my other brother ethan cam handed ethan a steaming cup of coffee this is the social worker your dogs just sprayed water and dog hair all over sorry simon go sit its all right cam went on foolish already slobbered all over her and phillip just got finished hitting on her anna smiled blandly i thought you were hitting on me i asked you to dinner cam corrected if id been hitting on you i wouldnt have been subtle cam sipped his coffee well now you know all the players she felt outnumbered and more than a little unprofessional standing there in the dimly lit kitchen in her bare feet facing three big and outrageously handsome men in defense she pulled out every scrap of dignity and reached for a chair gentlemen shall we sit down this seems to be an ideal time to discuss how you plan to care for seth she angled her head at cam for the foreseeable future well phillip said an hour later i think we pulled that off cam stood at the front door watching the neat little sports car drive away in the thinning rain shes got our number cam muttered she doesnt miss a trick i liked her ethan stretched out in the big wing chair and let the puppy climb into his lap get your mind out of the sewer cam he suggested when cam snickered i mean i liked her shes smart and shes professional but shes not cold seems like a woman who cares and shes got great legs phillip added but regardless of all that shes going to note down every time we screw up right now i figure weve got the upper hand weve got the kid and he wants to stay his mothers run off to god knows where and isnt making any noises at the moment but if pretty anna spinelli talks to too many people around st chris shes going to start hearing the rumors he dipped his hands in his pockets and started to pace i dont know if theyre going to count against us or not theyre just rumors ethan said yeah but theyre ugly weve got a good shot at keeping seth because of dads reputation that reputation gets smeared and well have battles to fight on several fronts anyonetries to smear dads rep theyre going to get more than a fight phillip turned to cam thats just what we have to avoid if we start going around kicking ass its only going to make things worse so you be the diplomat cam shrugged and sat on the arm of the sofa ill kick ass id say were better off dealing with what is than what might be thoughtfully ethan stroked the puppy ive been thinking about the situation its going to be rough for phillip to live here and commute back and forth to baltimore sooner rather than later cams going to get fed up with playing house sooners already here i was thinking we could pay grace to do some of the housework maybe a couple days a week now thats an idea i can get behind one hundred percent cam dropped onto the sofa trouble with that is it leaves you with nothing much to do the idea is for the three of us to be here share responsibility for seth thats what the lawyer says thats what the social worker says i said id find work what are you going to do phillip asked pump gas shuck oysters youd put up with that for a couple of days cam leaned forward i can stick can you odds are after the first week of commuting youll be calling from baltimore with excuses about why you cant make it back why dont you stay here and try pumping gas or shucking oysters for a while the argument was inevitable in minutes they were both up and nose to nose it took several attempts before ethans voice got through cam stepped back and with a puzzled frown turned what i said i think we ought to try building boats building boats cam shook his head for what for business ethan took out a cigar but ran it through his fingers rather than lighting it his mother hadnt allowed smoking in the house we got a lot of tourists coming down this way in the last few years and a lot more people moving down to get out of the city they like to rent boats they like to own boats last year i built one in my spare time for this guy out of dc little fourteenfoot skiff called me a couple months ago to see if id be interested in building him another one wants a bigger boat with a sleep cabin and galley ethan tucked the cigar back in his pocket ive been thinking on it itd take me months to do it alone in my spare time you want us to help you build a boat phillip pressed his fingers to his eyes not one boat im talking about going into business im in business phillip muttered im in advertising and wed be needing somebody who knew about that kind of thing if we were starting a business boat buildings got a history in this area but nobodys doing it anymore on st chris phillip sat did it occur to you that there might be a reason for that yeah it occurred to me and i thought about it and i figure its because nobodys taking the chance im talking wooden boats sailing vessels a specialty and we already got one client cam rubbed his chin hell ethan i havent done that kind of work seriously since we built your skipjack thats been jesus almost ten years and shes holding isnt she so we did a good job with her its a gamble he added knowing that single word was the way to cams heart weve got money for startup costs cam murmured warming up to the idea how do you know phillip demanded you dont have a clue how much money you need for startup costs youll figure it out a roll of the dice cam thought he liked nothing better christ knows id rather be swinging a hammer than a damn vacuum hose im in just like that phillip threw up his hands without a thought to overhead profit and loss licenses taxes insurance where the hell are you going to set up shop howre you going to run the business end thats not my problem cam said with a grin that would be yours i have a job in baltimore i had a life cam said simply in europe phillip paced away back away again trapped was all he could think ill do what i can to get things started this could be a huge mistake and its going to cost a lot of money and youd both better consider that the social worker might take a dim view of us starting a risky business at this point im not giving up my job at least thats one steady income ill talk to her about it cam decided on impulse see how she reacts youll talk to grace about pitching in around the house he asked ethan yeah ill go down to the pub and run it by her fine that leaves you to deal with seth tonight he smiled thinly at phillip make sure he does his homework oh god now that thats settled cam eased back whos cooking dinner chapter six contents prev next tracking down anna spinelli was the perfect excuse to escape the postdinner chaos at home it meant the dishes were someone elses problem and that he couldnt be pulled into the homework argument that had just begun to heat up between phillip and seth in fact as far as cam was concerned a rainy evening drive to princess anne was high entertainment and that was pretty pitiful for a man whod grown accustomed to jetting from paris to rome he tried not to think about it hed arranged to have his hydrofoil stored his clothes packed up and sent he had yet to have his car shipped over though it was just a bit too permanent a commitment but between the time spent repairing steps and doing laundry hed entertained himself by tuning up and tinkering with his mothers prized vette it gave him a great deal of pleasure to drive it so much that he accepted the speeding ticket he collected just outside of princess anne without complaint the town wasnt the hive of activity it had been during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when tobacco had been king and wealth poured into the area but it was pretty enough cam supposed with the old homes restored and preserved the streets clean and quiet now that tourism was becoming the newest deity for the shore the charm and grace of historic towns were a huge economic draw annas apartment was less than half a mile from the offices of social services easy walking distance to work to the courts shopping was convenient he imagined shed chosen the old victorian house for those reasons as well as for the ambience the building was tucked behind big trees their branches now hazed with new leaves the walkway was cracked but flanked by daffodils that were ready to pop out with sunny yellow steps led to a covered veranda the plaque beside the door stated that the house was on the historic register the door itself was unlocked and led cam into a hallway the wood floor was a bit worn but someone had troubled to polish it to a dull gleam the mail slots on the wall were brass again polished and indicated that the building had been converted to four apartments a spinelli occupied b cam trooped up the creaking stairs to the second floor the hallway was more narrow here the lights dimmer the only sound he heard was the muffled echo of what sounded like a riotous sitcom from the television of a he knocked on annas door and waited then he knocked again tucked his hands in his pockets and scowled hed expected her to be home hed never considered otherwise it was nearly nine oclock a weeknight and she was a civil servant she should have been quietly at home reading a book or filling out forms and reports that was how practical career women spent their evenings though he hoped eventually to show her a more entertaining way to pass the time probably at some womens club meeting he decided annoyed with her he searched the pockets of his black leather bomber jacket for a scrap of paper and was about to disturb a in hopes of borrowing something to write on and with when he heard the quick rhythmic click that an experienced man recognized as a womans high heels against wood he glanced down the hall pleased that his luck had changed he barely noticed that his jaw dropped the woman who walked toward him was built like a mans darkest fantasy and she was generous enough to showcase that killer body in a snug electricblue dress scooped low at the breasts and cut high on the thighs it left nothing and everything to a males imagination the click of heels on wood was courtesy of ice pick heels in the same shocking color which turned her legs into endless fascination her hair dewy with rain curled madly to her shoulders a thick ebony mane that brought images of gypsies and campfire sex to mind her mouth was red and wet her eyes huge and dark the scent of her reached him ten seconds before she did and delivered a breathtaking punch straight to the loins she said nothing only narrowed those amazing eyes cocked one glorious hip and waited well he had to work on getting his breath back i guess youve never heard the one about hiding your light under a bushel ive heard it she was furious to find him on her doorstep furious that she was without her professional armor and even more furious that hed been on her mind throughout the evening a great deal more than her date what do you want mr quinn now he grinned fast and sharp as a wolf baring fangs thats a loaded question at the moment miz spinelli dont be ordinary quinn youve avoided that so far i promise you i dont have a single ordinary thought in my mind unable to resist he reached out to toy with the ends of her hair where ya been anna look its well after business hours and my personal life isnt she broke off struggled not to curse or moan as the door across the hall opened youre back from your date anna yes mrs hardelman the woman of about seventy was wrapped in a pink chenille robe and peered over the glasses perched on her nose heat and canned laughter poured out into the hall she beamed at cam the smile lighting her pleasant face oh hes much betterlooking than the last one thanks cam stepped over and smiled back does she have a lot of them oh they come and they go mrs hardelman chuckled and fluffed at her thin white hair she never keeps them cam leaned companionably on the doorjamb enjoying the sounds of frustration anna made behind him guess she hasnt found one worth keeping yet she sure is pretty and such a nice girl she picks up things at the market for us if sister and i arent feeling up to going out always offers to drive us to church on sunday and when my petie died anna took care of the burial herself mrs hardelman looked over at anna with such affection and sweetness anna could only sigh youre missing your show mrs hardelman oh yes she glanced back into the apartment where the television blasted i do love my comedies you come back now she told cam and gently closed the door and because anna was perfectly aware that her neighbor wouldnt be able to resist peeping through the security hole hoping to catch a romantic goodnight kiss she dug out her keys you might as well come in since youre here thanks he crossed the hall waiting while she unlocked her door you buried your neighbors husband her parakeet anna corrected petie was a bird she and her sister have both been widows for about twenty years and all i did was get a shoe box and dig a hole out back next to a rosebush he brushed a hand over her hair again as she pushed the door open it meant something to her watch your hands quinn she warned and flicked on the lights to indicate that he was willing to oblige he held them out then tucked them into his pockets while he studied the room soft deep cushions bright bold colors he decided the choices meant she had a deeprooted sensual side he liked to think that the room was spacious and shed furnished it sparingly the sofa was big and plush enough for sleeping but there was only a wide upholstered chair and two tables to keep it company yet shed covered the walls with art prints posters penandink sketches they were of places rather than people and many of the scenes he recognized the narrow streets of rome the wild cliffs of western ireland the classy little cafes of paris ive been here he tapped the frame of the paris cafe how nice for you she said it dryly trying not to resent the fact that her pictures were the only way she could afford to travel for now now what are you doing here i wanted to talk to you about he made the mistake of turning looking at her again she was obviously a very annoyed woman but it only added to her appeal her eyes and mouth were sulky her body braced in challenge christ youre a looker anna i was attracted to you before i imagine you caught that but who knew she didnt want to be flattered she certainly didnt want her heartbeat to pick up speed and lose its steady rhythm but it was difficult to control either reaction when a man like cameron quinn was standing there looking at her as if hed like to start nibbling at any single part of her body and keep going till hed devoured it all she took a careful breath you wanted to talk to me about she prompted the kid stuff how about some coffee thats civilized right he decided to test them both by walking to her i figure you expect me to act civilized im willing to give it a shot she brooded a moment then pivoted on those sexy blue heels cam appreciated the rear view rolled his eyes toward heaven then followed her to the spotless counter that separated living room and kitchen he leaned on it pleased that the location gave him a perfect view of her legs then he heard the electric rumble and caught the amazing scent of fresh coffee you grind your own beans if youre going to make coffee you might as well make good coffee yeah he closed his eyes to better appreciate the aroma oh yeah do i have to marry you to get you to make my coffee every day or can we just live together she looked over her shoulder lifted her brows at his wide winning grin then got back to the task at hand i bet youve used that look to shut men down with enormous success but me i like it so where were you tonight i had a date he moved around the counter the kitchen area was small no more than a narrow passageway he liked being close enough so that her scent mixed with the smell of coffee early evening he commented it was going to be she felt the hair on the back of her neck prickle he was too damn close instinctively she employed her usual method with men who crowded her space she rammed her elbow into his gut practiced move he murmured and rubbing his stomach backed off an inch do you ever have to use it in your social worker mode rarely how do you want your coffee strong and black she set it to brew turned around and bumped solidly into him her radar she decided as his hands came up to take her arms had definitely been off or she was forced to admit shed ignored it because shed wondered how they might fit well now she knew he deliberately kept his eyes on her face didnt let them dip down to the small gold cross nestled between her breasts he wasnt particularly devout but he was afraid he would go to hell for having lascivious thoughts about the framework for a religious symbol besides he liked her face quinn she said with a long irritated sigh back off you dropped the mister quinn does that mean were pals because he smiled when he said it and because he did step back she found herself chuckling jurys still out i like the way you smell anna lusty provocative challenging of course i like the way miz spinelli smells too quiet and practical and subtle all right cam she turned took out two pretty deep cups from the cupboard lets stop dancing and agree that were attracted to each other i was hoping once we agreed to that wed start dancing wrong she tossed her hair back and poured coffee im seths caseworker youre proposing to be his guardian it would be incredibly unwise for either of us to act on a physical attraction he picked up the cup leaned back against the counter i dont know about you but i love doing stuff thats unwise especially if it feels good he brought the cup to his lips then smiled slowly and i bet acting on that physical attraction would feel damn good its fortunate that i happen to be very wise with a mirroring smile she leaned back on the opposite counter now you wanted to discuss seth and stuff as i believe you put it seth the rest of his brothers and the situation had gone completely out of his mind he supposed hed used it as an excuse to see her that was something to consider later i have to admit coming into princess anne to talk to you was a great reason to escape i was about to get stuck with dish duty and phil and the kid were already into round one on the homework issue im glad someones dealing with his schoolwork and why dont you ever refer to seth by his name i do sure i do no not as a rule she cocked her head is that a habit of yours cameron to avoid the personal contact of names with people you dont intend to have an important or permanent relationship with her point he was forced to admit but he lifted a brow i use your name he saw her blink heard her sigh then she waved the issue away what about seth its not about him directly except i figure were starting to divvy things up more evenhandedly phils the best to keep on him keep on seth he corrected with emphasis about school because for some reason phil actually liked school and we decided to get somebody to come in and deal with most of the housework a couple of days a week she still had a picture of him standing in a puddle of suds with a look of baffled fury on his face her lips wanted badly to twitch into a smile youll be happier i hope never to see another vacuum cleaner bag ever had one rip on you he shuddered deliberately and made her laugh anyhow ethan had this brainstorm im at loose ends phillip needs something to occupy him if hes going to be staying here though he figures on commuting to baltimore for now so were going into business into business what kind of business boat building she lowered her cup youre going to build boats ive built plenty so has ethan and actually though phil went over to the suitandtie life hes done some himself the three of us worked on the skipjack that ethan still sails thats fine for recreation for personal use for a hobby but to consider starting a business a risky one at the very time when youre trying to take on a minor dependent he wont go hungry for christs sake ethan holds his own on the bay and phils got that desk job in baltimore i could get busywork but whats the point im only pointing out that a venture of this nature would consume a great deal of money and time particularly during the first months stability isnt every damn thing annoyed he set his coffee down and began to pace shouldnt the kid learn theres more to life than ninetofiving it that there can be choices that you can take a chance how good is it for him if im stuck in that house dusting furniture and hating every goddamn minute of it ethans already got one client and if ethan brought this up you can believe hes weighed it from every angle nobody thinks things through as much as he does and since you felt you wanted to discuss this with me im simply trying to do the same weigh it from every angle and you think it would be better if i went out and got some nice stable timeclock job that brings in a nice stable timeclock paycheck every week he stopped in front of her is that the kind of man who appeals to you the kind who reports in at nine five days a week who takes you out to dinner on a rainy night and lets you get away at a reasonable hour without even trying to convince you to take off what there is of that dress she took a minute reminding herself it wouldnt solve anything if both of them lost the battle with temper what appeals to me what i wear and how i choose to spend my evenings arent the issues here as seths caseworker im concerned that his home life be as stable and happy as possible why should me building boats make him unhappy my question regarding this idea of yours is whether your attention will be taken away from him and turned toward this new business a business that you would i imagine find exciting challenging and interesting at least for a time his eyes narrowed you just dont think i can stick do you thats yet to be proved but i do think youll try what worries me is that youre not trying for seth youre trying for your father for your parents i dont think thats a count against you cam she said more gently but its not a point in seths favor how the hell did you argue with a woman who insisted on dotting every i he wondered so you think hes better off with strangers no i think hes better off with you and your brothers she smiled satisfied that she had shut him up for the moment and thats what went into my report this idea of starting a boatbuilding business is something new to think about and i hope none of you intends to rush into it do you sail no ive never tried it why id never been on a boat in my life until ray quinn took me out because he remembered how those eyes of hers could warm with compassion he decided to tell her how it had been for him i was scared to death but too tough to admit it id only been with them a few days never figured id stay he took me out on this little sunfish he had back then told me the air would do me good all he had to do was think and the image of that morning came clear as sunlight in his head my father was a big man the mighty quinn built like a bull i knew that little boat was going to tip over and id probably drown but he had a way of getting you to do things love anna thought it was pure and simple love in his voice it attracted her she admitted every bit as much as that toughly handsome face could you swim no but i still hated it that he made me wear a pfd personal flotation device he explained life jacket figured it was for sissies youd rather have drowned hell no but i had to make him think so anyway i sat in the stern my stomach clutched i was wearing these sunglasses my mother stella he corrected for shed been stella then had dug up somewhere because my eye was pretty banged up and the sunlight hurt hed been beaten abused neglected she remembered when the quinns had found him her heart went out to the little boy you must have been terrified down to the bone but id have choked on my tongue before id have admitted it he must have known that cam said quietly he always knew what was in my head it was hot and the humidity was up so that every time you took a breath it was like swallowing water he said it would be cooler when we moved out of the gut and onto the river but i didnt believe him i figured wed just sit there and fry the boat didnt even have a motor christ he laughed when i said that he told me we had something better than a motor hed forgotten his coffee and even the point of the story drifted away in the memory we headed out across the water slow and easy at first the boat rocked when we turned into the bend and i figured that was it game over this heron came out of the trees id seen it once before at least i like to think it was the same one it winged right over the boat wings spread to trap the air and then we caught the wind and that little sail filled we started to fly he turned around and grinned at me i didnt even know i was grinning back until i split my lip open again id never felt like that before in my life not once without thinking he lifted his hand and tucked her hair behind her ear not once in my life it changed you she knew that single moments both simple and dramatic could alter courses forever it started to a boat on the water and people who were giving me a chance it wasnt much more complicated than that it doesnt have to be that much more complicated here well have the kid swing the hammer put some sweat and effort into building a boat if its going to be a quinn operation that includes him her smile came quickly fully and to his surprise she patted him on the cheek that last part said it all its a gamble im not sure if its the time or the place for one but it should be interesting to watch is that what youre going to do he eased forward nudging her back against the counter watch me i dont intend to take my eyes off you on a professional level until im assured that you and your brothers provide seth with the proper home and guardianship fair enough he moved in just a little closer just a fraction till two welltoned bodies brushed and how about on a personal level she weakened enough to let her gaze skim down linger his mouth was definitely tempting dangerous and very close keeping my eyes on you on a personal level isnt a hardship a mistake maybe but not a hardship i always figure if youre going to make a mistake he put his hands on the counter caging her make it a big one what do you say anna he dipped his head a little lower hovered she tried to think to consider the consequences but there were times when needs desire and lust simply overpowered logic hell she muttered and cupping her hand at the back of his neck dragged his mouth down on hers it was exactly as she wanted hungry and fierce and mindless his mouth was hot and it was hard and it was almost heathen as he crushed down to devour hers she gave in to it gave all to it a moments madness where body ruled mind and blood roared over reason and the thrill snapped through her like a whip sharp painful and with a quick shocking burn christ his breath was gone his mind was reeling reflexively his hands dug into the counter before he jerked them away and filled them with her whatever hed expected whatever hed imagined didnt come close to the volcano that had so suddenly erupted in his arms he dragged a hand through her hair the wild curling mass of it fisted it there then plundered as if his life depended on it cant she managed but her arms wound around him banded around him until it seemed his heart wasnt merely thundering against hers but inside hers her moan was a rumble of desperate delirious pleasure that sounded in her throat exactly where his teeth nipped then scraped then dug greedily into flesh the counter bit into her back her fingers bit into his hips as she dragged him closer oh god she wanted contact friction more she found his mouth with hers again plunged blindly into the next kiss just one more she promised herself meeting matching his reckless demand her scent seduced his senses her name was a murmur on his lips a whisper in his mind her body was a glorious banquet melded to his no woman had ever filled him so quickly so completely so utterly to the exclusion of all else let me it was a plea and hed never in his life begged for a woman for gods sake anna let me have you his hands ran up her legs those endless thighs now she wanted it would be so easy to take and be taken but easy she knew was rarely right no not now regret smothered her even as she lifted her hands to frame his face for a moment longer her mouth stayed on his not yet not like this her eyes were dark clouded he knew enough of a womans pleasures and his own skills to believe he could make them go blind its perfect like this the timings wrong the circumstances wait someone had to move she decided to break that contact she sidestepped let out a shaky breath she closed her eyes lifted a hand to hold him off well she managed after another moment that was insane he took the hand shed raised brought it to his lips and nipped his teeth into her forefinger who needs sanity i do she nearly managed a genuine smile as she tugged her hand free not that i dont regret that deeply at this moment but i do need it wow she drew in another long breath pushed her hands up through her hair cameron youre every bit as potent as i expected i havent even started the smile widened i bet i just bet she eased back a little more picked up her rapidly cooling coffee i dont know as that episodes going to make either one of us sleep easier tonight but it was bound to happen she angled her head when his eyes narrowed what most women especially in your position would make excuses for what she lifted a shoulder and promised herself her system would level again eventually that was as much my doing as yours i wondered what it might be like to get my hands on you from the first time i saw you cam decided he might never be the same again i think im crazy about you no youre not she laughed and handed him his coffee youre intrigued youre attracted youve got a good healthy case of lust but those are entirely different matters and you dont even know me i want to he let out a short laugh and thats a big surprise to me i dont usually care one way or the other im flattered im not sure if thats a tribute to your charm or my own stupidity but im flattered but damn i knew that was coming but she repeated and set her cup in the sink seth is my priority he has to be the warmth that was both compassion and understanding came into her eyes and it touched something in him that was buried under that healthy lust and he should be yours i hope im around if and when that happens im doing everything i can think of i know you are and youre doing more than most would she touched his arm briefly then moved away i have a feeling youve got more inside you yet but there it is again youd better go now he wanted to stay even if it was just to stand there and talk to her to be i havent finished my coffee its cold and its getting late she glanced toward the window where raindrops ran like tears and the rain makes me wonder about things i shouldnt be wondering about he winced i dont suppose you said that to make me suffer sure i did she laughed again and moved to the door opened it wide to make her point if im going to why shouldnt you oh i like you anna spinelli youre a woman after my own heart youre not interested in a woman going for your heart she said as he crossed the room you want one whos after your body see were getting to know each other already good night she didnt evade when he pulled her in for another kiss as he walked out the door evading would have been a pretense and she wasnt one to delude herself so she met the kiss with teasing heat and honest enthusiasm then she shut the door in his face and then she leaned back against it weakly potent that wasnt the half of it her pulse was likely to stay on overdrive for hours maybe days she wished she didnt feel so damn happy about it chapter seven contents prev next cam was scowling at a basket full of pink socks and jockey shorts when the phone rang he knew damn well the socks and underwear had been white or close to it when hed dumped them in the machine now they were easteregg pink maybe they just looked that way because they were wet he pulled them out to stuff them in the dryer saw the red sock hiding among the pink and bared his teeth phillip he vowed was a dead man fuck it he dumped them inside slapped the dryer on what he hoped was broil and went to answer the phone he remembered just in time to turn down the little portable tv tucked in the corner of the counter it wasnt as if he was actually watching it it certainly wasnt that he was paying any attention at all to the passion and betrayals of the latemorning soap opera hed just switched it on for the noise quinn what hey cam took some doing to track you down hoss tod bardette here cam reached into an open bag of oreos on the counter and took out a handful hows it going tod well i have to tell you its going pretty damn good ive been spending some time anchored off the great barrier reef nice spot cam muttered over a cookie then his brows shot up as an impossibly gorgeous woman tumbled into bed with a ridiculously handsome man on the tiny screen across the kitchen maybe there was something to this daytime tv after all itll do heard you kicked ass in the med a few weeks ago a few weeks cam thought while he munched on a second cookie surely it had been a few years ago that hed flown across the finish line in his hydrofoil blue water speed cheering crowds and money to burn now he was lucky if he found enough milk in the fridge to wash down a stale oreo yeah thats what i heard too tod gave a rich chuckle well the offer to buy that toy from you still holds but i got another proposition coming at you tod bardette always had another proposition coming at you he was the rich son of a rich father from east texas who used the world as his playground and he was boat happy he raced them sponsored races bought and sold them and collected wives trophies and his share of the purse with smooth regularity cam had always felt tods luck had run hot since conception since it never hurt to listen and the bedroom scene had just been displaced by a commercial featuring a giant toilet brush he switched off the set im always ready to hear one im setting up a crew for la coupe internationale the oneton cup cam felt his juices begin to flow and he lost all interest in cookies and milk the international race was a giant in the sailing world five legs he thought the final one an ocean race of three hundred grueling miles you got it you know the aussies took the cup last year so its being held down here in australia i want to whip their butts and ive got a honey of a boat shes fast hoss with the right crew shell bring the cup back to the u s of a i need a skipper i want the best i want you how soon can you get down under give me five minutes thats what he wanted to say he could have a bag packed in one hop a plane and be on his way for men who raced it was one of lifes golden opportunities even as he opened his mouth his gaze landed on the rocker outside the kitchen window so he closed his eyes listened resentfully to the hum of the pink socks drying in the utility room behind him i have to pass tod i cant get away now lookie here im willing to give you some time to put your affairs pun intended he said with a snorting laugh in order take a couple weeks if youve got another offer ill beat it i cant do it ive got laundry to do a kid to raise damn if he was going to humiliate himself with that piece of information my brothers and i started a business he said on impulse ive got a commitment here a business this time tods laugh was long and delighted you dont pull my leg so hard it hurts now cams eyes narrowed he didnt doubt tod bardette of east texas would be joined by others of his friends and acquaintances in laughing at the idea of cameron quinn businessman were building boats he said between his teeth here on the eastern shore wooden boats custom jobs he added determined to play it to the hilt one of a kinds in six months youll be paying me top dollar to design and build you a boat by quinn since were old friends ill try to squeeze you in boats the interest in tods voice picked up well now you know how to sail them guess maybe youd know how to build them theres no maybe about it thats an interesting enterprise but come on cam youre not a businessman youre not going to stay stuck on some pretty little bay in maryland eating crabs and nailing planks you know ill make this race worth your while money fame and fortune and he chuckled after we win you can go back and put a couple of little sloops together he could handle it cam promised himself he could handle the insults the frustration of not being able to pack and go as he chose what he wouldnt do was give bardette the satisfaction of knowing he was ruffled youre going to have to find another skipper but if you want to buy a boat give me a call if you actually get one finished give me a call a sigh came through the receiver youre missing the chance of a lifetime here you change your mind in the next couple hours get in touch but i need to nail down my crew this week talk to you and cam was listening to a dial tone he didnt hurl the receiver through the window he wanted to considered it then figured hed be the one sweeping up the glass so what would be the point so he hung up the phone with careful deliberation he even took a deep breath and if whatever hed put in the washing machine hadnt chosen that moment to spin out of balance and send the machine hopping he wouldnt have slammed his fist into the wall i thought for a minute there you were going to pull it off he whirled and saw his father sitting at the kitchen table chuckling oh god this caps it why dont you get some ice for your knuckles its all right cam glanced down at them a couple of scrapes and the sharp pain was a good hold on reality i thought about this dad really thought about it i just dont believe youre here ray continued to smile youre here cam thats what matters it was tough turning down a race like that im grateful to you im proud of you bardette said he had a honey of a boat with his money behind it cam pressed his hands on the counter and stared out the window toward the quiet water i could win that bastard i captained a crew to second in the little americas cup five years ago and i took the chicagomackinac last year youre a fine sailor cam yeah he curled his fingers into fists what the hell am i doing here if this keeps up im going to get hooked on soap operas ill start thinking lilac and lance are not only real people but close personal friends ill start obsessing that my whites arent white enough ill clip coupons and collect recipes and go the rest of the way out of my fucking mind im surprised at you thinking of tending a home in those terms rays voice was sharp now with disappointment around the edges making a home caring for family is important work the most important work there is its not my work it seems it is now im sorry for that cam turned back if you were going to have a conversation with a hallucination you might as well look at it for what for dying on me well that was pretty inconvenient all around he would have laughed the comment and the ironic tone were so typically ray quinn but he had to get out what was nibbling at his mind some people are saying you aimed for the pole rays smile faded and his eyes turned sober and sad do you believe that no cam let out a breath no i dont believe that lifes a gift it doesnt always fit comfortably but its precious i wouldnt have hurt you and your brothers by throwing mine away i know that cam murmured it helps to hear you say it but i know that maybe i could have stopped things maybe i could have done things differently he sighed and turned the gold wedding band around and around on his finger but i didnt its up to you now you and ethan and phillip there was a reason the three of you came to me and stella a reason the three of you came together i always believed that now i know it and what about the kid seths place is here he needs you hes in trouble right now and he needs you to remember what it was like to be where he is what do you mean hes in trouble ray smiled a little answer the phone he suggested seconds before it rang and then he was gone ive got to start getting more sleep cam decided then yanked the receiver off the hook yeah yeah hello mr quinn right this is cameron quinn mr quinn this is abigail moorefield vice principal of st christopher middle school cam felt his stomach sink to his toes uhhuh im afraid theres been some trouble here i have seth delauter in my office what kind of trouble seth was in a fight with another student hes being suspended mr quinn id appreciate it if you could come to my office so matters can be explained to you and you can take seth home great wonderful at his wits end cam dragged a hand through his hair on my way the school hadnt changed much cam noted since hed done time there the first morning hed passed through those heavy front doors stella quinn had all but dragged him he was nearly eighteen years older now and no more enthusiastic the floors were faded linoleum the light bright from wide windows and the smell was of contraband candy and kid sweat cam jammed his hands in his pockets and headed for the administration offices he knew the way after all hed beaten a path to those offices countless times during his stay at st chris middle it wasnt the same old eagleeyed secretary manning the desk in the outer room this one was younger perkier and beamed smiles all over him may i help you she asked in a bouncing voice im here to post bail for seth delauter she blinked at that and her smile turned puzzled i beg your pardon cameron quinn to see the vp oh you mean mrs moorefield yes shes expecting you second door down the little hallway there on the right her phone rang and she plucked it up good morning she sang st christophers middle school this is kathy speaking cam decided he preferred the battleax who had guarded the offices in his day to this terminally pert newcomer even as he started toward the door his back went up his jaw set and his palms went damp some things he supposed never changed mrs moorefield was sitting behind her desk calmly entering data into a computer cam thought her fingers moved efficiently and the movement suited her she was neat and trim probably early fifties her hair was short and sleek and light brown her face composed and quietly attractive her gold wedding band caught the light as her fingers moved over the keys the only other jewelry she wore were simple gold shells at her ears across the room seth was slumped in a chair staring up at the ceiling trying to look bored cam assumed but coming off as sulky kid needed a haircut he realized and wondered who was supposed to deal with that he was wearing jeans frayed to strings at the cuffs a jersey two sizes too big and incredibly dirty hightops it looked perfectly normal to cam he rapped on the doorjamb both the vice principal and seth glanced over with two dramatically different expressions mrs moorefield smiled in polite welcome seth sneered mr quinn yeah then he remembered he was supposed to be here as a responsible guardian i hope we can straighten this out mrs moorefield he stuck his own polite smile into place as he stepped to her desk and offered a hand i appreciate your coming in so quickly when we have to take regrettable disciplinary action such as this against a student we want the parents or responsible parties to have the opportunity to understand the situation please mr quinn sit down what is the situation cam took his seat and found he didnt like it any more than he used to im afraid seth physically attacked another student this morning between classes the other boy is being treated by the school nurse and his parents have been informed cam lifted a brow so where are they both of roberts parents are at work at the moment but in any case why her smile returned small attentive questioning why mr quinn why did seth slug robert mrs moorefield sighed i understand youve only recently taken over as seths guardian so you may not be aware that this isnt the first time hes fought with other students i know about it im asking about this incident very well she folded her hands according to robert seth demanded that robert give him a dollar and when robert refused to pay him seth attacked him at this point she added shifting her gaze to seth seth has neither confirmed nor denied school policy requires that students be suspended for three days as a disciplinary action when involved in a fight on school premises okay cam rose but when seth started to get up he pointed a finger stay he ordered then crouched until they were eye to eye you try to shake this kid down seth jerked a shoulder thats what he says you slugged him yeah i slugged him went for the nose he added with a thin smile and shoved at the strawcolored hair that flopped into his eyes it hurts more whyd you do it maybe i didnt like his fat face with his patience as frayed as seths jeans cam gripped seth by the shoulders when seth winced and hissed in a breath alarm bells went off before seth could evade him cam tugged the arm of the oversized jersey down nasty little bruises knuckle rappers cam would have called them ran from seths shoulder to his elbow get off me his face heated with shame seth squirmed but cam merely shifted him scrapes were scored high on seths back red and raw hold still cam moved his grip and laid his hands on the arms of the chair his eyes stayed on seth you tell me what went down and dont even think about lying to me i dont want to talk about it i didnt ask you what you wanted im telling you to spill it or he said lowering his voice so only seth could hear are you going to let that punk get away clean seth opened his mouth closed it again he had to set his jaw so it wouldnt wobble he was pissed off we had this history test the other day and i aced it an idiot couldve gotten an ace but hes less than an idiot and he flunked so he kept hassling me dogged me down the hall jabbing at me i walked away because im sick to death of iss of what seth rolled his eyes inschool suspension its boring i didnt want to do more time so i walked but he kept jabbing and calling me names egghead teachers pet and all that shit didnt let it bother me but then he shoved me back against the lockers and he said i was just a son of a whore and everybody knew it so i decked him shamed and sick he jerked a defiant shoulder so i get a threeday vacation big deal cam nodded and rose when he turned around his eyes were nearly black with fury youre not suspending this kid for defending himself against an ignorant bully and if you try ill go over your head to the board of education shocked to the core seth stared up at cam nobody had ever stood up for him hed never expected anyone to stand up for him mr quinn nobody calls my brother a son of a whore mrs moorefield and if you dont have a school policy against vicious namecalling and harassment you damn well should so im telling you you better take another look at this situation and you better rethink just who gets suspended here and you can tell little roberts parents that if they dont want their kid crying over a bloody nose they better teach him some manners she took a moment before speaking shed been teaching and counseling children for nearly thirty years what she saw on seths face at that moment was hope stunned and wary but hope nonetheless it was a look she didnt want to extinguish mr quinn you can be certain that i will investigate this matter further i wasnt aware that seth had been injured if youd like to take him down to the nurse while i speak with robert and others i can take care of him as you wish ill hold the suspension in abeyance until ive satisfied myself with the facts you do that mrs moorefield but im satisfied with the facts now im taking seth home for the rest of the day hes had enough i agree with you the child hadnt looked shaken when hed come into her office she thought hed looked cocky he hadnt looked shaken when shed told him to sit down and called his home hed looked belligerent but he looked shaken now finally with his eyes wide and stunned and his hands gripping the arms of the chair the thin hard shield hed kept tight around him a shield neither she nor any of his teachers had been able to so much as scratch appeared to be deeply dented now she decided they would see what they could do for him if you will bring seth into school in the morning and meet with me here well resolve the matter well be here lets go he said to seth and headed out as they walked down the hall toward the front doors their footsteps echoed hollowly cam glanced down noted that seth was staring at his shoes still gives me the creeps he said seth shoved at the door what the way it sounds when you take the long walk to the vps office seth snorted hunched his shoulders and kept walking his stomach felt as if a thousand butterflies had gone to war inside it the american flag on the pole near the parking lot snapped in the wind from an open window behind them the pathetically offkey sounds of a midmorning music class clamored the elementary school was separated from the middle by a narrow swatch of grass and a few sadlooking evergreen bushes across the small outdoor track stood the brown brick of the high school it seemed smaller now cam noted almost quaint and not at all like the prison hed once imagined it to be he remembered leaning lazily against the hood of his first secondhand car in the parking lot and watching girls walking through those noisy hallways from class to class and watching girls sitting in the buttnumbing chairs during brainnumbing classes and watching girls the fact that his high school experience came back to him in a parade of varying female forms made him almost sentimental then a bell rang shrilly and the noise level through the open windows behind him erupted sentiment dried up quickly thank god was all he could think that chapter of his life was over but it wasnt over for the kid he remembered and since he was here he could try to help him through it they opened opposite doors of the vette and cam paused waited for their eyes to meet so do you figure you broke the assholes nose a glimmer of a smile worked around seths mouth maybe good cam got in slammed the door going for the nose is fine but if you dont want a lot of blood messing things up go for the belly a good solid short arm punch to the gut wont leave as much evidence seth considered the advice i wanted to see him bleed well you make your choices in life pretty good day for a sail he decided as he started the engine might as well i guess seth picked at the knee of his jeans someone had stood up for him was all his confused mind could think had believed him defended him and taken his part his arm hurt his shoulders ached but someone had taken his part thanks he muttered no problem you mess with one quinn you mess with them all he glanced over as he drove out of the lot and saw seth staring at him thats how it shakes down anyway lets get some burgers or something to take on the boat yeah i could eat seth swiped a hand under his nose got a dollar when cam laughed and punched the accelerator it was one of the best moments of seths life the wind was out of the southwest and steady so that the marsh grasses waved lazily the sky was clear and cheerfully blue the perfect frame for the heron that rose up out of the waving grass over the glinting water then down like a flashing white kite to catch an early lunch on impulse cam had tossed some fishing gear into the boat with any luck theyd have fried fish for dinner seth already knew more about sailing than cam had expected he shouldnt have been surprised by it he realized anna had said the boy had a quick mind and ethan would have taught him well and patiently when he saw how easily seth handled the lines he trusted him to trim the jib the sails caught the wind and cam found speed god he had missed it the rush the power the control it poured through him clearing his mind of worries obligations disappointments even grief water below and sky above and his hands on the helm coaxing the wind daring it tricking it into giving more behind him seth grinned and caught himself just before he yelled out in delight hed never gone so fast with ray it had been slow and steady with ethan work and wonder but this was a wild free ride rising and falling with the waves shooting like a long white bullet to anywhere the wind nearly took his cap so he turned the bill backward so the breeze wouldnt catch it and flip it away they skimmed across the shoreline passed the waterfront docks that were the hub of st chris before they finally slowed an old skipjack no longer in use was docked there a symbol to the watermans way of life the men and women who harvested the bay brought their days catch there rounder and sea trout and rockfish at this time of year and whats the date cam demanded as he glanced over his shoulder like the thirtyfirst seth shoved up his wraparound sunglasses and stared at the dock he was hoping for a glimpse of grace he wanted to wave to someone he knew crab season starts tomorrow hot damn guarantee you tomorrow ethan brings home a bushel of beauties well eat like kings you like crabs right i dunno what do you mean you dont know cam popped the top of a coke and guzzled havent you had crab before no youd better prepare your mouth for a treat then kid because youll have it tomorrow mirroring cams move seth reached for a soft drink himself nothing you cooks a treat it was said with a grin and received with one i can do crab just fine nothing to it boiling water lots of spices then you pop those snapping bastards into the pot alive its the only way thats sick cam merely shifted his stance they arent alive for long then theyre dinner add a sixpack of beer and you got a feast another few weeks and were talking softshell blues you plop em between a couple pieces of bread and bite in this time seth actually felt his stomach roll not me too squeamish too civilized shit sometimes on saturday in the summer mom and dad used to bring us down to the docks wed get us some softshell crab sandwiches a tub of peanut oil fries and watch the tourists try to figure out what to eat laughed our asses off the memory made him suddenly sad and he tried to shake off the mood sometimes we sailed down like this or wed cruise down to the river and fish mom wasnt much on fishing so shed swim then shed head to shore and sit on the bank and read why didnt she just stay home she liked to sail cam said softly and she liked being there ray said she got sick yeah she got sick cam blew out a breath she had been the only woman hed ever loved the only woman hed ever lost the missing of her could still creep up and cut him off at the knees come about he ordered lets head down the annemessex and see if anythings biting it didnt occur to either of them that the three hours they spent on the water was the most peaceful interlude either had experienced in weeks and when they returned home with six fat striped bass in the cooler they were for the first time in total harmony know how to clean them cam asked maybe ray had taught him but seth was no fool i caught four of the six that ought to mean you clean them thats the beauty of being boss cam began then stopped dead when he saw sheets snapping on the ancient clothesline he hadnt seen anything hanging out on the line since his mother had gotten sick for a moment he was afraid he was having another hallucination and his mouth went dry then the back door opened and grace monroe stepped out on the porch hey grace it was the first time cam had heard seths voice raised in happiness and pure boyish pleasure it surprised him enough to make him look over sharply then nearly drop the cooler on his foot as seth let go of his end and dashed forward hey there she had a warm voice that contrasted with cool looks she was tall and slim with long limbs shed once dreamed of using as a dancer but grace had learned to put most of her dreams aside her hair was boyishly short and that was for convenience she didnt have the time or energy to worry about style it was a dark honey blond that was often streaked with paler color during the summer her eyes were a quiet green and all too often had shadows dogging them but her smile was pure and sunny and never failed to light up her face or to set the dimple just beside her mouth winking a pretty woman cam thought with the face of a pixie and the voice of a siren it amazed him that men werent throwing themselves at her feet the boy all but did cam noted surprised when seth just about ran into her open arms he hugged and was hugged this prickly kid who didnt like to be touched then he flushed and stepped back and began to play with the puppy whod followed grace out of the house afternoon cam grace shielded her eyes from the sun with the flat of her hand ethan came by the pub last night and said yall could use a hand around here youre taking over the housework well i can give you three hours two days a week until she got no farther for cam dumped the cooler took the steps three at a time and grabbed her into a loud enthusiastic kiss it set seths teeth on edge to see it even as grace stuttered and laughed thats nice she managed but youre still going to have to pay me name your price i adore you he snatched her hands and planted more kisses there my life for you i can see im going to be appreciated around here and needed ive got those pink socks soaking in some diluted bleach might do the trick the red sock was phils hes responsible i mean what reasonable guy even owns a pair of red socks well talk more about sorting laundry and checking pockets someones little black book went through the last cycle shit he caught her archedbrow look down at the boy and cleared his throat sorry i guess it was mine i made some lemonade and i was going to put a casserole together but it looks like you may have caught your supper tonights but we could do with a casserole too okay ethan wasnt really clear about what youd need or want done maybe we should go over things darling you do whatever you think we need and itll be more than we can ever repay shed already seen that for herself pink underwear she mused dust an inch thick on one table and unidentified substances sticking to another and the stove god only knew when it had last been cleaned it was good to be needed she thought good to know just what had to be done well take it as it goes then i may have to bring the baby along sometimes julie minds her at night when im working at the pub but i cant always find somebody to take her otherwise shes a good girl i can help you watch her seth offered i get home from school at threethirty since when cam wanted to know and seth shrugged when i dont have iss aubrey loves playing with you ive got another hour here today she said because she was a woman constantly forced to budget time so ill make up that casserole and put it in the freezer all you have to do is heat it up when you want it ill leave you a list of cleaning supplies youre low on or i can pick them up for you if you like pick them up for us cam could have knelt at her feet want a raise she laughed and started back inside seth you see that that pup stays out of the fish guts hell smell for a week otherwise okay sure ill be finished in a few minutes and ill be in he stood up then stepped off the porch so grace wouldnt hear him through the door manfully he sized up cam youre not going to start poking at her are you poking at her he was blank for a moment then shook his head for gods sake hefting the ice chest he started around the side of the house to the fishcleaning table ive known grace half my life and i dont poke at every woman i see okay then it was the boys tone that made cam run his tongue around his teeth as he set the cooler down possessive proprietary and satisfied so you got your eye on her yourself huh seth colored a little opened the drawer for the fish sealer i just look out for her thats all she sure is pretty cam said lightly and had the pleasure of seeing seths eyes flash with jealousy but as it happens im poking at another woman right now and it gets sticky if you try that with more than one at a time and this particular female is going to take a lot of convincing chapter eight contents prev next he decided to get started on poking at anna since she was on his mind cam left seth to deal with the last couple of fish on his own and wandered inside he made appreciative noises at whatever grace was putting together over at the stove then wandered upstairs hed have a little more privacy on the phone in his room and annas business card was in his pocket at the door to his room he stopped and could have wept with gratitude since his bed was freshly made the plain green spread professionally smoothed the pillows plumped he knew some of the sheets hanging out on the line were his tonight he would sleep on fresh clean sheets he hadnt even had to launder it made the prospect of sleeping alone a little more tolerable the surface of his old oak dresser wasnt just dustfree it gleamed the bookshelves that still held most of his trophies and some of his favorite novels had been tidied and the overstuffed chair hed taken to using as a catchall was now empty he hadnt a clue where shed put his things but he imagined hed find them in their logical place he supposed hed gotten spoiled living in hotels over the last few years but it did his heart good to walk into his bedroom and not see a half a dozen testy little chores waiting for attention things where looking up so he plopped down on the bed stretched out and reached for the phone anna spinelli her voice was low professionally neutral he closed his eyes to better fantasize how she looked he liked the idea of imagining her behind some bureaucratic desk wearing that tight little blue number shed had on the night before miz spinelli how do you feel about crabs ah let me rephrase that he scooted down until he was nearly flat and realized he could be asleep in five minutes without really trying how do you feel about eating steamed crabs i feel favorable good how about tomorrow night cameron here he specified at the house the house thats never empty tomorrows the first day of crab season ethanll bring home a bushel well cook them up you can see how the quinns what would you call it relate interact see how seths getting along acclimating to this particular home environment thats very good hey ive dealt with social workers before of course never one who wore blue high heels but i was off the clock she reminded him however i think dinner might be a workable idea what time sixthirty or thereabouts he heard the flap of papers and found himself slightly annoyed that she was checking her calendar all right i can do that sixthirty she sounded entirely too much like a social worker making an appointment to suit him you alone in there in my office yes at the moment why just wondering ive been wondering about you on and off all day why dont you let me come into town and get you tomorrow then i could drive you home we could stop and id say climb into the backseat but the vette doesnt have one still i think we could manage im sure we could which is why ill drive myself down im going to have to get my hands on you again i dont doubt thats going to happen eventually in the meantime i want you i know because her voice had thickened and didnt sound quite so prim he smiled why dont i tell you just what id like to do to you i can go step by step you can even take notes in your little book for future reference i think wed better postpone that though i may be interested in discussing it at another time im afraid i have an appointment in a few minutes ill see you and your family tomorrow evening give me ten minutes alone with you anna he whispered it ten minutes to touch you i we can try for that time frame tomorrow i have to go goodbye bye pleased that hed rattled her he slid the phone back on the hook and let himself drift off into a welldeserved nap he was awakened just over an hour later by the slamming of the front door and phillips raised and furious voice home sweet home cam muttered and rolled out of bed he stumbled to the door and down the hall to the steps he was a lousy napper and whenever he indulged he woke up groggy irritable and in desperate need of coffee by the time he got downstairs phillip was in the kitchen uncorking a bottle of wine where the hell is everybody phillip demanded i dunno get out of my way rubbing one hand over his face cam poured the dregs of the pot into a mug stuck the mug in the microwave and punched numbers at random ive been informed by the insurance company that theyre holding the claim until such time as an investigation is complete cam stared at the microwave willing those endless two minutes to pass so he could gulp caffeine his bleary brain took in insurance claim investigation and couldnt correlate the terms huh pull yourself together damn it phillip gave him an impatient shove they wont process dads policy because they suspect suicide thats bullshit he told me he didnt kill himself oh really sick and furious phillip still managed to raise an ironic eyebrow did you have this conversation with him before or after he died cam caught himself but very nearly flushed instead he cursed again and yanked open the microwave door i mean theres no way he would have and theyre just stalling because they dont want to pay off the point is theyre not paying off at this time their investigators been talking to people and some of those people were apparently delighted to tell him the seamier details of the situation and they know about the letter from seths mother the payments dad made to her so he sipped coffee scalded the roof of his mouth and swore hell with it let them keep their fucking blood money its not as simple as that number one is if they dont pay it goes down that dad committed suicide is that what you want no cam pinched the bridge of his nose to try to relieve some of the pressure that was building hed lived most of his life without headaches and now it seemed he was plagued with them which means wed have to accept their conclusions or wed have to take them to court to prove he didnt and itd be one hell of a public mess struggling to calm himself phillip sipped his wine either way it smears his name i think were going to have to find this woman gloria delauter after all we have to clear this up what makes you think finding her and talking to her is going to clear this up we have to get the truth out of her how through torture not that it didnt have its appeal besides the kids scared of her cam added she comes around she could screw up the guardianship and if she doesnt come around we might never know the truth all of the truth he needed to know it phillip thought so he could begin to accept it heres the truth as i see it cam slammed his mug down this woman was looking for an easy mark and figured shed found one dad fell for the kid wanted to help him so he went to bat for him just the way he did for us and she kept hitting him up for more i figure he was upset coming home that day worried distracted he was driving too fast misjudged lost control whatever thats all there is to it lifes not as simple as you live it cam you dont just start in one spot then finish in the other as fast as you can curves and detours and roadblocks you better start thinking about them why thats all you ever think about and it seems to me weve ended up in exactly the same place phillip let out a sigh it was hard to argue with that so he decided a second glass of wine was in order whatever you think weve got a mess on our hands and were going to have to deal with it wheres seth i dont know where he is around christ cam around where youre supposed to keep an eye on him ive had my eye on him all damn day hes around he walked to the back door scanned the yard scowled when he didnt see seth probably around front or taking a walk or something im not keeping the kid on a leash this time of day he should be doing his homework youve only got to watch out for him on your own a couple of hours after school it didnt work out that way today there was a little holiday from school he hooked you let him hook when weve got social services sniffing around no he didnt hook disgusted cam turned back some little jerk at school kept razzing him poked bruises all over him and called him a son of a whore phillips stance shifted immediately from mild annoyance to righteous fury his gilt eyes glittered his mouth thinned what little jerk who the hell is he some fatfaced kid named robert seth slugged him and they said they were going to suspend him for it hell they are who the hells principal now some nazi cam had to smile when push came to shove you could always count on phillip she didnt seem to be after i went down and we got the whole story out of seth she shifted ground some im taking him back in tomorrow for another little conference now phillip grinned wide and wicked you cameron kickass quinn is going in for a parent conference at the middle school oh to be a fly on the wall you wont have to be because youre coming too phillip swallowed wine hastily before he choked what do you mean im coming and sos ethan cam decided on the spot were all going united front yeah thats just the way its going to be ive got an appointment break it theres the kid he spotted seth coming out of the woods with foolish beside him hes just been fooling around with the dog ethan ought to be along any minute and im tagging him for this deal phillip scowled into his wine i hate it when youre right we all go it should be a fun morning satisfied cam gave phillip a friendly punch on the arm were the big guys this time and when we win this little battle with authority we can celebrate tomorrow night with a bushel of crabs phillips mood lightened april fools day crab season opens oh yeah we got fresh fish tonight i caught it you cook it i want a shower cam rolled his shoulders miz spinellis coming to dinner tomorrow uhhuh well you what phillip whirled as cam started out of the room you asked the social worker to dinner here thats right told you i like her looks phillip could only close his eyes for gods sake youre hitting on the social worker shes hitting on me too cam flashed a grin i like it cam not to put down your warped idea of romance but use your head weve got this problem with the insurance company and weve got a problem with seth at school hows thats going to play to social services we dont tell them about the first and we give them the straight story on the second i think thats going to go over just fine with miz spinelli shes going to love it that the three of us went in to stand for seth phillip opened his mouth reconsidered and nodded youre right thats good then as new thoughts began to play he angled his head maybe you could use your influence on her to get her to move this case study along get the system out of our hair cam said nothing for a moment surprised at how angry even the suggestion of it made him so his voice was quiet im not using anything on her and its going to stay that way one situation has nothing to do with the other thats staying that way too when cam strode off phillip pursed his lips well he thought wasnt that interesting as ethan guided his boat toward the dock he spotted seth in the yard beside ethan simon gave a high happy bark ethan ruffled his fur yeah fella almost home now while he worked the sails ethan watched the boy toss sticks for the pup there had always been a dog in this yard to chase sticks or balls to wrestle in the grass with he remembered dumbo the sweetfaced retriever hed fallen madly in love with when hed come to the quinns hed been the first dog to play with to be comforted by in ethans life from dumbo hed learned the meaning of unconditional love had certainly trusted the dog long before hed trusted ray and stella quinn or the boys who would become his brothers he imagined seth felt much the same you could always depend on your dog when hed come here all those years ago damaged in body and soul he had no hope that his life would really change promises reassurances decent meals and decent people meant nothing to him so hed considered ending that life the water had drawn him even then he imagined himself walking out into it drifting out until it was over his head he didnt know how to swim then so it would have been simple just sinking down and down and down until there was nothing but the night hed slipped out to do it the dog had come with him licking his hand pressing that warm furry body against his legs and dumbo had brought him a stick tail wagging big brown eyes hopeful the first time ethan threw the stick high and far and in fury but dumbo chased it happily and brought it back tail wagging he threw it again then again then dozens of times then he simply sat down on the grass and in the moonlight cried his heart out clutching the dog like a lifeline the need to end it had passed a dog ethan thought now as he rubbed a hand over simons head could be a glorious thing he saw seth turn catch sight of the boat there was the briefest of hesitations then the boy lifted a hand in greeting and with the pup raced to the dock secure the lines mate aye aye seth handled the lines ethan tossed out competently enough slipping the loop over the post cam said how youd be bringing crabs tomorrow did he ethan smiled a little pushed back his fielders cap thick brown hair tickled the collar of his workstained shirt go on boy he murmured to the dog who was sitting vibrating in place as he waited for the command to abandon ship with a celebrational bark simon leaped into the water and swam to shore as it turns out hes right winter wasnt too hard and the waters warming up well pull in plenty should be a good day leaning over the side he pulled up a crab pot that dangled from the dock no winter hair hair why would there be hair in an old chicken wire box pot its a crab pot if i pulled this up and it was hairy full of blond seaweed itd mean the water was too cold yet for crabs seen them that way nearly into may if theres been a bad winter that kind of spring its hard to make a living on the water but not this spring because the waters warm enough for crabs seems to be you can bait this pot later chicken necks or fish parts do the job fine and in the morning we may just find us a couple of crabs sulking inside they fall for it every time seth knelt down wanting a closer look thats pretty stupid they look like big ugly bugs so i guess theyre bugdumb just more hungry than smart id say and cam says you boil them alive no way im eating those suit yourself me i figure on going through about two dozen come tomorrow night he let the pot slip back into the water then leaped expertly from boat to dock grace was here she cleaned the house and stuff yeah he imagined the house would smell lightly of lemon graces house always did cam kissed her right on the mouth ethan stopped walking looked down at seths face what smackaroo it made her laugh it was like a joke i guess like a joke sure he shrugged and ignored the hard sick ball in his gut none of his business who grace kissed nothing to do with him but he found his jaw clenched when cam hair dripping stepped out on the back porch hows the crab business looking itll do ethan said shortly cam lifted his brows at the tone what did one crawl out of the pot early and up your butt i want a shower and a beer ethan moved past him and into the house womans coming for dinner tomorrow that stopped ethan again and he turned keeping the screen door between them who anna spinelli shit was ethans only comment as he walked away whys she coming what does she want panic rose up inside seth like a fountain and spewed out in his voice before he could stop it shes coming because i asked her and she wants a crab dinner cam tucked his thumbs in his pockets rocked back on his heels why the hell was he the one who always had to handle this whitefaced fear i figure she wants to see if all we do around here is fart and scratch and spit we can probably hold off on that for one evening you gotta remember to put the toilet seat down though women really hate when you dont they make it a social and political statement if you leave it up go figure some of the tension eased out of seths face so shes just like coming to see if were slobs and grace cleaned everything up and youre not cooking so its mostly okay itll be more than mostly if you watch that foul mouth of yours yours is just as foul yeah but youre shorter than i am and i dont intend to ask you to pass the fucking potatoes in front of her seth snorted at that and his rockhard shoulders relaxed are you going to tell her about that shit in school today cam blew out a breath practice finding an alternate word forshit just for tomorrow night yeah im going to tell her what happened in school and im telling her that phil and ethan and i went in with you tomorrow to deal with it this time all seth could do was blink all of you youre all going thats right like i said you mess with one quinn you mess with them all it shocked and appalled and terrified them both when tears sprang to seths eyes they swam there for a moment blurring that deep bright blue instantly both of them stuck their hands in their pockets and turned away i have to do something cam said groping you go wash your hands or whatever well be eating pretty soon just as he worked up the nerve to turn intending to lay a hand on seths shoulder to say something that would undoubtedly make them both feel like idiots the boy darted inside and rushed through the kitchen cam pressed his fingers to his eyes massaged his temples dropped his arms jesus ive got to get back to a race where i know what im doing he took a step toward the door then shook his head and walked quickly away from it he didnt want to go inside with all that emotion all that need swirling in the air god what he wanted was his freedom back to wake up and find it had all been a dream better to wake up in some huge anonymous hotel bed in some exotic city with a hot naked woman beside him but when he tried to picture it the bed was the same one he slept in now and the woman was anna as a substitute it wasnt such a bad deal but it didnt make the rest of it go away he glanced up at the windows of the second floor as he walked around the house the kid was up there pulling himself together and he was out here trying to do the same thing the look the kid had shot him cam thought just before things got sloppy it had stirred up his gut hed have sworn hed seen trust there and a pathetic almost desperate gratitude that both humbled and terrified him what the hell was he going to do with it and when things settled down and he could pick up his own life again that had to happen he assured himself had to he couldnt stay in charge like this couldnt be expected to live like this forever he had places to go races to run risks to take once they had everything under control once they did what needed to be done for the kid and got this business ethan wanted established hed be free to come and go as he pleased again a few more months he decided maybe a year then he was out of here no one could possibly expect more from him not even himself chapter nine contents prev next vice principal moorefield studied the three men who stood like a wellmortared wall in her office the outward appearance would never indicate they were brothers one wore a trim gray suit and perfectly knotted tie another a black shirt and jeans and the third faded khakis and a wrinkled denim work shirt but she could see that at the moment they were as united as triplets in the womb i realize you have busy schedules i appreciate all of you coming in this morning we want to get this straightened out mrs moorefield phillip kept a mild negotiating smile on his face seth needs to be in school i agree after seths statement yesterday i did some checking it does appear as though robert instigated the incident there does seem to be some question over the motivation the matter of the petty extortion cam held up a hand seth did you tell this robert character to give you a dollar nah seth tucked his thumbs in his front pockets as hed seen cam do i dont need his money i dont even talk to him unless he gets in my face cam looked back at mrs moorefield seth says he aced that test and robert flunked is that right the vice principal folded her hands on her desk yes the test papers were handed back yesterday just before the end of class and seth received the highest grade now seems to me ethan interrupted in a quiet voice that seth told you straight then excuse me maam but if the other boy lied about some of it could be hes lying about all of it seth says the boy came after him and he did he said it was about this test so i figure it is ive considered that and i tend to agree with you mr quinn ive spoken with roberts mother shes no happier than you are about this incident or about the fact that both boys are to be suspended youre not suspending seth cam planted his feet not over this not without a fight i understand how you feel however blows were exchanged physical violence cant be permitted here id agree with you mrs moorefield under most circumstances phillip laid a hand on cams arm to prevent him from stepping forward however seth was being physically and verbally attacked he defended himself there should have been a teacher monitoring the hallway during the change of classes he should have been able to depend on an adult on the system to protect him why didnt one come forward to do so moorefield puffed out her cheeks blew out a breath thats a reasonable question mr quinn i wont start weeping to you about budget cuts but its impossible with a staff of our size to monitor all the children at all times i sympathize with your problem but seth shouldnt have to pay for it theres been a rough time recently ethan put in i dont figure that kicking the boy out of school for a couple days is going to help him any educations supposed to be more than learning leastways thats how we were taught its supposed to help build your character and help teach you how to get on in the world if it tells you that you get booted for doing what you had to for standing up for yourself then somethings wrong with the system you punish him the same way you punish the boy who started it cam said youre telling him theres not much difference between right and wrong thats not the kind of school i want my brother in moorefield steepled her hands looked over the tips of her fingers at the three men then down at seth your evaluation tests were excellent and your grades are well above average however your teachers say you rarely turn in homework assignments and even more rarely participate in class discussion were dealing with the homework cam gave seth a subtle nudge right yeah i guess i dont see why you dont have to see cam cut him off with one lowering glance you just have to do it we cant sit in the classroom with him and make him open his mouth but hell turn in his homework i imagine he will she murmured this is what ill agree to do seth because i believe you you wont be suspended but you will go on a thirtyday probation if there are no more disruptive incidents and your teachers report that you have improved your athomeassignment record well put this matter aside however your first homework assignment comes now and from me you have one week to write a fivehundredword essay on the violence in our society and the need for peaceful resolutions to problems oh man shut up cam ordered mildly thats fair he said to mrs moorefield we appreciate it that wasnt so bad phillip stepped back into the sunlight and rolled his shoulders speak for yourself ethan snugged his cap back on his head i was sweating bullets i dont want to have to do that again in this lifetime drop me off at the waterfront i can get a ride out to the boat jims working her and he ought to have pulled in a nice mess of crabs by now just make sure you bring us home our share cam piled into phillips shiny navy blue land rover and dont forget weve got company coming not going to forget ethan mumbled principals in the morning social workers in the evening christ jesus every time you turn around you have to talk to somebody i intend to keep miz spinelli occupied ethan turned around to look at cam you just cant leave females alone can you what would be the point theyre here ethan only sighed somebody better pick up more beer cam volunteered to get the beer late that afternoon it wasnt altruism he didnt think he could stand listening to phillip another five minutes going to the market was the best way to get out of the house and away from the tension while phillip drafted and perfected a letter to the insurance company on his snazzy little laptop computer get some salad stuff while youre out phillip shouted causing cam to turn back and poke his head in the kitchen where phillip was typing away at the table what do you mean salad stuff field greens for gods sake dont come back here with a head of iceberg and a couple of tasteless hothouse tomatoes i made up a nice vinaigrette the other day but theres not a damn thing around here to put it on get some plum tomatoes if they look decent what the hell do we need all that for phillip sighed and stopped typing first because we want to live long and healthy lives and second because you invited a woman to dinner a woman whos going to look at how we deal with seths nutritional needs then you go to the goddamn store fine you write this goddamn letter hed rather be burned alive field greens for sweet christs sake and get some sourdough bread and were nearly out of milk since im going to be bringing my juicer the next time i get back to baltimore pick up some fresh fruit some carrots zucchini ill just make a list hold it hold it cam felt the controls slipping out of his hands and struggled to shift his grip im just going for beer whole wheat bagels phillip muttered busily writing thirty minutes later cam found himself pondering the produce section of the grocery store what the hell was the difference between green leaf and romaine lettuce and why should he care in defense he began loading the cart at random since that worked for him he did the same thing through the aisles by the time he reached checkout he had two carts overflowing with cans boxes bottles and bags my goodness you must be having a party big appetites he told the checkout clerk and after a quick search of his brain pegged her hows it going mrs wilson oh fair enough she ran items expertly over the belt and scanner and into bags her quick redtipped fingers moving like lightning too pretty a day to be stuck inside here i can tell you that i get off in an hour and im going out chickennecking with my grandson were counting on having crab for dinner ourselves probably should have bought some chicken necks for the pot off our dock ethanll keep you supplied i imagine im awful sorry about ray she added didnt really get to tell you so after the funeral were sure going to miss him he used to come in here once or twice a week after stella passed buy himself a pile of those microwave meals id tell him ray you got to do better for yourself than that a man needs a good slab of meat now and then but its a hard thing cooking for one when youre used to family yeah it was all cam could say hed been family and he hadnt been there always had some story to tell about one of you boys showed me pictures and things from foreign newspapers on you racing here racing there and id say ray how do you know if the boy won or not when its written in italian or fransay wed just laugh she checked the weight on a bag of apples keyed them in hows that young boy whats his name now sam seth cam murmured hes fine goodlooking boy i said to mr wilson when ray brought him home thats ray quinn for you always keeping his door open dont know how a man of his age expected to handle a boy like that but if anybody could ray quinn could he and stella handled the three of you because she smiled and winked he smiled back they did we tried to give them plenty to handle i expect they loved every minute of it and i expect the boy seth was company for ray after yall grew up and lit out i want you to know i dont hold with what some people are saying no i dont her mouth thinned as she rang up three jumbo boxes of cold cereal with a cluck of her tongue and a shake of her head she continued i tell them straight to their face if they do that nasty gossiping in my hearing that if they had a christian bone in their body theyd mind their tongues her eyes glittered with fury and loyalty dont you pay any mind to that talk cameron no mind at all why the idea that ray would have had truck with that woman that the boy was his by blood not one decent minds going to believe that or that hed run into that pole on purpose makes me just sick to hear it it was making cam sick now he wished to god hed never come in the store some people believe lies mrs wilson some people would rather believe them that they do she nodded her head twice sharply and even if they dont they like to spread them around i want you to know that mr wilson and me considered ray and stella good friends and good people anybody says something i dont like about them around mes going to get their ears boxed he had to smile as i remember you were good at that she laughed now a kind of happy hoot boxed yours that time you came sniffing too close to my caroline dont think i didnt know what you were after boy caroline was the prettiest girl in tenth grade shes still a picture its her boy im going chickennecking with hell be four this summer and shes carrying her second into the sixth month now time does go right by it seemed it did cam thought when he was back at home and hauling bags of groceries into the house he knew mrs wilson had meant everything shed said for the best but she had certainly managed to depress him if someone whod been a staunch friend of his parents was being told such filthy lies they were spreading more quickly and more thickly than hed imagined how long could they be ignored before denials had to be given and a stand taken now he was afraid they would have no choice but to take phillips advice and find seths mother the kid was going to hate that cam knew and what would happen to the trust hed seen swimming in seths eyes guess you want a hand with that stuff phillip stepped into the kitchen i was on the phone the lawyer temporary guardianships a lock theres step one anyway great he started to relay the conversation in the grocery store then decided to let it ride for the night goddamn it theyd won two battles that day he wasnt going to see the rest of the evening spoiled by wagging tongues more out in the car he told phillip more what bags more phillip stared at the half dozen loaded brown bags jesus cam i didnt have more than twenty items on that list so i added to it he pulled a box out tossed it on the counter nobodys going to go hungry around here for a while you bought twinkies twinkies are you one of the people who believe that white stuff inside them is one of the four major food groups the kidll probably go for them sure he will you can pay his next dentist bill his temper dangerously close to the edge cam whirled around look pal he who goes to the store buys what he damn well pleases thats a new rule around here now do you want to get that stuff out of the car or let it fucking rot phillip only lifted a brow since shopping for food puts you in such a cheery mood ill take that little chore from now on and wed better start a household fund to draw from for daytoday incidentals fine cam waved him away you do that when phillip walked out cam began to stuff boxes and cans wherever they fit he would let somebody else worry about organizing in fact hed let anybody else worry about it he was done for a while he started out and when he hit the front door saw that seth had arrived home phillip was passing him bags and the two of them were talking as if they hadnt a care in the world so hed go out the back he decided let the two of them handle things for a couple of hours as he turned the puppy yipped at him then squatted and peed on the rug i suppose you expect me to clean that up when foolish wagged his tail and let his tongue loll all cam could do was close his eyes i still say the essays a raw deal seth complained as he walked into the house that kind of stuffs crap and i dont see why youll do it cam pulled the bag out of seths arms and i dont want to hear any bitching about it you can get started right after you clean up the mess your dog just made on the rug my dog hes not mine he is now and you better make sure hes housebroken all the way or he stays outside he stalked off toward the kitchen with phillip who was trying desperately not to laugh following seth stood where he was staring down at foolish dumb dog he murmured and when he crouched down the puppy launched himself into seths arms where he was welcomed with a fierce hug youre my dog now anna told herself she would and could be perfectly professional for the evening shed cleared the informal visit with marilou just to keep it official and the truth was she wanted to see seth again every bit as much as she wanted to see cam different reasons certainly and perhaps different parts of her but she wanted to see them both she could handle both sides of her heart and her mind shed always been able to separate areas of her life and conduct them all in a satisfactory manner this situation wouldnt be any different verdi soared out of her speakers wild and passionate she rolled her window up just enough that the breeze didnt disturb her hair she hoped the quinns would allow her a few moments alone with seth so she could judge for herself without influence how he was feeling she hoped she could steal a few moments alone with cam so she could judge for herself how she was feeling itchy she admitted needy but it wasnt always necessary or possible to act on feelings however strong they might be if after seeing him again she felt it best for all concerned to take a large step back she would do so she had no doubt the man had an iron will but so did anna spinelli she would match herself against cameron quinn in that respect any day and she could win even as she reassured herself of that one single fact anna pulled her spiffy little car into the drive and cam walked out onto the porch they stayed where they were for just a moment eyeing each other when he came off the porch and onto the walk that hard body tucked into snug black that dark hair unruly those smoky eyes unreadable her heart took one helpless spin and landed with a thud she wanted that toughlooking mouth on her those roughpalmed hands on her she wanted that allmale body pinning hers to a mattress moving with the speed that was so much a part of his life it was idiotic to deny it but shed handle him anna promised herself she only hoped she could handle herself she stepped out wearing a prim boxy suit the color of a birds nest her hair was pulled up and back and ruthlessly controlled her unpainted lips curved in a polite somewhat distant smile and she carried her briefcase for reasons that baffled him cam had precisely the same reaction hed had when shed clipped down her hallway on stiletto heels that rainy night instant and raging lust when he started toward her she angled her head just a little just enough to send the warning signal the handsoff sign was clear as a shout but he leaned forward a bit when he reached her sniffed at her hair you did that on purpose did what on purpose wore the donttouch suit and the sex goddess perfume at the same time just to drive me crazy listen to the suit quinn dream about the perfume she started past him then looked down coolly when his hand clamped over her arm youre not listening i like to play games as much as the next guy anna he tugged until she turned and they were again face to face but you may have picked a bad time for this one there was something in his eyes she realized something along with desire annoyance and because she recognized it as unhappiness she softened has something happened whats wrong whats right he tossed back she put a hand over the one still clamped to her arm and squeezed lightly rough day yes no hell giving up he let her go and leaned back on the hood of her car it was a testimony to her compassion that she was able to stifle a wince shed just had it washed and waxed there was this thing at school this morning thing youll probably get some official report or something about it so i want to give you our side personally uhoh sides well lets hear it so he told her found himself heating up again when he got to the point where hed seen the bruises on seths arm and ended up pushing himself off the car and stalking around it as he finished the story of how it had been resolved you did very well anna murmured nearly laughing when he stopped and stared at her suspiciously of course hitting the other boy wasnt the answer but i think it was a damn good answer i realize that and well just let it go for now my point is you did the responsible and the supportive thing you went down you listened you convinced seth to tell you the truth and then you stood up for him i doubt he was expecting you to why shouldnt i why wouldnt i he was right believe me not everyone goes to bat for their children hes not my kid hes my brother not everyone goes to bat for his brother she corrected the three of you going in this morning was exactly right and again unfortunately more than everyone would do its a corner turned for all of you and i suspect you understand that is that whats upset you no thats piddly other things doesnt matter he could hardly tell her about the investigation into his fathers death or the village gossip over it at this precarious point nor did he think it would count in their favor if he confessed he was feeling trapped and dreaming of escape hows seth taking it hes cool with it cam shrugged a shoulder we went sailing yesterday did some fishing blew off the day she smiled again and this time her heart was in it id hoped id be around to see it happening youre starting to fall for him what are you talking about youre starting to care about him personally hes beginning to be more than an obligation a promise to be kept he matters to you i said id take care of him thats what im doing he matters to you she repeated thats whats worrying you cam what happens if you start caring too much and how do you stop it from happening he looked at her the way the sun dropped down in the sky at her back the way her eyes stayed warm and dark on his maybe he was worrying he admitted and not just about his shifting feelings for seth i finish what i start anna and i dont walk away from my family looks like the kid qualifies there but im a selfish son of a bitch ask anybody some things i prefer to find out for myself now am i getting a crab dinner or not ethan ought to have the pot going by now he moved forward as if to lead her inside then judging the moment when she relaxed he yanked her into his arms and caught her up in a hot hearthammering kiss see that was for me he murmured when they were both breathless and quivering want it take it i warned you i was selfish anna eased back calmly adjusted her now rumpled jacket ran a hand over her hair to assure herself it was in place sorry but im afraid i enjoyed that every bit as much as you did so it doesnt qualify as a selfish act he laughed even as his pulse scrambled let me try it again i can pull it off this time ill take a rain check i want my dinner with that she sauntered up the steps knocked briefly and slipped into the house cam just stood where he was grinning this was a woman he thought who was going to make this episode of his life a memorable one by the time cam made his way inside and to the kitchen anna was already chatting with phillip and accepting a glass of wine you drink beer with crabs cam told her and got one out of the fridge for himself i dont seem to be eating any at the moment and phillip assures me this is a very nice wine she sipped considered and smiled hes absolutely right its one of my favorite whites since shed approved phillip topped off her glass smooth buttery and not overpowering phils a wine snob cam twisted off the top and lifted the bottle of harp to his lips but we let him live here anyway and how is that working out she wondered if they realized how male the house seemed tidy as a pin yes but without even a whiff of female it must be odd adjusting to the three of you in the same household again well we havent killed each other cam bared his teeth in a smile at his brother yet with a laugh she walked to the window and where is seth hes with ethan phillip told her theyre doing the crabs around at the pit the pit around the side cam took her hand and tugged her toward the door mom wouldnt let us cook crab in the house she might have been a doctor but she could be squeamish didnt like to watch he drew her off the porch and down the steps as he spoke dad had this brick pit around the side of the house fell down my first summer he didnt know much about laying bricks but we rebuilt it when they stepped around the corner she saw ethan and seth standing by a huge kettle over an open fire in a lopsided bricksided pit smoke billowed and from a big steel barrel on the ground came the scraping and clattering of claws anna looked from barrel to kettle and back again you know what i think i can be a bit squeamish myself she stepped back turned to the view of the water she didnt even mind that cam laughed at her especially when she heard seths voice raised in desperate excitement are you dumping them in now oh man shit that is so gross i told him to watch his mouth tonight but he doesnt know youre here yet she only shook her head he sounds very normal she winced a little when she heard a clatter and seths wild exclamation of delight and disgust and id think whats happening around the corner is just barbaric enough to thrill him her hand lifted quickly protectively to her hair when she felt a tug i like it down cam tossed the pin hed pulled out aside i want it up she said mildly and began to walk toward the water i bet were going to knock heads about all kinds of things he sipped his beer and sent her a sidelong look as they walked ought to keep it all interesting i doubt either of us will be bored seth comes first cam i mean that she paused listened to the musical lap of water against the hull of the boats the sloping shoreline topping one of the markers was a huge nest buoys bobbed in the tide i can help him and its unlikely well always agree on whats right for him itll be essential to keep that issue completely separate when we end up in bed he was grateful he hadnt taken another sip from the bottle no doubt in his mind hed have choked on it i can do that she lifted her head as an egret soared by and wondered if the nest belonged to her when im certain i can well use my bed my apartments more private than your house he rubbed a hand over his stomach in a futile attempt to calm himself lady youre right up front arent you whats the point in being otherwise were grownups unattached she shot him a look a flick of the lashes an arch of a brow but if youre the type whod prefer me to pretend reluctance until seduction sorry no im all right with it this way if he didnt overheat and explode in the meantime no games no pretenses no promises where the hell do you come from he finished fascinated pittsburgh she said easily and started back toward the house thats not what i meant i know but if you intend to sleep with me you should have some interest in the basic facts no games no pretenses no promises thats fine but i dont have sex with strangers he put a hand on her arm before she wandered too close to the house he wanted another moment alone okay what are the basic facts im twentyeight single of italian descent my mother died when i was twelve and i was raised primarily by my grandparents in pittsburgh thats right theyre wonderful oldfashioned energetic loving i can make a terrific red sauce from scratch the recipes been passed down in my family for generations i moved to dc right after college worked there and did some graduate studies but washington didnt suit me too political yes and too urban i was looking for something a little different so i ended up down here cam glanced around the quiet yard the quiet water its different from dc all right i like it i also like horror novels sappy movies and any kind of music except jazz i read magazines from back to front and dont know why and though im comfortable with all sorts of people i dont particularly like large social functions she stopped considered they would see she decided how much more hed want to find out i think thats enough for now and my glass is nearly empty youre nothing like my first impression of you no i think youre exactly like mine of you do you speak italian fluently he leaned forward and murmured a highly charged and sexually explicit suggestion in her ear some women might have slapped his face others might have giggled some certainly would have blushed anna merely made a humming sound in her throat your accents mediocre but your imagination is exceptional she gave his arm a light pat be sure to ask me again some other time damn right i will cam muttered and watched her smile in an easy open manner at seth as he came barreling around the corner of the house hello seth he skidded to a halt that wary and distant look came into his eyes his shoulders hunched yeah hi ethan says we can eat anytime good im starved though she knew he was braced against her she kept walking toward him i hear you went sailing yesterday seths gaze slid by her locked accusingly on cams yeah so ive never been she said it quickly sensing that cams indrawn breath was the signal for a sharp reminder of manners cam offered to let me tag along with you sometime its his boat then catching the dark scowl on cams face seth shrugged sure thatd be cool im supposed to go get a ton of newspaper to spread on the porch thats the way you eat crabs right before he could dash off she bent down and whispered in his ear good thing for us cam didnt cook them that got a snicker out of him and a quick fleeting grin before he turned and ran inside chapter ten contents prev next she wasnt so bad for a social worker seth came to this thoughtful conclusion about anna after hed retreated to his room ostensibly to work on his antiviolence essay he was drawing pictures instead quick little sketches of faces he had a stupid week to write the stupid thing didnt he wouldnt take more than a couple of hours once he got down to doing it which was a raw deal all around but better than letting fatfaced robert get him suspended he could still close his eyes and bring up the image of all three of the quinns standing in the principals office all three of them standing beside him and facing down the allpowerful moorefield it was so cool he decided and began to doodle the moment in his notebook there there was phillip in his fancy suit with his hair just right and his kind of narrow face he looked like one of the magazine ads seth thought the ones that sold stuff only rich guys could buy next he sketched in ethan all seriousfaced seth mused his hair a little shaggy even though seth remembered how hed combed it just before theyd gone into the school he looked exactly like what he was the kind of guy who made his living and lived his life outdoors and there was cam rough and tough with that light of mean in his eyes thumbs hooked in the front pockets of his jeans yeah that was it seth decided he most always stood like that when he was ticked off even in the rough sketch he came across as someone whod done most everything and planned to do a whole lot more last he sketched in himself trying to see what others would see his shoulders were too thin and bony he thought with some disappointment but they wouldnt always be his face was too thin for his eyes but it would fill out too one day hed be taller and stronger and he wouldnt look like such a puny kid but hed kept his head up hadnt he he hadnt been afraid of anything and he didnt look like hed just wandered into the picture he looked almost like he belonged there mess with one quinn mess with them all thats what cam had said and he must have meant it but he wasnt a quinn seth thought frowning as he held up the sketch to study details or maybe he was he just didnt know it hadnt mattered to him if ray quinn had been his father like some people said all that had mattered was that he was away from her it hadnt mattered who his father was still didnt he assured himself he just didnt give a rats ass all he wanted was to stay here right here nobody had used the back of their hand or their fists on him for months now nobody got blitzed out on drugs and laid around so long and so still he thought they were dead secretly hoped they were no flabby guys with sweaty hands tried to grope him he wasnt even going to think about that eating crabs had been pretty cool too good and messy he remembered with a grin you got to eat them with your hands the social worker didnt act all prim and girly about it either she just took off her jacket and rolled up her sleeves it didnt seem like she was watching to see if he burped or scratched his butt or anything shed laughed a lot he remembered he wasnt used to women laughing a lot when they werent coked up and that was a different kind of laughing seth knew miss spinellis wasnt wild and hard and desperate it was low and well smooth he supposed nobodyd told him he couldnt have more either man hed bet he ate a hundred of those ugly suckers he didnt even mind eating the salad though he pretended he did he hadnt had that gnawing sick feeling in his stomach that was desperate hunger for a long time now so long he might have forgotten the sensation but he hadnt forgotten he hadnt forgotten anything hed worried some that the social worker would want to pull him back in but she seemed pretty okay to him and he saw her sneaking little bits of crab and bread to foolish so she couldnt be all bad but hed have liked her better if she was a waitress or something like grace when the light knock sounded on his door seth slapped the notebook closed on his sketches and quickly opened another where the first dozen words of his fivehundredword essay were scrawled yeah anna poked her head in hi can i come in a minute it was weird being asked and he wondered if she would just turn around and go if he said no but he shrugged i guess i have to leave soon she began taking a quick survey of the room a twin bed inexpertly made a sturdy dresser and desk a wall of shelves that held a few books a portable stereo that looked very new and a pair of binoculars that didnt there were white miniblinds at the windows and a palegreen paint on the walls it needed junk she thought a boys junk ancient broken toys posters tacked to the walls but the puppy snoring in the corner was a very good start this is nice she wandered to the window youve got a good view water and trees you get to watch the birds i bought a book on local waterfowl when i moved here from dc so i could figure out what was what it must be nice to see egrets every day i guess i like it here its hard not to huh he shrugged his shoulders took the cautious route its okay i got no problems with it she turned glanced down at his notebook the dreaded essay i started it defensively he pulled the notebook closer and knocked the other one to the floor before he could snatch it up anna crouched to pick it up herself oh look at this it had fallen open to a sketch of the puppy just his face straight on and she thought the artist had captured that sweet and silly expression perfectly did you sketch this its no big deal im working on the damn essay arent i she might have sighed over his response but she was too charmed by the sketch its wonderful it looks just like him her fingers itched to turn the pages to see who else seth might have drawn but she resisted and set the notebook down i cant draw a decent stick man its nothing just fooling around well if you dont want it maybe i could have it he thought it might be a trick after all she had her jacket back on was carrying her briefcase she looked like social services again rather than the woman whod rolled up her sleeves and laughed over steamed crabs what for i cant have pets in my apartment just as well she added it wouldnt be fair to keep one closed in all day while im at work but then she smiled and glanced over at the sleeping puppy i really like dogs when i can afford a house and a yard im going to have a couple of them but until then i have to play with other peoples pets it seemed odd to him in seths mind adults ruled often with an iron hand did what they wanted when they wanted why dont you just move someplace else the place ive got is close to work the rents reasonable she looked toward the window again to the stretch of land and water both were deep with shadows as night moved in it has to do until i can manage to get the house and yard she wandered to the window drawn to that quiet view the first star winked to life in the eastern sky she nearly made a wish somewhere near the water like this anyway she turned back and sat on the side of the bed facing him i just wanted to come up before i left see if theres anything you wanted to talk about or any questions you wanted to ask me no nothing okay she hadnt really expected him to talk to her freely yet maybe youd like to know what i see here what i think she took his shoulder jerk as assent i see a houseful of guys who are trying to figure out how to live with each other and make it work four very different men who are bumping up against each other and i think theyre going to make some mistakes and most certainly irritate each other and disagree but i also think theyll work it out eventually because they all want to she added with an easy smile in their own ways they all want the same thing she rose and took a card out of her briefcase you can call me whenever you want i put my home number on the back i dont see any reason for me to come back in an official capacity for a while but i may come back for a puppy fix good luck with the essay when she started for the door seth went with impulse and tore the sketch of foolish out of his notebook you can have this if you want really she took the page beamed at it god hes cute thanks he jerked back when she bent to kiss his cheek but she brushed her lips across it lightly then straightened she stepped back ordering herself to keep an emotional distance say good night to foolish for me anna slipped the sketch in her briefcase as she walked downstairs phillip was noodling at the piano his fingers carelessly picking out some bluesy number it was another skill she envied it was a constant disappointment to her that she had no talent ethan was nowhere to be seen and cam was restlessly pacing the living room she thought that might be a very typical overview of all three men phillip elegantly whiling away the time ethan off on some solitary pursuit and cam working off excess energy with the boy up in his room drawing his pictures and thinking his thoughts cam glanced up and when their eyes locked the ball of heat slammed into her gut gentlemen thank you for a wonderful meal phillip rose and held out a hand to take hers we have to thank you its been too long since we had a beautiful woman to dinner i hope youll come back oh hes a smooth one she decided id like that tell ethan hes a genius with a crab good night cam ill walk you out shed counted on it first thing she said when they stepped outside from what i can see seths welfare is being seen to he has proper supervision a good home support with his school life he could certainly use some new shoes but i dont imagine theres a boy of ten who couldnt shoes whats wrong with his shoes regardless she said turning to him when they reached her car all of you still have adjustments to make and theres no doubt hes a very troubled child i suspect he was abused physically and perhaps sexually i figured that out for myself cam said shortly it wont happen here i know that she laid a hand on his arm if i had a single doubt in that area he wouldnt be here cam he needs professional counseling you all do counseling thats crap we dont need to pour our guts out to some underpaid county shrink many underpaid county shrinks are very good at their job she said dryly since i have a degree in psychology myself i could be considered an underpaid county shrink and im good at mine fine youre talking to him youre talking to me weve been counseled dont be difficult her voice was deliberately mild because she knew it would spark a flash of annoyance in his eyes it was only fair she thought as hed annoyed her im not being difficult ive cooperated with you from the getgo more or less she mused and continuing to be fair admitted it was more than shed expected youve made a solid start here but a professional counselor will help all of you get beneath the surface and deal with the root of the problems we dont have any problems she hadnt expected such hardline resistance to such a basic step but realized she should have of course you do seths afraid to be touched hes not afraid to let grace touch him grace anna pursed her lips in thought grace monroe from the list you gave me yeah shes doing the housework now and the kids nuts about her might even have a little crush thats good thats healthy but its only a start when a childs been abused it leaves scars what the hell were they talking about this for he thought impatiently why were they talking about shrinks and digging at old wounds when all hed wanted was a few minutes of easy flirtation with a pretty woman my old man beat the hell out of me so what i survived he hated remembering it hated standing in the shadow of the house that had been his sanctuary and remembering the kids mother knocked him around well shes not going to get the chance to do it again that chapters closed its never closed anna said patiently whatever new chapter you start always has some basis in the one that came before im recommending counseling to you now and im going to recommend it in my report go ahead he couldnt explain why it infuriated him even to think about it he only knew hed be damned if he would ask himself or any of his brothers to open those longlocked doors again you recommend whatever you want doesnt mean we have to do it you have to do whats best for seth how the hell do you know whats best its my job she said coolly now because her blood was starting to boil your job you got a college degree and a bunch of forms were the ones who lived it who are living it you havent been there you dont know anything about it what its like to get your face smashed in and not be able to stop it to have some bureaucratic jerk from the county who doesnt know dick decide what happens to your life didnt know she thought of the dark deserted road the terror the pain and the screams cant be personal she reminded herself though her stomach clutched and fluttered your opinion of my profession has been crystalclear since our first meeting thats right but i cooperated i filled you in and all of us took steps to make this work his thumbs went into his front pockets in a gesture seth would have recognized its never quite enough though theres always something else if there werent something else she returned you wouldnt be so angry of course im angry weve been working our butts off here i just turned down the biggest race of my career ive got a kid on my hands who looks at me one minute as if im the enemy and the next as if im his salvation jesus christ and its harder to be his salvation than his enemy bullseye he thought with growing resentment how the hell did she know so much im telling you the best thing for the kid for all of us is to be left alone he needs shoes ill get him goddamn shoes and what are you going to do about the fact that hes afraid to be touched even in the most casual way by you or your brothers are you going to buy his fear away hell get over it cam was dug in now and refused to allow her to pry him out get over it a sudden fury had her almost stuttering out the words then they poured out in a hot stream that made the flash of pain in her eyes all the more poignant because you want him to because you tell him to do you know what its like to live with that kind of terror that kind of shame to have it bottled up inside you and have little drops of that poison spill out even when someone you love wants to hold you she ripped open her car door tossed her briefcase in i do i know exactly he grabbed her arm before she could get into the car get your hand off me wait a minute i said get your hand off me because she was trembling he did somewhere during the argument shed gone from being professionally irritated to being personally enraged he hadnt seen the shift anna im not going to let you get behind the wheel of this car when youre this churned up i lost someone i cared about recently and im not going to let it happen again im fine though she bit off the words she followed them up by a long steadying breath im perfectly capable of driving home if you want to discuss the possibility of counseling rationally you can call my office for an appointment why dont we take a walk both of us can cool off im perfectly cool she slipped into her car nearly slammed the door on his fingers you might take one though right off the dock he cursed when she drove away briefly considered chasing her down pulling her out of the car and demanding that they finish the damn stupid argument his next thought was to stalk back into the house and forget it forget her but he remembered the wounded look that had come into her eyes the way her voice had sounded when shed said she knew what it was like to be afraid to be ashamed someone had hurt her he realized and at that moment everything else faded to the background anna slammed the door of her apartment yanked off her shoes and heaved them across the room her temper was not the type that flashed and boiled then cooled it was a simmering thing that bubbled and brewed then spewed over the drive home hadnt calmed her down at all it had merely given her rising emotions enough time to reach a peak she tossed her briefcase on the sofa stripped off her suit jacket and threw it on top ignorant hardheaded narrowminded man she fisted her hands and rapped them against her own temples what had made her think she could get through to him what had made her think she wanted to when she heard the knock on her door she bared her teeth she expected her acrossthehall neighbor wanted to exchange some little bit of news or gossip she wasnt in the mood determined to ignore it until she could be civilized she began yanking pins out of her hair the knock came again louder now come on anna open the damn door now she could only stare as shock and fury made her ears ring the man had followed her home hed had the nerve to come all the way to her door and expect to be welcomed inside he probably thought shed be so consumed with lust that shed jump him and have wild sex on the living room floor well he was in for a surprise of his own she strode to the door yanked it open you son of a bitch cam took one look at her flushed and furious face the wild tumbling hair the eyes that sparkled with vengeance and decided it was undoubtedly perverse to find that arousing but what could he do about it he glanced down at her clenched fist go ahead he invited but if you belt me youll have to write a fivehundredword essay on violence in our society she made a low threatening sound in her throat and tried to slam the door in his face he was quick enough to slap a hand on it strong enough to put his weight against it and hold it open i wanted to make sure you got home all right he began as they struggled with the door and since i was in the neighborhood i thought i should come up i want you to go away very far away in fact i want you to go all the way to hell i get that but before i take the trip give me five minutes ive already given you what i now consider entirely too much of my time so whats five more minutes to settle it he braced the door open with one hand which she found infuriating and stepped inside if it wasnt for seth id call the cops right now and have your butt tossed in jail he nodded hed dealt with his share of furious women and knew there was a time to be careful yeah i get that too listen i dont have to listen to you using the flat of her hand she shoved him hard in the chest youre insulting and youre hardheaded and youre wrong so i dont have to listen to you im not wrong he tossed back youre wrong i know every damn thing she interrupted you drop in from bouncing around all over the world playing hotshot daredevil and suddenly you know everything about whats best for a tenyearold boy youve known barely a month i was not playing at being a hotshot daredevil i was making a career out of it he erupted his purpose of conciliation and peacemaking shattering to bits a goddamn good one and i do know whats best for the kid im the one whos been there day and night you spend a couple of hours with him and figure you got a better handle on it thats just bullshit its my job to have a handle on it then you should know that every situation is different maybe it works for some people to spill their guts to a stranger and have their dreams analyzed hed worked it out carefully logically on the way over he was determined to be absolutely reasonable nothing wrong with that if its what does it for you but you cant rubberstamp this you have to look at the circumstances and the personalities here and you know make adjustments she couldnt get her breathing under control so she finally stopped trying i dont rubberstamp the people im chosen to help i study and i evaluate and goddamn you i care i am not some bureaucratic jerk who doesnt know dick im a trained caseworker with over six years experience and i got that training and that experience because i know exactly what its like to be on the other side to be hurt and scared and alone and helpless and no one whose case is assigned to me is just a name on a form her voice broke shocking her to silence quickly she stepped back pressing one hand to her mouth holding the other up to signal him away she felt it rising inside her knew she wouldnt be able to stop it get out she managed get out of here now dont do that panic closed his throat as the first hot tears spilled down her cheeks furious women he understood and could deal with the ones who wept destroyed him time out foul jesus dont do that just leave me alone she turned away thinking only of escape but he wrapped his arms around her buried his face in her hair im sorry im sorry im sorry hed have apologized for anything everything if only to put them back on even ground i was wrong i was out of line whatever you said dont cry baby he turned her around holding her close he pressed his lips to her forehead her temple his hands stroked her hair her back then his mouth was on hers gently at first to comfort and soothe while he continued to murmur mindless pleas and promises but her arms lifted wrapped around his neck her body pressed into his and her lips parted heated the change happened quickly and he was lost in her drowning in her the hand that had stroked gently through her hair now tangled in it fisted as the kiss rushed toward searing take me away was all she could think dont let me reason dont let me think just take me she wanted his hands on her his mouth on her she wanted to feel her muscles quiver with need under his fingers with that strong halfwild taste of his filling her she could let everything go she trembled against him shuddered in his arms and the sound she made against his desperate mouth might have been a whimper he jerked back as if hed been stung and though his hands werent completely steady he kept them on her arms and kept her at arms length that wasnt he had to stop give himself a minute his mind was mush and was unlikely to clear if she continued to look at him with those dark damp eyes that were clouded with passion i dont believe im going to say this but this isnt a good idea he ran his hands up and down her arms as he struggled to hold on to control youre upset probably not thinking he could still taste her and the flavor on his tongue had outrageous hunger stirring in his belly christ i need a drink annoyed with both of them she swiped the back of her hand over her cheek to dry it ill make coffee i wasnt talking about coffee i know but if were going to be sensible lets stick with coffee she stepped into the kitchen area and kept herself busy with the homey process of grinding beans and brewing every nerve in her body was on edge every need shed ever had or imagined having was brutally aroused if wed finished that anna you might have thought i used the situation she nodded continued to fix coffee or i would have wondered if i had either way bad idea its important to me never to mix sex and guilt she looked at him then quietly levelly its vital to me and he knew knowing he suffered both helpless rage and helpless pity christ anna when when i was twelve im sorry it made him sick in his gut in his heart im sorry he said again inadequately you dont have to talk about it thats where we disagree talking about it is finally what saved me and he would listen she thought and he would know her my mother and i had gone to philadelphia for the day i wanted to see the liberty bell because we were studying about the revolutionary war in school we had this clunker of a car we drove over saw the sights we ate ice cream and bought souvenirs anna her head whipped up a direct challenge are you afraid to hear it maybe he raked a hand through his hair maybe he was afraid to hear it afraid of what it would change between them another roll of the dice he thought then looked at her waiting patiently and he understood he needed to know go ahead turning she chose cups from the cabinet it was just the two of us it always had been shed gotten pregnant when she was sixteen and would never say who the father was having me complicated her life enormously and must have brought her a great deal of shame and hardship my grandparents were very religious very old school anna laughed a little very italian they didnt cut my mother out of their lives but my sense was that it made her uncomfortable to have more than a peripheral part in them so we had an apartment about a quarter the size of this one she brought the pot to the counter poured the rich dark coffee it was in april on a saturday shed taken off work so we could go we had the best day and we stayed later than wed planned because we were having fun i was half asleep on the ride back and she must have made a wrong turn i know we got lost but she just joked about it the car broke down smoke started pouring out from under the hood she pulled over to the side and we got out just started giggling what a mess what a fix he knew what was coming and it sickened him maybe you should sit down no im all right she thought it was the radiator needing water anna continued her eyes unfocused as she looked back she could remember how warm it had been how quiet and how the moon had drifted in and out of smokylooking clouds we were going to hike back to the closest house and see if we could get some help a car came along stopped there were two men inside and one of them leaned out and asked us if we had a problem she lifted her coffee sipped her hands were steady now she could say it all again and live through it all again i remember the way her hand squeezed mine clamped down so hard it hurt i realized later that she was afraid they were drunk she said something about just walking down to her brothers house that we were fine but they got out of the car she pushed me behind her when the first one grabbed her she yelled at me to run but i couldnt i couldnt move he was laughing and pawing at her and she was fighting him and when he dragged her off the road and pushed her down i ran up and tried to pull him off but of course i couldnt and the other man yanked me off and tore my shirt a defenseless woman and a helpless child cams hands fisted at his sides as both rage and impotence coursed through him he wanted to go back to that night that deserted road and use them viciously he kept laughing anna said quietly i saw his face very clearly for a moment or two like it was frozen in front of my eyes i kept hearing my mother screaming begging them not to hurt me he was raping her i could hear him raping her but she kept begging them to leave me alone and she must have seen that that wasnt going to happen and she fought harder i could hear the man hitting her yelling at her to shut up it didnt seem real even when he was raping me it didnt seem like it could be real just an awful dream that went on and on and on when they were finished they stumbled back to their car and drove away they just left us there my mother was unconscious hed beaten her badly i didnt know what to do they said i went into shock but i dont remember anything until i was in the hospital my mother never regained consciousness she was in a coma for two days then she died anna i dont know what to say to you what can be said to you i didnt tell you for your sympathy she said she was twentyseven a year younger than i am now it was a long time ago but you dont forget it never goes away completely and i remember everything that happened that night everything i did afterward after i went to live with my grandparents i did everything i could to hurt them to hurt myself that was my way of dealing with what had happened to me i refused counseling she told him coolly i wasnt going to talk to some thinfaced driedup shrink instead i picked fights looked for trouble found it i had indiscriminate sex used drugs ran away from home and butted up against the social workers and the system she picked up the jacket shed stripped off earlier and folded it neatly now i hated everyone myself most of all i was the one who had wanted to go to philadelphia i was the reason we were there if i hadnt been with her she would have gotten away no he wanted to touch her but was afraid to not because she seemed fragile she didnt she seemed impossibly strong no you werent to blame for any of it i felt the blame and the more i felt it the more i struck out at everyone and everything around me sometimes its all you can do he murmured fight back run wild until you get it all out sometimes theres nothing to fight and nowhere to run for three years i used what had happened that night to do whatever i chose she looked at cam again with a quick ironic lift and fall of brow i didnt choose well i thought i was a pretty tough cookie when i ended up in juvie but my caseworker was tougher she pushed and she prodded and she hounded me because she refused to give up on me she got through and because my grandparents refused to give up on me i got through carefully she laid the jacket back over the arm of the sofa it could have been different i could have stayed just one more failed statistic in the system but i didnt he thought it was amazing that she had turned a horror into such strength she was amazing for choosing work that would have to remind her daily of what had ripped her life apart and you decided to pay it back to go into the kind of work that had turned you around i knew i could help and yes i owed a debt the same way you feel you owe one i survived she said looking him dead in the eyes again but survival isnt enough it wasnt enough for me or for you and it wont be enough for seth one thing at a time he murmured i want to know if they caught the bastards no shed long ago learned to accept and to live with that it was weeks before i was coherent enough to make a statement they never caught them the system doesnt always work but ive learned and i believe it does its best ive never thought so and this doesnt change my mind he started to reach out hesitated then tucked his hand into his pocket im sorry i hurt you that i said things that made you remember its always there she told him you cope and you put it aside for long periods of time it comes back now and again because it never really goes away did you have counseling eventually yes i she broke off sighed all right im not saying counseling works miracles cam im telling you it can be helpful it can be healing i needed it and when i was finally ready to use that help i was better lets do this he did touch her now just laid a hand over hers on the counter well leave it as an option lets see how things go all around see how things go she sighed too tired to argue her head ached and her body felt hollowed out and fragile i agree with that but ill still recommend counseling in my report dont forget the shoes he said dryly and was vastly relieved when she laughed i wont have to mention them because i know youll have him at the store by the weekend we could call it a compromise i seem to be getting better at them lately then you must have been incredibly obstinate before i think the word my parents used was bullheaded its comforting to be understood she looked down at the hand covering hers if you asked to stay i couldnt say no i want to stay i want you but i cant ask tonight bad timing all around she understood how some men felt about a woman whod been sexually attacked her stomach seized into hard knots but it was best to know is it because i was raped he wouldnt let it be he refused to allow what had happened to her affect what would happen between them its because you couldnt say no tonight and tomorrow you might be sorry you didnt surprised she looked up at him again youre never quite what i expect you to be he wasnt quite what he expected either not lately this thing here whatever it is isnt quite what i expected it to be how about a saturday night date i have a date saturday her lips curved slowly the knots in her stomach had loosened she hadnt even been aware of it but ill break it seven oclock he leaned across the counter kissed her lingered over it kissed her again im going to want to finish this so am i well he heaved a sigh and started for the door while he was sure he could thats going to make the drive home easier he paused turned around to look at her you said you survived anna but you didnt you triumphed everything about you is a testament to courage and strength when she stared at him obviously stunned he smiled a little you didnt get either from a social worker or a counselor they just helped you figure out how to use it i figure you got it from your mother she must have been a hell of a woman she was anna murmured near tears again so are you cam closed the door quietly behind him he decided he would take his time driving home he had a lot to think about chapter eleven contents prev next pretty saturday mornings in the spring were not meant to be spent indoors or on crowded streets to ethan they were meant to be spent on the water the idea of shopping actually shopping was very close to terrifying dont see why we all have to do this because hed gotten to the jeep first cam rode in front he turned his head to spare ethan a glance because were all in this the old claremont barns for rent right we need a place if were going to build boats we have to make the deal insanity was all phillip had to say as he turned down market street in st chris cant go into business if you dont have a place of business cam returned he found that single fact inarguably logical so we take a look at it make the deal with claremont and get started licenses taxes materials orders for gods sake phillip began tools advertising phone lines fax lines bookkeeping so take care of it cam shrugged carelessly soon as we sign the lease and get the kid his shoes you can do whatever conies next i can do it phillip complained at the same time seth muttered he didnt need any damn shoes ethan got our first order i found out about the building you take care of the paperwork and youre getting the damn shoes he told seth i dont know how come youre the boss of everybody cam could only manage a short grim laugh me either the claremont building wasnt really a barn but it was as big as one in the mids it had been a tobacco warehouse after the revolutionary war the british ships no longer sailed to st chris carrying their wide variety of goods businesses that had boomed went bankrupt the revival in the late s grew directly from the bay with improved methods of canning and packing the national market for oysters opened up and st chris once again prospered and the old tobacco warehouse was refitted as a packinghouse then the oyster beds played out and the building became a glorified storage shed over the last fifty years it had been empty as often as it was filled from the outside it was unpretentious sun and weatherfaded brick thumbsize holes in the mortar a sagging old roof that was desperately in need of reshingling what windows it could boast were small and stingy most were broken all were filthy oh yeah this looks promising already disgusted phillip parked in the pitted lot at the side of the building we need space cam reminded him it doesnt have to be pretty good thing because this doesnt come close to pretty a bit more interested now ethan climbed out he walked up to the closest window used the bandanna from his back pocket to rub off most of the grime so he could peer through its a good space got cargo doors at the back a dock needs a little work a little phillip stared in over ethans shoulder floors rotting out its got to be infested with vermin probably termites and rodents probably be a good idea to mention that to claremont ethan decided keep the rent down hearing the tinkle of glass breaking he saw that cam had just put his elbow through an already cracked window guess were going inside breaking and entering phillip only shook his head thats a good start cam flipped the pathetic lock on the window and shoved it up it was already broken give me a minute he boosted himself inside disappeared cool seth decided and before a word could be spoken he climbed inside too nice example were setting for him phillip ran a hand over his face and wished fervently hed never given up smoking well think of it this way you could have picked the locks but you didnt right listen ethan weve got to think about this theres no reason why you cant we cant build that first boat at your place once we start renting buildings filing for tax numbers were committed whats the worst that can happen we waste some time and some money i figure ive got enough of both he heard the mix of cams and seths laughter echoing inside and maybe well have some fun while were at it he started around to the front door knowing phillip would grumble but follow i saw a rat seth said in pure delight when cam shoved the front door open it was awesome rats phillip studied the dim space grimly before stepping inside lovely well have to get us a couple of shecats ethan decided theyre meaner than toms he looked up scanning the high ceiling water damage showed clearly in the open rafters there was a loft but the steps leading up to it were broken rot and very likely rats had eaten at the scarred wood floor it would require a great deal of cleaning out and repair but the space was generous he began to allow himself to dream the smell of wood under the saw the tang of tongue oil the slap of hammer on nail the glint of brass the squeak of rigging he could already see the way the sun would slant in through new clean windows onto the skeleton of a sloop throw up some walls i guess for an office cam was saying seth dashed here and there exploring and exclaiming well have to draw up plans or something this place is a heap phillip pointed out yeah so itll come cheap we put a couple thousand into fixing it up better to have it bulldozed and start over phil try to control that wild optimism cam turned to ethan what do you think itll do itll do what phillip threw up his hands fall down around our ears at that moment a spider which phillip estimated to be about the size of a chihuahua crawled over the toe of his shoe get me a gun he muttered cam only laughed and slapped him on the back lets go see claremont stuart claremont was a little man with hard eyes and a dissatisfied mouth the little chunks of st christopher that he owned were most often left to fall into disrepair if his tenants complained loudly enough he occasionally and grudgingly tinkered with plumbing or heat or patched a roof but he believed in saving his pennies for a rainy day in claremonts mind it never rained quite hard enough to part with a cent still his house on oyster shell lane was a showplace as anyone in st chris could tell you his wife nancy could nag the ears off a turnip and she ruled that roost the walltowall carpet was thick and soft the walls prettily papered fussy curtains were ruthlessly coordinated with fussy upholstery magazines lay in military lines over a gleaming cherry wood coffee table that matched gleaming cherry wood end tables that matched gleaming cherry wood occasional tables nothing was out of place in the claremont house each room looked like a picture from a magazine like the picture cam mused and not at all like life so youre interested in the barn with a stretchedout grin that hid his teeth claremont ushered them all into his den it was decorated in english baronial style the dark paneling was accented with hunting prints there were deepcushioned leather chairs in a port wine shade a desk with brass fittings and a brick fireplace converted to gas the bigscreen television seemed both out of place and typical mildly phillip told him it had been agreed on the drive over that phillip would handle the negotiations weve just started to look around for space terrific old place claremont sat down behind his desk and gestured them to chairs lots of history im sure but were not interested in history in this case there seems to be a lot of rot a bit claremont waved that away with one shortfingered hand you live round here what can you expect you boys thinking of starting some business or other were considering it were in the talkingaboutit stages uhhuh claremont didnt think so or the three of them wouldnt be sitting on the other side of his desk as he considered just how much rent he could pry out of them for what he considered an irritating weight around his neck he looked at seth well well talk about it then maybe the boy here wants to go outside no he doesnt cam said without a smile were all talking about it if thats the way you want it so claremont thought thats the way it was he could hardly wait to tell nancy why hed had a good closeup look at the kid now and a halfblind idiot could see ray quinn in those eyes saint ray he thought sourly it looked like the mighty had fallen yes sir and he was going to enjoy letting people know what was what im looking for a fiveyear lease he told phillip correctly judging who would be handling the business end were looking for one year at this point with an option for seven of course wed expect certain repairs to be completed before we took occupancy repairs claremont leaned back in his chair hah that place is solid as a rock and wed require termite inspection and treatment regular maintenance would of course be our responsibility aint no damn bugs in that place well then phillip smiled easily youd only have to arrange for the inspection what are you asking for in rent because he was annoyed and because hed always despised ray quinn claremont bumped up his figure two thousand a month two before cam could choke out his pithy opinion phillip rose no point in wasting your time then we appreciate you seeing us hold it hold it claremont chuckled fought off the little tug of panic at having a deal slip through his grasping fingers so quickly didnt say that wasnt negotiable after all i knew your daddy he aimed that tightlipped smile directly at seth knew him more than twentyfive years i wouldnt feel right if i didnt give his boys a little break fine phillip settled down again resisted rubbing his hands together he forgot all his objections to the overall plan in his delight in the art of the deal lets negotiate what the hell have i done thirty minutes later phillip sat in his jeep methodically rapping his head against the steering wheel a damn good job id say ethan patted him on the shoulder hed reached the jeep ahead of cam this time and had taken winners point in the front seat cut his opening price in half got him to agree to paying for most of the repairs if we do them ourselves and confused him enough to have him go for the whatwasit rent control clause if we take the sevenyear option the place is a dump were going to pay twelve thousand dollars a year not including utilities and maintenance for a pit yeah but now its our pit pleased cam stretched out his legs or tried pull that seat up some ethan im jammed back here nope maybe you should drop me back by the place i can start figuring things and i can get a lift home later were going shopping cam reminded him i dont need any damn shoes seth said again but in reflex rather than annoyance youre getting damn shoes and youre getting a damn haircut while were at it and were all going to the damn mall id rather get hit with a brick than go to the mall on a saturday ethan hunched down in his seat pulled the brim of his cap low over his eyes he couldnt bear to think about it when you start working in that death trap phillip told him youll likely be hit with a ton of them if i have to get a haircut everybodys getting one cam glanced briefly at seths mutinous face you think this is a democracy shit grab some reality kid youre ten you could use one phillip met cams eyes in the rearview mirror as he drove north out of st chris your hairs longer than his shut up phil ethan goddamn it pull your seat up i hate the mall in defiance ethan stretched his own legs out and tipped the back of his seat down a notch its full of people pete the barbers still got his place on market street yeah and everybody who walks out of it looks like beaver cleaver frustrated cam gave the back of ethans seat a solid kick keep your feet off my upholstery phillip warned or youll walk to the damn mall tell him to give me some room if i have to get shoes i get to pick them out you dont have any say in it if im paying for the shoes youll wear what i tell you and like it ill buy the stinking shoes myself i got twenty dollars cam snorted out a laugh try to get a grip on that reality again pal you cant buy decent socks for twenty these days you can if you dont have to have some fancy designer label on them ethan tossed in this aint paris you havent bought decent shoes in ten years cam threw back and if you dont pull up that frigging seat im going to cut it out phillip exploded cut it out right now or i swear im going to pull over and knock your heads together oh my god he took one hand off the wheel to drag it down his face i sound like mom forget it just forget it kill each other ill dump the bodies in the mall parking lot and drive to mexico ill learn how to weave mats and sell them on the beach at cozumel itll be quiet itll be peaceful ill change my name to raoul and no one will know i was ever related to a bunch of fools seth scratched his belly and turned to cam does he always talk like that yeah mostly sometimes hes going to be pierre and live in a garret in paris but its the same thing weird was seths only comment he pulled a piece of bubble gum out of his pocket unwrapped it and popped it into his mouth getting new shoes was turning into an adventure it would have stopped at shoes if cam hadnt noticed that the seat of seths jeans was nearly worn through not that he thought that was a big deal he assured himself but it was probably best since they were there anyway to pick up a couple of pairs of jeans he had no doubt that if seth hadnt bitched so much about trying on jeans he himself wouldnt have felt compelled to push on to shirts to shorts to a windbreaker and somehow theyd ended up with three ball caps an orioles sweatshirt and a glowinthedark frisbee when he tried to think back to exactly where hed taken that first wrong turn it all became a blur of clothes racks complaining voices and cash registers churning the dogs greeted them with wild and desperate enthusiasm the minute they pulled into the drive this would have been endearing but for the fact that the pair of them reeked of dead fish with much cursing and shoving and threats the humans escaped into the house shutting the dogs with their hurt feelings outside the phone was ringing somebody get that cam pleaded seth take this junk upstairs then go give those stinking dogs a bath both of them the thought thrilled him but he thought it best to complain how come i have to do it because i said so oh he hated falling back on something that lame and that adult the hose is around back god i want a beer but because he lacked the energy even for that he dropped into the closest chair and stared glassyeyed at nothing if he had to face that mall again in this life he promised himself he would just shoot himself in the head and be done with it that was anna phillip told him as he wandered back into the living room anna saturday night he couldnt stop the groan i need a transfusion she said to tell you shed take care of dinner good fine ive got to pull myself together the kids yours and ethans for tonight hes ethans phillip corrected ive got a date myself but he sank into a chair and closed his eyes its not even five oclock and all i want to do is crawl into bed and oblivion how do people do this hes got enough clothes to last him a year if we only have to do it once a year how bad can it be phillip opened one eye hes got spring and summer clothes what happens when fall gets here sweaters coats boots and hes bound to outgrow every damn thing we bought today we cant allow that to happen there must be a pill or something we can give him and maybe hes got a coat already he came pretty much with the clothes on his back dad didnt get a package deal this time either okay well think about that later lots later cam pressed his fingers to his eyes you saw the way claremont looked at him didnt you that nasty little gleam in his beady little eyes i saw it hell talk and hell say what he wants to say nothing we can do about it you think the kid knows anything one way or the other i dont know what seth knows i cant get a handle on him but im going to look into investigators on monday check on tracking down the mother asking for trouble weve already got trouble the only way to deal with it is to gather information if it turns out that seths a quinn by blood then we deal with that dad wouldnt have hurt mom that way marriage wasnt just a thing to them it was the thing and they were solid if hed slipped hed have told her that phillip firmly believed and theyd have worked it out that part of their lives wasnt our business and it wouldnt be our business now but for seth he wouldnt have slipped cam murmured determined to believe it ill tell you one thing i got from them you get married you make that promise thats it i figure thats why the three of us are still on the single side of life maybe but we cant ignore the talk the suspicions and if the insurance company balks on paying off dads policy its going to put all four of us in a bind especially since we just signed a lease for that hellhole well be okay lucks starting to move in our direction oh phil asked as cam rose how do you figure that because im about to spend the evening with one of the sexiest women on the planet and i intend to get very lucky he glanced back as he started up the stairs dont wait up bro when he stepped into his bedroom cam heard the commotion from the backyard he walked to the window and looked down on seth and the dogs simon was sitting stoically while seth soaped him down foolish raced in mad circles barking in excitement and terror at the hose that was pouring out water where it had been carelessly tossed on the grass of course the kid was wearing his brandnew shoes which were now soaking wet and muddy he was laughing like a loon he hadnt known the boy could laugh like that cam realized as he kept watching he hadnt known he could look like that unreservedly happy and young and silly simon stood up gave a long violent shake that sent water and soap flying backing up seth slipped in the wet grass and tumbled onto his back he continued to howl with laughter as both dogs pounced on him they wrestled over the water and mud and soap until the three of them were soaked and filthy upstairs cam just stood watching with a milewide grin on his face the image popped in his head when he headed down the hallway to annas apartment he wanted to be able to tell her about it over dinner he wanted to share it and he thought it would certainly soften her every bit as much as a quiet meal in a candlelit restaurant the roses hed picked up on the way werent going to hurt either he sniffed them himself if he was any judge of the female mind and heart hed bet his full stake that anna spinelli had a weak spot for yellow roses before he could knock on annas door the door across the hall swung open hello there you must be the new boyfriend hi mrs hardelman we met a few days ago no we didnt you met sister oh he smiled cautiously she looked exactly like the woman who had popped out of that door before even down to the pink chenille robe well hows it going you brought her flowers shell like that my beaux used to bring me flowers and my henry god rest his soul brought me lilacs every may you think lilacs next month young man if anna lets you keep coming around most of them she scoots along but maybe shell keep you yeah he managed to smile even as his heart stopped at the words keep you maybe on impulse he pulled one of the roses out and gave it to her with a neat little flourish oh a girlish blush rose pink on her wrinkled face oh my goodness her eyes gleamed with pleasure as she sniffed it how lovely how sweet why if i were forty years younger id fight anna for you she winked flirtatiously and id win no contest he flashed her a return wink and a grin ah say hi to sister you have a nice time tonight you go dancing she added as she shut the door good idea and chuckling to himself cam knocked when she answered looking sexy enough to gobble up in three quick bites he decided the dance should begin immediately he snatched her up whirled her around to the throbbing elemental beat of classic bruce springsteen and the e street band then he dipped her as she laughed and stumbled well hello enjoying the quick dizziness she chuckled let me up youve got me off balance thats just where i want you off balance he lowered his mouth to hers in a molten kiss that melted every bone in her body with her head spinning she clutched at his shoulders doors still open she managed and flailed out with a hand to slam it shut good thinking he brought her up slowly inch by inch his mouth still nibbling busily on hers your neighbor said i should take you dancing oh she was surprised steam wasnt pumping out of her pores is that what that was that was just a sample he caught her bottom lip between his teeth tugged released wanna tango anna i think wed better sit this one out but she pressed a hand to her heart to hold it in place as she eased out of his arms you brought me flowers she buried her face in them as she took them from him figured i was a sucker for rosebuds did you yeah youre right she laughed over the blooms ill put them in water you can pour us some wine ive got it breathing on the counter glasses are right there okay i he looked over saw a shiny pot steaming on the stove a platter of antipasto on the counter whats all this dinner she crouched down at a kitchen cupboard to locate a vase didnt phillip give you my message i thought when you told him youd take care of it you meant you had someplace you wanted to go and youd make the reservations he plucked a stuffed mushroom off the platter sampled it and sighed in pure sensory delight i didnt think youd be cooking for me i like to cook she said easily as she filled a pale pink vase with water and i wanted to be alone with you he swallowed quickly hard to argue with that what are we having linguini with the famous spinelli family red sauce she turned to take the glass of merlot hed poured for her her face was just a little flushed from the kitchen heat the dress shed chosen was the color of ripe peaches and molded her curves like a lovers hands her hair was down and curling madly and her lips were painted nearly the same color as the wine she sipped cam decided if they were to have more than a threesecond conversation before he grabbed her again hed better stay on the opposite side of the counter it smells incredible it tastes better her pulse was hammering everywhere at once the way hed looked at her just that one long intense and measuring stare before he smiled had brought out her need a low and nagging ache of need throbbing incessantly on an impulse she reached back and turned the flame under the pot off keeping her eyes on cams she walked around the counter so do i she told him she set her glass aside then took his placed it on the counter she shook her hair back tipped her face up to his smiled slowly try me chapter twelve contents prev next his blood was already pounding a hard primal beat as he took a step forward he looked into her eyes wanting to see every shift and flicker of emotion im going to want to do more than try so be sure sometimes she thought you had to go with your instincts with your cravings at that moment hers all of hers centered on him you wouldnt be here tonight if i wasnt with a slow curving of lips she reached up and twined his hair around her finger she could handle him she was sure of it he put his hands on her hips this was no pencilslim model with a body like a boy but a woman and he wanted her he smiled back he could handle her he was sure of it you like to gamble anna now and then lets roll the dice he brought her against him in one hard jerk one that made her breath catch and release an instant before his mouth was on hers the kiss was quickly desperate quickly ravenous tongues tangling teeth nipping the little feral purrs that sounded in her throat went straight to his head like hot whiskey she tugged his shirt free of his waistband then her hands shot under flesh and muscle she needed to feel it with a hum of pleasure she kneaded and scraped and stroked until that flesh seemed to burn under her fingers and those muscles hardened like iron she wanted those muscles that strength pitted against her own he fumbled at the back of her dress searching for a zipper and she laughed breathlessly with her mouth at his throat it doesnt have a zipper she closed her teeth over his jaw and didnt bother to be gentle you have to peel it off jesus he tugged the snug stretchy material off her shoulder and replaced it with teeth as the craving for the taste of flesh her flesh overwhelmed him they circled like dancers though their pace outdistanced the dreamy strains of the chopin prelude that had replaced the boss he toed off his shoes she rushed open the buttons of his shut his head was swimming as they bumped into the bedroom door she laughed again but the sound slipped toward a moan when he yanked the dress down to her waist when those eyes of smoked steel streaked down when he lowered his head and began to devour the flesh above the black lace edge of her bra his tongue slid under teasing and tasting until her knees were loose and her head full of flashing lights and colors shed known he could do this to her take her to that teetering edge of reason and insanity shed wanted him to more shed wanted to take him there with her the wanting was huge ruthlessly keen recklessly primitive and for now for both of them it was all that mattered murmuring mindlessly she dragged off his shirt and dug her nails into the hard ridge of his shoulders his chest was broad and firm the flesh hot and smooth under her roaming hands there were scars under the shoulder along the ribs the body she thought of a risktaker of a man who played to win with a quick and expert flick of his fingers he opened the front hook and let her breasts fill his greedy hands she was magnificent golden skin and lush curves he thought her body almost impossibly perfect yet it was erotically real soft and firm and smooth and fragrant he wanted to bury himself in her but when she tugged at the button of his slacks he shook his head uhuh i want you in bed he brought her hands up until they circled his neck brought his mouth down until the kiss was savage and stunning i want you under me over me wrapped around me she kicked off one shoe balancing herself as they swayed toward the bed i want you inside me kicked off the other as they tumbled to the mattress she rolled over him first straddling him the light was nearly gone only a pale wash from the setting sun slipped through the windows shadows shifted her lips were hungry restless racing over his face his throat though she had wanted men before now there was a ferocious and primal greed sweeping through her that shed never experienced she would take him was all she could think take what she wanted and ease this almost unbearable need when she arched back and her upper body was silhouetted in that fragile light the breath clogged in his lungs he wanted with an urgency he couldnt remember feeling for anything or anyone else the desire to take to possess to own surged violently in his already raging blood he reared up gripping her hair in one hand yanking her head back to expose that long column of throat to his mouth he could have anything with her would have everything he was rougher than he meant to be as he pushed her back on the bed his breath was already heaving as he locked his hands with hers her eyes were dark and gleaming the kind of eyes he thought for a man to drown in her hair a tangled mass of black silk against the deep bronze of the spread the scent of her was more than a provocative invitation it was a smoldering demand take me it seemed to say if you dare i could eat you alive he murmured and once more crushed his mouth to hers he held her down knowing that if she wrestled free it would be over too soon fast god yes he wanted fast but he didnt want it to end he thought he could live his life right here in this bed with annas quivering body under his her hands flexed under his her body arched when he drew the tip of her breast into his mouth he could feel her heartbeat stumble as he used teeth tongue lips to taste to pleasure them both when hed filled himself on her fed himself on her he released her hands to touch and be touched they rolled over the bed groping tugging at the clothes that remained between them their breath was quick and labored punctuated by half gasps and low moans that spoke of turbulent thrills and dark delights sensation slid over sensation building trembling layers toward delirium she shuddered under his hands nearly wept as each new lash of pleasure whipped through her each sharp and separate she fought to bring him the same barbed and edgy ache his hand closed over her and she was hot and wet and ready her body arched her nails bit into his back as her system exploded to peak then they went mad she would remember only a battle for more and more still more wild animal sex a craving to mate seeking hands slid off damp flesh hungry mouth sought hungry mouth she came again and her cry of release was a half sob of both triumph and helplessness the light was gone but he could still see her the glint of those dark eyes the generous shape of that beautiful mouth the blood roared in his head in his heart in his loins he could think only now and drove himself hard and deep inside her his vision grayed his mind reeled they remained poised for a shivering moment joined mated he wasnt even aware that his hands sought hers that their fingers locked into fists then they began to move a race now full of speed and urgency there was the good healthy sound of damp flesh slapping against damp flesh their gazes met and held he watched her eyes go blind and opaque as she crested he heard the moan tear from her lips an instant before he closed his over hers to swallow the sound her hips pumped like pistons urging him on driving him closer to his own jagged brink he hammered himself into her holding onto the edge by his fingertips watching her watching her while the need for release clawed viciously at his gut then her body went taut a drawn bow of shock and pleasure it was her scream he swallowed as he let himself fall he couldnt possibly move cam was certain that if someone held a gun to his head at that moment he would simply lie there and take the bullet at least hed die a satisfied man he couldnt think of a better place to be than stretched out over annas curvy body with his face buried in her hair and if he stayed there long enough he might get his second wind the music had changed again when his mind cleared enough for him to tune in to it he recognized paul simons clever twists of lyrics and melody he nearly drifted off as he was invited to call the singer al if you fall asleep on top of me im going to have to hurt you he drummed up the energy to smile im not going to sleep im thinking about making love to you again oh she stroked her hands down his back to his hips are you yeah just give me a couple of minutes id be glad to if i could breathe oh lazily he propped himself on his elbows and looked down at her sorry she only grinned no youre not youre smug but so am i so thats okay it was great sex it was great sex she agreed now im going to finish dinner well need fuel if were going to try that again both delighted and baffled he shook his head youre a fascinating woman anna no games no pretenses looking the way you do you could have men jumping through hoops she gave him a little shove so she could wiggle free what makes you think i havent youre exactly where i wanted you arent you smiling she rose and walked naked to the closet thats a hell of a body youve got there miz spinelli she glanced over her shoulder as she wrapped herself in a short red robe same to you quinn she headed out to the kitchen humming to herself as she turned the heat back on under the sauce filled a pot with water for the pasta lord it was lovely she thought to feel so loose so limber so liberated however reckless it might be for her to take cameron quinn as a lover the results were worth every risk hed made her aware of every inch of her body and every inch of his he made her feel painfully alive and best of all she mused as she took out the bread she wanted to toast lightly he seemed to understand her it was one thing to be wanted by a man to be satisfied by a man but it warmed her heart to be liked by the man who desired her she turned and picked up her wine just as cam came out of the bedroom hed pulled on his slacks but hadnt bothered to hook them anna sipped slowly while she studied him over the rim of her glass broad shoulders hard chest the waist that tapered to narrow hips and long legs oh yes he had a terrific body and for now it was all hers she lifted a pepper from the tray and held it up to his lips its got bite cam said as the heat filled his mouth umhmm i like bite she picked up his wine and handed it to him hungry as a matter of fact it wont be long and because she recognized the look in his eye she slipped around the counter to stir her sauce the waters nearly on the boil you know what they say about a watched pot he began and started around the counter after her it was the sketch on the refrigerator that distracted him from his halfformed plan to wrestle her to the kitchen floor hey that looks just like foolish it is foolish seth drew it get out he hooked a thumb in his pocket as he took a closer study really its damn good isnt it i didnt know the kid could draw you would if you spent more time with him i spend time with him every day cam muttered he doesnt tell me dick cam didnt know where the vague annoyance had come from but he didnt care for it howd you get this out of him i asked she said simply and slid linguini into the boiling water cam shifted on his feet look im doing the best i can with the kid i didnt say you werent i just think youll do better with a little more practice and a little more effort she pushed her hair back she hadnt meant to get into this her relationship with cam was supposed to have two separate compartments without their contents getting mixed up together youre doing a good job i mean that but youve got a long way to go cam in gaining his trust his affection giving your own hes an obligation youre fulfilling and thats admirable but hes also a young boy he needs love you have feelings for him ive seen them she smiled over at him you just dont know what to do with them yet cam scowled at the sketch so now im supposed to talk to him about drawing dogs anna sighed then turned to frame cams face in her hands just talk to him youre a good man with a good heart the rest will come annoyed again he gripped her wrists he couldnt have said why the quiet understanding in her voice the amused compassion in her eyes made him nervous im not a good man his grip tightened just enough to make her eyes narrow im selfish impatient i go for the thrills because thats what suits me paying your debts doesnt have anything to do with having a good heart im a son of a bitch and i like it that way she merely arched a brow its always wise to know yourself he felt a little flutter of panic in his throat and ignored it ill probably hurt you before were done anna tilted her head maybe ill hurt you first willing to risk it he didnt know whether to laugh or swear and ended up pulling her into his arms for a smoldering kiss lets eat in bed that was the plan she told him the pasta was cold by the time they got to it but that didnt stop them from eating ravenously they sat crosslegged on her bed knees bumping and ate in the glow of the half dozen candles shed lighted cam shoveled in linguini and closed his eyes in pure sensory pleasure goddamn this is good anna wound pasta expertly around her fork and bit you should taste my lasagna im counting on it relaxed and lazy he broke a piece of the crusty bread shed put into a wicker basket and handed half to her her bedroom hed noted was different from the rest of the apartment here she hadnt gone for the practical for the streamlined the bed itself was a wide pool covered in soft rose sheets and a slick satin duvet in rich bronze the headboard was a romantic arch of wrought iron curvy and frivolous and plumped now with a dozen fat colorful pillows the dresser he pegged as an antique a heavy old piece of mahogany refinished to a rosy gleam it was covered with pretty little bottles and bowls and a silverbacked brush the mirror over it was a long oval there was a mahogany ladys vanity with a skirted stool and glinting brass handles for some reason hed always found that particular type of furniture incredibly sexy a copper urn was filled with tall fussy flowers the walls were crowded with art and the windows framed in the same rich bronze as the spread this he thought idly was annas room the rest of the apartment was still miz spinellis the practical and the sensual both suited her he reached over the side of the bed to the floor where hed put the bottle of wine he topped off her glass trying to get me drunk he flashed a grin at her her hair was tangled the robe loose enough to have one shoulder curving free her big dark eyes seemed to laugh at both of them dont have to but it might be interesting anyway she smiled shrugged and drank why dont you tell me about your day today he gave a mock shudder nightmare time really she twirled more pasta fed it to him details shopping shoes hideous when she laughed he felt the smile split his face god she had a great laugh i made ethan and phillip go with me no way i was facing that alone we had to practically handcuff the kid to get him to go youd think i was fitting him for a straitjacket instead of new hightops too many men dont appreciate the joys challenges and nuances of shopping next time you go anyway i had my eye on this building on the waterfront we checked it out before we headed to the mall itll do the job what job the business boat building anna set her fork down youre serious about that dead serious the placell do it needs some work but the rents in line especially since were strongarming the landlord into paying for most of the basic repairs you want to build boats itll get me out of the house keep me off the streets when she didnt smile back he shrugged his shoulder yeah i think i could get into it for now anyway well do this one for the client ethans already got lined up see how it goes from there i take it you signed a lease thats right why putz around some might say caution consideration details i leave the caution and consideration to ethan the details to phillip if it doesnt work all weve lost is a few bucks and a little time odd how that prickly temper suited him she mused it went so well with those dark damnitall looks and if it does work she added have you thought of that what do you mean if it works youll have taken on another commitment its getting to be a habit she laughed now at the expression of annoyance and surprise on his face its going to be fun to ask you how you feel about all this in six months or so she leaned forward and kissed him lightly how about some dessert the nagging worry the word commitment had brought on faded back as her lips rubbed over his whatcha got cannoli she told him as she set their plates on the floor sounds good or watching him she unbelted her robe let it slide off her shoulders me sounds better he said and let her pull him to her it was just after three when seth heard the car pull into the drive hed been asleep but having dreams bad ones where he was back in one of those smelly rooms where the walls were stained and thinner than his drawing paper and every sound carried through them sex noises grunts and groans and creaking mattresses his mothers nasty laugh when she was coked up it made him sweat having those dreams sometimes she would come in to where he was trying to find comfort and sleep on the musty sofa if her mood was good she would laugh and give him smothering hugs waking him out of a fitful sleep into the smells and sounds of the world shed dragged him into if her mood was bad she would curse and slap and often end up sitting on the floor crying wildly either way made for one more miserable night but worse hundreds of times worse was when one of the men shed taken to bed slipped out crept across the cramped room and touched him it hadnt happened often and waking up screaming and swinging drove them off but the fear lived inside him like a redhot demon hed learned to sleep on the floor behind the sofa whenever she had a man around but this time seth hadnt waked from nightmare to worse he fought his way out of the sweaty dream and found himself on clean sheets with a snoring puppy curled beside him he cried a little because he was alone and there was no one to see then he snuggled closer to foolish comforted by the soft fur and steady heartbeat the sound of the car coming in stopped him from drifting back to sleep his first thought was cops theyd come to get him to haul him away then he told himself even as his heart jumped up to pound in his throat that he was being a baby still he crept out of bed padded silently to the window to look he had a hiding place picked out if one was needed it was the vette seth told himself hed have recognized the sound of its engine if he hadnt been half asleep he saw cam get out heard the soft cheerful whistling been out poking at some woman seth decided with a sneer grownups were so predictable when he remembered that cam was supposed to have dinner with the social worker that night his eyes went wide his jaw dropped man oh man he thought cam was bouncing on miss spinelli that was so weird so weird he realized he didnt know how he felt about it one thing for sure he realized as cam whistled his way to the door cam felt just fine and dandy about it when he heard the front door close he snuck to his own bedroom door he wanted to get a quick peek but at the sound of feet coming up the stairs he dived back into bed just in case the puppy whimpered began to stir and seth slammed his eyes shut as the door opened when the footsteps came slowly quietly toward the bed his heart began to pound in his chest what would he do he thought in a sick panic god what could he do foolishs tail began to thump on the bed as seth cringed and waited for the worst guess you think this is a pretty good deal lazing around half the day getting your belly filled having a nice soft bed at night cam murmured his voice was slightly slurred from lack of sleep but to seth it sounded like drugs or liquor he struggled to keep his breathing slow and steady while his heartbeat pounded like a jackhammer against his ribs in his head yeah you fell into roses didnt you and didnt have to do a thing to earn it goofylooking dog seth nearly blinked realizing cam was speaking to foolish and not him itll be his problem wont it when youre grown and take up more of the bed than he does cautious seth slitted his eyes open just enough so he could see through his lashes he saw cams hand come down give foolish a quick careless stroke then the tangled sheets and blanket came up smoothed over his shoulders that same hand gave seths head a quick and careless stroke when the door closed again seth waited thirty full seconds before daring to open his eyes he looked straight into foolishs face the pup seemed to be grinning at him as though theyd gotten away with something grinning back seth draped an arm around the pups pudgy body i guess it is a pretty good deal huh boy he whispered in agreement foolish licked seths face then yawning hugely settled down to sleep again this time when seth dropped off to sleep there were no sweaty dreams to haunt him chapter thirteen contents prev next youre awfully damn happy these days cam acknowledged phillips pithy comment with a shrug and kept on whistling while he worked they were making decent progress on what cam jokingly thought of as their shipyard it was hard sweaty filthy work and every time cam compared it to laundry detail he praised god though what windows werent broken were open wide the air still carried a vague chemical scent at phillips insistence theyd bought a batch of insect bombs and blasted the place with killing fog when it cleared the death toll was heavy it took nearly a half a day just to clear out the corpses replacement windows were slated to be delivered that day claremont had bitched bitterly about the expense despite the deal he got on them because his brotherinlaw managed the lumber company in cambridge and had sold them to him at cost hed been only slightly mollified that the quinns would rip out the old windows and install the new ones saving him from hiring laborers if the fact that the improvements to the building would spike the potential resale value pleased him he kept that small delight to himself theyd pried or punched out rotted boards and hauled them outside to a steadily growing pile of discards the metal banister of the stairs leading up to the overhead loft was rusted through so they yanked it out claremont was able to finesse the proper permits so they were tossing up a couple of walls to close in what would be a bathroom because cam considered this kind of work a hobby one he enjoyed and he came home most nights to a clean house and had a pretty woman willing to tango with him whenever time and circumstances permitted he figured he had a right to be happy hell the kid had even been doing his homework most of the time he had turned in the muchdespised essay and was halfway through his probation without incident cam figured his luck had been running hot and strong for the past couple of weeks as far as phillip was concerned it had been the worst two weeks of his life he had barely spent any time in his apartment had lost his favorite pair of magli loafers to the gnawing puppy teeth of foolish hadnt seen the inside of a single fourstar restaurant and hadnt so much as sniffed a woman unless he counted mrs wilson at the supermarket and he damn well didnt instead he was handling and juggling and bouncing details that no one else so much as thought about getting blisters on his hands swinging a hammer and spending his evenings wondering what had happened to life as hed known it the fact that he knew cam was getting regular sex fried the hell out of him when the board he lifted gifted him with a fat splinter in the thumb he swore ripely why the hell didnt we hire carpenters because as keeper of our magic funds you pointed out its cheaper this way and claremont gave us the first months rent free if we did it ourselves cam took the board himself placed it and began to hammer in the next stud you said it was a good deal gritting his teeth he yanked out the splinter sucked on his aching thumb i was insane at the time phillip stepped back hands on his hips above his tool belt and surveyed the area it was filthy dirt sawdust piles of refuse stacks of lumber sheets of plastic this was not his life he thought again as the sound of cams hammer thudded in time with the gritty rock beat of bob seger that pumped out of the radio i must have been insane this place is a dump yep setting up this idiotic business is going to devour our capital no doubt about it well go under in six months could be phillip scowled and reached down for the jug of iced tea you dont give a good damn if it bombs it bombs cam tucked his hammer back in his belt took out his measuring tape were no worse off but if it makes it if it just bumps along for a while well have what we need which is cam picked up the next board eyeballed it along its length then set it over the sawhorses a business which ethan can run after the dust settles he gets himself a couple of parttimers offseason watermen he builds three or four boats a year to keep it afloat he paused long enough to mark the board run the saw dust flew and the noise was awesome cam set the power saw aside hefted the board into place ill give him a hand now and then youll keep track of the money end but it ought to give us room to move some i can get in a few races a year you can get back to bilking the consumer with jazzy ads he pulled out his hammer everybodys happy phillip cocked his head scratched his chin youve been thinking thats right when do you figure this slide back to normalitys going to happen cam swiped at the sweat on his forehead with the back of his hand the faster we get this place up and running the faster we get the first boat done which explains why youve been busting your ass and mine then what ive got enough contacts to line up a second job even a third he thought of tod bardette the bastard even now priming a crew for the oneton cup yeah he could finesse bardette into a boat by quinn and there were others plenty of others who would pay and pay well i figure my main contribution to this enterprise is contacts six months he said we can handle six months im going back to work monday phillip told him braced for a fight ive got to im flexing time so ill only be in baltimore monday through thursday its the best i can do cam considered okay i dont have a problem with that but youll be busting ass on weekends for six months phillip thought more or less then he hissed out a breath one factor you havent worked into your plan seth what about him hell be here hes got a place to live im going to use the house as a base and when youre off breaking records and female hearts in monte carlo cam scowled and rapped the hammer harder than necessary on the head of the nail he doesnt want to be in my damn pocket all the time you guysll be around when im not the kids going to be taken care of and if the mother comes back they havent been able to find her nothing id feel better if we knew where she is and what shes up to im not thinking about her shes out of the picture has to be cam insisted remembering the look of pastyfaced terror on seths face shes not going to mess with us id like to know where she is phillip said again and what the hell she was to dad cam put it out of his mind his way of handling loose ends was to knot them up together and forget about them the immediate problem as he saw it was getting the building in shape ordering equipment tools supplies if the business was a means to an end it had to begin every day he worked on the building was one day closer to escape every dollar he poured into supplies and equipment was an investment in the future his future he was keeping his promise he told himself his way with the sun beating down on his back and a faded blue bandanna tied around his head he ripped broken shingles off the roof ethan and phillip were working behind him replacing shingles seth appeared to be having a fine time winging the discarded ones from roof to ground and a satisfying pile was forming below it was a cool place to be as far as seth was concerned up on the roof with the sun beating down and the occasional gull flying by you could see just about everything from up here the town with its straight streets and square yards the old trees popping up out of the grass the flowers were okay too from up here they were just blobs and dots of color someone was mowing and the sound carried up to him like a distant hum he could see the waterfront with the boats at dock or cruising along the water a couple of kids were sailing a little skiff with blue sails and because he envied them he looked away toward the docks there were people shopping or strolling or eating lunch at one of the outdoor tables with umbrellas tourists were watching the show the crab pickers put on he liked to sneer at the tourists when he did he didnt envy the boys in their neat little boat quite so much he wished he had the binoculars ray had given him so he could see even farther he wished he could sit up here sometime with his sketchbook everything looked so clean from up here the sky and water both so blue the grass and leaves so green you could smell the water if you took a good sniff and maybe that was hot dogs grilling the scent made his stomach growl with hunger he shifted a little and looked at cam out of the corner of his eye man he wished he had muscles like that with muscles like that you could do anything and nobody could stop you if a guy had muscles like that he would never have to be afraid of anything anyone ever in his whole life testing his own biceps with his finger he was far from satisfied he thought maybe if he got to use tools he could harden them up you said i could pull some of them off seth reminded him later you said later before im saying it again it was hot nasty tedious work and cam wanted it over as much as he wanted to breathe hed already sweated through his tshirt and pulled it off his back gleamed damp and his throat was desertdry he pried off another square and watched seth send it soaring you throwing them in the same place thats what you said to do he eyed the boy seths hair stuck out from under an orioles fielders cap that cam had ended up buying him when they went to a game the week before now that he thought of it cam didnt think hed seen the kid without the cap since he got it the ball game had been an impulse he thought now just one of those things but it had given him a sharp tug to see the way seths eyes had gone huge at the sight of camden yards how hed sat there a hot dog clutched and forgotten in his hand as he watched every movement on the field and it had made cam laugh when seths serious and firm opinion had been it looks like shit on tv compared to this he watched seth send another shingle flying and wondered if he should teach the kid how to field a ball instantly the fact that he had had the thought irritated him youre not looking where youre throwing them i know where theyre going if you dont like how i do it you can throw them down yourself you said i could pull some off not worth it cam told himself not worth the effort to argue fine you want to rip shingles off the damn roof here look see how im doing this you use the claw of the hammer and ive been watching you for an hour it doesnt take brains to rip off shingles fine cam said between his teeth you do it he shoved the hammer into seths eager hand im going down i need a drink cam went nimbly down the ladder trying to assure himself that all tenyearold boys were snotty assholes and the more shingles the kid ripped free the fewer there would be for him to do himself if he survived the day he had another saturday night date with anna he wanted to make the most of it now there was a woman he thought as he grabbed the jug of ice water and glugged some down damn near the perfect woman though it occasionally gave him an uneasy feeling in the gut to think of her that way it was tough to find the flaws beautiful smart sexy that great laugh she let loose so often those gorgeous warm understanding eyes the wild spirit of adventure tucked into the practical public servant suits and she could cook he chuckled to himself and pulled out another bandanna to mop his face why if he was the settlingdown type he would snatch her right up get a ring on her finger say the idos and tuck her into his house his bed on a permanent basis hot meals hot sex conversation laughter slow smiles to wake you up in the morning shared looks that said more than dozens of words when he caught himself staring into space the jug dangling from his fingers and a stupid grin on his face he shook himself hard let out a long breath the sun had baked his brain he decided permanent wasnt his style never had been and marriage the word made him shudder was for other people thank god anna wasnt looking for any more than he was a nice easy no strings no frills relationship suited them both to ensure that his mind didnt go hot again he dumped frigid water over his head six months he promised himself as he started back outside six months and he would start easing himself back into his own world competition speed glittery parties and women who were only looking for a fast ride when the thought of it fell flat when the image of it all left him hollow inside he swore it was what he wanted goddamn it what he knew where he belonged he wasnt cut out to spend his life building boats for other people to sail raising a kid and worrying about matching socks sure maybe hed teach the kid how to field a grounder or a pop fly but that was no big deal maybe anna spinelli was firmly hooked in his brain but that didnt have to be a big deal either he needed room he needed freedom he needed to race his thoughts were boiling as he stepped outside the aluminum extension ladder nearly crashed on top of him his hot oath and the muffled scream overhead sounded as one when he looked up his heart simply stopped beating seth dangled from his fingertips from the broken frame of a window twenty feet above in the space of a trio of heartbeats cam saw the pattern on the bottom of the new hightops the dangling laces the droopy socks before he could draw the first breath both ethan and phillip were leaning over the roof and struggling to reach seth you hold on ethan shouted hear me cant panic made seths voice thin and very very young slipping we cant reach him from here phillips voice was deadly calm but his eyes as they stared down at cams were bright with fear put the ladder up quick he made the decision in seconds though it seemed like the rest of his life cam gauged the time it would take to haul the ladder into place to climb up or climb down to where seth hung too long was all he could think and he moved to stand directly under seth you let go seth just let go ill catch you no i cant his fingers were raw and bleeding and nearly gave way as he shook his head fiercely panic skittered up his spine like hungry mice you wont yes you can i will close your eyes and just let go im here cam planted his legs apart and ignored his own trembling heart im right here im scared me too let go do it he said so sharply that seths fingers released on instinct it seemed as though he fell forever endlessly sweat poured down cams face air refused to come into seths lungs though his eyes stung from sun and salt cam never took them off the boy his arms were there braced and ready as seth tumbled into them cam heard the explosion of breath his seths he didnt know which as they both fell heavily cam used his body to cushion the boy took the hard ground on his bare back but in an instant he was up on his knees he spun seth around and plastered the boy against him christ oh christ is he all right ethan shouted from above yeah i dont know are you okay i think yeah he was shaking badly his teeth chattering and when cam loosened his hold enough to look into his face he saw deathly pale skin and huge glassy eyes he sat down on the ground pulled seth into his lap and pushed the boys head between his knees just shaken up he called to his brothers nice catch phillip sat back on the roof rubbed his hands over his clammy face and figured his heart rate would get back to normal in another year or two jesus ethan what was i thinking of sending that kid down for water not your fault hoping to steady both of them ethan squeezed phillips shoulder nobodys fault hes okay were okay he looked down again intended to tell cam to get the ladder but what he saw was the man holding on to the boy his cheek pressed to the top of the boys hair the ladder could wait just breathe cam ordered just take it slow you got the wind knocked out of you thats all im okay but he kept his eyes closed terrified that he would throw up now and totally humiliate himself his fingers were burning but he was afraid to look when it finally sank in that he was being held and held close it wasnt sick panic it wasnt shuddering disgust that raced through him it was gratitude and a sweet almost desperate relief cam closed his eyes as well and it was a mistake he saw seth falling again falling and falling but this time he wasnt quick enough or strong enough he wasnt there at all fear bent under fury he whirled seth around until their faces were close and shook him what the hell were you doing what were you thinking of you idiot you could have broken your neck i was just his voice hitched mortifying him i was only i didnt know my shoe was untied i mustve stepped wrong i only but the rest of the words were muffled against cams hard sweaty chest as he was pulled close again he could feel the rapid beat of cams heart hear it thunder under his ear and he closed his eyes again and slowly testingly his arms crept around to hold its all right cam murmured ordering himself to calm down wasnt your fault you scared the shit out of me his hands were trembling cam realized he was making a fool of himself deliberately he pulled seth back and grinned so how was the ride seth managed a weak smile i guess it was pretty cool deathdefying because they were both feeling awkward they eased back slowly warily good thing youre puny yet you had any weight on you you might have knocked me out cold shit seth said because he couldnt think of anything else messed up your hands some cam frowned consideringly at the bloody torn fingertips guess we better get the rest of the crew down and fix you up its nothing it hurt like fire no use having you bleed to death because his hands still werent quite steady cam made quick work of lifting the ladder into place go on in and get the first aid kit he ordered looks like phil was on the mark when he made us buy the damn thing we might as well use it on you after he watched seth go inside out of sight cam simply lowered his brow to the side of the ladder his stomach continued to jump and a headache he hadnt been aware of until that instant roared through his temples like a freight train you okay ethan put a hand on cams shoulder the minute he was on the ground ive got no spit my spits dried clean up never been so fucking scared that makes three of us phillip glanced around because his knees were still wobbly he sat on one of the rungs of the ladder how bad are his hands does he need a doctor fingers are ripped up some its not too bad at the sound of a car pulling into the loosegravel lot he turned to see who it was and his jittery stomach sank oh perfect sexy social worker at three oclock whats she doing here ethan pulled his cap down lower on his head he hated having women around when he was sweaty i dont know we have a date tonight but not until seven shes going to have some damn female thing to say about us having the kid up there in the first place so we wont tell her phillip murmured even as he shot anna a charming welcoming smile well this brightens the day nothing better than to see a beautiful woman after a tough mornings work gentlemen she only smiled when phillip took her hand and brought it to his lips amusement rippled through her three men three brothers three reactions phillips polished welcome ethans vaguely embarrassed nod and cams irritated scowl and there was no doubt each and every one of them looked outrageously male and appealing in sweat and tool belts i hope you dont mind i wanted to see the building and i did come bearing gifts theres a picnic hamper in my car men food she added for anyone whod like a lunch break that was nice of you appreciate it ethan shifted his feet ill go fetch it out of your car thanks she surveyed the building tipped down her roundlensed wirerimmed sunglasses studied it again all she could think was that she was glad shed dressed casually for this impromptu visit in roomy jeans and a tshirt there was no way to go in there she imagined and come out clean so this is it the start of our empire phillip began having just figured out that he could take her on a tour around the outside and give cam enough time to clean seth up and shut him up when the boy came out the color was back in his face which was filthy with sweat dirt and the blood that hed smeared on his cheeks from his fingers his white just do it tshirt was in the same condition he carried the first aid kit like a banner alarm shot into annas eyes she was rushing toward seth taking him gently by the shoulders before either cam or phillip could think of a reasonable story oh honey youre hurt what happened nothing cam began he just i fell off the roof seth piped up hed calmed down while he was inside and had gone from being weakkneed to wildly proud fell off the shocked to numbness anna instinctively began to check for broken bones seth stiffened then squirmed but she continued grimly until she was satisfied my god what are you doing walking around she turned her head long enough to aim a furious glare at cam have you called an ambulance he doesnt need a damn ambulance its just like a woman to fall to pieces fall to pieces keeping a protective hand on seths shoulder she whirled on them fall to pieces the three of you are standing around here like a herd of baboons the child could have internal injuries hes bleeding just my fingers seth held them out admiring them man was he going to be the hot topic in school come monday i slipped off the ladder coming down but i caught myself on the window frame up there he pointed it out helpfully while annas head spun from the height and cam told me to let go and hed catch me and i did and he did damn kid wont say two words half the time cam muttered to phillip the other half he wont shut the hell up hes fine he said lifting his voice just knocked the wind out of him she didnt bother to respond only sent him one long fulminating look before turning back to smile at seth why dont i take a look at your hands honey well clean them up and see if you need stitches she lifted her chin but the shaded glasses didnt quite conceal the heat in her eyes then id like to speak with you cameron i bet you would he mumbled as she led seth toward her car seth found he didnt mind being babied a bit it was a new experience to have a woman fuss over a little blood her hands were gentle her voice soothing and if his fingers throbbed and stung it was a small price to pay for what now seemed a glorious adventure it was a long way down he told her yes i know thinking of it only made the ball of anger in her stomach harden you must have been terrified i was only scared for a minute he bit the inside of his cheek so he wouldnt whimper as she carefully bandaged his wounds some kids wouldve screamed like a girl and wet their pants he wasnt sure if hed screamed or not that part was a blur but hed checked his jeans and knew he was okay there and cam he was pissed off youd think i kicked the damn ladder out from under me on purpose her head came up he yelled at you he started to expand on that but there was something about her eyes that made it hard to tell an outandout lie for a minute mostly he just got goofy about it youd think id had my arm whacked off the way he was carrying on patting on me and stuff he shrugged but remembered the warm glow in his gut at being held close safe tight some guys you know they cant take a little blood her smile softened and she reached up to brush his hair back yeah i know well youre in pretty good shape for a guy who likes to dive off roofs dont do it again okay once was enough glad to hear it theres fried chicken in the hamper unless theyve eaten it all yeah man i could eat a dozen pieces he started to race off then felt a tug on his conscience it was another rare sensation and it caused him to turn back and meet her eyes cam said hed catch me and he did he was cool then he ran toward the building shouting for ethan to save him some damn chicken anna only sighed she sat there on the side of the passenger seat while she put the first aid kit back in order when the shadow fell across her she continued to tidy up she could smell him sweat man the faint undertones of the soap from his morning shower she knew his scent so well now and the way it would mix with her own that she could have picked him out of a roomful of men had she been handcuffed and blindfolded and though it was certainly true that shed been curious about the building it was really only a handy excuse to drive over from princess anne to see him i dont suppose theres any point in me telling you that boys seths age shouldnt be going up and down extension ladders unsupervised i dont suppose there is or that boys his age are careless often awkward and clumsy hes not clumsy cam said with some heat hes agile as a monkey of course he added with a sneer in his voice the rest of us are baboons so that fits she closed the first aid kit rose and handed it to him apparently she agreed however accidents happen no matter how careful you are no matter how hard you try to prevent them thats why theyre accidents she looked at his face the irritation was still there she noted with her with circumstances and oh that underlying anger that never seemed to fade completely away was very very close to the surface so she said softly how many years of your life did that little event shave off he let out a breath a couple of decades but the kid handled himself he turned a little to look back toward the building it was then that anna saw the smears of blood on his back smears she realized after her hearts first leap that had come from seths hands the boy had been held she thought and the boy had held on cam turned back caught her smiling what nothing well since im here and youre all eating my food i think im entitled to a tour how much of this business are you going to have to put in one of your reports im not on the clock she told him more sharply than she intended i thought i was coming to pay a visit to friends i didnt mean it that way anna really she stepped around the car door and slammed it shut at her back damn it she had come to see him to be with him not to fit in an unannounced home visit what i will put in my next report unless i see something to the contrary is that its my opinion that seth is bonding with his guardians and they with him ill make sure you get a copy ill take a rain check on the tour you can get the hamper back to me at your convenience she thought it was a great exit as exits went striding around the car while she tossed off her lines her temper was flaring but just under control then he grabbed her as she reached for the car door and spoiled it she whirled around swinging but her fist slid off his damp chest and ruined the impact hands off where are you going just hold it a minute i dont have to hold anything and i dont want you holding me she shoved at him with both hands god youre filthy if youd just be still and listen to what you dont think i get it you dont think ive clued in to what you saw what you thought when i pulled up oh hell here comes the social worker close ranks boys she jerked back well fuck you he could have denied it could have taken the idontknowwhatyouretalkingabout approach and done an expert job of it but her eyes had the same effect on him as theyd had on seth they wouldnt let his tongue wrap itself around a decent lie okay youre right it was kneejerk at least you have the decency to be honest the depth of the hurt infuriated her as much as it surprised her i dont know what youre so frosted about dont you she tossed back her hair then ill tell you i looked at you and saw a man who also happens to be my lover you looked at me and saw a symbol of a system you dont trust or respect now that thats cleared up get out of my way im sorry he dragged the bandanna off because his head was splitting youre right again and im sorry so am i she started to open the car door will you give me a damn minute here instead of reaching for her again he dragged his hands through his hair it wasnt the impatient tone that stopped her but the weariness of the gesture all right she let go of the door handle youve got a minute he didnt think there was another woman on the planet hed explained himself to more than the one watching him now with a faint frown we were all a little shaken up right then the timing couldnt have been worse goddamn it my hands were still shaking he hated to admit that hated it to gather some control he turned away paced off paced back i was in a wreck once about three years ago grand prix hit the chute misjudged went into a hell of a spin the car was breaking apart around me the worst fear is invisible fire vapors catching hold i had this flash of myself burned to a crisp just for an instant but it was vivid he balled the bandanna up in his hand then pulled it out smooth im telling you anna i swear to you standing under that kid and watching his shoelaces dangle was worse hell of a lot worse how could she hold on to her anger and why couldnt he see that he had such a huge well of love to give if he would only let himself dip into it freely hed said that he would probably hurt her but she hadnt known it would come so soon or from this direction she hadnt been looking in the right direction she hadnt known she was falling in love with him i cant do this she said half to herself and wrapped her hands around her arms to warm them the chill penetrated even though she stood in streaming sun how many steps had she taken toward love she wondered and how many could she take back to save herself i dont know what i was thinking of being involved with you on a personal level only complicates our mutual interest in the child dont back off from me anna he experienced another level of fear now one hed never felt before so we take a few wrong steps we get the balance back were good together were good in bed she said and blinked when she saw what might have been hurt flash in his eyes only no she said slowly as he stepped toward her not only but ive got something for you inside me anna he forgot his hands were grimy and laid them on her shoulders i havent used it up yet this thing with you its one of the first times i havent wanted to rush to the finish line they would still get there she realized she would have to be prepared for him to reach that line and cross it ahead of her dont mix up who i am and what i am she told him quietly you have to be honest with me or the rest of it means nothing ive been more up front with you than ive ever been with a woman before and i know who you are all right she laid a hand on his cheek when he bent to kiss her well see what happens next chapter fourteen contents prev next it was a good spring afternoon balmy air fine wind and just enough cloud cover to filter the sun and keep it from baking your flesh down to your bones when ethan guided his workboat into dock the waterfront was busy with tourists whod come to see the watermen work and the busy fingers of the crab pickers fly he had reached his quota early which suited him fine the water tanks under the faded striped awning of his boat were crawling with annoyed crabs that would find their way into the pot by nightfall he would turn in his catch and leave his mate to diddle with the engine it was running just a tad rough he planned to take himself over to the building to see how the plumbing was coming he was itching to have it done and ethan quinn wasnt a man who itched for much at least he didnt allow himself to think he did but the boat building enterprise was a little private dream that hed nurtured for some time now he thought it was about ripe simon let out one sharp happy woof as the boat bumped the pilings even as ethan prepared to secure the lines there were hands reaching for them hands he recognized before he lifted his gaze to the face long pretty hands that wore no rings or polish ive got it ethan he looked up and smiled at grace appreciate it whatre you doing on the docks midday picking crabs betsy was feeling off this morning so they were short a pair of hands my mother wanted aubrey for a couple of hours anyway you ought to take some time for yourself grace oh she secured the lines expertly then straightened to run a hand through her short cap of hair one of these days did yall finish up that ham casserole i made the other day fought over the last bite it was great thanks now that hed about run out of easy conversation and was standing on the dock beside her he didnt know what to do with his hands to compensate he scratched simons head we pulled in a nice catch today so i see but her smile didnt reach her eyes and she was gnawing on her lip a sure sign ethan thought that what was on graces mind was trouble is there a problem i hate to take up your time when youre busy ethan her eyes scanned the docks could you walk with me a minute sure i could use something cold jim you handle things from here all right you got it capn with the dog trotting between them ethan tucked his hands in his pockets he nodded when a familiar voice called out a greeting barely noticed the quick fingers of the crab pickers who put on quite a show while they worked he noticed the smells because he was so fond of them water fish salt in the air and the subtle notes of graces soap and shampoo ethan i dont want to cause you or your family any grief you couldnt grace you may already know it just bothers me so much i just hate it so much her voice lowered sizzling with a temper that ethan knew was rare he saw that her face was set her mouth grim and he decided to forgo that cold drink and lead her farther away from the docks you better tell me get it off your mind and put it on yours she said with a sigh she hated to do it ethan was always there if you had trouble or needed a shoulder once shed wished he would offer her more than a shoulder but shed learned to accept the way things were its best that you know she said half to herself you cant deal with things unless you know theres an investigator for the insurance company talking to people asking questions about your father about seth too ethan laid a hand on her arm briefly they were far enough away from the docks from the storefronts and the jangle of traffic hed thought they were done with that what kind of questions about your daddys state of mind the last few weeks before his accident about him bringing seth home he came to see me this morning first thing i thought it was better to talk to him than not she looked at ethan relieved when he nodded i told him ray quinn was one of the finest men ive ever known and gave him a piece of my mind about going around trying to pick up nasty gossip because ethan smiled at that her lips curved well he made me so mad claims hes only doing his job and his manners mild as skim milk but it bothered me especially when he asked if i knew anything about seths mother or where hed come from i told him i didnt and that it didnt matter seth was where he was supposed to be and that was that i hope i did the right thing you did just fine her eyes were the color of stormy seas now as emotions churned through her ethan i know itll hurt if some people talk if some of them say things theyve got no business saying it doesnt mean anything she continued and took his hands in hers not to anyone who knows your family well get through it he gave her hands a quick squeeze then didnt know if he should hold on to them or let go im glad you told me he let go but he kept looking at her face looked so long that the color began to rise in her cheeks youre not getting enough sleep he said your eyes are tired oh embarrassed annoyed she brushed her fingertips under them why was it the man only seemed to notice if something was wrong with her aubrey was a little fussy last night ive got to get back she said quickly and gave the patient simon a quick rub ill be by the house tomorrow to clean she hurried off thinking hopelessly that a man who only noticed when you looked tired or troubled would never pay you any mind as a woman but ethan watched her walk away and thought she was too damn pretty to work herself like a mule the inspectors name was mackensie and he was making the rounds so far his notes contained descriptions of a man who was a saint with a halo as wide and bright as the sun a selfless samaritan of a man who not only loved his neighbors but cheerfully bore their burdens who had with his faithful wife beside him saved large chunks of humanity and kept the world safe for democracy his other notations termed raymond quinn a pompous interfering holierthanthou despot who collected bad young boys like other men collected stamps and used them to provide him with slave labor an ego balm and possibly prurient sexual favors though mackensie had to admit the latter was more interesting that view had come from only a scattered few being a man of details and caution he realized that the truth probably lay somewhere in between the saint and the sinner his purpose wasnt to canonize or condemn one raymond quinn policy number lq it was simply to gather facts and those facts would determine whether the claim against that policy would be paid or disputed either way mackensie got paid for his time and his efforts hed stopped off and grabbed a sandwich at a little grease spot called bay side eats he had a weakness for grease bad coffee and waitresses with names like lulubelle it was why at age fiftyeight he was twenty pounds overweight twentyfive if he didnt tip the scale a few notches back from zero before he stepped on it had a chronic case of indigestion and was twice divorced he was also balding and had bunions and an eyetooth that ached like a bitch in heat mackensie knew he was no physical prize but he knew his job had thirtytwo years with true life insurance and kept records as clean as a nuns heart he pulled his ford taurus into the pitted gravel lot beside the building his last contact a little worm named claremont had given him directions he would find cameron quinn there claremont had told him with a tightlipped smile mackensie had disliked the man after five minutes in his company the inspector had worked with people long enough to recognize greed envy and simple malice even when they were layered over with charm claremont didnt have any layers that mackensie had noticed he was all smarm he belched up a memory of the dill pickle relish hed indulged in at lunch shook his head and thumbed out his hourly dose of zantac there was a pickup truck in the lot an aging sedan and a spiffy classic corvette mackensie liked the looks of the vette though he wouldnt have gotten behind the wheel of one of those death traps for love or money no indeed but he admired it anyway as he hauled himself out of his car he could admire the looks of the man as well he mused when a pair of them stepped out of the building not the older one with the redchecked shirt and clipon tie paper pusher he decided he was good at recognizing types the younger one was too lean too hungry too sharpeyed to spend much time pushing papers if he didnt work with his hands mackensie thought he could and he looked like a man who knew what he wanted and found a way to make it so if this was cameron quinn mackensie decided that ray quinn had had his hands full while he was alive cam spotted mackensie when he walked the plumbing inspector out he was feeling pretty good about the progress he figured it would take another week to complete the bathroom but he and ethan could do without that little convenience that much longer he wanted to get started and since the wiring was done and that too had passed inspection there was no need to wait he tagged mackensie as some sort of paper jockey jiggling his memory he tried to recall if he had another appointment set up but he didnt think so selling something he imagined as mackensie and the inspector passed each other the man had a briefcase cam noted wearily when people carried a briefcase it meant there was something inside they wanted to take out youd be mr quinn mackensie said his voice affable his eyes measuring i would im mackensie true life insurance weve got insurance or he was nearly sure they did my brother phillip handles those kinds of details then it clicked and cams stance shifted from relaxed to on guard true life thats the one im an investigator for the company we need to clear up some questions before your claim on your fathers policy can be settled hes dead cam said flatly isnt that the question mackensie im sorry for your loss i imagine the insurance companys sorry it has to shell out as far as im concerned my father paid in to that policy in good faith the trick is you have to die to win he died it was warm in the sun and the pastrami on rye with spicy mustard wasnt settling well mackensie blew out a breath theres some question about the accident car meets telephone pole telephone pole wins trust me i do a lot of driving mackensie nodded under other circumstances he might have appreciated cams nobullshit tone youd be aware that the policy has a suicide clause my father didnt commit suicide mackensie and since you werent in the car with him at the time its going to be tough for you to prove otherwise your father was under a great deal of stress emotional upheaval cam snorted my father raised three badasses and taught a bunch of snotnosed college kids he had a great deal of stress and emotional upheaval all his life and hed taken on a fourth thats right cam tucked his thumbs in his front pockets and his stance became a silent challenge that doesnt have anything to do with you or your company as it bears on the circumstances of your fathers accident theres a question of possible blackmail and certainly a threat to his reputation i have a copy of the letter found in his car at the scene when mackensie opened his briefcase cam took a step forward ive seen the letter all it means is theres a woman out there with the maternal instincts of a rabid alley cat you try to say that ray quinn smashed into that pole because he was afraid of some twobit bitch ill bury your insurance company fury he thought hed already passed through sprang back fullblown and fangsharp i dont give a good goddamn about the money we can make our own money true life wants to welsh on the deal thats my brothers area and the lawyers but you or anybody else messes with my fathers rep youll deal with me the man was a good twentyfive years younger mackensie calculated tough as a brick and mad as a starving wolf he decided it would be best all round if he changed tactics mr quinn i have no interest or desire to smear your fathers reputation true lifes a good company ive worked for them most of my life he tried a winning smile this is just routine i dont like your routine i can understand that the gray area here is the accident itself the medical reports confirm that your father was in good physical shape theres no evidence of a heart attack a stroke any physical reason that would have caused him to lose control of his car a singlecar accident an empty stretch of road on a dry clear day the accidentreconstruction experts findings were inconclusive thats your problem cam spotted seth walking down the road from the direction of school and there he thought is mine i cant help you with it but i can tell you that my father faced his problems square on he never took the easy way ive got work to do leaving it at that cam turned away and walked toward seth mackensie rubbed eyes that were tearing up from the sunlight quinn might have thought hed added nothing to the report but he was wrong if nothing else mackensie could be sure the quinns would fight for their claim to the bitter end if not for the money for the memory whos that guy seth asked as he watched mackensie head back to his car some insurance quack cam nodded down the street where two boys loitered a half a block away whore those guys seth gave a careless glance over his shoulder followed it with a shrug i dont know just kids from school theyre nobody they hassling you nan are we going up on the roof roofs done cam murmured and watched with some amusement as the two boys wandered closer trying and failing to look disinterested hey you kids whatre you doing seth hissed mortified relax come on over here cam ordered as both boys froze like statues what the hell are you calling them over for theyre just jerks from school i could use some jerk labor cam said mildly it had also occurred to him that seth could use some companions of his own age he waited while seth squirmed and the two boys held a fast whispering consultation it ended with the taller of the two squaring his shoulders and swaggering down the road on his battered nikes we werent doing anything the boy said his tone of defiance slightly spoiled by a lisp from a missing tooth i could see that you want to do something the boy slid his eyes to the younger kid then over to seth then cautiously up to cams face maybe you got a name sure im danny this is my kid brother will i turned eleven last week hes only nine ill be ten in ten months will stated and rapped his brother in the ribs with his elbow he still goes to elementary danny put in with a sneer which he generously shared with seth baby school im not a baby as wills fist was already clenched and lifted cam took hold of it then lightly squeezed his upper arm seems strong enough to me im plenty strong will told him then grinned with the charm of an angelic host well see about that see all this crap piled up around here old shingles tar paper trash cam surveyed the area himself you see that dumpster over there the crap goes in the dumpster you get five bucks each danny piped up his hazel eyes glinting in a freckled face dont make me laugh kid but youll get a twodollar bonus if you do it without me having to come out and break up any fights he jerked a thumb at seth hes in charge the minute cam left them alone danny turned to seth they sized each other up in narroweyed silence i saw you punch robert seth shifted his balance evenly it would be two against one he calculated but he was prepared to fight so what it was cool was all danny said and began to pick up torn shingles will grinned happily up into seths face robert is a big fat fart and danny said when you socked him he bled and bled seth found himself grinning back like a stuck pig oink oink will said delighted we can buy ice cream with the money up at crawfords yeah maybe seth started to gather up trash with will cheerfully dogging his heels anna wasnt having a good day shed started out the morning running her last pair of hose before she even got out her front door she was out of bagels and yogurt and she admitted almost every damn thing because shed been spending too much time with cam or thinking about cam to keep to her usual marketing routine when she stopped off to mail a letter to her grandparents she chipped a nail on the mailbox her phone was already ringing when she walked into her office at eightthirty and the hysterical woman on the other end was demanding to know why she had yet to receive her medical card she calmed the woman down assured her she would see to the matter personally then simply because she was there the switchboard passed through a whining old man who insisted his neighbors were child abusers because they allowed their offspring to watch television every night of the week television he told her is the tool of the communist left nothing but sex and murder sex and murder and subliminal messages i read all about them im going to look into this mr bigby she promised and opened her top drawer where she kept her aspirin youd better i tried the cops but they dont do nothing those kidsre doomed going to need to deprogram them thank you for bringing this to our attention my duty as an american you bet anna muttered after hed hung up knowing that she was due in family court at two that afternoon she booted up her computer intending to call up the file to review her reports and notes when the message flashed across her screen that her program had committed an illegal act she didnt bother to scream she simply sat back closed her eyes and accepted that it was going to be a lousy day it got worse she knew her testimony in court was key the higgins case file had come across her desk nearly a year ago the three children ages eight six and four had all been physically and emotionally abused the wife barely twentyfive was a textbook case of the battered spouse shed left her husband countless times over the years but she always went back six months before anna had worked hard and long to get her and her children into a shelter the woman had stayed less than thirtysix hours before changing her mind though annas heart ached for her it had come down to the welfare of the children their pinched faces the bruises the fear and worse the dull acceptance in their eyes tormented her they were in foster care with a couple who was generous enough and strong enough to take all of them and seeing those foster parents flanking the three damaged boys she vowed she would do everything in her power to keep them there counseling was recommended in january of last year when this case first came to my attention anna stated from the witness stand both family and individual the recommendation was not taken nor was it taken in may of that same year when mrs higgins was hospitalized with a dislocated jaw and other injuries or in september when michael higgins the eldest boy suffered a broken hand in november of that year mrs higgins and her two oldest sons were all treated in er for various injuries i was notified and assisted mrs higgins and her children in securing a place in a womens shelter she did not remain there two full days youve been caseworker of record on this matter for more than a year the lawyer stood in front of her knowing from experience it wasnt necessary to guide her testimony yes more than a year and she felt the failure keenly what is the current status on february sixth of this year a police unit responding to the call from a neighbor found mr higgins under the influence of alcohol mrs higgins was reported as hysterical and required medical treatment for facial bruises and lacerations curtis the youngest child had a broken arm mr higgins was taken into custody at that time as i was the caseworker of record i was notified did you see mrs higgins and the children on that day the lawyer asked her yes i drove to the hospital i spoke with mrs higgins she claimed that curtis had fallen down the stairs due to the nature of his injuries and the history of the case i didnt believe her the attending physician in er shared my opinion the children were taken into foster care where they have remained since that date she continued to answer questions about the status of the case file and the children themselves once she drew a smile out of the middle boy when she spoke of the tball team hed been able to join then anna prepared herself for the irritation and tedium of crossexamination are you aware that mr higgins has voluntarily entered an alcohol rehabilitation program anna spared one glance at the higginses pro bono lawyer then looked directly into the fathers eyes im aware that over the past year mr higgins has claimed to have entered a rehabilitation program no less than three times she saw the hate and fury darken his face let him hate me she thought shed be damned if he would lay hands on those children again im aware that hes never completed a program alcoholism is a disease ms spinelli mr higgins is now seeking treatment for his illness you would agree that mrs higgins has been a victim of her husbands illness i would agree that she has suffered both physically and emotionally at his hands and can you possibly believe that she should suffer further lose her children and they her can you possibly believe that the court should take these three little boys away from their mother the choice anna thought was hers the man who beat her and terrorized their children or the health and safety of those children i believe she will suffer further until she makes the decision to change her circumstances and its my professional opinion that mrs higgins is incapable of caring for herself much less her children at this time both mr and mrs higgins now have steady employment the lawyer continued mrs higgins has stated under oath that she and her husband are reconciled and continuing to work on their marital difficulties separating the family will as she stated only cause emotional pain for all involved i know she believes that her steady look at mrs higgins was compassionate but her voice was firm i believe that there are three children whose welfare and safety are at stake im aware of the medical reports the psychiatric reports the police reports in the past fifteen months these three children have been treated in the emergency room a combined total of eleven times she looked at the lawyer now wondering how he could stand in a court of law and fight for what was surely the destruction of three young boys im aware that a fouryearold boys arm was snapped like a twig i strongly recommend that these children remain in licensed and supervised foster care to ensure their physical and emotional safety no charges have been filed against mr higgins no no charges have been filed anna shifted her gaze to the mother let it rest on that tired face thats just another crime she murmured when she was finished anna passed by the higginses without a glance but behind the rail little curtis reached out for her hand do you have a lollipop he whispered making her smile she made a habit of carrying them for him he had a weakness for cherry tootsie roll pops maybe i do lets see she was reaching into her purse when the explosion came from behind her get your hands off whats mine you bitch as she started to turn higgins hit her full force knocking her sprawling and sending curtis to the floor with her in a heap of screams and wails her head rang like church bells and stars dazzled her eyes she could hear screams and curses as she managed to push herself up to her hands and knees her cheek ached fiercely where it had connected with the seat of a wooden chair her palms sang from skidding on the tile floor and damn it the new hose she had bought to replace the ones shed run were torn at the knees hold still marilou ordered she was crouched in annas office grimly doctoring the scrapes im all right indeed the injuries were minor it was worth it that little demonstration in open court ensures that he wont get near those kids for quite a while you worry me anna marilou looked up with those dark gleaming eyes id almost think you enjoyed being tackled by that twohundredpound putz i enjoyed the results ouch marilou she blew out a breath as her supervisor rose to examine the bruise on annas cheek i enjoyed filing charges for assault and most of all i enjoyed seeing those kids go home with their foster family a good days work with a shake of her head marilou stepped back it worries me too that you let yourself get too close you cant help from a distance so much of what we do is just paperwork marilou forms and procedures but every now and again you get to do something even if its only getting tackled by a twohundredpound putz and its worth it if you care too much you end up with more than a couple of bruises and a skinned knee if you dont care enough you should find another line of work marilou blew out a breath it was difficult to argue when she felt exactly the same way go home anna ive got another hour on the clock go home consider it combat pay since you put it that way i could use the hour i dont have anything in the house to eat if you hear any more on she broke off and looked up at the knock on her doorjamb her eyes widened cameron miz spinelli i wonder if you have a minute to his smile of greeting transformed into a snarl the light in his eyes turned hot and sharp as a flaming sword what the hell happened to you he was in the room like a shot filling it nearly barreling over marilou to get to anna who the hell hit you no one exactly i was instead of giving her a chance to finish he whirled on marilou torn between fascination and amusement marilou backed up a step and held her hands up palms out not me champ i only browbeat my staff never lay a finger on them there was a ruckus in court thats all struggling to be brisk and professional despite her bare legs and feet anna rose marilou this is cameron quinn cameron marilou johnston my supervisor its a pleasure to meet you even under the circumstances marilou held out a hand i was a student of your fathers a million years ago i quite simply adored him yeah thanks who hit you he demanded again of anna someone who is even now on the wrong side of a locked cell quickly anna worked her bare feet back into her lowheeled pumps marilou im going to take you up on the hour off her only thought now was to get cam out away from marilous curious and alltooobservant eyes cameron if you need to speak with me about seth you could give me a ride home she slipped on her dovegray jacket smoothed it into place its not far ill buy you a cup of coffee fine sure when he caught her chin in his hand a tugofwar of pleasure and alarm raged inside her well talk ill see you tomorrow marilou oh yes marilou smiled easily while anna hurriedly gathered her briefcase well talk too chapter fifteen contents prev next anna kept her mouth firmly shut until they were out of the building and safely alone in the parking lot cam for gods sake for gods sake what this is where i work she stopped at his car turned to face him where i work remember you cant come storming into my office like an outraged lover he took her chin in hand again leaned his face close i am an outraged lover and i want the name of the son of a bitch who put his hands on you she wouldnt allow herself to be thrilled by the violence sparking around him it would be she reminded herself as her stomach gave a delicious little hop completely unprofessional the person in question is being dealt with by the proper authorities and youre not allowed to be a lover outraged or otherwise during business hours yeah try and stop me he challenged and leading with his temper crushed his mouth to hers she wiggled for a moment anyone could peek out an office window and see the kiss was too hot too heady for a daylight embrace in an office parking lot the kiss was also too hot too heady to resist she gave in to it to him to herself and wrapped her arms around him will you cut it out she said against his mouth no okay then lets take this indoors good idea with his mouth still on hers he reached back to open the car door i cant get in until you let me go good point he released her then surprised her by gently tenderly brushing his lips over the bruise on her cheek does it hurt her heart was still flopping maybe a little she got inside deliberately reaching for her seat belt keeping her moves efficient and casual what happened he asked as he slid in beside her abusive father of three wife beater didnt care for my testimony in family court today he shoved me i had my back turned or hed have gotten a hard knee to the groin but as it was i was off balance did a nosedive which would have been embarrassing but for the fact that hes now in lockup and the kids are with their foster family and the wife i cant help her anna let her aching head fall back you have to pick your battles he said nothing to that hed been thinking the same thing it was why hed decided to dump three kids on ethan and come to see her hed made up his mind to tell her about the insurance investigation the speculations about seths connection to his father the search that phillip had instigated for seths mother hed decided to tell her everything to ask her advice to get her take now he found himself wondering if that was the wisest course for her for him for seth it would wait he told himself and rationalized his postponement shed had a rough time needed a little attention so do you get knocked around much in your line of work hmm no she laughed a little as he pulled up in front of her building now and again somebody takes a swing or throws something at you but mostly its just verbal abuse fun job it has its moments she took his hand walked alongside him did you know that television is the tool of the communist left i hadnt heard that im here to tell you she used her key to check her mail slot gathered letters and bills and a fashion magazine sesame street is just a front i always suspected that big yellow bird nah hes just a shill the frogs the mastermind she put her finger to her lips as they approached her door they snuck in together like kids hooking school i just didnt want to have the sisters fussing over me mind if i do that depends on your definition of fussing well start here he slipped his arms around her waist touched his lips to hers i suppose i could tolerate that she helped him deepen the kiss what are you doing here cam i had a lot on my mind his lips brushed over the bruise again then lower to her jawline you mostly i wanted to see you be with you talk to you make love to you her lips curved against his all at the same time why not i did have this thought about taking you out to dinner but now im thinking maybe we could order pizza perfect she said it with a sigh why dont you pour us some wine and ill change theres this other thing he worked his way over to her ear something ive been wanting to do ive been wondering what it would be like to get miz spinelli out of one of her dedicatedpublicservant suits have you since the first time i saw you she smiled wickedly nows your chance i was hoping youd say that he brought his mouth back to hers hungrier now more possessive this time her sigh caught on a trembling gasp as he jerked her jacket off her shoulders and trapped her arms im wanting the hell out of you day and night her voice was throaty now dark with need i guess that makes it handy since i want the hell out of you too it doesnt scare you nothing about you and me scares me and what if i said i want you to let me do anything i want to you everything her heart fluttered to her throat but her eyes stayed steady id say whos stopping you with desire dark and dangerous in his eyes he skimmed his gaze down then back to her face i wonder what miz spinelli wears under these prim little blouses i dont think a man like you is going to let a few buttons keep him from finding out youre right he shifted his hands from her jacket to the crisply pressed cotton of her blouse and ripped he watched her eyes go wide and shocked and aroused if you want me to stop i will i wont do anything you dont want hed torn her blouse and it had thrilled her he waited watching for her to say stop or go and it thrilled her even more she understood she hadnt been completely truthful when shed told him nothing about them scared her she was afraid of what might be happening to her heart but here in physical love she knew she could match him i want everything all his blood leaped still he kept his touch light teasing running the back of his hand above the slick white material of her demicut bra miz spinelli he drawled it while his fingers slipped beneath the polished satin to rub against her stiffened nipple how much can you take his light tugs had heat spiraling through her system already the air was thick i think were about to find out slowly his eyes on her face he backed her against the wall lets start here brace yourself he murmured and his hand shot under her skirt and tore aside the lacy swatch she wore beneath her breath exploded out and she nearly laughed then he plunged his fingers into her lancing that hard rough shock of pleasure through her unprepared system the orgasm ripped through her emptying her mind stealing her breath when her knees gave way he simply held her against the wall take more he was desperate to watch her take more to see the shocked excitement capture her face to see those gorgeous eyes go wild and blind she gripped his shoulders for balance with her head tipped back he could see the pulse in her throat beat madly and was compelled to taste just there she moaned against him moved against him her breath hitching when he yanked the jacket and what was left of her blouse away she was helpless staggered the assault on her senses left her limbs shuddering and her heart hammering she said his name tried to but it caught on a gasp as he spun her around her damp palms pressed to the wall he tore at the button of her skirt she felt it give way shivering as the material slid over her hips and pooled at her feet his hands were on her breasts molding sliding from satin to flesh and back again then he tore that as well and she gloried in the sound of the delicate material rending his teeth nipped into her shoulder and his hands oh his hands were everywhere driving her toward madness then beyond rough palms against smooth skin clever fingers pressing sliding the breath that had torn ragged through her lips began to slow pleasure was thick and midnight dark she felt herself slipping into some erotic halfworld where there was only sensation slick stunning and sinful the wall was smooth and cool his hands were not the contrasts were unbearably arousing when he spun her around again her eyes were dazzled by the sunlight he was still fully dressed and she was naked she found it exquisitely erotic and could say nothing as he slowly lifted her arms above her head bracketed her wrists with one hand watching her he combed his hand roughly through her hair to scatter pins i want more he could barely speak tell me you want more yes i want more he pressed his body to hers soft cotton rough denim against damp flesh and the kiss he took from her left her mind spinning then his mouth went to work on her quivering body he wanted all the tastes of her the dark honey of her mouth the damp silk of her breasts there was the creamy taste of her belly the polished satin of her thighs then the heat the furnace flood of it as he licked his way between them everything all was all he could think then more her hands gripped his hair pressing his face closer as she climbed to peak it was her cry the half scream that broke the final link on his control it had to be now he freed himself then pressed against her i need to fill you he panted the words out i want you to watch me when i do he drove into her where they stood and their twin groans tangled in the air afterward he carried her to bed lay down beside her she curled up against him like a child a gesture he found surprisingly sweet he watched her sleep thirty minutes then a hour he couldnt stop touching her a hand through her hair fingertips over the bruise on her face a stroke over the curve of her shoulder had he said he had something inside of him for her he began to worry just what that something might be hed never felt compelled to stay with a woman after sex had never felt the need to just look at her while she slept or to touch only for the sake of touching and not to arouse he wondered what odd and slippery level theyd reached then she stirred sighed and her eyes fluttered open and focused on him when she smiled his heart quite simply turned over in his chest hi did i fall asleep looked like it to me he searched for some glib remark something light and frivolous but all he could find to say was her name anna and he lowered his mouth to hers tenderly softly lovingly the sleep had cleared from her eyes when he drew away but he couldnt read them she breathed in once slowly then out again what was that damned if i know both of them eased back cautiously i think wed better order that pizza relief and disappointment warred inside her anna put all her effort into supporting the relief good idea the numbers right next to the kitchen phone if you dont mind calling it in id like to grab a quick shower get some clothes on all right with casual intimacy he stroked a hand over her hip what do you want on it all i can get she waited while he laughed and was pleased that he rolled out of bed first she needed another minute ill pour the wine terrific the minute she was alone she turned her face into the pillow and let out a muffled scream of frustration steps back she thought furious with herself where did she get the idiotic idea she could take a few steps back she was over her head in love with him my fault she reminded herself my problem sitting up she pressed a hand to her traitorous heart and my little secret she decided she felt better when she was dressed and had a light shield of makeup in place shed given herself a good talkingto in the shower maybe she was in love with him it didnt have to be a bad thing people fell in and out of love all the time and the wise ones the steady ones enjoyed the ride she could be wise and steady she certainly wasnt looking for happily ever after a white knight a prince charming anna had outgrown fairy tales long ago and all of her innocence had cemented into reality on the side of a deserted road at the age of twelve shed learned to make herself happy because for too many years following the rape it had seemed she was helpless to do anything but make herself and everyone near her miserable shed survived the worst there was no doubt she could survive a slightly dented heart in any case shed never been in love before she had skirted around it breezed over it wriggled under it but had never before run headlong into it it could be a marvelous adventure certainly a learning experience and any woman who found herself a lover like cameron quinn had plenty of blessings to count so she was smiling when she came into the living room and found cam sipping wine staring at the cover of her latest fashion magazine hed put music on eric clapton was pleading with laylah when she came up behind him and pecked a kiss on the back of his neck she didnt expect his jolt of surprise it was guilt plain and simple and he hated it he nearly bobbled the wine and had to fight to keep his face composed the pouty face on the cover of the magazine in his hand was a certain longstemmed french model named martine didnt mean to startle you she raised an eyebrow as she looked at the magazine in his hands absorbed with this summers new pastels were you just passing the time pizza should be along in a minute he started to set the magazine down wanted sincerely to bury it under the sofa cushions but she was nipping it out of his hand i used to hate her his throat was uncomfortably dry huh well not martine the magnificent exactly models like her slim and blond and perfect i was always too round and too brunette this she added giving her wet curling hair a tug made me insane as a teenager i tried everything imaginable to straighten it i love your hair he wished shed turn the damn magazine facedown youre twice as beautiful as she is theres no comparison her smile came quick and warm around the edges thats very sweet i mean it he said it almost desperately but thought it best not to add that hed seen both of them naked and knew what he was talking about very sweet still i wanted so badly to be slim and blond and hipless youre real he couldnt stop himself he took the magazine and tossed it over his shoulder shes not thats one way to put it enjoying herself she cocked her head seems to me you racearoundtheworld types usually go for the supermodels they look so good draped over a mans arm i barely know her who jesus he was losing it anybody theres the pizza he said with great relief your wines on the counter ill get the food fine without a clue as to what was suddenly making him so edgy she wandered to the kitchen for her drink cam saw that the magazine had fallen faceup so it appeared that martine was aiming those killer blue eyes right at him it brought back the memory of a scored cheek and a spitting female he cast a wary glance at anna it wasnt an experience he cared to repeat as he paid the delivery boy anna took the wine out to her tiny balcony its a nice evening lets eat out here she had a couple of chairs and a small folding table set out pink geraniums and white impatiens sprang cheerfully out of clay pots if i ever manage to save enough for a house i want a porch a big one like you have she went back in for plates and napkins and a garden one of these days im going to learn something about flowers a house garden porches more comfortable out in the air he settled down i pictured you as a town girl i always have been im not sure suburbia would suit me fences with neighbors just over them too much like apartment living id think without the privacy and convenience she slid a loaded slice of pizza onto her plate but id like to give home owning a shot somewhere in the country eventually the problem is i cant seem to stick to a budget you he helped himself miz spinelli seems so practical she tries my grandparents were very frugal had to be i was raised to watch my pennies she took a bite and drew in a deep appreciative breath before speaking over a mouthful of cheese and sauce mostly i watch them roll away whats your weakness primarily she sighed clothes he looked over his shoulder through the door to her clothes heaped in a tattered pile on the floor i think i owe you a blouse and a skirt not to mention the underwear she laughed lustily i suppose you do she stretched out comfortable in paleblue leggings and an oversized white tshirt this was such a hideous day im glad you came by and changed it why dont you come home with me what where the hell had that come from he wondered the thought hadnt even been in his mind when the words popped out of his mouth but it must have been somewhere for the weekend he added spend this weekend at the house she brought her pizza back to her lips bit in carefully i dont think that would be wise theres an impressionable young boy in your home he knows what the hells going on he began then caught the look the miz spinelli look in her eye okay ill sleep on the sofa downstairs you can lock the bedroom door her lips quirked where do you keep the key this weekend ill be keeping it in my pocket but my point is he continued when she laughed you can have the bedroom on a professional level itll give you some time with the kid hes coming along anna and i want to take you sailing ill come over saturday and we can go sailing come friday night he took her hand brought her knuckles to his lips stay till sunday ill think about it she murmured and drew her hand away romantic gestures were going to undo her and i think if youre going to have a houseguest you should check with your brothers they might not care to have a woman underfoot for a weekend they love women especially women who cook ah so now im supposed to cook maybe just one little pot of linguini or a dish of lasagna she smiled and took another slice of pizza ill think about it she said again now tell me about seth he made a couple of buddies today really terrific her eyes lit with such pleasure and interest he couldnt help himself yeah i had them all up on the roof practiced catching them as they fell off her mouth fell open then shut again on a scowl very funny quinn gotcha a kid from seths class and his kid brother i bought them for five bucks as slave labor then they wheedled an invite out to the house for dinner so i stuck ethan with them she rolled her eyes you left ethan alone with three young boys he can handle it i did for a couple of hours this afternoon and he recalled it hadnt been so bad all he has to do is feed them and make sure they dont kill each other their mothers picking them up at seventhirty sandy mclean well sandy miller now i went to school with her he shook his head amazed and baffled two kids and a minivan never wouldve figured that for sandy people change she murmured surprised at how much she envied sandy miller and her minivan or they werent precisely what we imagined them to be in the first place i guess her kids are pistols because he said it with such easy good humor she smiled again well now i see why you popped up at my office you wanted to escape the madness yeah but mostly i just wanted to rip your clothes off he took another slice himself i did both and he thought as he sipped his wine and watched the sun go down with anna beside him he felt damn good about it chapter sixteen contents prev next drawing wasnt ethans strong point with the other boats hed built hed worked off very rough sketches and detailed measurements for the first boat for this client hed fashioned a lofting platform and had found working from it was easier and more precise the skiff hed built and sold had been a basic model with a few tweaks of his own added hed been able to see the completed project in his mind easily enough and had no trouble envisioning side or interior views but he understood that the beginnings of a business required all the forms phillip had told him to sign and needed something more formal more professional they would want to develop a reputation for skill and quality quickly if they expected to stay afloat so hed spent countless hours in the evenings at his desk struggling over the blueprints and drawings of their first job when he unrolled his completed sketches on the kitchen table he was both pleased and proud of his work this he said holding down the top corners is what i had in mind cam looked over ethans shoulder sipped the beer hed just opened grunted i guess thats supposed to be a boat insulted but not particularly surprised by the comment ethan scowled id like to see you do better rembrandt cam shrugged sat upon closer more neutral study he admitted he couldnt but that didnt make the drawing of the sloop look any more like a boat i guess it doesnt matter much as long as we dont show your art project to the client he pushed the sketch aside and got down to the blueprints here ethans thoughtful precision and patience showed through okay now were talking you want to go with smoothlap construction its expensive ethan began but its got advantages hell have a strong fast boat when were finished ive been in on a few cam murmured youve got to be good at it well be good at it cam had to grin yeah the thing is as a matter of pride ethan nudged the sketch of the completed boat back over it takes skill and precision to smoothlap a boat anybody who knows boats recognizes that this guy hes a sunday sailor doesnt know more than basic port and starboard hes just got money but he hangs with people who know boats and so we use him to build a rep cam finished good thinking he studied the figures the drawings the views it would be a honey he mused all they had to do was build it we could build a lift model we could building a lift model was an old and respected stage of boat building boards of equal thickness would be pegged together and shaped to the desired hull form then the model could be taken apart so that the shape of the mold frames could be determined then the builders would trace the shape of the planks or lifts in their proper relation to one another we could start the lofting cam mused i figured we could start work on that tonight and continue tomorrow that meant drawing the fullsized shape of the hull on a platform in the shop it would be detailed showing the mold sections and those sections would be tested by drawing in the longitudinal curves waterlines yeah why wait cam glanced up as seth wandered in to raid the refrigerator though it would be better if we had somebody who could draw worth diddly he said casually and pretended not to notice seths sudden interest as long as we have the measurements and the works first class it doesnt matter defending his work ethan smoothed a hand over his rendition of the boat just be nicer if we could show the client something jazzy cam lifted a shoulder phillip would call it marketing i dont care what phillip would call it the stubborn line began to form between ethans eyebrows a sure sign that he was about to dig in his heels the clients satisfied with my other work and hes not going to be critiquing a drawing he wants a damn boat not a picture for his wall i was just thinking cam let it hang as ethan obviously irritated rose to get his own beer lots of times in the boatyards ive known people come around hang out they like to watch boats being built especially the people who dont know squat about boat building but think they do you could pick up customers that way so ethan popped the top and drank i dont care if people want to watch us rabbeting laps he did of course but he didnt expect it would come to that itd be interesting i was thinking if we had good framed sketches on the walls boats weve built we havent built any damn boats yet your skipjack cam pointed out the workboat the one you already did for our first client and i put in a lot of time on a twomasted schooner up in maine a few years ago and a snazzy little skiff in bristol ethan sipped again considering maybe it would look good but im not voting to hire some artist to paint pictures weve got an equipment list to work out and phils got to finish fiddling with the contract for this boat just a thought cam turned seth was still standing in front of the wideopen refrigerator want a menu kid seth jolted then grabbed the first thing that came to hand the carton of blueberry yogurt wasnt what hed had in mind for a snack but he was too embarrassed to put it back stuck with what he considered phillips health crap he got out a spoon i got stuff to do he muttered and hurried out ten bucks says he feeds that to the dog cam said lightly and wondered how long it would take seth to start drawing boats he had a detailed and somewhat romantic sketch of ethans skipjack done by morning he didnt need phillips presence in the kitchen to remind him it was friday the day before freedom ethan was already gone sailing out to check crab pots and rebait though seth had tried to plot how to catch all three of them together he simply hadnt been able to figure out how to delay ethans dawn departure but two out of three he thought as he passed the table where cam was brooding silently over his morning coffee wasnt bad it took at least two cups of coffee before any man in the quinn household communicated with more than grunts seth was already used to that so he said nothing as he set down his backpack he had his sketchbook with his finger wedged between the pages he dropped it on the table as if it didnt matter to him in the least then with his heart skipping rummaged through the cupboards for cereal cam saw the sketch immediately smiling into his coffee he said nothing he was considering the toast hed managed to burn when seth came to the table with a box and a bowl that damn toasters defective you turned it up to high again phillip told him and finished beating his eggwhiteandchive omelet i dont think so how many eggs are you scrambling there im not scrambling any phillip slid the eggs into the omelet pan hed brought from his own kitchen make your own jeez was the guy blind or what seth wondered he poured milk on his cereal and gently nudged the sketchbook an inch closer to cam it wouldnt kill you to add a couple more while youre doing it cam broke off a piece of the charcoaled toast he had almost learned to like it that way i made the coffee the sludge phillip corrected lets not get delusions of grandeur cam sighed lustily then rose to get a bowl he picked up the cereal box that sat beside seths open sketchbook he could all but hear the boy grind his teeth as he sat back down and poured probably going to have company this weekend phillip concentrated on browning the omelet to perfection who anna cam slopped milk into his bowl im going to take her sailing and i think ive got her talked into cooking dinner all the guy could think about was girls and filling his gut seth decided in disgust he used his elbow to shove the sketch pad closer cam never glanced up from his cereal bowl when he saw phillip slide the omelet from pan to plate he judged it time to make his move seths face was a study in agonized fury whats this cam said absently cocking his head to view the sketch that was by now all but under his nose seth nearly rolled his eyes it was about damn time nothing he muttered and gleefully kept eating looks like ethans boat cam picked up his coffee glanced at phillip doesnt it phillip stood sampling the first bite of his breakfast approving it yeah its a good drawing curious he looked at seth you do it i was just fooling around the flush of pride was creeping up his neck and leaving his stomach jittery i work with guys who cant draw this well phillip gave seth an absent pat on the shoulder nice work no big deal seth said with a shrug as the thrill burst through him funny ethan and i were just talking about using sketches of boats in the boatyard you know phil like advertising our work phillip settled down to his eggs but lifted a brow in both surprise and approval you thought of that color me amazed good idea he studied the sketch more closely as he worked it through frame it rough keep the edges of the sketch raw it should look workingman not fancy cam made a sound in his throat as if he were mulling it over one sketch wont make much of a statement he frowned at seth i guess you couldnt do a few more like of ethans workboat or if i got some pictures of a couple of the boats ive worked on i dunno seth fought to keep the excitement out of his voice he nearly succeeded in keeping his eyes bored when they met cams but little lights of pleasure danced in them maybe it didnt take phillip long to clue in catching the drift he reached for his coffee and nodded could make a nice statement clients who came in would see different boats weve done itd be good to have a drawing of the one youre starting on cam snorted ethans got a pathetic sketch looks like a kindergarten project dont know what can be done about it then he looked at seth narrowed his eyes maybe you can take a look at it seth felt laughter bubble up in his throat and gamely swallowed it i suppose great you got about ninety seconds to make the bus kid or youre walking to school shit seth scrambled up grabbed his backpack and took off in a flurry of pounding sneakers when the front door slammed phillip sat back nice work cam i have my moments every now and again howd you know the kid could draw he gave anna a picture hed done of the pup hmm so whats the deal with her deal cam went back to his pitiful toast and tried not to envy phillip his eggs spending the weekend sailing cooking dinner havent seen you sniffing around any other woman since she came on the scene phillip grinned into his coffee sounds serious almost domestic get a grip cams stomach took an uncomfortable little lurch were just enjoying each other i dont know she looks like the picketfence type to me cam snorted career woman shes smart shes ambitious and shes not looking for complications she wanted a house in the country cam remembered near the water with a yard where she could plant flowers women always look for complications phillip said positively better watch your step i know where im going and how to get there thats what they all say anna was doing her best not to look for or find complications it was one of the reasons shed decided against seeing cameron on friday night she made work her excuse and compromised by telling him shed be at his house bright and early saturday morning for a sail when he wheedled she weakened and promised to make lasagna the part of her that gained so much pleasure from watching others eat what shed prepared herself came from her grandmother anna believed that was something to be proud of though she didnt commit to spending the night they both realized it was understood she took the evening for herself changing out of her suit and into baggy sweats she put some of her favorite music on nestling billie holiday between verdi and cream she poured a glass of good red wine and watched the sun set it was time she knew long past time to do some clear thinking some objective analyzing shed known cameron quinn only a matter of weeks yet shed allowed herself to become more involved with him than with any other man whod touched her life this level of involvement hadnt been in her plans she usually planned so well steps she took both professionally and personally were always carefully thought out she knew that was a protective action one she had decided upon coolly and at an early age if she thought about where each step was leading or could lead held back on impulse and depended on intellect it was much harder to make a mistake she felt shed made too many mistakes years before if she had continued along the path she blindly raced down after losing her innocence and her mother she would have been doomed shed had to learn not to blame herself for the things she had done during that dark part of her life not to wallow in guilt for the hurt shed caused the people who loved her guilt was a negative emotion anna preferred positive actions results direction what she had chosen and accomplished had been for her grandparents for her mother and for that terrified child curled on the side of a dark road it had taken time a long healing time before it came to her that while shed lost her mother her grandparents had lost their only child a daughter they loved despite their grief they opened their home to anna despite her destructive actions their hearts never faltered eventually she learned to accept the loss the horrors shed experienced more she learned to accept that everything she had done for the two years following that night was the result of a wounded soul she was fortunate to have people love her enough to help her heal when she found her way again she promised herself that she would never be reckless again impulse was saved for foolish things spending sprees long fast drives to nowhere it had become so important to her that she remain basically practical motivated and rational that she had buried that reckless bent of her heart now she thought it was that same heart that had led her to this loving cameron quinn was ridiculously reckless and she knew it was going to cost her but her emotions were her own responsibility she decided that was something she had learned the hard way she would handle them and she would survive them but it was just so odd she admitted and leaned against the open patio door to catch the earlyevening breeze shed always believed that if she ever experienced love she would be aware of every stage of it shed hoped to enjoy it the gradual slide shed imagined the mutual awareness of deepening feelings but there had been no gradual slide no gentle fall with cam it was one fast hard tumble one moment she felt attraction interest enjoyment then it seemed she no more than blinked before she was headlong in love she imagined it would scare him to death as he was racing for the hills the image made her laugh a little they were well matched there she decided she would like to do some fast running in the opposite direction herself shed been prepared for an affair but far from ready for a love affair so analyze she ordered herself what was it about him that made the difference his looks on a little hum of pleasure she closed her eyes there was little doubt thats what had gained her attention initially what woman wouldnt look twice then look again at those dangerous dark looks the restless steelcolored eyes the firm mouth that was equally appealing in a grin or a snarl his body was the perfect female fantasy of tough muscle rough hands and lean lines naturally shed been attracted and his quick mind had intrigued her so had his arrogance she admitted though it was a lowering thought but it was his heart that had changed everything oh she hadnt expected that generous heart recklessly generous he had so much to give and was so unaware of it he thought himself selfish hardbitten even cold and she imagined he could be but where it counted most he was warm and giving she didnt think he was fully aware of how much he was offering seth or how their relationship was changing she sincerely doubted he fully understood that he loved the boy and anna realized it was that blind spot in cam to his own goodness that had undone her she supposed when it came down to it falling in love with him had actually been sensible staying in love with him would be disastrous she would have to work on that the phone rang distracting her carrying her wine she walked back in and picked up the portable on the coffee table hello miz spinelli working she couldnt stop the smile working something out yes an aria soared out of her stereo as she sat down propped her feet on the coffee table you ethan and i have a little something well fiddle with tonight yet then im not even going to think about work until monday he had a portable phone himself and had wandered outside where he might find some privacy it was seths turn to do the dinner dishes and he heard another plate hit the floor with a crash theyre calling for fair weather tomorrow are they thats handy you could still drive up tonight it was tempting but shed already given in to too many impulses where he was concerned ill be there early enough in the morning i dont suppose you have a bikini a red one she tucked her tongue in her cheek no i dont mines blue he waited a beat dont forget to pack if i pack if i stay i keep the key to the bedroom door youre so strict he watched an egret sail over the water and into a nest atop a marker making for home he thought settling in just cautious quinn and very smart hows the building coming along he murmured he liked hearing her voice feeling the moist air move watching the evening slide gentle as a kiss over water and trees ill show you when youre here he wanted to show her seths sketch hed framed it himself that afternoon and wanted to share it with someone who mattered well probably get started on the first boat next week really that quick why wait its time to put our money down and see how the dice fall ive been feeling lucky lately from the house behind him he heard the puppy bark madly followed by simons deeper tones then phillips voice raised in a half shout half laugh and echoed by the rarely heard sound of seths giggle it made him turn stare at the house the back door opened and the two canine forms bulleted out tumbling over each other as they reached the steps and there framed in the doorway with the kitchen light washing through was the boy grinning whatever pulled at cams heart pulled hard for a moment just one wild moment he thought he heard the creak of the porch rocker and his fathers low chuckle jesus its weird he murmured the connection began to waver and crackle as he walked what everything he found himself gripping the phone tighter yearning for her with a wild almost desperate desire you should be here i miss you i cant hear you he realized hed been stepping away from the house a kind of kneejerk denial of the sensation of being drawn in coming home settling in with a shake of his head he walked back until the connection cleared and thanked god for the vagaries of technology i said what are you wearing she laughed softly looked down at her baggy practical sweats why nothing much she purred and both of them fell into the ease of phone flirting with various sensations of relief a short time later cam set the phone on the porch steps and wandered down to the dock water lapped gently against the hull of the boat night birds were stirring and the deep twotoned call of an owl in the woods beyond led the chorus the sea was inkdark under the fragile light of a thumbnail moon there was work to do he knew ethan would be waiting for him but he needed to sit there by the water for a moment to sit in the quiet while stars winked on and the owl called endlessly patiently for its mate he didnt jump when he saw the movement beside him he was getting used to it he couldnt count the times hed sat on this same dock under this same sky with his father it occurred to him that it was probably a little different to sit here with his fathers ghost but what the hell nothing about his life was the same as it once had been i knew you were here cam said quietly i like to keep an eye on things ray dressed in fishermans pants and a shortsleeved sweatshirt that cam remembered had once been bright blue dangled a line in the water been a while since i did any night fishing cameron decided that if ray pulled up a wriggling catfish it would most likely send him over the thin edge of sanity how close an eye he asked thinking of anna and just what the two of them did in the dark ray chuckled i always respected my boys privacy cam dont you worry about that she sure is a looker he said lightly she tries to cover it up when shes working but a man with a good eye can see through it you always had a good eye for the ladies how about you cam hated himself for asking it was such a peaceful night such a perfect one but he never knew how long these visitations hallucinations whatever they were would last he had to ask how was your eye for the ladies dad sharp enough landed on your mother didnt it and ray sighed i never touched another woman after i made my vows to stella cam i looked i appreciated i enjoyed but i never touched you have to tell me about seth i cant its not the way it has to be you did a good thing by the boy making him a part of the business youre starting by using his drawings he needs to feel that hes a part of things i wish id had more time with him with all of you but thats not the way it has to be either dad you know what i miss cam the silliest things watching the three of you argue over something there were times when your mother and i thought youd bicker us crazy but i miss that now and earlymorning fishing when the sun just starts to burn off the mist over the water i miss teaching i miss seeing that look on a students face when something you say just one thing clicks and opens the mind i miss pretty girls in summer dresses and lying in bed at three oclock in the morning listening to rain on the roof then he turned his head and smiled his eyes were as bright and brilliantly blue as the sweatshirt had once been you should appreciate those things while you have them but you never do not all the way too busy living now and again you should try to stop to appreciate the little things theyll build up if you do ive got a little more on my mind than rain on the roof right now i know youve got a mess on your hands but youre sorting it youve still got to figure out what you want and what you need and whats inside you youve got more in there than you think i want answers i need answers youll find them ray said complacently when you slow down tell me this do ethan and phillip know youre here they will ray smiled again when its time for it it should be a nice day for sailing tomorrow enjoy the little things he said and faded away chapter seventeen contents prev next he was watching for her cam figured it was just one more first in his life hed never watched and waited for a woman that he could recall even as a teenager they had come to him calling on the phone wandering by the house loitering near his locker at school he supposed hed gotten used to it spoiled by it he had never faced the typical male terror of asking for that first date hed been asked out when he was fifteen by the luscious allyson brentt an older woman of sixteen she even picked him up at his front door in her daddys chevy impala he wasnt sure how he felt about being driven around by a girl until allyson had parked on blue crab drive and suggested they make use of the backseat he didnt mind that a bit losing his virginity to pretty fasthanded allyson at fifteen was a sweaty and delightful experience and cam had never looked back he liked women liked everything about them even the annoying parts it was what made them female and he figured men got the best part of the deal they got to look they got to touch and smell and unless they were complete morons they could usually wriggle out of those soft arms and move on to the next ones without too much trouble hed never been a moron but he watched for anna and waited for her and wondered what it was about her that made him not quite so anxious to wriggle maybe it was the lack of pressure he mused as he wandered away from the dock toward the side of the house to listen for her car again it could be the very lack of any expectations she was joyfully sexual and she didnt seem to expect a lot of romantic trappings shed come from a painful childhood yet shed gotten past the damage and made herself into something strong and whole he admired that the way she could and did play up or play down her looks fascinated him that duality kept him wondering who she would be and yet both parts of her fit so smoothly together a man could barely see the seam the more he thought about her the more he wanted her whatre you doing he nearly jumped out of his skin when seth came up behind him hed been staring at the road all but willing anna to pull into the drive now he jammed his hands in his pockets mortified nothing just walking around you werent walking seth pointed out because id stopped now im walking again see seth rolled his eyes at cams back then caught up with him what am i supposed to do cam feigned intense interest in the candyred tulips sunning themselves along the edge of the house about what stuff ethans out on the workboat and phillips closed up in the office doing computer stuff so he leaned down to tug up a weed at least he thought it was a weed where the hell was she where are those kids youve been hanging with they had to go to the store and have lunch with their grandmother seth sneered on principle i dont have anything to do its boring well go clean your room or something come on jesus what am i your social director is the tv broken nothing on saturday mornings but kid shit you are a kid cam pointed out and heard the sound of an approaching car with vast relief teach that braindead dog of yours some tricks hes not braindead instantly insulted seth turned and whistled for the pup watch foolish raced up carrying what appeared to be a can of beer in his mouth yeah chewing on aluminum thats brilliant look i dont but cam broke off when seth snapped a finger pointed and foolish plopped his butt on the ground he does it on voice command too seth said matteroffactly as he rubbed foolishs head in reward but ive got him responding to hand signals he held a hand out and foolish gamely lifted a paw thats pretty good pride and surprise mixed in his voice how long did it take you to teach him that just a couple hours here and there all three watched as anna pulled into the drive foolish was the first to rush to greet her he doesnt do real good with stay yet seth confided but we havent worked on it long he didnt do real good with down either the minute anna stepped out of the car foolish was leaping and yipping his tongue lashing out joyfully to lick everywhere cam figured the dog had the right idea hed have liked to jump on her and start licking himself she wore jeans that were faded to a soft pale blue and a lipstickred top tucked into the waistband it was a simple outfit that borrowed from the practical and the siren and made cams mouth water she looks different with her hair down seth commented yeah he wanted his hands on it on her and that was that she was crouched down purring at the puppy who had flopped adoringly on his back to have his belly rubbed her head came up and even with the shaded glasses cam could see her eyes widen in awareness then shift warningly to the child who walked behind him ignoring the signal he hauled her to her feet gave her one good yank that made her stumble over the pup and against him and closed his mouth over her sputtering protest it was like being swallowed by the sun was all she could think the heat was huge and had reached flash point before she could draw the first breath need restless and greedy pumped out of him and slammed into her at alarming speed the wild drumming of a woodpecker hunting breakfast echoed through the still air and matched the frantic beat of her heart all she could do was hold on until hed devoured enough of what he wanted from her to satisfy him when he eased her back those clever lips curved a smug look she was sure she would resent when her head settled back on her shoulders again morning anna good morning she cleared her throat stepped back and made herself look over at seth he appeared to be more bored than shocked so she worked up a smile for him good morning seth yeah hi your dogs growing into his feet because she needed the distraction she looked down at foolish and held out a hand he planted his rump and lifted a paw charming her oh arent you smart she crouched again shook his paw tugged his ears what else can you do were working on a couple of things foolish had just run through his entire repertoire but seth didnt want to say so you make a good team ive got some groceries in the car she said casually makings for dinner give me a hand yeah all right he shot a resentful look at cam ive got nothing else to do were going sailing arent we she said it brightly amused when she saw cams mouth fall open and seth look at her with sharp interested eyes am i going of course she turned opened the car door then handed him a bag as soon as we put this stuff away i hope im a quick learner i know next to nothing about boats cheered seth settled bags on each hip nothing to it but you should have a hat with this he carted his bags toward the house i was figuring on it being just you and me cam told her and hed had a nice fantasy going about slipping into some quiet bend of the river and making rocky love to her in the bottom of the boat were you she took out a small overnight bag pushed it into his hands im sure itll be great fun with the three of us she closed her car door patted cams cheek then sauntered into the house behind seth it turned out to be the four of them seth insisted on taking foolish and with anna backing him all the way they outvoted cam it was tough to stay annoyed when his crew was so damn cheerful foolish sat on a bench wearing an ancient doggie life jacket that had belonged to one of ray and stellas numerous dogs and barked happily at waves and birds seth already munching on one of the sandwiches from the cooler dutifully explained to anna the mystery of the rigging she looked so damned cute cam thought with one of his old and battered orioles caps on her head watching studiously as seth identified each line he maneuvered through the channels motoring between markers at an easy speed working through what the locals called little neck river into tangier sound and toward the bay there was a light chop and cam glanced back to see how anna would weather it she was kneeling in the stern leaning over the rail but he saw with a grin that it wasnt because of a queasy stomach her smile was huge her finger pointing eagerly as she caught sight of the clumps of trees and spreading marshes of smith island he called for seth to hoist sail it was a moment anna would never forget city life hadnt prepared her for the sounds the motion the sight of white sails rising snapping in the wind then filling with it for a moment the boat seemed to fly with the wind slapping her cheeks and filling the canvas to bursting water churned in their wake and she tasted salt she wanted to watch everything at once the waves rising from bluegreen water the sea of white canvas above the stretches and bumps of land and the man and boy who worked so smoothly so competently with barely a word passing between them they sailed past what seth identified as a crab shanty it was no more than a fragile shack of beaten and weathered gray wood stilted out of the water and attached to a rickety dock the orange floats that marked the crab pots dotted the surface she watched a workboat rocking in the tide as a waterman a picture in his faded pants battered cap and white boots hauled up a chicken wire cage he paused in his work long enough to touch the brim of his cap in greeting before tossing two snapping crabs into his water tank life on the water anna thought and watched the workboat putt toward the next float thats little donnie seth told her ethan says they call him that even though hes grown up because his fathers big donnie weird anna laughed it had looked to her as if little donnie was pushing two hundred pounds i guess thats the way it is when you live in a small community it must be wonderful to live and work on the water that way seth lifted a shoulder its okay but id rather just sail when she lifted her face to the wind she decided he had a point just sail fast and free with the boat rising and falling the gulls wheeling overhead cam looked so natural at the wheel she thought with his long legs planted apart to accommodate the roll of the boat his hands firm his dark hair flying when he turned his head was it any wonder her heart jumped when he held out a hand was it any wonder she rose and walked cautiously over the unfamiliar deck to take it want the wheel desperately better not she said trying to be practical i dont know what im doing i do he tugged her in front of him put his hands over hers thats pocomoke he told her nodding toward a narrow channel if you want to slow down we can head that way dodge some crab pots the wind slapped playfully at her face she watched a gull swoop toward the surface of the water skim it then rise up calling in that sharp cry that sounded like a laughing scream the hell with practicalities i dont want to slow down she heard him laugh above her ear atta girl where are we heading what are we doing heading south southwest sailing to the luff he told her on the edge of the wind on the edge it feels like were in the middle of it i didnt know we could go so fast its wonderful good hold on a minute to her shock he stepped back and called to seth to help him make some adjustments to the sails as her hands whiteknuckled on the wheel she heard them laughing she heard the creak of the masts the shiver of the canvas as it turned if anything she thought the boat picked up speed she tried to relax after all there was nothing but water ahead of them she could see to the right starboard she corrected herself a small motorboat cruising out of one of the many rivers and channels too far away she judged for any traffic jams or accidents just as she had herself convinced she could do the job without incident the boat tilted she muffled a scream and nearly whipped the wheel in the opposite direction of the tilt but cams hands closed over hers again and held it steady were going over nan were heeled in nicely more speed her heart stayed in her throat you left me at the wheel sails needed trimming the kid knows how to work the sheets ethans taught him a lot and he catches on quick hes a damn good sailor but you left me at the wheel she repeated you did fine he brushed an absent kiss on the top of her head thats tangier island up ahead well go around it then head north theres some quiet spots on the little choptank well hit there about lunchtime they didnt appear to be capsizing she thought with a steadying breath and since she hadnt run them aground she relaxed enough to lean back against him she planted her feet apart as cam did and let her body balance with the motion of the boat her newest ambition was to have a little sloop skiff whatever it was called when she finally got that house on the water she would have the quinn brothers build it for her she decided dreaming if i had a boat id do this every chance i got well have to teach you the basics before long well have you trapezing what swinging from the mast in a spangled leotard the image had its appeal not quite you use a rig a trapeze and you hang out over the water for fun well i like it he said with a laugh its for speed balancing power hanging out over the water she mused glancing to port i might like it too he let her work the jib under seths watchful eye she liked the feel of the line in her hand and knowing she was in charge more or less of the billowing white sheet they rounded the little sandy spit of tangier island and she was treated to the quick maneuvering of tacking jibbing the teamwork necessary to maintain speed while changing course cam had stripped down to denim cutoffs and his skin gleamed with sun and sweat and water if her hands ached a little from the unfamiliar work she didnt complain instead she got a foolish thrill when cam told her she was a pretty good crew they had lunch on hudson creek off the little choptank river near a brokendown wharf with only the birds and the lap of water for company the sun was bright in a clear blue sky and the temperature had soared into the eighties to give a hint of the summer that was still weeks away to the accompaniment of music on the radio they took a cooling swim foolish paddled joyfully while seth dived beneath the mirrorlike surface and swam like a wild dolphin hes having the time of his life anna murmured a layer of the sulky defiant angry boy shed first interviewed was being washed away she wondered if he knew it then i guess i cant be too annoyed that you insisted on his coming along she smiled shed bundled her hair on top of her head in a vain attempt to keep it dry with the way seth and the puppy were splashing nothing was dry you dont really mind and youd never have had that smooth of a sail without him on board true enough but theres something to be said for a rough sail he parted the water in front of him then slid his arms around her anna gripped his shoulders in automatic defense no dunking would i do anything that predictable his eyes were smoky with laughter especially when this is more fun he tilted his head and kissed her their lips were wet and slippery and annas pulse thrummed at the sensation of his mouth sliding over hers then capturing then taking the cool water seemed to grow warmer as their legs tangled she was weightless sighing as she floated into the kiss then she was underwater she surfaced sputtering shaking wet hair out of her eyes the first thing she heard was seths laughter the first thing she saw was cams grin it was irresistible he claimed then swallowed water himself as she flipped onto her stomach and kicked it into his face youre next she warned seth who was so stunned at the idea of an adult playing with him that she caught him easily and wrestled him under he struggled spat out water swallowed more when he laughed hey i didnt do anything you laughed besides as i see it you guys work as a team it was probably your idea no way he wiggled free then got the bright idea to dive and pull her under the surface by the ankle it was a pitched battle and when they were exhausted they agreed to call it a draw it was only then that they noticed cam was no longer in the water but sitting comfortably on the side of the boat eating a sandwich what are you doing up there anna called out while she pushed her soppingwet hair back watching the show he washed the ham and cheese down with pepsi a couple of goons goons she slid her eyes toward seth and in tacit agreement the foes became a unit i only see one goon around here how about you just one he agreed as they swam slowly toward the boat any idiot could have seen what they had in mind cam nearly lifted his legs out of reach then he decided what the hell and let them pull him back into the water with an impressive splash it would be hours before it occurred to seth that anna and cam had both had their hands on him and he hadnt been scared at all after the boat was docked the sails dropped the decks swabbed anna rolled up her metaphorical sleeves and got to work in the kitchen it was her mission to give the quinn men a meal they wouldnt soon forget she might have been a novice sailor but here she was an expert it smells like glory phillip told her when he wandered in itll taste better she built the layers of her lasagna with an artists flair old family recipe theyre the best he agreed weve got my fathers secret waffle batter recipe ill have to whip you up some in the morning id like that she glanced up to smile at him and noted what she thought was worry in his eyes everything all right sure just some leftover tangles from work it had nothing to do with work but with the latest report from the private investigator hed hired seths mother had been spotted in norfolk and that was entirely too close need any help in here everythings under control she finished off her casserole with a thin layer of mozzarella before popping it in the oven you might want to try the wine absently phillip picked up the bottle breathing on the counter and instantly his interest was piqued nebbiolo the best of the italian reds i think so and i can promise my lasagnas a match for it phillip grinned as he poured two glasses his eyes were a golden brown that for some reason made anna think of archangels anna my love why dont you toss cam over and run away with me because id hunt you both down and kill you cam stated as he stepped into the kitchen back off from my woman bro before i hurt you though it was said lightly cam wasnt entirely sure he was joking and he wasnt entirely pleased to feel the hot little spurt of jealousy he wasnt the jealous type he doesnt know a barolo from a chianti phillip told her as he got down another glass youre better off with me goodness she said in a passable imitation of their belowthemasondixonline drawl i just love being fought over by strong men and here comes one more she added as ethan stepped through the back door you want to duel for me too ethan he blinked and scratched his head women confused him but he was pretty sure there was a joke coming on did you make whatevers cooking in there with my own little hands she assured him ill go get my gun when she laughed he shot her a quick smile then ducked out of the room to shower off the days work jesus ethan nearly flirted with a woman amazed phillip lifted his glass in a toast were going to have to keep you around anna if someone will set the table while i put the salad together i might hang around long enough to let you sample my cannoli cam and phillip eyed each other whose turn is it cam demanded not mine it must be yours no way i did it yesterday they studied each other another moment then both turned to the door and yelled for seth anna only shook her head younger brothers she supposed were meant to be abused in such matters she knew the meal was a success when seth gobbled up a third helping hed lost that alleycat boniness she noted and the pallor perhaps his eyes were still occasionally wary peeking out under his lashes as if searching for the blow that hed learned too young to expect but more often anna thought there was humor in his eyes he was a bright boy who was discovering how to be amused by people his language was rough and she didnt expect there would be a great deal of improvement in it as long as he lived in a household of men though she did see that cam booted him lightly under the table now and again when he swore too often they were making it work shed had strong doubts in the beginning that three grown men well set in their ways would find a way of adjusting of making room and especially of opening their hearts to a boy who had been thrust upon them but they were making it work when she wrote her report on the quinn case the following week she was going to state that seth delauter was home exactly where he belonged it would take time for the guardianship to move from temporary to permanent but she would add her weight nothing warmed her heart quite so deeply as seeing the way seth looked over at cam after another underthetable kick and grinned exactly like a tenyearold boy caught sinning he would make a terrific father she thought just rough enough around the edges to make it fun hed be the type to cart a child around on his shoulders to wrestle in the yard she could almost see it the handsome darkhaired little boy the pretty rosycheeked girl youre in the wrong business phillip told her as he pushed back from the table and considered loosening his belt she blinked caught daydreaming and very nearly flushed i am you should own a restaurant any time you want to shift gears in that direction ill be the first in line to invest he rose intending to make use of his cappuccino maker to complement her dessert and answered the phone on the first ring at the sound of the husky female voice with a sexy italian accent he raised his eyebrows hes right here phillip ran his tongue over his teeth and held out the phone to cam its for you pal cam took the phone and after one purring sentence in his ear almost placed the voice hi sugar he said searching for a name come va because he did indeed love his brother phillip tried his best to distract anna i just picked up this machine about six months ago he told her holding her chair so she would rise and perhaps move out of earshot its a beaut really she wasnt the least bit interested in the working of some fancy coffee machine not when shed heard just how smoothly cam had greeted his obviously female caller when she heard him laugh her teeth went on edge it didnt occur to cam to muffle his voice or censor the content hed finally put a name with the voice sophia of the curvy body and bedroom eyes and was chatting lightly about mutual acquaintances she liked racing all manner of racing and was a hot sleek bullet in bed no i had to take a pass on the rest of the season this year he told her i dont know when ill get back to rome youll be the first bella he answered when she asked if he would call her when he did sure i remember the little trattoria near the trevi fountain absolutely he leaned back against the counter her voice brought back memories not of her particularly as he could barely get a clear image of her face in his head but of rome itself the busy narrow streets the smells the sounds the rush the races what her question about his porsche jerked him back to the present time and place yeah ive got it garaged in nice until he trailed off his thoughts scattering as she asked him if he would consider selling it she had a friend she told him carlo he remembered carlo didnt he carlo wondered if cam would be interested in selling the car since he was staying so long in the states i havent thought about it sell the car a little lance of panic stabbed him it would be like admitting he wasnt going back not just to europe but to his life she was speaking quickly persuasively her italian and english mixing and confusing him he had her number si and could call her anytime she would tell carlo he was thinking about it they were all missing cam rome was so noioso without him she had heard he had said no to a big race in australia and was afraid it must be a woman holding him had he finally fallen for a woman yes no his head was spinning its complicated sweetie but ill be in touch then she made him laugh one more time when she whispered a suggestion on how they might spend his first night back in rome ill be sure to keep that in mind darling how could i forget yeah ciao phillip was busily foaming milk and trying with the air of a desperate man to engage anna in conversation about types of coffee beans ethan with the instinct of a survivor had already deserted the kitchen and seth simply sat crumbling a heel of garlic bread for foolish who hid under the table oblivious cam raised a suspicious eyebrow at the cappuccino machine ill stick with regular coffee he began and smiled when anna walked up to him i remember your cannoli from and the air whooshed out of his lungs as she plowed a fist into his gut before he could suck it back in she strode past him and outside with a slap of the screen door what rubbing his stomach cam goggled at phillip jesus what did you say to her youre such a jerk phillip muttered and deftly poured the first cup she looked really pissed seth commented and sniffed the air can i try some of that junk youre making sure phillip made up a latte heavy on the milk while cam headed outside cam caught up to anna on the dock where she stood fuming her arms folded over her chest what the hell was that for oh i dont know cam for the hell of it she whirled around to face him her eyes blazing in the starlight women are peculiar creatures they get annoyed when the man theyre supposed to be with flirts over the phone right in their damn face with some italian bimbo the light dawned but to his credit he barely winced come on sugar he broke off unsure whether he was amused or frightened when she lifted a fist dont you call me sugar you use my name do you think im an idiot sugar sweetie honey pie thats what you say when you cant even remember the name of the woman whos underneath you in bed wait a damn minute no you wait a damn minute do you have any idea how insulting it is to stand there and hear you make a date to meet your italian squeeze in rome when my lasagnas barely settled in your stomach worse she thought much much worse hed done it seconds after shed been building foolish castles in the air of him with children their children oh it was mortifying infuriating i wasnt making a date he began then paused fascinated while a stream of impressive italian curses poured out of her mouth you didnt learn those from your grandparents when she bared her teeth and hissed he couldnt stop the smile youre jealous its not a matter of jealousy its a matter of courtesy she tossed her head and tried to calm down she was only embarrassing herself more with the outburst she realized but by damn she wasnt finished yet youre a free agent cameron and so am i no pretenses no promises fine but i wont tolerate you having phone sex while im standing in the same room it wasnt phone sex it was a conversation the little trattoria by the trevi fountain she said coolly now how could i forget youll be the first you want to have some italian zucchero cam thats your business but dont you ever do it in my face again she took a breath then held up a hand before he could speak im sorry i hit you he gauged her mood ruffled but calming no youre not okay im not you deserved it it didnt mean anything anna yes she thought wearily it did to her it meant a great deal and that was her own fault her own small disaster it was rude manners never were my strong point im not interested in her i cant even remember her face anna angled her head do you honestly think a statement like that goes to your credit what the hell did she want him to say he wondered with a quick impatient hiss of breath sometimes he supposed the truth was best its your face anna that i cant get out of my mind she sighed now youre trying to distract me is it working maybe her emotions she reminded herself her problem lets just agree that even casual relationships have lines that shouldnt be crossed he wasnt sure casual was the word to describe what was between them but at the moment whatever made her happy suited him okay starting now youre the only italian bimbo i flirt with her bland unsmiling stare made him grin it was terrific lasagna none of my other bimbos could cook she slid her gaze to the water back to his face then cocked her head consideringly cam was pretty sure he saw the beginnings of humor in her eyes wed both end up in there he told her but i dont mind if you dont i suppose all in all id rather stay dry she glanced toward the house when music slipped through the windows and into the air who plays the violin thats ethan it was a quick and lively jig one of their parents favorites the piano joined in made him smile and thats phillip what do you play a little guitar id like to hear in a gesture of peace she held out a hand he took it drawing her closer taking her fingers to his lips youre the one i want anna youre the one i think of for now she thought and let him slide her into his arms now was all that had to matter chapter eighteen contents prev next anna wasnt sure how she felt about seeing cam frown in concentration as he tuned up a battered old gibson guitar it was a piece of him she hadnt counted on it surprised her pleased her to see how smoothly how easily the three men had slid into a song strong voices she mused quick and clever fingers teamwork once again and unbroken family ties without a doubt there had been many evenings such as this in their lives she could imagine the three of them years younger melding their tunes with the two people who had given them the music and the purpose and the family sitting in the room with them she took that image and the music upstairs with her when she finally went to bed to cams bed reminding herself there was a child in the house she locked the door in case cam came tiptoeing up from his makeshift bed on the sofa downstairs and she told herself she wouldnt unlock it if he came tapping no matter how sexy hed looked strumming that old guitar to life most of the tunes had been old irish ballads and pub songs that shed been unfamiliar with she found them sad and heartwrenching even when the tune beneath the words was lively they mixed in some rock and sneered at seth when he suggested they play something from this century it had been sweet anna thought as she undressed they would never think of it that way and would likely be horrified that anyone else did but sweet was how shed seen it four males four brothers not of the blood but of the heart it was easy to see how well they understood each other and how they had come to just not accept the child but to include him when seth commented that violins were for girls and wusses ethan merely smiled and went into a hot lick designed to capture seths interest and imagination and ethans dry comment lets see a wuss do that earned a shrug and a grin from seth when seth had fallen asleep theyd just left him there sprawled on the rug with the puppys head pillowed on his butt another belonging in annas mind she slipped into her nightshirt and picked up her hairbrush this house was an easy place to feel belonging big simple rooms livedin furniture noisy plumbing she caught a few female touches that hadnt been there before a gleam to the furniture the odd vase of spring flowers compliments of the housekeeper anna imagined which probably went largely unnoticed by the occupants if it were her house she wouldnt change much she decided dreaming again as she ran the brush through her hair maybe spruce up some of the colors add a bit of dash here and there with thick throw pillows and splashier flowers she would definitely want to expand the gardens shed been doing some reading on perennials what worked best in sun what thrived in shade there was a nice spot where the trees began to take over from the yard she thought lily of the valley some hostas and periwinkles would do well there and add some interest wouldnt it be lovely she reflected to while away a saturday morning digging in the earth crowding pretty bedding plants together planning the flow of colors and textures and heights and to watch them grow and spread and bloom year after year a movement outside the window caught her eye in the mirror her heart sprang into her throat as she saw the shadow move behind the dark glass as the window crept up she turned slowly holding the brush like a weapon and cam stepped over the sill hi he had enjoyed watching her brush her hair hated to see her stop brought you something he held out a clutch of wild violets which she tried to eye suspiciously just how did you get up here climbed he stepped forward she stepped back climbed what up the side of the house mostly used to be able to shimmy up and down the gutter but i weighed less then he came closer she moved back that was clever of you what if youd fallen hed climbed sheer rock faces in montana mexico and france but he smiled winningly at her concern youd have felt sorry for me i dont think so since he had maneuvered his way to arms length she reached out and snatched the slightly crushed flowers thanks for the violets good night interesting he decided her voice and her expression were prim despite the fact that she was standing there in nothing more than a long white tshirt for some reason he found the plain and practical cotton ridiculously sexy it appeared he was finally going to get the chance to seduce her i couldnt sleep he reached over hit the light switch and left only the small bedside lamp burning warm and gold you didnt try very long she said flicking the switch back on again seemed like hours he lifted a hand to trace a finger lightly up her arm from wrist to elbow her skin was dusky golden against the pure white of the nightshirt all i could think about was you beautiful anna he said softly with the italian eyes her toes seemed to curl in response to that skimming finger which moved now to trace her jawline her heart was fluttering no it was her stomach no it was everything cam theres a young boy in the house whos dead asleep his fingers dipped to her throat tested the rapid pulse beating there snoring on the living room rug you should have carried him up to bed why because there had to be a good reason but how was she supposed to think clearly when he was looking at her those flintgray eyes so focused so intense on her face you planned this she said weakly not exactly i thought i would have to talk you into going for a walk in the woods after the house quieted down and then i would make love to you outside he took her hand turned it palm up and pressed his lips to the center in the starlight but rains coming in rain she glanced toward the window and saw the curtains billowing in the freshening wind when she looked back he was closer and his arms were around her those broadpalmed clever hands stroking up her back and i want you in bed my bed he tipped his head to nibble kisses along her jaw then just under it where the skin was soft as water i want you anna day and night tomorrow she began tonight tomorrow and the word always was on the edge of his mind when his mouth found hers she made a small sound that might have been distress when his tongue slipped through her parted lips to deepen the kiss it went deeper still deeper until she had no choice but to let herself sink the pretty little flowers drifted to the floor as her fingers went limp he had kissed her like this only once before with such unspeakable tenderness that it stripped her soul bare if she could have formed words she would have babbled out her love for him but her knees were jelly her heart lost and words were beyond her he barely touched her just those hands light on her back while his mouth drank from hers and destroyed her its not a race this time he heard himself murmur the words but wasnt sure if he spoke to himself or to her all he knew was he wanted slow painfully slow endlessly slow so that he could savor every moment every move every moan he reached out dimmed the lights i want this spot he whispered and let his mouth journey along the fragile skin just under her jaw again and this one to the slender column of her throat where her scent was warm and smoky when he stepped back and tugged his shirt over his head she took a breath she would get her feet back under her she thought and offer back some of what he was giving her she reached for him rose on her toes until their eyes and mouths lined up but he kissed her temples her brow her eyes when they fluttered closed i love looking at you he told her he took the hem of her nightshirt in his fingers and lifted it inch by inch all of you even when youre not around i have a picture of you in my head when her nightshirt was pooled on the floor he kept his eyes on her face lifted her into his arms felt her tremble and he knew in one breathstealing flash that he had never wanted another woman the way he wanted anna this time when he laid her on the bed it was he who sank mindlessly into the kiss he didnt have to order his hands to be gentle to go slowly he didnt have to hold back an urge to plunder not when she sighed so softly under his touch not when she moved so fluidly beneath his hands not when she gave so completely before he could ask he explored her with a kind of wonder as if it were the first time the first woman the first need somehow it was new this longing to linger to sip instead of gulp to glide instead of race when her hands roamed over him his skin quivered and warmed neither of them heard the first soft patters of rain or the low poignant moan of the wind she rose to peak on one long shimmering wave floated down again breathing out his name pleasure was liquid soft as morning dew wide as a dark sea she could feel it sliding through her shifting spreading taking her up on another high curving crest where only he existed she pressed her mouth to his throat his shoulder would have absorbed him into her skin if shed known a way no one had ever taken her away so completely and when she framed his face brought his mouth to hers and poured all she was into the kiss she knew he was with her absolutely hers when he filled her it was only one more link she opened took him and gave they moved together slowly breath tangling gazes locked moved together silkily rhythms matched to draw out every ounce of pleasure it built dizzying and dazzling so that her lips curved even as her eyes swam kiss me she demanded on one last trembling breath so their mouths met clung as that last sweeping wave swamped them he didnt speak didnt dare when her hands slid limply from his back to the bed he felt as if hed tumbled off a cliff and fallen hard on his heart now his heart was swollen exposed and it was hers if this was love it scared the hell out of him but he couldnt move couldnt let her go she felt so good so right beneath him his body was weak sated and his mind close to empty it was only his heart that trembled and pumped he would worry about it later saying nothing nothing at all he shifted drew her close possessively close to his side and let the rain lull him to sleep anna awoke with the sun shooting into her eyes and was stunned to find herself wrapped up in cam his arms had a good strong hold on her and hers were snug around him their legs were tangled with her right hooked over his hip like an anchor if her mind had been clear it might have occurred to her that while they both assumed their affair was casual even sophisticated in sleep theyd both known better she slid her leg down hoping to unknot their limbs but he only shifted and anchored hers more firmly cam she whispered it feeling foolish and guilty and when she received no response wriggled and spoke more firmly cameron wake up he grunted snuggled closer and muttered something into her hair she sighed and deciding she had no choice lifted the leg that was caught between his until her knee pressed firmly against his crotch then she gave it a quick nudge that got his eyes open whoa what wake up im awake and his justopen eyes were all but crossed would you mind moving your when the pressure eased off he let out the breath hed been holding thanks youve got to go she was back to whispering you shouldnt have stayed in here all night why not he whispered back its my bed you know what im talking about she hissed one of your brothers could get up any minute he exerted himself to lift his head a couple of inches and peer at the clock on the opposite nightstand its after seven ethans already up has probably emptied his first crab pot and why are we whispering because youre not supposed to be here i live here a sleepy smile moved over his face damn youre pretty when youre all rumpled and embarrassed i guess i have to have you again stop it she nearly giggled until his hand snuck around to cup her breast not now were here now naked and everything and youre all soft and warm he nuzzled his way to her neck dont you start too late im already into the first lap and indeed when he shifted she understood that the starting gun had already sounded he was inside her in one easy move and it was so smooth so natural so lovely she could only sigh no moaning he said with a chuckle at her ear youll wake up my brothers she snorted out a laugh and caught between amusement and arousal shoved and rolled until she straddled him he looked sleepy and dangerous and exciting a little breathless she braced her hands on either side of his head she bent down and sucked his bottom lip into her mouth okay smart guy lets see who moans first and arching back she began to ride afterward they decided it was a tie she made him climb out the window which he claimed was ridiculous but it made her feel a little less decadent the house was quiet when she came downstairs freshly showered and comfortable in olivedrab cotton slacks and a camp shirt seth was still sleeping on the rug foolish stood guard on the floor at the sight of anna the pup scrambled up whining pitifully as he followed her into the kitchen she assumed it was either an empty stomach or a full bladder when she opened the back door he shot out like a bullet and proved it was the latter by peeing copiously on an azalea just struggling into bloom birds were singing with full joyful throats dew sparkled on the grass and the grass needed mowing there was still a light mist on the water but it was burning off quickly like blown smoke and through it she could see little diamond sparks of sunlight on calm water the air was fresh from the nights rain and the leaves seemed greener fuller than they had only a day before she built a little fantasy that included steaming coffee and a walk down to the dock by the time shed taken the first step toward brewing the coffee cam came in through the hallway door he hadnt shaved she noted and found that the stubble of beard suited her image of a lazy sunday morning in the country he lifted a brow she got two mugs out of the cupboard then lifted hers good morning cameron good morning anna deciding to play along he walked over and gave her a chaste kiss how did you sleep very well and you like a log he wound a lock of her hair around his finger it wasnt too quiet for you quiet city girl country silence oh no i liked it in fact i dont think ive ever slept better they were grinning at each other when seth stumbled in rubbing his eyes have we got anything to eat cam kept his gaze locked on annas phillip ran his mouth about making waffles go wake him up waffles cool he ran off his bare feet slapping on the wood floor phillips not going to appreciate that anna commented hes the one who started the waffle rumor i could make them you made dinner we take turns around here to avoid chaos and the shedding of blood a loud and nasty thud sounded over their heads and made cam grin why dont we pour that coffee and take a walk out of the line of fire i was thinking the same thing on impulse he grabbed a fishing pole hold this a hunt through the fridge netted him a small round of phillips brie i thought we were having waffles we are this is bait he tucked the cheese in his pocket and picked up his coffee you use brie for bait you use whats handy a fish is going to bite itll bite on damn near anything he handed her a mug of coffee lets see what we can catch i dont know how to fish she said as they headed out nothing to it you drown a worm or in this case some fancy cheese and see what happens then why do guys go off with all that expensive complicated gear and those funny hats just trappings were not talking dry flyfishing here were just dropping a line if we cant pull up a couple of cats by the time phillips got waffles on the table ive really lost my touch cats for one stunning moment she was absolutely horrified you dont use cats as bait he blinked at her saw that she was perfectly serious then roared with laughter sure we do you catch em by the tail skin their bellies and drop them in he took pity on her only because she went deathly pale but it didnt stop him from laughing catfish honey were going to bring up some catfish before breakfast very funny she sniffed and started walking again catfish are really ugly ive seen pictures youre telling me youve never eaten catfish why in the world would i a little miffed she sat on the side of the dock feet dangling and cupped her mug in both hands fry them fresh and fry them right and youve never tasted better toss in some hush puppies a couple ears of sweet corn and youve got yourself a feast she eyed him as he settled beside her and began to bait his hook with brie his chin was stubbled his hair untidy his feet bare fried catfish and hush puppies this from the reckless cameron quinn the man who races through the waters roads and the hearts of europe i dont think your little pastry from rome would recognize you he grimaced and dropped his line in the water were not going to get into that again are we no she laughed and leaned over to kiss his cheek i almost dont recognize you myself but i kind of like it he handed her the pole you dont exactly look like the sober and dedicated public servant yourself this morning miz spinelli i take sundays off what do i do if i catch a fish reel it in how well worry about that when it happens he leaned over to pull up the crab pot tied to the near piling the two annoyedlooking jimmies inside made him grin at least we wont starve tonight the snapping claws had anna lifting her feet slightly higher above the water but she was content to sit there sipping coffee watching the morning bloom when mama duck and her six fuzzy babies swam by she had what cam considered a typical city girl reaction oh look look baby ducks arent they cute we get a nest down there in the bend near the edge of the woods most every year and because she was looking so dreamyeyed he couldnt resist makes for good hunting over the winter hunting what she murmured charmed and already imagining what it would be like to hold one of those puffy ducklings in her hand then her eyes popped wide horrified you shoot the little ducks well theyre bigger by then he had never shot a duck or anything else in his life you can sit right here and drop a couple before breakfast you should be ashamed your citys showing id call it my humanity if they were my ducks no one would shoot them his quick grin had her narrowing her eyes you were just trying to get a rise out of me it worked you look so cute when youre outraged he kissed her cheek to mollify her my mothers heart was too soft to allow hunting fishing never bothered her she said that was more of an even match and she hated guns what was she like she was steady he decided it was hard to rock her once you did she had a kickass temper but it was tough to get it going she loved her work loved the kids she had a lot of soft spots shed cry at movies or over books and she couldnt even watch when we cleaned fish but when there was trouble she was a rock hed taken annas hand without realizing it lacing their fingers when i came here i was beat up pretty bad she fixed me up i kept thinking id take off as soon as i was steady on my feet again i kept telling myself these people were a couple of assholes i could rob them blind and take off anytime i wanted i was going to mexico but you didnt take off anna said quietly i fell in love with her it was the day i got back from my first sail with dad this world had opened up for me i was a little scared of it but there it was he went inside to grade some papers i think i was making bitching noises about having to wear that stupid life jacket and just general bullshit she took me by the hand and pulled me right into the water she said then id better learn to swim and she taught me i fell in love with her about ten feet out from this dock you couldnt have dragged me away from here moved anna lifted their joined hands to her cheek i wish id had the chance to meet her to meet both of them he shifted suddenly realizing that he had told her a story hed never shared with anyone and he remembered the way hed sat here the night before talking to his father do you ah believe that people come back from you know ghosts spirits twilight zone stuff i dont not believe it she said after a moment after my mother died there were times when i could smell her perfume just out of the blue out of the air this scent that was so her maybe it was real maybe it was my imagination but it helped me thats what counts i suppose yeah but oh she nearly dropped the pole when she felt the tug somethings on here take it uhuh you caught it he decided the distraction was for the best another minute or two he might have made a total fool of himself and told her everything he reached over to steady the pole reel it in some then let it play out thats it no dont jerk just slow and steady it feels big her heart was thudding between her ears really big they always do you got it now just keep bringing it in he rose to get the net that always hung over the edge of the dock bring her up up and out anna leaned back eyes half shut they popped wide when the fish came flashing and wriggling out of the water and into the sunlight oh my god dont drop the pole for gods sake shaking with laughter cam gripped her shoulder before she could pitch herself into the water leaning forward he netted the flopping catfish nice one what do i do what do i do now expertly cam freed fish from hook then to her horror handed her the full net hang on to it dont leave me with this thing she took one squinting look saw whiskers and fishy eyes and shut her own cam come back here and take this ugly thing he set the widemouthed pail hed just filled with water on the dock took the net and flopped the catch into it city girl she let out a long breath of relief maybe she peeped into the pail ugh throw it back its hideous not on your life its a fourpounder easy when she refused to take the pole a second time he sacrificed the rest of his brothers brie and settled down to catch the rest of that nights supper himself the reception that her mornings work received from seth changed her attitude impressing a small boy by catching an indisputably ugly and possibly gourmand fish was a new kind of triumph by the time she was driving with cam to the boatyard shed decided one of her next projects would be to read up on the art of fishing i think with the proper bait i could catch something much more attractive than a catfish want to go dig up some night crawlers next weekend she tipped down her sunglasses are those what they sound like you bet she tipped them back up i dont think so i think id prefer using those pretty feathers and whatnot she glanced at him again so do you know your fathers secret waffle recipe nope he didnt trust me with it he figured out pretty fast that i was a disaster in the kitchen what kind of bribe would work best on phillip you couldnt worm it out of him with a hermes tie it only gets passed down to a quinn theyd see about that she decided and tapped her fingers on her knee she continued tapping them when he pulled into the lot beside the old brick building she wasnt sure what reaction he expected from her as far as she could see there was little change here the trash had been picked up the broken windows replaced but the building still looked ancient and deserted you cleaned up it seemed like a safe response and it appeared to satisfy him as they got out of opposite doors of the car the docks going to need some work he commented phillip ought to be able to handle it he took out keys as shiny as the new lock on the front door i guess we need a sign or something he said half to himself as he unlocked the dead bolts when he opened the door anna caught the scent of sawdust mustiness and stale coffee but the polite smile shed fixed on her face widened in surprise as she stepped inside he flicked on lights and made her blink they were brilliant overhead hanging from the rafters and unshaded the newly repaired floor had been swept clean or nearly so bare drywall angled out on the near side to form a partition the stairs had been replaced the banister of plain wood oiled the loft overhead still looked dangerous but she began to see the potential she saw pulleys and wenches enormous power tools with wicked teeth a metal chest with many drawers that she assumed held baffling tools new steel locks glinted on the wide doors leading to the dock this is wonderful cam you do work fast speeds my business he said it lightly but it pleased him to see that she was genuinely impressed you had to work like dogs to get this much done though she wanted to see everything it was the huge platform in the center of the building that pulled her forward drawn on it in dark pencil or chalk were curves and lines and angles i dont understand this fascinated she circled around it is this supposed to be a boat it is a boat the boat its lofting you draw the hull full size the mold section transverse forms then you test them out by sketching in some longitudinal curves like the sheer some of the waterlines he was on his knees on the platform as he spoke using his hands to show her and still leaving her in the dark but it didnt matter whether she understood the technique he described or not she understood him he might not realize it yet but he had fallen in love with this place and with the work he would do here we need to add the bow lines and the diagonals we may want to use this design again and this is the only way to reproduce it with real accuracy its a damn good design im going to want to add in the structural details full size the more detail the better he looked up and saw her smiling at him swinging her sunglasses by the earpiece sorry you dont know what the hell im talking about i think its wonderful i mean it youre building more than boats here faintly embarrassed he got to his feet boats is the idea he jumped nimbly off the platform come take a look at these he caught her hand led her to the opposite walls there were two framed sketches now one of ethans beloved skipjack and the other of the boat yet to be built seth did them the pride in his voice was just there he didnt even notice it hes the only one of us who can really draw worth a damn phils adequate but the kid is just great hes doing ethans workboat next then the sloop ive got to get some pictures of a couple of boats i worked on so he can copy them well hang them all in here and add drawings of the others we build kind of like a gallery a trademark there were tears in her eyes when she turned and wrapped her arms around him her fierce grip surprised him but he returned it more than boats she murmured then drew back to frame his face in her hands its wonderful she said again and pulled his mouth down to hers the kiss swarmed through him swamped him staggered him everything about her about them spun around in his heart questions dozens of them buzzed like bees in his head and the answer the single answer to all of them was nearly within his reach he said her name just once then drew her unsteadily away he had to look at her really look but nothing about him seemed quite on balance anna he said again wait a minute before he could get a firm grip on the answer before he could get his feet back under him again the door creaked open letting in sunlight excuse me folks mackensie said pleasantly i saw the car out front chapter nineteen contents prev next cams first reaction was pure annoyance something was happening here something monumental and he didnt want any interruptions were not open for business mackensie he kept his grip on annas arms firm and turned his back to the man he considered no more than a paperpushing pest didnt think you were with his voice still mild and friendly mackensie wandered in in his line of work he rarely received a warm welcome door was unlocked well this is going to be quite a place he was a harry homemaker at heart and the sight of all those spankingnew power tools stirred the juices got yourself some topgrade equipment here you want a boat come back tomorrow and well talk i get seasick mackensie confessed with a quick grimace cant even stand on a dock without getting queasy thats tough go away but i sure do admire the looks of boats cant say i ever gave much thought to what went into building them thats some band saw over there mustve set you back some this time cam did turn the fury in his eyes as dangerous as a cocked gun its my business how i spend my money baffled by the exchange anna laid a hand on cams arm she wasnt surprised that he was being rude shed seen him be rude before but the snap and hiss of his anger over what appeared to be no more than a nuisance puzzled her if this is the way he intends to treat potential clients she thought he might as well close the doors now before she could think of the proper calming words cam shook her off what the hell do you want now just a couple of questions he nodded politely to anna maam larry mackensie claim investigator for true life insurance in the dark anna automatically accepted the hand he held out mr mackensie im anna spinelli mackensie did a quick flip through his mental file it took only a moment for him to tag her as seth delauters caseworker as she had come on the scene after the death of the insured hed had no need to contact her but she was in his records and the cozy little scene hed walked in on told him she was pretty tight with at least one of the quinns he wasnt sure if or how that little bit of information would apply but he would just make a note of it pleased to meet you if you two have business to discuss anna began ill just wait outside i dont have anything to discuss with him now or later go file your report mackensie were done just about i figured youd like to know ill be heading back to the home office got a lot of mixed results on my interviews mr quinn not much of what youd call hard facts though he glanced toward the band saw again wished fleetingly he could afford one like it theres the letter that was found in your fathers car that goes to state of mind singlecar accident driver a physically fit man no traces of alcohol or drugs he lifted his shoulders then theres the fact that the insured increased his policy and added a beneficiary shortly before the accident the company looks hard at that kind of thing you go ahead and look cams voice had lowered like the warning growl of an attack dog but not here not in my place just letting you know how things stand starting a new business mackensie said conversationally takes a good chunk of capital you been planning this for long cam sprang quickly had mackensie by the lapels and up on the toes of his shiny laceup shoes you son of a bitch cam stop it the order was quick and sharp and anna punctuated it by stepping forward and shoving a hand on each mans chest she thought it was like moving between a wolf and a bull but she held her ground mr mackensie i think youd better go now on my way his voice was steady enough despite the cold sweat that had pooled at the base of his neck and was even now dripping down his spine its just details mr quinn the company pays me to gather the details but it didnt pay him he reminded himself as he walked outside where he could gulp in air to be beaten to a pulp by a furious beneficiary bastard fucking bastard cam desperately wanted to hit something anything but there was too much empty air does he really think my father plowed into a telephone pole so i could start building boats i should have decked him goddamn it first they say he did it because he couldnt face the scandal now its because he wanted us to have a pile of money the hell with their dead money they didnt know him they dont know any of us anna let him rant let him prowl around the building looking for something to damage her heart was frozen in her chest suicide was suspected she thought numbly an investigation was in place and cam had known must have known all along that was a claim investigator from the company who holds your fathers life insurance policy that was a fucking moron cam whirled more oaths stinging his tongue then he saw her face set and entirely too cool its nothing just a hassle lets get out of here its suspected that your father committed suicide he didnt kill himself she held up a hand she had to keep the hurt buried for now and lead with the practical youve spoken with mackensie before and i assume you your lawyer at any rate has been in contact with the insurance company about this matter for some time phillips handling it you knew but you didnt tell me it has nothing to do with you no she realized it wasnt possible to keep all the hurt buried i see that was personal she reminded herself she would deal with that later and as to how it affects seth fury sprang up again clawed at his throat he doesnt know anything about it if you actually believe that youre deluding yourself gossip runs thick in small towns close communities and young boys hear a great deal it was the caseworker now cam thought with rising resentment she might as well be carrying her briefcase and wearing one of her dumpy suits gossips all it is it doesnt matter on the contrary gossip can be very damaging youd be wiser to be open with him to be honest though that seems to be difficult for you dont twist this around on me anna its goddamn insurance its nothing its your father she corrected his reputation i dont imagine theres much that means more to you she drew a deep breath but as you said its nothing to do with me on a personal level i think were finished here wait a minute he stepped in front of her blocking her exit he had the sinking feeling that if she walked she meant to walk a lot farther than his car why so you can explain its family business im not family youre absolutely right it amazed her that her voice was so calm so detached so utterly reasonable when she was boiling inside and i imagine you felt it best to hold the matter back from seths caseworker much wiser to show her only the positive angles lock up any negatives my father didnt kill himself i dont have to defend him to you or anyone no you dont and id never ask you to she stepped around him and started for the door he caught her before she reached it but shed expected that and turned calmly theres no point in arguing cam when essentially we agree theres no point in you being pissed off he shot back were handling the insurance company were handling the gossip about seth being his love child for christs sake what stunned she pressed a hand to her head theres speculation that seth is your fathers illegitimate son its nothing but bull and small minds cam replied my god have you considered even for a moment what it could do to seth to hear that kind of talk have you considered even for a moment that this was something i needed to know in order to evaluate in order to help seth properly his thumbs went into his pockets yeah i considered it and i didnt tell you because were handling it were talking about my father here were also talking about a minor child in your care he is in my care cam said evenly and thats the point im doing what i thought was best all around i didnt tell you about the insurance thing or about the gossip because theyre both lies perhaps they are but by not telling me you lied i wasnt going to go around feeding anybody this crap that the kid was my fathers bastard she nodded slowly well take it from some other mans bastard it doesnt make seth less of a person i didnt mean it like that he began and reached out for her but she stepped away dont do that he exploded with it and grabbed her arms dont back off from me for christs sake anna my life has turned inside out in the past couple of months and i dont know how long its going to be before i can turn it back around ive got the kid to worry about the business you mackensies coming around people are speculating about my fathers morals over the fresh fruit at the supermarket seths bitch of a mothers down in norfolk wait she didnt move away this time she yanked away seths mother has contacted you no no jesus his brain was on fire we hired a detective to track her down phillip figured wed be better off knowing where she is what shes up to i see her heart broke in two halves one for the woman one for the professional both sides bled and shes in norfolk but you didnt bother to tell me that either no i didnt tell you hed backed himself into this corner cam realized and there was no way out we only know she was there a couple of days ago social services would expect to be notified of this information he kept his eyes on hers nodded slowly i guess they just were my mistake there was a line between them now she realized very thick and very darkly drawn obviously you dont think very much of me or of yourself for that matter let me explain something to you however i may be feeling about you on a personal level at this moment its my professional opinion that you and your brothers are the right guardians for seth okay so i will have to take this information ive just learned into consideration she continued it will have to be documented all thats going to do is screw things up for the kid he hated the fact that his stomach clenched at the thought hated the idea that he might see that look of whitefaced fear on seths face again im not going to let some sick gossip mess things up for him well on that we can agree shed gotten her wish on one level anna realized shed been around to see how much seth would come to matter to him just long enough she thought hollowly its my professional opinion that seth is well cared for both physically and emotionally her voice was brisk now professional hes happy and is beginning to feel secure added to that is the fact that he loves you and you love him though neither one of you may fully realize it i still believe counseling would benefit all of you and that too will go into my report and recommendation when the court rules on permanent guardianship as i told you from the beginning my concern my primary concern is the best welfare of the child she was solidly behind them cam realized and would have been no matter what hed told her or hadnt told her guilt struck him a sharp backhanded blow i was never less than honest with you she said before he could speak damn it anna im not through she said coolly i have no doubt that youll see seth is well settled and that this new business is secure before as you put it you turn your life back around which i assume means picking up your racing career in europe youll have to find a way to juggle your needs but thats not my concern but there may come a time when the guardianship is contested if indeed seths mother makes her way back here at that time the case file will be reevaluated if he remains happy and well cared for under your guardianship ill do whatever i can to see to it that he remains with you im on his side which appears to put me on yours thats all shame layered onto guilt with a sprinkling of relief between anna i know how much youve done im grateful she shook her head when he lifted a hand im not feeling very friendly toward you at the moment i dont want to be touched fine i wont touch you lets find somewhere to sit down and talk the rest of this out i thought we just had now youre being stubborn no now im being realistic you slept with me but you didnt trust me the fact that i was honest with you and you werent with me is my problem the fact that i went to bed with a man who saw me as an enjoyment on one hand and an obstacle on the other is my mistake thats not the way it was his temper began to rise again pumped by a slick panic thats not the way it is its the way i see it now i need to take some time and see how i feel about that id appreciate it if youd drive me back to my car she turned and walked away he preferred fire to ice but he couldnt break through the frigid shield shed wrapped around her temper it scared him a sensation that he didnt appreciate she was perfectly polite even friendly to seth and phillip when she returned to the house to gather her things she was perfectly polite to cam so polite that he imagined he would feel the chill of it for days he told himself it didnt matter shed get over it she was just in a snit because he hadnt bared his soul shared all the intimate details of his life with her it was a woman thing after all women had invented the cold shoulder just to make men feel like slugs he would give her a couple of days he decided let her stew let her come to her senses then he would take her flowers shes ticked off at you seth commented as cam stood by the front door staring out what do you know shes ticked off seth repeated entertaining himself with his sketchbook while sitting crosslegged on the front porch she didnt let you kiss her goodbye and youre all the time locking lips shut up whatd you do i didnt do anything cam kicked the door open and stomped out shes just being female you did something seth eyed him owlishly shes not a jerk shell get over it cam dropped down into the rocker he wasnt going to worry about it he never worried about women he lost his appetite how was he supposed to eat fried fish without remembering how he and anna had sat on the dock that morning he couldnt sleep how was he supposed to sleep in his own bed without remembering how theyd made love on those same sheets he couldnt concentrate on work how was he supposed to detail diagonals without remembering how shed beamed at him when he showed her the lofting platform by midmorning he gave up and drove to princess anne but he didnt take her flowers now he was ticked off he strode through the reception area straight back into her office then fumed when he found it empty typical was all he could think his luck had turned all bad mr quinn marilou stood in the doorway her hands folded is there something i can do for you im looking for anna ms spinelli im sorry shes not available ill wait itll be a long one she wont be in until next week next week his narrowed eyes reminded marilou of steel sharpened to the killing point what do you mean she wont be in ms spinelli is taking the week off and marilou figured the reason for it was even now boring holes through her with furious gray eyes shed thought the same when anna had dropped off her report that morning and requested the time im familiar with the case file if theres something i can do no its personal where did she go i cant give you that information mr quinn but youre free to leave a message either a written one or one on her voice mail of course if she checks in ill be happy to tell her youd like to speak with her yeah thanks he couldnt get out fast enough she was probably in her apartment he decided as he hopped back in his car sulking so he would let her yell at him get it all out of her system then hed nudge her along to bed so they could put this ridiculous little episode behind them he ignored the nerves dancing in his stomach as he walked down the hall to her apartment he knocked briskly then tucked his hands into his pockets he knocked louder banged his fist on the door damn it anna open up this is stupid i saw your car out front the door behind him creaked open one of the sisters peered out the jingling sound of a morning game show filled the hallway she not in there annas young man her cars out front he said she took a cab he bit back an oath pasted on a charming smile and walked across the hall where to to the train station or maybe it was the airport she beamed up at him really he was such a handsome boy she said shed be gone for a few days she promised to call to make sure sister and i were getting on such a sweet girl thinking of us when shes on vacation vacation to did she say the woman bit her lip and her eyes unfocused in thought i dont think she mentioned it she was in an awful hurry but she stopped by just the same so we wouldnt be worried shes such a considerate girl yeah the sweet considerate girl had left him high and dry shed had no business flying to pittsburgh the airfare had eaten a large hole in her budget but shed wanted to get there had needed to get there the minute she walked into her grandparents cramped row house half her burden lifted anna louisa theresa spinelli was a tiny slim woman with steelgray hair ruthlessly waved a face that fell into dozens of comfortable wrinkles and a smile as wide as the mediterranean sea anna had to bend low to be clasped and kissed al al our bambinas home its good to be home nana alberto spinelli hurried to the door he was a foot taller than his wifes tidy fivethree with a broad chest and a spare tire that pressed cozily against anna as they embraced his hair was thin and white his eyes dark and merry behind his thick glasses he all but carried her into the living room where they could begin to fuss over her in earnest they spoke rapidly and in a mix of italian and english food was the first order of business theresa always thought her baby was starving after theyd plied her with minestrone and fresh bread and an enormous cube of tiramisu theresa was almost satisfied that her chick wouldnt perish of malnutrition now al sat back puffing to life one of his thick cigars youll tell us why youre here do i need a reason to come home struggling to relax fully anna stretched out in one of a pair of ancient wing chairs it had been recovered she knew countless times just now it was in a gay striped pattern but the cushion still gave way beneath her butt like butter you called three days ago you didnt say you were coming home it was an impulse ive been swamped at work up to my ears im tired and wanted a break i wanted to come home and eat nanas cooking for a while it was true enough if not the whole truth she didnt think it would be wise to tell her doting grandparents that shed walked into an affair eyes wide open and ended up with her heart broken you work too hard theresa said al dont i tell you the girl works too hard she likes to work hard she likes to use her brain its a good brain me ive got a good brain too and i say shes not here just to eat your manicotti are we having manicotti for dinner anna beamed knowing it wouldnt distract them for long theyd seen her through the worst stuck by her when shed done her best to hurt them and herself and they knew her i started the sauce the minute you called to say you were coming al dont nag the girl im not nagging im asking theresa rolled her eyes if you have such a good brain in that big head of yours youd know its a boy that sent her running home is he italian theresa demanded fixing anna with those bright bird eyes and she had to laugh god it was good to be home i have no idea but he loves my red sauce then hes got good taste why dont you bring him home let us get a look at him because were having some problems and i need to work them out work them out theresa waved a hand how do you work them out when youre here and hes not is he goodlooking gorgeous does he have work al wanted to know hes starting his own business with his brothers good he knows family theresa nodded pleased you bring him next time well see for ourselves all right she said because it was easier to agree than to explain im going to go unpack hes hurt her heart theresa murmured when anna left the room al reached over and patted her hand its a strong heart anna took her time hanging her clothes in the closet folding them into the drawers of the old dresser shed used as a child the room was so much the same the wallpaper had faded a bit she remembered that her grandfather had hung it himself to brighten the room when shed come to live with them and shed hated the pretty roses on the wall because they looked so fresh and alive and everything inside her was dead but the roses were still there a little older but still there as were her grandparents she sat on the bed hearing the familiar creak of springs the familiar the comforting the secure that she admitted was what she wanted home children routine with the surprises that family always provided thrown in to some she supposed it would have sounded ordinary at one time she had told herself the same thing but she knew better now home marriage family there was nothing ordinary there the three elements formed a unit that was unique and precious she wanted needed that for herself maybe she had been playing games after all maybe she hadnt been completely honest not with cam and not with herself she hadnt tried to trap him into her dreams but underneath it all hadnt she begun to hope hed share them shed maintained a front of casual nostrings sex but her heart had been reckless enough to yearn for more maybe she deserved to have it broken the hell she did she thought springing up shed been making it enough shed accepted the limitations of their relationship and still he hadnt trusted her that she wouldnt tolerate damned if shed take the blame for this she decided and stalking to the streaked mirror over her dresser she began to freshen her makeup she would have what she wanted one day a strong man who loved her respected her and trusted her she would have a man who saw her as a partner not as the enemy shed have that home in the country near the water and children of her own and a goddamn stupid dog if she wanted she would have it all it just wouldnt be with cameron quinn if anything she should thank him for opening her eyes not only to the flaws in their socalled relationship but to her own needs and desires she would rather choke chapter twenty contents prev a week could be a long time cam discovered particularly when you had a great deal stuck in your craw that you couldnt spit out it helped that hed been able to pick fights with both phillip and ethan but it wasnt quite the same as having a showdown with anna it helped too that beginning work on the hull of the boat took so much of his time and concentration he couldnt afford to think about her when he was planking he thought of her anyway hed had a few bad moments imagining her running around on some caribbean beach in that little bikini and having some overmuscled overtanned type rubbing sunscreen on her back and buying her mai tais then hed told himself that shed gone off somewhere to lick her imaginary wounds and was probably in some hotel room drapes drawn sniffing into a hankie but that image didnt make him feel any better when he got home from a full saturday at the boatyard he was ready for a beer maybe two he and ethan headed straight for the refrigerator and had already popped tops when phillip came in seth isnt with you over at dannys cam guzzled from the bottle to wash the sawdust out of his throat sandys dropping him off later good phillip got a beer for himself sit down what i got a letter from the insurance company this morning phillip pulled out a chair the gist is theyre stalling they used a bunch of legal terms cited clauses but the upshot is theyre casting doubt on cause of death and are continuing to investigate fuck that cheapscate bastards just dont want to shell out annoyed cam kicked out a chair and wished with all his heart it had been mackensie i talked to our lawyer phil continued grimacing he may start rethinking our friendship if i keep calling him on weekends he says we have some choices we can sit tight let the insurance company continue its investigation or we can file suit against them for nonpayment of claim let them keep their fucking money i dont want it anyway no ethan spoke quietly in the echo of cams outburst he continued to brood into his beer shaking his head its not right dad paid the premiums year after year he added to the policy for seth its not right that they dont pay and if they dont pay its going to go down somewhere that he killed himself thats not right either theyve been doing all the pushing up to now he added and raised his somber eyes lets push back if it ends up going to court phillip warned him it could get messy so we turn away from a fight because it could get messy for the first time amusement flickered over ethans face well fuck that cam cam sipped again ive been wanting a good fight for a while i guess this is it then were agreed well have the papers drawn up next week and well go after their asses revved and ready phillip lifted his bottle heres to a good fight heres to winning cam corrected im for that its going to cost us some phillip added filing fees legal fees most of the capital weve pooled is sunk into the business he blew out a breath i guess we need another pool with less regret than hed expected cam thought of his beloved porsche waiting patiently for him in nice just a car he told himself just a damn car i can get my hands on some fresh cash itll take a couple of days i can sell my house ethan shrugged his shoulders ive had some people asking about it and its just sitting there no the thought of it twisted in cams gut youre not selling your house rent it out well get through this ive got some stocks phillip sighed and waved goodbye to a chunk of his growing portfolio ill tell my broker to cash them in well open a joint account next week the quinn legal defense fund the three of them managed weak smiles the kid ought to know ethan said after a moment if were going to take this to the wall he ought to know whats going on cam looked up in time to see both of his brothers eyes focus on him oh come on why does it have to be me youre the oldest phillip grinned at him besides itll take your mind off anna im not brooding about her or any woman been edgy and broody all week ethan mumbled making me nuts who asked you we had a little disagreement thats all im giving her time to simmer down seems to me shed simmered down to frozen the last time i saw her phillip examined his beer that was a week ago its my business how i handle a woman sure is but let me know when youre done with her will you shes phillip broke off when cam all but leaped over the table and grabbed him by the throat beer bottles flew and shattered on the floor resigned ethan raked his hand through his hair scattering drops of spilled beer cam and phillip were on the floor pounding hell out of each other he got himself a fresh beer before filling a pitcher with cold water his work boots crunched over broken glass which he kicked out of the way in hopes that he wouldnt have to run anybody to the hospital for stitches with malice toward neither he emptied the pitcher on both his brothers it got their attention phillips lip was split cams ribs throbbed and both of them were bleeding from rolling around on broken glass drenched and panting they eyed each other warily gingerly phillip wiped a knuckle over his bloody lip sorry bad joke i didnt know things were serious between you i never said they were serious phillip laughed then winced as his lip wept brother did you ever i guess i never figured youd be the first of us to fall in love with a woman the stomach that phillips fists had abused jittered wildly who said im in love with her you didnt punch me in the face because youre in like he looked down at his pleated slacks shit do you know how hard it is to get bloodstains out of a cotton blend he rose held out a hand to cam shes a terrific lady he said as he hauled cam to his feet hope you work it out i dont have to work out anything cam said desperately youre way off here if you say so im going to get cleaned up he headed out limping only a little i aint mopping the damn floor ethan stated because your glands got in an uproar he started it cam muttered not caring how ridiculous it sounded no i figure you did with whatever you did to piss anna off ethan opened the broom closet took out a mop and tossed it to cam now i guess you got to clean it up he slipped out the back door the two of you think you know so goddamn much furious he kicked a chair over on his way to fetch a bucket i ought to know whats going on in my own life insanity thats what i should be in australia propping for the race of my life thats where i should be he dragged the mop through water beer glass and blood muttering to himself australias just where id be if i had any sense left damn womans complicating things better off just cutting loose there he kicked over another chair because it felt good then shook shards of glass from the mop into the bucket who had a fight seth wanted to know cam turned and narrowed his eyes at the boy standing in the doorway i kicked phillips ass what for because i wanted to with a nod seth walked around the puddle and got a pepsi out of the fridge if you kicked his ass how come youre bleeding maybe i like to bleed he finished mopping up while the boy stood watching him whats your problem cam demanded i got no problem cam shoved the bucket aside with his foot the least phillip could do was empty it somewhere he went to the sink and badtemperedly picked glass out of his arm then he got out the whiskey righted a chair and sat down with the bottle and a glass he saw seths eyes slide over the bottle and away deliberately cam poured two fingers of johnnie walker into a glass not everybody who drinks gets drunk he said not everybody who gets drunk as i may decide to do knocks kids around dont know why anybody drinks that shit anyway cam knocked back the whiskey because were weak and stupid and it feels good at the time are you going to australia cam poured another shot doesnt look like it i dont care if you go i dont care where the hell you go the underlying fury in the boys voice surprised them both flushing seth turned and raced out the door well hell cam thought and shoved the whiskey aside he pushed away from the table and hit the door as seth streaked across the yard to the woods hold it when that didnt slow the boy down cam put some mean into it goddamn it i said hold it this time seth skidded to a halt when he turned around they stared at each other across the expanse of grass temper and nerves vibrating from them in all but visible waves get your butt back over here now he came fists clenched chin jutting out they both knew he had nowhere to run i dont need you oh the hell you dont i ought to kick your ass for being stupid everybody says youve got some genius brain in there but if you ask me youre dumb as dirt now sit down there he added jabbing a finger at the steps and if you dont do what i tell you when i tell you i might just kick your ass after all you dont scare me seth said but he sat i scare you white and that gives me the hammer cam sat as well watched the puppy come crawling toward them on his belly and i scare little dogs too he thought in disgust im not going anywhere he began i said i dont care fine but im telling you anyway i figured i would once everything settled down i told myself i would i guess i needed to never figured on coming back here to stay then why dont you go cam gave him a halfhearted boot on the top of his head with the heel of one hand why dont you shut up until i say what i have to say the painless smack and impatient order were more comforting to seth than a thousand promises ive been coming to the fact that ive been running long enough i liked what i was doing while i was doing it but i guess im pretty well finished with it it looks like ive got a place here and a business here maybe a woman here he murmured thinking of anna so youre staying to work and poke at a girl those are damn good reasons for hanging in one place then theres

immensely cheered seth snickered youre uglier im bigger im entitled so i guess ill hang around to see if you get any prettier as time goes on i didnt really want you to go seth said under his breath after a long moment it was the closest he could get to speaking his heart i know cam sighed now that weve got that settled weve got this other thing nothing to worry about its just some legal bullshit phil and the lawyerll handle most of it but there might be some talk you shouldnt pay any attention to it if you hear it what kind of talk some people some idiots think dad aimed for that pole killed himself yeah and now this asshole from the insurance companys asking questions cam hissed out a breath he knew he should probably tell the kid not to call adults assholes but there were bigger issues here you knew that sure it goes around he talked to danny and wills mother danny said she gave him an earful she didnt like some guy coming around asking questions about ray that butthead chuck up at the dairy queen told the detective guy that ray was screwing around with his students then had a crisis of conscience and killed himself crisis of conscience jesus where did the kid come up with this stuff chuck kimball he always was a butthead word is he got caught cheating on a lit exam and got booted out of college and it seems to me phillip beat the crap out of him once cant remember why

me he was my father but another time she said this other guy was and once when she was really loaded she said my old man was some guy named keith richards cam couldnt help it the laugh just popped out jesus now shes hitting on the stones who ill see to your music education later i dont know if ray was my father seth looked up shes a liar so i dont go with anything she said but he took me i know he gave her money a lot of it i dont know if hed have told me if he was he said there were things we had to talk about but he had stuff to work out first i know you dont want him to be it couldnt matter cam realized not anymore do you want him to be he was decent the boy said so simply that cam draped an arm around his shoulders and seth leaned against him yeah he was everything had changed everything was different and he was desperate to tell her cam knew his life had turned on its axis yet again and somehow hed ended up exactly where he needed to be the only thing missing was anna he took a chance and drove to her apartment it was saturday night he thought she was due back at work on monday she was a practical woman and would want to take sunday to catch up sort her laundry answer her mail whatever if she wasnt home he was going to by god sit on her doorstep until she got there but when she answered his knock and stood there looking so fresh so gorgeous he was caught off balance anna on the other hand had prepared for this meeting all week she knew exactly how she would handle it cam this is a surprise you just caught me caught you he said stupidly yes but ive got a few minutes would you like to come in yeah i where the hell have you been she lifted her brows excuse me you took off out of the blue i wouldnt say that i arranged leave from work checked in with my neighbors had my plants watered while i was gone i was hardly abducted by aliens i simply took a few days of personal time do you want some coffee no okay he thought she was going to keep playing it cool he could do that i want to talk to you thats good because i want to talk to you too hows seth hes fine really we got a lot of things ironed out just today what have you done to your arm impatient he glanced down at the raw nicks and scrapes nothing its nothing listen anna why dont you sit down id really like to apologize if i was hard on you last weekend apologize well that was more like it willing to be forgiving he sat on the sofa why dont we just forget it ive got a lot to tell you id really like to clear this up smiling pleasantly she sat across from him i suppose we were both in a difficult position a great deal of that was my fault becoming involved with you was a calculated risk but i was attracted and didnt weigh the potential problems as carefully as i should have obviously something like last weekends disagreement was bound to happen and as we both have seths interests at heart and will continue to i would hate for us to be at odds good then we wont he reached for her hand but she evaded his gesture and merely patted his now that thats settled you really have to excuse me i hate to rush you along cam but i have a date a what a date she glanced at the watch on her wrist shortly as it happens and i have to change very slowly he got to his feet you have a date tonight what the hell is that supposed to mean what it generally does she blinked twice as if confused then let her eyes fill with apology oh im sorry i thought we both understood that wed ended the well the more personal aspect of our relationship i assumed it was clear that it wasnt working out for either of us it felt as though someone had blown past his guard and rammed an iron fist into his solar plexus look if youre still pissed off do i look pissed off she asked coolly no he stared at her shaking his head while his stomach did a quick pitch and roll no you dont youre dumping me dont be melodramatic were simply ending an affair that both of us entered freely and without promises or expectations it was good while it lasted really good id hate to spoil that now as far as our professional relationship goes ive told you that ill do all i can to support your permanent guardianship of seth however i do expect you to be more forthcoming with information from now on ill also be happy to consult with you or advise you on any area of that guardianship you and your brothers are doing a marvelous job with him he waited certain there would be more thats it i cant think of anything else and i am a little pressed for time youre pressed for time shed just stabbed him dead center of the heart and she was pressed for time thats too damn bad because im not finished im sorry if your egos bruised yeah my egos bruised i got a lot of bruises right now how the hell can you stand there and brush me off after what we had together we had great sex im not denying it were just not going to have it any longer sex he grabbed her arms and shook her and had the small satisfaction of seeing a flash of anger heat through the chill in her eyes thats all it was for you thats what it was for both of us it wasnt going the way shed planned shed expected him to be angry and storm out or to be relieved that shed backed away first and walk away whistling but he wasnt supposed to confront her like this let go of me the hell i will ive been half crazy for you to get back you turned my life upside down and ill be damned if youll just stroll away because youre through with me were through with each other i dont want you anymore and its your bad luck i said it first now take your hands off

and im not going to keep heading there no matter how i feel about you how do you feel about me tired of you she shouted tired of me tired of us sick and tired of telling myself fun and games could be enough well its not not nearly and i want you out he felt the temper and panic that had gripped him ease back into delight youre in love with me arent you hed never seen a woman go from simmer to boil so fast and seeing it he wondered why it had taken him so long to realize he adored her she whirled grabbed a lamp and hurled it he gave her credit for aim and gave thanks that he was light on his feet as the base whistled by his head before it crashed into the wall you arrogant conceited coldblooded son of a bitch she grabbed a vase now a new one shed bought on the way home to cheer herself up she let it fly jesus anna it was admiration pure and simple that burst through him as he was forced to catch the vase before it smashed into his face you must be nuts about me i despise you she looked frantically for something else to throw at him and snagged a bowl of fruit off the kitchen counter the fruit went first apples loathe you pears hate you bananas i cant believe i ever let you touch me then the bowl but she was more clever this time feinted first then heaved in the direction of his dodge the stoneware caught him just above the ear and had stars spinning in front of his eyes okay game over he made a dive for her caught her around the waist his already abused body suffered from kicks and punches but he hauled her to the couch and held her down get ahold of yourself before you kill me i want to kill you she said between gritted teeth believe me i get the picture you dont get anything she bucked under him and sent his system into a tangled mess of lust and laughter sensing both she reared up and bit him hard ouch goddamn it okay thats it he dragged her up and threw her over his shoulder you still packed tells me shes got a damn date like hell she does tells me were finished what bullshit he marched her into the bedroom saw her bag on the bed and grabbed it what are you doing put me down put that down im not letting loose of either until were in vegas vegas las

held her arms were getting married and thats the end of it you can just her body sagged and her head reeled married the word finally pierced her temper you dont want to get married believe me ive been rethinking the idea since you beaned me with the fruit bowl now are you going to come along reasonably or do i have to sedate you please let me go anna he lowered his brow to hers dont ask me to do that because i dont think i can live without you take a chance roll the dice come with me youre angry and youre hurt she said shakily and you think rushing off to vegas to have some wild plasticcoated instant marriage is going to fix everything he framed her face gently now tears were shimmering in her eyes and he knew hed be on his knees if she let them spill over you cant tell me you dont love me i wont believe you oh im in love with you cam but ill survive it there are things i need i had to be honest with myself and admit that you broke my heart i know he pressed his lips to her forehead i know i did i was shortsighted i was selfish i was stupid and damn it i was scared of me of you of everything that was going on around me i messed it up and now you dont want to give me another chance its not a matter of chances its a matter of being practical enough to admit that we want different things i finally figured out today what it is i want tell me what you want i want a home he had one for her he thought i want marriage hadnt he just asked her i want children how many her tears dried up and she shoved at him it isnt a joke im not joking i was thinking two with an option for three his mouth quirked at the look of blankeyed shock on her face there now youre getting scared because youre beginning to realize im serious you youre going back to rome or wherever as soon as you can we can go to rome or wherever on our honeymoon were not taking the kid i draw the line there i might like to get in a couple of races from time to time just to keep my hand in but basically im in the boat building business of course it might go bellyup then youd be stuck with a househusband who really hates housework she wanted to press her fingers to her temples but he still had her by the arms i cant think good just listen you cut a hole in me when you left anna i wouldnt admit it but it was there big and empty he rested his brow on hers for a moment you know what i did today i worked on building a boat and it felt good i came home the only home ive ever had and it felt right had a family meeting and decided that wed take on the insurance company and do whats right for our father by the way ive been talking to him she couldnt stop staring at him even though her head was reeling what who my father had some conversations with him three of them since he died he looks good her breath was clogged right at the base of her throat cam yeah yeah he said with a quick grin i need counseling we can talk about that later didnt mean to get off the track i was telling you what i did today right very slowly she nodded yes okay after the meeting phil made some smart remark so i punched him and we beat on each other for a bit that felt good too then i talked to seth about the things i should have talked to him about before and i listened to him the way i should have listened before then we just sat for a while that felt good anna and it felt right her lips curved im glad theres more i knew when i was sitting there that that was where i wanted to be needed to be only one thing was missing and that was you so i came to find you and take you back he pressed his lips gently to her forehead to take you home anna i think i want to sit down no i want your knees weak when i tell you i love you are you ready oh god ive been real careful never to tell a woman i loved her except my mother i didnt tell her often enough take a chance on me anna and ill tell you as often as you can stand hearing it she hitched in a breath im not getting married in vegas spoilsport he watched her lips bow up before he closed his over them and the taste of her soothed every ache in his body and soul god i missed you dont go away again it brought you to your senses she wrapped her arms tight around him and it felt good she thought giddily it felt right oh cam i want to hear it right now i love you it feels so damn perfect loving you i cant believe i wasted so much time less than three months she reminded him too much time but well make it up i want you to take me home she murmured after he eased back cocked his head after what then he made her laugh by lifting her into his arms he picked his way through the wreckage kicked a very sadlooking banana out of the way you know i cant figure out why i used to think marriage would be boring ours wont be she kissed his bruised head it was still bleeding a little promise turn the page for a preview of rising tides nora robertss trilogy continues with a captivating new novel about the lives and loves of three brothers months after their fathers death ethan quinn and his brothers were settled into the family home on chesapeake bay but something kept ethan from working through his grief people were talking about the late mighty quinn and his young son seth to honor the memory of the greatest man he ever knew ethan must clear his fathers name once and for all got us some nice peelers here capn jim bodine culled crabs from the pot tossing the marketable catch in the tank he didnt mind the snapping claws and had the scars on his thick hands to prove it he wore the traditional gloves of his profession but as any waterman could tell you they wore out quick and if there was a hole in them by god a crab would find it he worked steadily his legs braced apart for balance on the rocking boat his dark eyes squinting in a face weathered with age and sun and living he might have been taken for fifty or eighty and jim didnt much care which end you stuck him in he always called ethan capn and rarely said more than one declarative sentence at a time ethan altered course toward the next pot his right hand nudging the steering stick most watermen used rather than a wheel at the same time he nudged the throttle and gear levels with his left hand there were constant small adjustments to be made with every foot of progress up the line of traps the chesapeake bay could be generous when she chose but she liked to be tricky and make you work for it ethan knew the bay as well as he knew himself often he thought he knew it better the fickle moods and movements of the continents largest estuary for two hundred miles it flowed from north to south yet it measured only four miles across where it brushed by annapolis and thirty at the mouth of the potomac river st christopher sat snug on marylands southeastern shore depending on its generosity cursing its caprices ethans waters his home waters were edged with marshland strung with flatland rivers with sharp shoulders that shimmered through thickets of gum and oak it was a world of tidal creeks and sudden shallows where wild celery and widgeongrass rooted it had become his world with its changing seasons sudden storms and always always the sounds and scents of the water timing it ethan grabbed his gaffing pole and in a practiced motion as smooth as a dance hooked the pot line and drew it into the pot puller in seconds the pot rose out of the water streaming with weeds and pieces of old bait and crowded with crabs he saw the brightred pinchers of the fullgrown females or sooks and the scowling eyes of jimmies right smart bunch of crabs was all jim had to say as he went to work heaving the pot onboard as if it weighed ounces rather than pounds the water was rough today and ethan could smell a storm coming in he worked the controls with his knees when he needed his hands for other work and he eyed the clouds beginning to boil together in the far western sky time enough he judged to move down the line of traps in the gut of the bay and see how many more crabs had crawled into the pots he knew jim was hurting some for cash and he needed all he could come by himself in order to keep afloat the fledgling boat building business he and his brothers had started time enough he thought again as jim rebaited a pot with thawing fish parts and tossed it overboard in leapfrog fashion ethan gaffed the next buoy ethans sleek chesapeake bay retriever simon stood with his front paws on the gunwhale tongue lolling like his master he was rarely happier than when out on the water the men worked in tandem and in near silence communicating with grunts shrugs and the occasional oath the work was a comfort since the crabs were plentiful there were years when they werent years when it seemed the winter had killed them off or that the waters would never warm enough to tempt them to swim in those years the waterman suffered unless he had another source of income ethan intended to have one building boats the first boat by quinn was nearly finished and a little beauty it was ethan thought cameron had another client on the line some rich guy from cams racing days so they would start another before long ethan never doubted that his brother would reel the money in theyd do it he told himself however doubtful and full of complaints philip was he glanced up at the sun and the clouds sailing slowly steadily eastward and gauged the time well take them in jim theyd been eight hours on the water a short day but jim didnt complain he knew it wasnt so much the oncoming storm that had ethan piloting the boat back up the gut boys home from school by now he said yeah and though seth was selfsufficient enough to stay home alone for a time in the afternoon ethan didnt like to dare fate a boy of ten with seths temperament was a magnet for trouble when cam returned from europe in a couple weeks theyd juggle seth between them but for now the boy was ethans responsibility the water in the bay kicked turning gunmetalgray now to mirror the sky but neither the men nor the dog worried about the rocky ride as the boat crept up the steep fronts of the waves then slid back down in the troughs simon stood at the bow now head lifted the wind blowing his ears back grinning his doggie grin ethan had built the workboat himself and knew she would do as confident as the dog jim moved to the protection of the awning and cupped his hands to light a cigarette the waterfront of st chris was alive with tourists the early days of june lured them out of the city tempted them to drive from the suburbs of dc and baltimore he imagined they thought of the little town of st christophers as quaint with its narrow streets clapboard houses and tiny shops they liked to watch the crab pickers fingers fly and eat the flaky crab cakes or tell their friends theyd had a bowl of shecrab soup they stayed in the bedandbreakfasts st chris was the proud home of no less than four and they spent their money in the restaurants and gift shops ethan didnt mind them during the times when the bay was stingy tourism kept the town alive and he thought there would come a time when some of those same tourists might decide having a hand built wooden sailboat was their hearts desire the wind picked up as ethan moored at the dock jim jumped nimbly out to secure lines his short legs and squat body giving him the look of a leaping frog wearing white rubber boots and a greasesmeared gimme cap at ethans careless hand signal simon plopped his butt down and stayed in the boat as the men worked to unload the days catch the wind made the boats sunfaded green awning dance ethan watched pete monroe walk toward them irongray hair crushed under a battered billed hat stocky body outfitted in baggy khakis and a redchecked shirt good catch today ethan ethan smiled he liked mr monroe well enough though the man had a bonedeep stingy streak he ran monroes crab house with a tightly closed fist but as far as ethan could tell every mans son who ran a picking plant complained about profits ethan pushed his own cap back scratched the nape of his neck where sweat and damp hair tickled good enough youre in early today storms coming monroe nodded already his crab pickers who worked under the shade of striped awnings were preparing to move inside rain would drive the tourists inside as well he knew to drink coffee or eat ice cream sundaes since he was half owner of the bayside cafe he didnt mind looks like you got about seventy bushels there ethan let his smile widen some might have said there was a hint of the pirate in the look ethan wouldnt have been insulted but hed have been surprised closer to ninety id say he knew the market price to the penny but understood they would as always negotiate he took out his negotiating cigar lit it and got to work the first fat drops of rain began to fall as ethan motored toward home he figured hed gotten a fair price for his crabs his eightyseven bushels of crabs if the rest of the summer was as good he was going to consider dropping another hundred pots next year maybe hiring on a parttime crew oystering wasnt what it had been on the bay not since parasites had killed off so many that made the winters hard a few good crabbing seasons were what he needed to dump the lions share of the profits into the new business and to help pay the lawyers fee his mouth tightened at that thought as he rode out the swells toward home they shouldnt need a damn lawyer they shouldnt have to pay some slick suited talker to clear their fathers good name it wouldnt stop the whispers around town anyway those would only stop when people found some thing juicier to chew on than ray quinns life and death and the boy ethan mused staring out over the water that trembled under the steady pelting of rain there were some who liked to whisper about the boy who looked back at them with ray quinns darkblue eyes he didnt mind for himself as far as ethan was concerned they could wag their tongues about him until they fell out of their flapping mouths but he minded deeply that anyone would speak a dark word about the man hed loved with every beat of his heart so he would work his fingers numb to pay the lawyer and he would do whatever it took to guard the child thunder shook the sky booming off the water like cannon fire the light went dim as dusk and those dark clouds burst wide to pour out solid sheets of rain still he didnt hurry as he docked at his home pier a little more wet to his mind wouldnt kill him as if in agreement with the sentiment simon leaped out to swim to shore while ethan secured the lines he gathered up his lunch pail and with his watermans boots thwacking wetly against the dock he headed for home ethan removed the boots on the back porch his mother had scalded his skin about tracking mud often enough in his youth for the habit to stick to the man still he didnt think anything of letting the wet dog nose in the door ahead of him until he saw the gleaming floor and counters shit was all he could think as he studied the paw prints and heard simons happy bark of greeting there was a squeal more barking then laughter youre soaking wet the female voice was low and smooth and amused it was also very firm and made ethan wince in guilt out simon out you go you just dry off on the front porch there was another squeal baby giggles and the accompanying laughter of a young boy the gangs all here ethan thought rubbing rain from his hair the minute he heard footsteps heading in his direction he made a beeline for the broom closet and a mop he didnt often move fast but he could when he had to oh ethan grace monroe stood with her hands on her narrow hips looking from him to the paw prints on her justwaxed floor ill get it sorry he could see that the mop was still damp and decided it was best not to look at her directly wasnt thinking he muttered filling a bucket at the sink didnt know you were coming by today oh so you let wet dogs run through the house and dirty up the floors when im not coming by he jerked a shoulder floor was dirty when i left this morning didnt figure a little wet would hurt it any then he relaxed a little it always seemed to take him a few minutes to relax around grace these days but if id known you were here to skin me over it id have left him on the porch he was grinning when he turned and made her sigh oh give me the mop ill do it nope my dog my mess i heard aubrey absently grace leaned on the doorjamb she was tired but she often was shed put in eight hours that day too and she would put in another four at shineys pub that night serving drinks there were nights when she crawled into bed that she would have sworn she heard her feet crying seths minding her for me i had to switch my days mrs lynley called this morning and asked if id shift doing her house till tomorrow because her motherinlaw called her from dc and invited herself down to dinner mrs lynley claims her motherinlaw is a woman who looks at a speck of dust like its a sin against god and man i didnt think youd mind if i did yall today instead of tomorrow you fit us in whenever you can manage it grace and were grateful he was watching her from under his lashes as he mopped hed always thought she was a pretty thing like a palomino all gold and longlegged she chopped her hair off short as a boys but he liked the way it sat on her head like a shiny cap with fringes she was as thin as one of those milliondollar models but he knew graces long lean form wasnt for fashion shed been a gangly skinny kid as he recalled shed have been about seven or eight when hed first come to st chris and the quinns he supposed she was twenty and a couple now and skinny wasnt exactly the word for her she was like a willow slip he thought and then very nearly flushed she smiled at him and her mermaidgreen eyes warmed faint dimples flirted in her cheeks for reasons she couldnt name seeing such a healthy male specimen wielding a mop entertained her did you have a good day ethan good enough he did a thorough job with the floor he was a thorough man then he went to the sink again to rinse bucket and mop sold a mess of crabs to your daddy at the mention of her father graces smile dimmed a little there was distance between them and had been since shed become pregnant with aubrey and had married jack casey the man her father had called that noaccount grease monkey from upstate her father had turned out to be right about jack the man had left her high and dry a month before aubrey had been born and hed taken her savings her car and most of her selfrespect with him but shed gotten through it grace reminded herself and she was doing just fine shed keep right on doing fine on her own without a single penny from her family if she had to work herself to death to prove it she heard aubrey laugh again a long rolling gut laugh and her resentment vanished she had everything that mattered it was all tied up in a brighteyed curly headed little angel just in the next room ill make you up some dinner before i go ethan turned back took another look at her she was getting some sun and it looked good on her warmed her skin she had a long face that went well with her long body though the chin tended to be stubborn a man could take a glance and hed see a long cool blonde a pretty body a face that made you want to glance back just a little longer and if you did youd see shadows under the big green eyes and weariness around that soft mouth you dont have to do that grace you ought to go on home and relax a while youre on at shineys tonight arent you ive got time and i promised seth sloppy joes it wont take me long she shifted as ethan continued to stare at her shed long ago accepted that those long thoughtful looks from him would stir her blood just another of lifes little problems she supposed what she demanded and rubbed a hand over her cheek as if expecting to find a smudge nothing well if youre going to cook you ought to hang around and help us eat it id like that she relaxed again and moved forward to take the bucket and mop from him and put them away herself aubrey loves being here with you and seth why dont you go on in with them ive got some laundry to finish up then ill start dinner ill give you a hand no you wont it was another point of pride for her they paid her she did the work all the work go on in the front room and be sure to ask seth about the math test he got back today howd he do another a she winked and shooed ethan away seth had such a sharp brain she thought as she headed into the laundry room off the kitchen if shed had a better head for figures for practical matters when shed been younger she wouldnt have dreamed her way through school shed have learned a skill a real one not just serving drinks and tending house or picking crabs shed have had a career to fall back on when shed found herself alone and pregnant with all her hopes of running off to new york to be a dancer dashed like glass on brick it had been a silly dream anyway she told herself unloading the dryer and shifting the wet clothes from the washer into it pie in the sky her mama would say but the fact was growing up there had only been two things shed wanted the dance and ethan quinn
