 chapter one a journey for tom ripley tom looked behind him and saw the man coming out of the green cage he walked faster there was no doubt the man was following him tom had noticed him five minutes ago staring at him from a table tom had paid for his drink in a hurry and left at the corner tom leaned forward and ran across fifth avenue there was raouls should he take a chance and go in for another drink or should he run over to park avenue and try to escape by hiding in dark doorways he went into raouls as he walked up to an empty seat at the bar he looked around to see if he knew anyone there was that big man with red hair whose name he always forgot sitting at a table with a blonde girl but who was that man outside was that the kind of man they would send after him he didnt look like a police officer or a detective he looked like a businessman someones father welldressed with gray hair was that the kind of man they sent on a job like this he would chat with you in a bar and then bang one hand on the shoulder and the other hand holding a policemans identification tom ripley youre under arrest tom watched the door here he was coming inside taking a place at the bar tom stared at him they couldnt give you more than ten years tom thought maybe fifteen but with good behavior as the man started to speak tom suffered a moment of desperate regret why was he pretending to work for the income tax office yes he received checks for hundreds of dollars from stupid people who believed him when he said they owed money but he never cashed the checks it was really just a silly game that made him feel powerful pardon me are you tom ripley yes my name is herbert greenleaf richard greenleafs father the look on his face would have been less confusing if he had been holding a gun the face was friendly smiling and hopeful youre a friend of richards arent you tom searched his memory dickie greenleaf a tall blond guy he had quite a lot of money tom remembered oh dickie greenleaf yes charles and marta schriever told me about you i know so few of richards friends but they seemed to think you know him quite well somebody told them you drank at the green cage i remember him yes but youre not writing him now mr greenleaf seemed disappointed no i dont think ive seen dickie in a couple of years hes been in europe for two years the schrievers thought you might have some influence on richard we want him to come home tom hadht seen the schrievers more than three or four times in his life he had once calculated charley schrievers income tax and saved him a lot of money maybe that was why the schrievers had recommended him maybe charley had said that tom was intelligent honest and very willing to help it was a slight mistake i dont suppose you know anybody else close to richard who might be able to persuade him mr greenleaf asked id certainly like to help where is he staying in europe tom asked not caring at all where dickie was staying in a town called mongibello south of naples he divides his time between painting and sailing he bought a house richard has his own income not a large amount but enough to live on in italy it seems tom thought dickie was probably having a great time over there an income a house a boat why should he want to come home dickie was lucky what was tom doing living from week to week hiding from the police now for the first time in his life he had a talent for mathematics why didnt someone pay him for it tom realized that his whole body had tensed he was bored bored bored he wanted to be at the bar by himself id be very happy to write to dickie if you give me his address i suppose hell remember me we were at a weekend party out on long island once i remember and i came up to your apartment a few times too tom went on he showed me some of his models of ships did he ever show you his drawings mr greenleaf was smiling again dickie hadnt but tom said brightly yes of course he did interesting some of them tom had never seen them but he could imagine them now and he could see dickie holding them up for him to see yes richard has talent mr greenleaf said with satisfaction i think he has tom agreed he was getting more bored every minute he knew the feelings he experienced them at parties or when he was having dinner with somebody he didnt want to be with im sorry im not free now or id go over and try to persuade richard myself tom said just because mr greenleaf wanted him to richard has always listened to his friends advice if you or somebody else could find the time id even send them over to talk to him i dont suppose you could get time off from your present job could you toms heart suddenly jumped he put a look of careful thought on his face he didnt have a job he might have to leave town soon anyway if the police started asking questions he wanted to leave new york i might he said carefully id be glad to pay for your trip do you really think you might be able to go this fall i think i might id be glad to see richard again especially if you think i might be able to help i do i think hed listen to you youll probably succeed where the rest of us have failed why dont you come over to my house and meet my wife wed be so happy if you would go to europe and bring richard back hello tom my boy mr greenleaf said in a voice that promised good drinks an excellent dinner and a bed for the night in case he got too tired to go home emily this is tom ripley im so happy to meet you his wife said warmly how do you do mrs greenleaf mr ripleys been here before mr greenleaf said hes come here with richard oh has he i dont believe i met you though about thirty minutes later they went into the diningroom where a table was set for three with a dark blue tablecloth and a whole cold chicken the conversation was dull and the dinner delicious tom told mrs greenleaf that he was working for an advertising company called rothenberg fleming and barter later on purpose he called it reddington fleming and parker the greenleafs didnt notice the difference where did you go to college mr greenleaf asked i went to princeton for a time then when i visited an aunt in denver i stayed out there and went to college tom hoped mr greenleaf would ask him something about princeton but he didnt tom could discuss the teaching system the college rules the atmosphere at weekend dances and the political beliefs of the students he had been very friendly with a princeton student last summer and had asked him for more and more information in case he might be able to use it some time tom had also met a young man who had been going to the university of colorado he had told the greenleafs that he had been raised by his aunt dottie in boston in truth though she had taken him to denver when he was sixteen and he had only finished high school there but he felt like he had gone to school there as well after tom had finished high school they had moved back to boston again mrs greenleaf came in with some photographs and tom sat down beside her as she looked through them richard taking his first step richard with long blond curls the photographs werent interesting to him until richard was about sixteen richard had hardly changed between sixteen and twentyfour mrs greenleaf handed tom several photos these are from europe this is mongibello she said showing tom a picture of dickie in a boat on the sand and heres the girl the only other american who lives there marge sherwood mr greenleaf said the girl was in a swimsuit on the beach her arms around her knees there was also a good picture of richard in shorts sitting on the wall of a terrace tom noticed that mrs greenleaf was staring down at the floor in front of her he saw tears in her eyes mr greenleaf had told him that mrs greenleaf was seriously ill and got emotional very easily she was worried she would never see dickie again her husband came over to comfort her mrs greenleaf tom said softly i want you to know that ill do everything i can to make dickie come home thank you tom she pressed toms hand tightly emily dont you think its time for you to go to bed mr greenleaf asked tom stood up as mrs greenleaf did mr greenleaf went out of the room with her tom remained standing his hands at his sides in a large mirror on the wall he could see himself the serious hardworking young man again he was doing the right thing behaving the right way but he had a feeling of guilt he felt himself beginning to sweat and he tried to relax what was he so worried about hed felt so good tonight its like a dream tom thought in a minute mr greenleaf or somebody else would say tom tom and he would open his eyes and find himself back in raouls with a drink in front of him chapter two a new start toms mood was calm and happy but he didnt feel like making friends he wanted his time for thinking he began to play a role on the ship the role of a serious young man with an important job ahead of him he had a sudden desire for a hat and so he bought one on the ship a bluegray cap of soft english wool he could look like so many different types of people in the hat he had always thought that he had the worlds dullest face the cap changed all that now he was a young man with a private income not long out of princeton possibly he was starting a new life goodbye to all of the awful people he had known in new york whatever happened with dickie he would handle himself well and mr greenleaf would respect him for it when mr greenleafs money was gone he might not come back to america he might get an interesting job in a hotel or he might work as a salesperson for a european company and travel around in the world one afternoon he wrote a polite letter to his aunt dottie dear auntie i am on my way to europe by boat i had a business offer that i cant explain right now i had to leave suddenly so i was not able to come to boston and im sorry because it may be months or even years before i come back i wanted to tell you not to worry and not to send me any more checks thank you very much for the last one from a month ago i am well and very happy love tom the letter made him feel better because it separated him from her no more of the letters comparing him to his father and the stupid checks for six dollars and fortyeight cents or twelve dollars and ninetyfive cents when she had some change left over from the store aunt dottie had always told tom that he had cost her more than his father had left in insurance but did she have to keep repeating it lots of aunts and even strangers raised a child for nothing and were glad to do it after his letter to aunt dottie he got up and walked around the ship he always got angry when he wrote to her he hated being nice to her until now he had always needed the money she sent him but he didnt need it now he would be independent forever he had run away from aunt dottie at seventeen and had been brought back and he had done it again at twenty and succeeded he remembered how innocent he had been not knowing how the world worked he remembered how he felt when he had been fired from a job in new york because he wasnt strong enough to lift boxes eight hours a day he was very upset and thought it wasnt fair he remembered deciding then that the world was full of selfish people and that you had to be an animal or you wouldnt eat he remembered right after that he had stolen a loaf of bread from a store and had taken it home and eaten it quickly feeling that the world owed him bread and more tom sat back in his chair again pulled his hat down over his eyes and folded his hands over his stomach his separation from the other passengers was making them notice him he imagined the others asking is he an american i think so but he doesnt act like an american does he most americans are so noisy hes very serious isnt he and he cant be more than twentythree he must have something very important on his mind yes he had the present and future of tom ripley a few days later tom arrived in naples where he stayed overnight the next morning at eleven he got on the bus for mongibello now and then he saw little villages by the waters edge and people swimming near the shore finally the driver said loudly mongibello tom jumped down out of the bus and walked into the little post office across the road where he asked the man behind the window for richard greenleafs house after a short walk tom found a twofloor house with an iron gate on the road and a terrace that hung over the cliffs edge tom rang the bell an italian woman came out of the house drying her hands mr greenleaf tom asked the woman smiled and answered in italian as she pointed down toward the sea tom nodded thank you he didnt have a swimsuit so he went into one of the little shops near the post office and bought a tiny black and yellow one he put on his shoes again and walked down a road which led to the beach looking down the beach tom saw him from a great distance definitely dickie though his skin was a dark brown and his hair looked lighter than tom remembered it he was with marge tom approached the pair dickie greenleaf he asked smiling dickie looked up yes im tom ripley i met you in the states several years ago remember dickie didnt seem to recognize tom i think your father said he was going to write you about me oh yes dickie said he stood up tom what is it ripley this is marge sherwood he said marge tom ripley dickie was looking at him carefully not in a very friendly manner you dont seem to remember me from new york tom said i cant really say that i do dickie said where did i meet you i think wasnt it at buddy lankenaus it wasnt but he knew dickie knew buddy lankenau and buddy was a very nice guy after a short swim dickie and marge returned to their towels dickie said were leaving would you like to come up to the house and have lunch with us well yes thanks very much fifteen minutes later tom had had a cool shower and was sitting in a comfortable chair on dickies terrace with a drink in his hand he wondered if marge lived here at that moment dickie came out and poured himself a drink sorry theres no ice i havent got a refrigerator tom smiled i have a shirt for you your mother said youd asked for one also some socks do you know my mother i met your father just before i left new york and he asked me to dinner at his house i suppose he offered you a job too hes always searching for young men to work for his company no he didnt tom felt that dickie didnt like him had mr greenleaf told dickie he was coming to persuade him to return home or was dickie just in a bad mood he probably could have persuaded dickie to come home if he had met dickie in a cafe down at the beach but this way was useless tom was angry at himself nothing he took so seriously ever worked out he had learned that years ago what hotel are you staying in marge asked tom tom smiled i havent found one yet what do you recommend the miramares the best in that case ill try the miramare tom said standing up i must go neither dickie nor marge asked him to stay dickie walked with him to the gate marge wasnt leaving tom wondered if dickie and marge were sleeping together marge was in love with dickie tom thought but dickie didnt care much about her it was nice to meet you goodbye dickie goodbye tom let three days go by on the fourth morning he went down to the beach and found dickie alone doesnt look like marge is coming down dickie said i think ill go up tom got up they walked to the miramare saying almost nothing to each other they went up to toms room and dickie tried the shirt on and held the socks up to his feet both the shirt and the socks were the right size and as tom had thought dickie was very pleased with the shirt now dickie had everything tom thought everything he had to offer he would refuse an invitation for a drink too tom knew thanks for delivering the clothes it was very nice of you dickie held out his hand i think i ought to tell you something else tom said with a smile your father sent me over here especially to ask you to come home what do you mean dickie asked paid your way yes it was his last chance to make dickie laugh or go out and slam the door in disgust but the smile was coming the way tom remembered dickies smile paid your way hes getting desperate isnt he dickie closed the door again he came up to me in a bar in new york tom said i told him i wasnt a close friend of yours but he thought i could help if i came over i told him id try i dont want you to think im taking advantage of your father ill try to find a job somewhere in europe soon and ill be able to pay him back he bought me a roundtrip ticket oh dont bother the company will pay for it i can just see dad approaching you in a bar which bar was it raonls he followed me from the green cage tom and dickie had a drink in the hotel bar they drank to herbert richard greenleaf chapter three friendships and jealousies come on tom ill show you some of my paintings dickie led the way into the big room tom had looked into a couple of times on his way to and from the shower this is one of marge im working on now oh tom said with interest it wasnt good in his opinion probably in anybodys opinion and these a lot of paintings of the seashore dickie obviously wanted tom to say something nice about them because he was proud of them they were all wild and all the same how long are you going to be here dickie asked oh at least a week i think tom answered because dickies face was red from the wine which had put him in a good mood if youre going to be here a little longer why dont you stay with me theres no reason to stay in a hotel unless you prefer it thank you very much tom said theres a bed in the other room which you didnt see the next morning tom moved in are we still going to naples tom asked remember we talked about it yesterday certainly dickie looked at his watch its only a quarter to twelve we can make the twelve oclock bus the bus was just arriving as they reached the post office dickie stopped running right in the face of a young man with red hair and a bright sports shirt an american dickie freddie dickie yelled what are you doing here came to see you and the cecchis theyre giving me a place to stay for a few days im off to naples with a friend tom dickie introduced them the americans name was freddie miles tom thought he was disgusting he hated red hair freddie had large redbrown eyes that shook in his head he was also very heavy see you tonight freddie about an hour later the bus left tom and dickie in naples i know a good place for lunch dickie said a real neapolitan pizza place do you like pizza they sat there until five oclock dickie had spent most of the time talking about freddie and tom had found the conversation as uninteresting as freddies face then they moved to a cafe called the galleria this is what i like dickie said sitting at a table and watching the people go by it really improves your attitude toward life a welldressed italian greeted dickie warmly and sat down at the table with them tom listened to their conversation in italian understanding a word here and there want to go to rome dickie asked him suddenly sure tom said now the italian had a long gray car with a loud radio that he and dickie seemed happy to shout over they reached rome in about two hours and the italian dropped them in the middle of a street and said a quick goodbye in rome they bought tickets for a music show that evening after the show they had dinner and drank a bottle and a half of wine they were in a fine mood by one in the morning they walked with their arms around each others shoulders singing and talking neither had the slightest idea what street they were on when the sun comes up we can see where we are dickie said cheerfully he looked at his watch only a couple more hours the next morning they returned to naples just in time to catch the bus for mongibello when they reached mongibello marge was annoyed because dickie hadnt called to say he was spending the night in rome i dont mind of course but i thought you were in naples and anything can happen in naples tom kept his mouth shut he wasnt going to tell marge anything they had done let her imagine what she pleased dickie had made it clear that they had had a very good time marge had the look of a mother or an older sister now the womans dislike of the rough play of little boys and men or was it jealousy she seemed to know that dickie had formed a closer friendship with tom in twentyfour hours just because he was another man than she could ever have with dickie whether he loved her or not and he didnt for the next three or four days they didnt see much of marge tom anyway kept dickie amused he had lots of funny stories to tell about new york some of them true some of them invented obviously dickie was enjoying his company tom wrote to mr greenleaf promising him that dickie was considering returning to the united states he had to smile as he wrote the letter because he and dickie were talking of visiting the greek islands this winter marge wouldnt be goingtom was sure both he and dickie left her out of their travel plans when they discussed them dickie was paying attention to marge because he knew shed be lonely in mongibello by herself but one day when they asked her to go to the roman ruins at herculaneum she refused i think ill stay home you boys enjoy yourselves she said with an effort at a cheerful smile well if she wont she wont tom said and then walked calmly into the house so that she and dickie could talk alone on the terrace if they wanted to after a few minutes the gate slammed marge had left tom walked out of the house and onto the terrace was she angry about something tom asked no she feels kind of ignored i suppose i feel like im getting in the way of your relationship with marge of course not getting in the way of what well she might think so no its just that i owe her something and i havent been particularly nice to her lately we havent its after two want to take a little walk and go by the post office they walked down the hill in silence what had marge said about him tom wondered dickie came out of his silence only to greet luigi the post office worker and thank him for his letter tom had no mail i think ill go up to see marge dickie said i wont be long but dont wait all right tom said feeling suddenly desperate about half way up the hill he had the sudden need to go to marges house he could go with the excuse of apologizing to her but satisfy his anger by surprising and annoying them he suddenly felt that dickie was touching her at this minute and partly he wanted to see it and partly he hated the idea of seeing it tom stopped near marges apartment one of her bras was hanging out of the window through the window he could see that dickies arm was around her waist dickie was kissing her little kisses on her cheek smiling at her tom was disgusted he knew dickie didnt mean it he knew dickie was using this cheap easy way to hold on to her friendship tom turned away and ran down the steps wanting to scream he ran all the way to dickies house and sat on the couch in dickies living room for a few moments his mind shocked and empty he went into dickies bedroom and walked around for a few moments his hands in his pockets he wondered when dickie was coming back or was he going to stay all afternoon really take her to bed with him he opened dickies closet door and looked in there was a newlooking gray suit tom took it out he took off his shorts and put on the gray pants he put on a pair of dickies shoes then he opened the bottom drawer and took out a clean blue and white shirt marge you must understand that i dont love you tom said into the mirror in dickies voice marge stop it tom turned suddenly and made a move in the air pretending to grab marges throat he shook her twisted her down to the floor he was breathing heavily you know why i had to do that he said addressing marge though he watched himself in the mirror you were coming between tom and me no not that but there is something between us he turned stepped over the imaginary body and went to the window he could see the bottom of the steps that led up to marges house maybe they were sleeping together tom thought with disgust he ran back to the closet and took a hat from the top shelf he put it on it surprised him how much he looked like dickie with the top part of his head covered really it was only his darker hair that was very different from dickie but his nose his narrow jaw his eyes whatre you doing tom turned around quickly dickie was in the doorway oh just amusing myself sorry dickie dickie slammed the door loudly please get out of my clothes are you and marge ok tom tried to calm himself as he hung up the suit marge and i are fine dickie yelled another thing i want to say he said looking at tom im not in love with you i dont know if you have the idea that i am or not in love with me tom smiled weakly i never thought you were well marge thinks youre in love with me why tom felt the blood go out of his face what have i ever done its just the way you act dickie said and went out of the door tom quickly put his shorts back on and followed dickie just because dickie liked him tom thought marge had spread her dirty ideas about him to dickie are you in love with marge no but i feel sorry for her i care about her shes been very nice to me weve had some good times together you dont seem to be able to understand that im going to keep her friendship well have i done anything to prevent you i told you dickie id rather leave than do anything to hurt your friendship with marge dickie looked at tom no you havent done anything specifically but its obvious you dont like her around im sorry tom said sincerely he was sorry he hadnt made more of an effort that he had done a bad job well lets forget it marge and are ok dickie turned away and stared out at the water tom went into the kitchen to make himself some coffee this wasnt the time to be too friendly with dickie dickie had his pride he would be silent for most of the afternoon then come back in by about five oclock after he had been painting for a time and everything would be the same as before one thing tom was sure of dickie was glad to have him here dickie was bored with living by himself and bored with marge too tom still had three hundred dollars left and he and dickie were going to use it on a trip to paris chapter four a loss of control the next day tom walked down to the post office there were two letters one to him from dickies father one to dickie from someone in new york who tom didnt know he walked quickly home as he opened mr greenleafs letter unfolding the typewritten sheet respectfully nov my dear tom since you have been with dickie over a month and he shows no more sign of coming home than before you went it is clear to me that you havent been successful i realize that you reported sincerely that he is considering returning but honestly i dont see it anywhere in his letter of october he seems more determined than ever to stay where he is i want you to know that my wife and i appreciate whatever efforts you have made for us from today i have no further need of your assistance i hope you have not troubled yourself greatly by your efforts of the last month and i sincerely hope the trip has given you some pleasure despite the failure of its main goal both my wife and i send you greetings and our thanks sincerely h r greenleaf tom walked into the house it was the end mr greenleaf had simply fired him he had failed he stood at the corner of the terrace staring out at the city and thinking of nothing feeling lost and alone he turned as he heard the gate open dickie walked up the path smiling but tom thought it was an unnatural polite smile heres a letter for you he handed dickie his letter and put the one from mr greenleaf into his pocket when dickie had finished reading his letter a letter that made him laugh out loud as he read it tom said do you think marge would like to go up to paris with us when we go dickie looked surprised i think she would well ask her tom said cheerfully i dont know if i should go up to paris dickie said i wouldnt mind getting away somewhere for a few days but paris he lighted a cigarette id rather go to san remo or even genoa but paris genoa cant compare with paris can it no of course not but its a lot closer but when will we get to paris i dont know any time parisll still be there tom ran from the hall into the kitchen and fixed himself an iceless drink his hands were shaking only yesterday dickie had said are you going home for christmas very quietly in the middle of a conversation but dickie knew he wasnt going home for christmas he didnt have a home and dickie knew it he had told dickie all about aunt dottie in boston it was simply what dickie wanted that was all marge was full of plans for christmas he couldnt bear to imagine it all right hed leave hed do anything rather than spend christmas with them marge said she didnt care to go with them to san remo she was busy working on her book the book must be awful tom thought he had known writers you didnt write a book while spending half the day on the beach they took only one suitcase of dickies for the two of them because they planned to be away only three nights and four days dickie was in a slightly more cheerful mood but the awful feeling was still there the feeling that this was the last trip they would make together anywhere dickie said absolutely nothing on the train to san remo tom sat opposite him staring at his handsome expressionless face at his hands with the two rings one green and one gold tom decided to steal the green ring when he left he would do it the very last day he thought he stared at dickies closed eyes a crazy emotion of hate of warmth of impatience and frustration was rising in him preventing his breathing he wanted to kill dickie it was not the first time he had thought of it before once or twice or three times it had been a desire that went away immediately and left him with a feeling of shame now he thought about it for a whole minute two minutes because he was leaving dickie anyway and what was there to be ashamed of any more he had offered dickie friendship and respect everything he had to offer and dickie had answered with coldness and now dislike dickie was just pushing him out in the cold if he killed him on this trip tom thought he could simply say that there had been an accident he could he had just thought of something brilliant he could become dickie greenleaf himself he could do everything that dickie did he could go back to mongibello first and collect dickies things tell marge a story rent an apartment in rome or paris receive dickies check every month and sign dickies name on it he could step right into dickies shoes he began to think of how the water but dickie was such a good swimmer the cliffs it would be easy to push dickie off a cliff when they took a walk but he imagined dickie grabbing at him and pulling him off with him and he felt nervous he would have to make his hair more blond but he wouldnt live in a place of course where somebody who knew dickie lived he had only to look enough like dickie to be able to use his passport dickie opened his eyes looking right at him and tom relaxed putting his head back and shutting his eyes quickly tom are you ok dickie asked shaking toms knee ok tom said smiling a little he saw dickie sit back with a look of anger and tom knew why because dickie had hated giving him even that much attention tom smiled to himself amused at pretending to be asleep that had been the only way to hide his thoughts from dickie san remo flowers a main street along the beach shops and stores and french english and italian tourists tom searched his brain where in one of these little streets tonight in the water it was slightly cloudy though not cold it would be easy in the hotel room too but how would he get rid of the body that left only the water and dickie was very comfortable in the water there were boats rowboats and little motorboats that people could rent down at the beach in each motorboat tom noticed was a heavy round cement anchor tied to a rope to prevent the boat from floating away why dont we take a boat dickie tom asked trying not to sound eager well all right for an hour around the port dickie said the italian boatman started the motor for them then dickie took the wheel and they headed straight out from the town wherere you going tom shouted does it matter dickie smiled no it didnt you dare me to jump in tom asked beginning to take off his jacket dickie only laughed at this suggestion opening his mouth wide keeping his eyes fixed on the distance in front of the boat tom kept on undressing he had his shoes and socks off under his pants he wore his swimsuit like dickie ill go in if you will tom shouted will you he wanted dickie to slow down will i sure dickie slowed the motor he let go of the wheel and took off his jacket the boat moved up and down losing its speed come on dickie said nodding at toms pants take them off tom looked at the land they were a long way from the white sand and pink houses of san remo now he picked up the oar slowly playing with it between his knees and when dickie was pulling his pants down tom lifted the oar and swung it down hard on the top of dickies head hey dickie yelled sliding half off the wooden seat tom stood up and brought the oar down again what the dickie said as he lost consciousness tom hit him on the side of the neck three times finally the body relaxed and stopped moving tom straightened getting his breath back painfully he looked around him there were no boats nothing except far far away a little white one moving from left to right tom stopped and pulled at dickies green ring he put it in his pocket the other ring was tighter but it came off over the bleeding hand then he reached for the rope that was tied to the heavy weight he guessed the rope was about fourteen or fifteen meters long he began to feel cooler and calmer the cement weight should be just enough to hold a body down he thought the body might move around a little but it wouldnt come up to the surface tom pulled the body toward the edge of the boat sliding it along the side he began with dickies head and shoulders turned dickies body on its stomach and pushed him out little by little dickies head was in the water tom took a breath and pushed hard dickie went over the side of the boat tom started the boat cautiously and headed toward the shore north of san remo maybe he could find a place an empty area on the shore where he could stop the boat and get out he couldnt think of a way to get rid of the boat he moved it toward a shallow short beach until he felt it hit ground tom decided to sink the boat the little beach gave him a feeling of safety and privacy there was no sign that a human foot had ever touched the place tom began to gather stones and to drop them into the boat one by one he worked without stopping because he was afraid somebody might find him if he stopped to rest when the stones reached the top of the boat he pushed the boat away from the beach and pushed it down more and more until water entered over the sides as the boat began to sink he gave it another push toward deeper water and walked with it until the water was up to his waist and the boat sank below his reach then he walked back to shore and lay down for a time face down on the sand he began to plan his story for the return to mongibello tom stepped off the bus almost directly in front of marge she was in her swimsuit and the white jacket she always wore to the beach wheres dickie she asked hes in rome tom smiled easily absolutely prepared for marges questions hes staying up there for a few days i came down to get some of his stuff to take up to him is he staying with somebody no just in a hotel tom began to walk toward the house and marge followed him tom took the big iron key to the terrace door from its usual place the table had been moved a little and there was a book on the chair marge had been here since they left tom thought can i fix you a drink no thanks how long do you think dickies going to be away tom frowned thoughtfully well i dont really know he says he wants to see a lot of art shows up there i think hes just enjoying a change of scene how long are you staying just overnight ill be going up to rome tomorrow probably in the afternoon i dont suppose ill see you again unless youre at the beach have a good time in case i dont see you and tell dickie to write a postcard what hotel is he staying at oh uh whats the name of it near the piazza di spagna the inghilterra thats it but i think he said to use the american express as a mailing address all right bye marge walked down the path to the iron gate and out tom picked up the suitcase and ran upstairs to dickies bedroom he opened the drawers quickly and emptied them into the suitcase there were letters keys address books and clothes he wanted to take all of dickies stuff straight away to rome but he worried about what marge might think if he took so much for such a short time he decided it would be better to pretend that dickie had later made a decision to move to rome the next day tom worked calmly and thoroughly expecting marge to come by at any minute but it was after four before she came still here she asked as she came into dickies room yes i had a letter from dickie today hes decided hes going to move to rome tom stood up and smiled a little it seemed to be a surprise to him too he wants me to pick up all his things all i can carry move to rome for how long i dont know the rest of the winter at least hes not coming back all winter marge sounded lost already no he said he might even sell the house hes still going to cortina isnt he marge asked dickie and marge had been planning to go on a christmas vacation to cortina with freddie miles no hes not he said he was going to write freddie and tell him he decided not to go tom watched her shocked face he knew she was wondering whether he was going to live with dickie or not and that she was probably deciding because of his cheerful manner that he was tom felt the question move up to her lips and then she asked him are you going to stay with him in rome maybe for a time ill help him with his apartment i want to go to paris this month then i suppose around the middle of december ill be going back to the states a few minutes later marge stood up and said goodbye tom suddenly felt that she might be going to telephone dickie today or maybe even go up to rome but what could she do if she did go people change hotels and there were enough hotels in rome to keep her busy for days when she didnt find him she would suppose that he had gone to paris or to another city with tom ripley chapter five a new identity tom left mongibello by taxi around six oclock after a cup of coffee at giorgios where he said goodbye to his and dickies village friends to all of them he told the same story that mr greenleaf was staying in rome for the winter and that he sent his greetings until he saw them again on the train tom wrote a letter to marge as soon as he arrived at the hotel in rome he typed it on dickies typewriter rome november dear marge ive decided to take an apartment in rome for the winter just to have a change of scene and get away from old mongy i feel a need to be by myself im sorry it was so sudden and that i didnt get a chance to say goodbye but actually im not far away and i hope ill see you now and then i just didnt feel like going to pack my stuff so i gave the job to tom you had the wrong idea about tom hes going back to the states soon hes really not a bad guy and i dont dislike him he has nothing to do with us anyway and i hope you realize that write me at the american express rome until i know where i am im terribly sorry about christmas darling but i dont think i should see you so soon and you can hate me or not for that all my love dickie tom had kept his hat on when he entered the hotel and he gave dickies passport in at the desk instead of his own he also signed in with dickies signature he spent that evening practicing dickies signature for the bank checks dickies monthly income was going to arrive from america in less than ten days tom moved the next day to the hotel europa near the via veneto he held imaginary conversations with marge and freddie in his hotel room he spoke to her as dickie in case she called he had done so little to change his appearance but even his expression tom thought was like dickies now he wore a smile that was dangerously welcoming to a stranger a smile perfect to greet an old friend or a lover it was dickies best and most typical smile when he was in a good mood on january there was a letter from marge she was giving up her house on march she said she wrote when am i going to see you i hate missing a summer in europe after ive lived through another awful winter but i think ill go home in early march darling it would be so wonderful if we could go home on the same boat together is there a possibility i dont suppose there is youre not going back to the us even for a short visit this winter as ever marge on january tom wrote back to marge im painting with a man called di massimo and am quite pleased with the results i miss you too but if you can still live with my plan id prefer not to see you for several more weeks hello to giorgio and his wife it was a letter like all of dickies letters a letter that couldnt be called warm or cold and said almost nothing tom was receiving dickies checks now so he had enough money to live as he wanted he had found an apartment in a large apartment house in the via imperiale near the pincian gate he had signed a contract to stay a year though he didnt plan to spend most of his time in rome especially the winter he only wanted a home after years of not having one and rome was exciting rome was part of his new life he wanted to be able to say in majorca or athens or cairo or wherever he was yes i live in rome i keep an apartment keep was the way the international upper classes referred to their apartments the apartment had a large living room a bedroom a kind of sitting room kitchen and bath it suited the respectable neighborhood and the respectable life he wanted to lead tom carefully avoided the americans in rome who might expect him to come to their parties and ask them to his though he loved to chat with americans and italians in the cafe greco and in the students restaurants in the via margutta he told his name only to an italian painter named carlino whom he met in a via margutta bar told him also that he painted and was studying with a painter called di massimo if the police ever asked this man could now tell them that dickie greenleaf had been painting in rome in january he had a ticket for majorca by train to naples then the boat from naples to palma over the night of january and february he had bought two new suitcases from guccis the best leather products store in rome while tom was packing his suitcases one morning his doorbell rang he supposed it was a salesperson or a mistake he had no name on his doorbell downstairs because he didnt like people to visit him it rang for the second time and tom still ignored it and went on with his lazy packing he loved to pack and he took a long time about it a whole day or two days laying dickies clothes carefully into suitcases now and then trying on a goodlooking shirt or a jacket in front of the mirror he was standing in front of the mirror with one of dickies shirts when there was a knock at his door it might be someone from mongibello someone who had found his address and wanted to surprise him that was silly he told himself but his hands were cool with sweat as he went to the door he felt faint and was afraid he would fall down he opened the door with both hands though only a few centimeters hello the american voice said out of the darkness of the hall dickie its freddie tom took a step back holding the door open hes wont you come in hes not here right now he should be back a little later freddie miles came in looking around his fat ugly face turned in every direction how had he found the place tom wondered tom took his rings off quickly and pocketed them and what else he too looked around the room youre staying with him freddie asked with that strange stare that made his face look stupid and rather scared oh no im just staying here for a few hours tom said calmly removing dickies shirt he had another shirt on under it dickies gone for lunch otellos i think he said he should be back around three at the latest one of the apartment owners had probably let freddie in tom thought and told him which bell to press and told him mr greenleaf was in too freddie had probably said he was an old friend of dickies now he would have to get freddie out of the house without seeing signora buffi downstairs because she always called out hello mr greenleaf i met you in mongibello didnt i freddie asked arent you tom i thought you were coming to cortina i couldnt go thanks how was the trip oh fine what happened to dickie didnt he write to you he decided to spend the winter in rome he told me hed written to you not a word marge told me hed moved to rome but she didnt have the address except the american express office it was only by luck that i met somebody at a restaurant last night who knew where he lived freddie had walked toward the bedroom and stopped looking at the suitcases on the bed is dickie leaving for somewhere or did he just get here he asked turning hes leaving didnt marge tell you hes going to sicily when tomorrow or late tonight im not quite sure so whats the matter with dickie lately freddie asked frowning whats the idea of hiding from everybody he says hes been working pretty hard this winter tom said he seems to want privacy but as far as i know hes still friendly with everybody including marge tom turned around and saw freddie staring at the silver identification bracelet on his left wrist it was dickies bracelet which tom had never seen him wearing but had found with dickies clothes freddie had clearly seen it before tom put on his coat slowly and calmly freddie was looking at him now with a different expression with a little surprise tom knew what freddie was thinking he sensed danger ready to go tom asked you live here dont you no tom protested smiling the fat ugly face stared at him from under the bright red hair if they could get out without seeing signora buffi downstairs tom thought he would be safe lets go i see youre wearing dickies jewelry tom couldnt think of a single thing to say a single joke to make oh just for a day or two he said in his deepest voice dickie got tired of wearing it so he told me to wear it he meant the identification bracelet but there was also the silver pin on his tie with the g on it tom had bought the pin himself he could feel the anger growing in freddie miles tom was afraid of his eyes yes im ready to go freddie said seriously getting up ive just remembered i have to make a telephone call tom said ill meet you there freddie walked to the door and turned with a swing of his broad shoulders thats the otello not far from the inghilterra yes tom said hes supposed to be there by one oclock freddie nodded nice to see you again he said in an unfriendly manner and closed the door tom whispered a curse he opened the door slightly and listened to the sound of freddies shoes going down the stairs he wanted to make sure freddie left without speaking to one of the buffis again then he heard freddies hello maam freddie was talking with signora buffi the womans voice came more clearly only mr greenleaf she was saying no only one mr who no sir i do not think he has gone out today at all but i could be wrong she laughed tom twisted his hands imagining that they were around freddies neck then he heard freddies footsteps running up the stairs tom stepped back into the apartment and closed the door he could go on saying that he didnt live here that dickie was at otellos or that he didnt know where dickie was but freddie wouldnt stop now until he found dickie or freddie would drag him downstairs and ask signora buffi who he was freddie knocked on the door the handle turned it was locked tom picked up a heavy glass ashtray he couldnt get his hand around it and he had to hold it by the edge he tried to think just for two seconds more wasnt there another solution what would he do with the body he couldnt think this was the only way he opened the door with his left hand his right hand with the glass ashtray was pulled back and down freddie came into the room listen would you mind telling the hard edge of the ashtray hit the middle of his head freddie looked shocked then his knees bent and he went down like a bull hit between the eyes with a hammer tom kicked the door shut he slammed the edge of the ashtray into the back of freddies neck he hit the neck again and again scared that freddie might be only pretending and that one of his great arms might suddenly grab his legs and pull him down then he felt freddies wrist for a pulse there was a faint one though it seemed to stop as he touched in the next second it was gone he searched freddies pockets a wallet the american passport in the inside pocket of the overcoat mixed italian and some other kind of coins two car keys on a ring that said fiat he searched the wallet for a license there it was with all the details he went to the front window then nearly smiled because it was so simple there stood the black car across the street almost directly in front of the house he could not be sure but he thought there was no one in it he suddenly knew what he was going to do he set freddie up against the wall and poured some strong alcohol from a bottle down his throat he had hours of time but he didnt stop until the room was ready the two dozen smoked cigarettes and a glass of alcohol broken and only halfcleaned up from the bathroom floor the curious thing was that he knew he would have the whole apartment cleaned up by eight oclock according to the story he was going to tell freddie would leave his house by seven and dickie greenleaf was a fairly neat young man even with a few drinks in him tom was dirtying the house only so that he would believe the story he was going to tell at ten to eight tom dragged freddies dead body out of the apartment and began to walk down the stairs on the way down he stopped hearing someone come out of an apartment on the second floor he waited for a moment and then continued he didnt want to rest going down the stairs fortunately nobody else came out of any of the apartments or in the front door the street looked normal if anyone came over tom thought he would blow such a breath of alcohol in his face that there wouldnt be any reason to ask what was the matter he paused a moment for a car to pass and then took a few heavy steps to freddies car he pushed freddies head and one shoulder through the open window of the car while he breathed deeply can i help you a voice asked in italian ah no no thanks tom replied with drunken happiness i know where he lives he said in english the man nodded smiling a little too and walked on tom swung freddie out on the door pulled him around the door and onto the car seat came around the car and pulled freddie into the seat beside the drivers seat he put freddies key in and the car started quickly they were off down the hill to the via veneto past the american library over to the piazza venezia through the forum past the colosseum a grand tour of rome that freddie could not appreciate tom began to look around for the right spot there was a place ahead with three or four trees near the edge of the road and surely a tomb behind them tom pulled off the road by the trees and shut off his lights he waited a moment watching both ends of the straight empty road freddies body was still soft tom dragged him roughly now through the dirt and stopped behind the last tree behind what remained of a tomb which was probably only a meter high he thought and quite good enough for this pig tom cursed his ugly weight and kicked him suddenly in the chin then he walked back to his car on his exhausted weak legs and turned the car around toward rome again he was tired tired to the point of crying and sick of the sight of freddie miles chapter six the hunt for clues tom went out before eight in the morning to buy the papers there was nothing they might not find freddie for days tom thought nobody was likely to walk around an unimportant tomb like the one he had put freddie behind he was dressed by nine and had even spoken to signora buffi to tell her he would be gone for at least three weeks the telephone rang and tom picked it up mr greenleaf asked the italian voice yes the voice stated that the body of frederick miles had been found that morning and hadnt mr miles visited him yesterday afternoon yes that is true would you be kind enough to answer some questions a police officer will come to you i will be very glad to help if i can tom said in slow careful italian but can the officer come now it is necessary for me to leave the house at ten oclock the voice made a little sound and said probably not but they would try tom hurried to push a couple of suitcases under the bed and carried the other to a closet and shut the door he didnt want the police to think he was planning to leave town but what was he nervous about they probably didnt have any clues maybe a friend of freddies had known that freddie was going to try to see him yesterday that was all tom picked up a paint brush and put it in a cup of water he didnt want to look too upset by the news of freddies death to do a little painting while he waited for them though he was dressed to go out he was going to be a friend of freddies but not a very close friend signora buffi let the police in at tenthirty there were two an older man in the uniform of an officer and a younger man in an ordinary police uniform the older man greeted him politely and asked to see his passport tom produced it and the officer looked carefully from tom to the picture of dickie more carefully than anyone had ever looked at it before tom thought the officer would ask him about it but he didnt he handed tom the passport with a little smile how was he killed tom asked he was hit on the head and in the neck by a heavy object the officer replied and robbed we think he was drunk was he drunk when he left your apartment yesterday afternoon well a little we had both been drinking the officer wrote this down in his book and also the time that tom said freddie had been there from about twelve until about six do you know where he was going when he left the officer asked no i dont but you thought he was able to drive oh yes if he had been too drunk to drive i would have gone with him the officer asked another question that tom pretended not quite to understand the officer asked it a second time choosing different words and smiled at the younger police officer the officer wanted to know what his relationship to freddie had been a friend tom said not a very close friend i had not seen or heard from him in about two months i was terribly upset to hear about the disaster this morning tom let his anxious face express what his rather simple vocabulary couldnt he thought he succeeded he thought the questioning wasnt very serious and that they were going to leave in another minute or two he said nothing about making a trip to the via appia when he left your apartment no tom said what did you do yesterday after mr miles left i stayed here tom said moving his open hands as dickie had done and then i had a little sleep and later i went out for a walk around eight or eightthirty a man who lived in the house whose name tom didnt know had seen him come in last night at about a quarter to nine and they had said good evening to each other you took a walk alone yes and mr miles left here alone he was not going to meet anybody he didnt say so tom wondered if freddie had had friends with him at his hotel or wherever he had been staying tom hoped that the police wouldnt introduce him to any of freddies friends who might know dickie now his name richard greenleaf would be in the italian newspapers tom thought and also his address hed have to move it was awful he cursed to himself the police officer saw him but it looked like a curse against the sad end of freddie tom thought we are searching the car now maybe the murderer was somebody he picked up to give a ride to shall we be able to reach you here for the next few days in case there are any more questions tom hesitated i was planning to leave for majorca tomorrow i am sorry but we may need to contact you in the next couple of days he stated quietly he was not giving tom the opportunity to argue about it even if he was an american we shall inform you as soon as you may go i am sorry if you have made travel plans perhaps there is still time to change them good day mr greenleaf good day tom stood there after they had closed the door he could move to a hotel he thought if he told the police what hotel it was he didnt want freddies friends or any friends of dickies coming to see him after they saw his address in the newspapers before an hour had passed he was at the inghilterra his three suitcases two of them dickies and one his own depressed him he had packed them for such a different purpose and now this he went out at noon to buy the papers every one of the papers had the news american murdered on the via appia antica shocking murder of wealthy american frederick miles last night on the via appia via appia murder of american without clues tom read every word there really were no clues at least not yet and no suspects but every paper gave the name herbert richard greenleaf and gave his address as the place where freddie had last been seen by anybody the phone didnt ring all afternoon at about eight when it was dark tom went downstairs to buy the evening papers he sat in a little restaurant a few streets away reading them still no clues tom drank his glass of wine slowly and looked through each of the papers for the lastminute articles that were sometimes put into italian papers just before they came out he found nothing more on the miles case but on the last page of the last newspaper he read sunken boat with bloodstains found near san remo he read it rapidly with more terror in his heart than he had felt when he had carried freddies body down the stairs or when the police had come to question him this was like a bad dream come true the boat was described in detail and it brought the scene back to him dickie smiling in the boat dickie smiling at him dickies body sinking through the water the article said that the stains were believed to be blood not that they were it didnt say what the police or anybody else planned to do about them but the police would do something tom thought his imagination went in several directions what would they think if they searched for dickies body and found it they would think that it was tom ripleys now dickie would be suspected of murder then dickie would be suspected of freddies murder too tom sat in his room wondering what would happen if he did nothing and what he could make happen by his own actions marge would come up to rome she had obviously called the rome police to get his address if she came up he would have to see her as tom and try to persuade her that dickie was out as he had with freddie he mustnt see marge that was all everything would be a disaster if he saw her itd be the end of everything but if he could be patient nothing at all would happen it was just this moment he thought just this murder that made things so difficult but absolutely nothing would happen to him if he could keep doing and saying the right things to everybody afterward everything would be ok again he picked up the telephone and told the man at the hotel desk that if miss marjorie sherwood called again he would accept the call he thought he could persuade her in two minutes that everything was all right and that freddies murder didnt concern him at all he would say that he had moved to a hotel to avoid annoying telephone calls from strangers but still be within reach of the police in case they wanted him to identify any suspects they picked up he lay down on the bed tired but not ready to undress tom imagined dickie smiling at him dressed in the suit that he had worn in san remo the suit and tie were completely wet dickie bent over him shaking him i swam he said tom wake up im all right i swam im alive tom moved away from his touch he heard dickie laugh at him dickies happy deep laugh i swam dickies voice yelled ringing and ringing in toms ears tom looked around the room looking for dickie in the yellow light under the lamp in the dark corner tom felt his own eyes open wide frightened and though he knew his fear was silly he kept looking everywhere for dickie below the curtains at the window and on the floor on the other side of the bed he pulled himself up from the bed and walked almost falling across the room and opened a window he felt drugged he sat beneath the window breathing the cold air in finally he went into the bathroom and wet his face at the sink he had let his imagination go crazy he had been out of control the first thing he thought of when he woke up was marge he reached for the telephone and asked if she had called during the night she hadnt he had a terrible feeling that she was coming up to rome very strangely there was nothing in the papers about either the miles case or the san remo boat it frightened him the telephone rang and he jumped for it obediently it was either marge or the police there are two officers of the police downstairs to see you sir a minute later he heard their footsteps in the carpeted hall it was the same older officer as yesterday with a different younger policeman they took the chairs tom offered are you a friend of the american thomas ripley the older officer asked yes tom said do you know where he is i think he went back to america about a month ago i see that will have to be checked you see we are trying to find thomas ripley we think he may be dead dead why the officer seemed to be smiling between each sentence the smile had bothered tom a little yesterday too you were with him on a trip to san remo in november were you not they had checked the hotels yes where did you last see him in san remo no i saw him again in rome tom remembered that marge knew he had gone back to rome after mongibello because he had said he was going to help dickie in his new apartment in rome when did you last see him i dont know the exact date something like two months ago i think i think i had a postcard from from genoa saying that he was going back to america why do you think he is dead did you take a boat ride with thomas ripley in san remo i think we did yes i remember why because a little boat has been found with some kind of stains on it that may be blood it was lost on november the day you were in san remo with mr ripley the officers eyes rested on him without moving the friendliness of the look angered tom it wasnt honest he felt but he made an effort to behave well but nothing happened to us on the boat ride there was no accident did you bring the boat back of course it was obvious what was going on in the officers head dickie greenleaf had twice been on the scene of a murder or near enough the missing thomas ripley had taken a boat ride on november with dickie greenleaf are you saying you do not believe me when i tell you that i saw tom ripley in rome around december oh no i didnt say that i wanted to hear what you would say about your travels with mr ripley after san remo because we cannot find him he smiled again if hes not in america you could try paris or genoa we will the officer said he put his papers away he had made at least a dozen notes on them before you go tom said in a nervous voice i want to ask you when i can leave the city i was planning to go to sicily i would very much like to leave today if it is possible i plan to stay at the hotel palma in palermo it will be very simple for you to reach me if i am needed palermo the officer repeated well that may be possible after making a phone call to his station the officer turned to tom smiling yes you may go to palermo today thank you he walked with the two of them to the door if you find where tom ripley is please let me know too he said sincerely of course we shall keep you informed sir good day chapter seven the waiting game tom had no plan to try to run away from anything he just wanted to get out of rome he was desperate to get out he threw the last objects into his suitcase and slammed the lid down and locked it the phone again tom picked it up quickly hello oh dickie it was marge and she was downstairs he could tell from the sound surprised he said in toms voice whos this is this tom marge well hello where are you im downstairs is dickie there can i come up you can come up in about five minutes tom said with a laugh is dickie there not at the moment he went out about a half an hour ago but hell be back soon i know where he is if you want to find him where at the eightythird police station no excuse me its the eightyseventh is he in any trouble no just answering questions he was supposed to be there at ten want me to give you the address he wished he hadnt started talking in toms voice why hadnt he pretended to be a servant some friend of dickies anybody and told her that dickie was out for hours marge wasnt happy no o ill wait for him here it is tom said pretending to find the address twentyone via perugia do you know where that is tom didnt but he was going to send her in the opposite direction from the american express where he wanted to go for his mail before he left town i dont want to go marge said ill come up and wait with you if its all right well its he laughed the laugh that marge knew so well the thing is im expecting somebody any minute its a business interview about a job believe it or not old ripleys trying to put himself to work oh said marge not in the least interested well how is dickie why does he have to talk to the police oh just because he had some drinks with freddie that day you saw the papers didnt you how long has dickie been living here here oh just overnight ive been up north when i heard about freddie i came down to rome to see him if it hadnt been for the police id never have found him im awfully glad youre in town marge dickiell be so happy to see you hes been worried about what you might think of all this in the papers oh has he marge said surprised but obviously pleased why dont you wait for me in angelos its that bar right down the street in front of the hotel as you go toward the piazza di spagna steps ill see if i can come out and have a drink or a coffee with you in about five minutes ok oh all right angelos you cant miss it on the street straight in front of the hotel byebye tom quickly called for his bill to be prepared and for somebody to carry his luggage and then he walked downstairs he wanted to see if marge was still in the hotel waiting there for him or possibly still there making another telephone call she wasnt there tom paid his bill if anybody asks for me would you say that ive left the city tom asked the man at the desk tom went out to his waiting taxi would you take me to the american express please he asked the driver the boat approached palermo harbor slowly he had spent two days in naples and there had been nothing of any interest in the papers and the police had made no attempt to contact him but maybe they had just not bothered to look for him in naples he thought and were waiting for him in palermo at the hotel but there were no police on the dock and no police in the hotel either tom felt so happy that he went over to the mail counter and asked boldly if there was any message for mr richard greenleaf the clerk told him there wasnt then he began to relax there wasnt even a message from marge maybe marge had given dickie up after this situation maybe shed realized that dickie was running away from her he dressed put on one of his new traveling suits and walked out into the palermo early evening there across the square was the great cathedral he had read about in a guidebook tomorrow he would begin his visit but this moment was wonderful he thought as he stopped to stare at the tall cathedral in front of him wonderful to look at the dusty walls and to think of going inside tomorrow to imagine its smell made up of hundreds and hundreds of years beyond sicily came greece he definitely wanted to see greece he wanted to see greece as dickie greenleaf with dickies money dickies clothes dickies way of behaving with strangers but would it happen that he couldnt see greece as dickie greenleaf would one thing after another happen to stop him murder the police people he hadnt wanted to murder it had been necessary the idea of going to greece walking over the acropolis as tom ripley american tourist held no charm for him at all he would rather not go tears came in his eyes as he stared up at the cathedral and then he turned away there was a fat letter from marge the next morning tom squeezed it between his fingers and smiled he was sure he knew what it said because it was so fat he read it at breakfast he enjoyed every line of it with his breakfast it was all he had hoped for and more if you really didnt know that i had come by your hotel that only means that tom didnt tell you which gives me my answer its pretty obvious now that youre running out and cant face me why dont you admit that you cant live without your little friend im only sorry old boy that you didnt have the courage to tell me this before and directly what do you think i am a smalltown fool who doesnt know about such things success number two of my roman holiday is informing the police that tom ripley is with you they seemed in a desperate hurry to find him i wonder why whats he done now i also informed the police in my best italian that you and tom are always together and that i could not imagine how they found you and missed tom ill be leaving for the states around the end of march im not angry dickie boy i just thought you had more courage thanks for all the wonderful memories theyre like something in a museum already best wishes for the future marge five days passed calm lonely but very pleasant days in which he wandered around palermo stopping here and there for an hour or two in a cafe or a restaurant and reading his travel books and the newspaper he visited a palace the palermo library with its paintings and papers in glass cases he wrote letters to people in new york but he was lonely he had imagined himself making a bright new group of friends with whom he would start a new life with new attitudes standards and habits that would be much better and clearer than the ones he had had all his life now he realized that it couldnt be he would have to keep a distance from people always he was alone and it was a lonely game he was playing the friends he might make were most of the danger of course if he had to wander around the world alone well there was much less chance that he would be found out that was one cheerful side of it anyway and he felt better after he had thought of it he changed his behavior slightly to suit the role of an observer of life he was still polite and smiling to everyone to people who wanted to borrow his newspaper in restaurants and to workers he spoke to in the hotel but he carried his head even higher and he spoke a little less when he spoke there was a sadness about him now he enjoyed the change he imagined that he looked like a young man who had had an unhappy love affair or emotional disaster and was trying to recover by visiting some of the more beautiful places on the earth hello how are you he greeted the man behind the hotel desk with a smile a letter for you sir very urgent the man said smiling too it was from dickies bank in naples inside the envelope was another envelope from dickies bank in new york tom read the letter from the naples bank first february dear sir it has been brought to our attention by the wendell trust company of new york that there exists a doubt whether your signature on your check of five hundred dollars of last january is your own we are informing you as quickly as possible so that we can take the necessary

december were they going to go back and check on all his signatures now would somebody be able to tell that all three signatures were not dickies tom went upstairs and immediately sat down at the typewriter most false signatures took months to be discovered he thought why had they noticed this one in four weeks wasnt it because they were checking on him in every department of his life since the freddie miles murder and the san remo boat story they wanted to see him personally in the naples bank maybe some of the men there knew dickie by sight a terrible fear ran over his shoulders and down his legs for a moment he felt weak too weak to move he saw himself surrounded by a dozen policemen italian and american they were asking him where dickie greenleaf was and he was unable to produce dickie greenleaf or tell them where he was or prove that he existed he imagined himself trying to sign h richard greenleaf under the eyes of a dozen witnesses and falling apart suddenly and not being able to write at all february dear sirs in reply to your letter concerning my january check i signed the check myself and received all of the money if i had missed the check i would of course have informed you at once i am returning the card with my signature for your permanent record as you requested sincerely h richard greenleaf he signed dickies signature several times on the back of the banks envelope before he signed his letter and then the card then he wrote a similar letter to the naples bank and promised to go to the bank within the next few days and sign his name again for their permanent record he marked both envelopes urgent and then mailed them chapter eight the return of tom ripley police station rome february dear mr greenleaf you are urgently requested to come to rome to answer some important questions concerning thomas ripley your presence would be most appreciated and would greatly speed up our work failure to come to us within a week will cause us to take certain steps which will be annoying for us and for you most respectfully yours captain enrico farrara so they were still looking for tom but maybe it meant that something had happened on the miles case too tom thought the italians didnt call in an american using words like these in the last paragraph they were actually threatening him and of course they knew about the signature on the check by now he stood with the letter in his hand looking around the room he saw himself in the mirror the corners of his mouth were turned down his eyes were anxious and scared and because the way he looked was the way he felt he suddenly became twice as frightened he folded the letter and pocketed it then took it out of his pocket and tore it into pieces he began to pack rapidly this was the end of dickie greenleaf he knew he hated becoming thomas ripley again hated being nobody hated putting on his old set of habits again now people would look down on him and be bored with him unless he put on an act for them tom ripley always felt stupid and unable to do anything with himself except entertain people for minutes at a time he hated going back to himself as he would hate putting on a dirty old suit of clothes a suit of clothes that had not been very good even when it was new his tears fell on dickies blue and white shirt that lay on top in the suitcase it had dickies initials on it he began to count up the things of dickies that he could still keep because they had no initials or because no one would remember that they were dickies and not his own tom paid his bill at the hotel but he had to wait until the next day for a boat away from the island he reserved the boat ticket in the name of greenleaf thinking that this was the last time he would ever reserve a ticket in the name of greenleaf but that maybe it wouldnt be either he couldnt give up the idea that the problem might go away just might and for that reason it was senseless to give up hope there was no point in being desperate anyway even as tom ripley tom ripley had never really been desperate though he had often looked it hadnt he learned something from these last months if you wanted to be cheerful or sad or hopeful or thoughtful or polite you simply had to act those things a very cheerful thought came to him when he awoke on the last morning in palermo he could leave all dickies clothes at the american express in venice under a different name and pick them up at some future time if he wanted to or had to or else never pick them up at all it made him feel much better to know that dickies good shirts his identification bracelet and his wrist watch would be safely stored somewhere instead of lying at the bottom of the ocean or in a trashcan in sicily so after removing the initials from dickies two suitcases he sent them locked from naples to the american express company in venice together with two paintings he had begun in palermo he sent them in the name of robert s fanshaw to be stored until they were collected tom took a train from naples up through rome florence bologna and verona where he got out and went by bus to the town of trento about sixty kilometers away he didnt want to buy a car in a town as big as verona because the police might notice his name when he obtained his license plates he thought in trento he bought a used car for about eight hundred dollars he bought it in the name of thomas ripley as his passport read and took a hotel room in that name to wait the twentyfour hours until his license plates would be ready by noon the next day he had his plates on his car and nothing had happened there was nothing in the papers about the search for thomas ripley it made him feel rather strange rather safe and happy perhaps the whole situation was unreal he began to feel happy even in his boring role as thomas ripley he took a pleasure in it almost overdoing the old tom ripley shyness with strangers would anyone anyone believe that such a person had ever committed a murder and the only murder he could possibly be suspected of was dickies in san remo and the police didnt seem to be getting very far on that life as tom ripley had one positive at least it freed his mind of guilt for the stupid unnecessary murder of freddie miles the next night he spent in venice he found venice much bigger than he had imagined he found he could walk across the whole city by the narrow streets and bridges without setting foot in a boat he chose a hotel very near the rialto bridge called the costanza a hotel which was neither famous nor a cheap one on the back streets it was clean inexpensive and convenient to places of interest it was just the hotel for tom ripley as he spent a couple of hours in his room tom imagined the conversation he was going to have with the police before long well i havent any idea i saw him in rome if youve any doubt of that you can ask miss marjorie sherwood of course im tom ripley he would give a laugh i cant understand what all the problem is about san remo yes i remember we brought the boat back after an hour yes i came back to rome after mongibello but i didnt stay more than a couple of nights ive been wandering around the north of italy im afraid i havent any idea where he is but i saw him about three weeks ago tom got up from his chair smiling changed his shirt and tie for the evening and went out to find a pleasant restaurant for dinner a good restaurant he thought tom ripley could order something expensive for once his pocket was so full of money that it wouldnt bend he had cashed a thousand dollars worth of travelers checks in dickies name before he left palermo tom entered a small lighted street it was full of restaurants and he chose a very large and respectablelooking place with white tablecloths and brown wooden walls the kind of restaurants which experience had taught him by now concentrated on food and not appearance he took a table and opened one of the newspapers and there it was a short article on the second page police search for missing american dickie greenleaf friend of the murdered freddie miles missing after sicilian holiday the article stated that h richard dickie greenleaf a close friend of frederick miles the american murdered three weeks ago in rome had disappeared after taking a boat from palermo to naples both the sicilian and roman police had been informed and were looking for him a final paragraph said that greenleaf had just been requested by the rome police to answer questions concerning the disappearance of thomas ripley also a close friend of greenleaf ripley had been missing for about three months the paper said the next morning there was a long story in another newspaper saying in only one small paragraph that thomas ripley was missing but stating very boldly that richard greenleafs absence was making the police suspect his guilt and that he should go immediately to the police to discuss the situation the paper also mentioned the forged checks on his walk around the city the next morning he decided that he had to identify himself immediately it would look worse for him whatever happened the longer he waited when he left the cathedral he inquired of a policeman where the nearest police station was he asked it sadly he felt sad he wasnt afraid but he felt that identifying himself as thomas phelps ripley was going to be one of the saddest things he had ever done in his life you are thomas ripley the captain of police asked with no more interest than if tom had been a dog that had been lost and was now found may i see your passport tom handed it to him i dont know what the trouble is but when i saw in the papers that i am believed to be missing it was all sad and boring just as he had expected what happens now tom asked the officer i shall telephone to rome the officer answered calmly and picked up the telephone on his desk there was a few minutes wait for the rome line and then the officer announced to someone in rome that the american thomas ripley was in venice then the officer said to tom they would like to see you in rome can you go to rome today tom frowned i wasnt planning to go to rome i shall tell them the officer said and spoke into the telephone again now he was arranging for the rome police to come to him there were still some advantages to being an american citizen tom supposed tom spent the rest of the day in his room quietly thinking reading and making small changes to his appearance he thought it quite possible that they would send the same man who had spoken to him in rome at eightthirty that evening his telephone rang and the man from the hotel desk announced that lieutenant roverini was downstairs would you have him come up please tom said tom opened the door in a lazy way good evening good evening lieutenant roverini from the roman police behind him came another tall silent young police officer not another tom realized suddenly but the one who had been with the lieutenant when tom had first met roverini in the apartment in rome you are a friend of mr richard greenleaf the lieutenant asked obviously not recognizing him yes when did you last see him and where i saw him for a short time in rome just before he went to sicily and did you hear from him when he was in sicily the lieutenant was writing it all down in the notebook that he had taken from his brown case no i didnt hear from him you did not know when you were in rome that the police wanted to see you no i did not know that i cannot understand why people think i am missing mr greenleaf did not tell you in rome that the police wanted to speak to you no mr ripley where have you been since the end of november i have been traveling i have been mostly in the north of italy tom made a mistake here and there and his italian sounded quite different from dickies where milan torino faenza we have searched the hotels in milan and faenza did you stay all the time with friends no i slept quite often in my car it was obvious he didnt have much money tom thought may i see your passport tom pulled it out of his inside jacket pocket the lieutenant studied the picture closely while tom waited with the slightly anxious look the firmly open lips of the passport photograph the lieutenant looked quickly at the few marks that only partly filled the first two pages of the passport you have been in italy since october yes the lieutenant smiled a pleasant italian smile now and leaned forward well that settles one important matter the mystery of the san remo boat tom frowned what is that a boat was found sunk there with some stains that were believed to be blood naturally when you were missing or we thought you were missing immediately after san remo we thought it might be a good idea to ask mr greenleaf what had happened to you we did that the boat was missed the same day that you two were in san remo tom pretended not to see the joke did you also know frederick miles the lieutenant asked no i only met him once when he was getting off the bus in mongibello i never saw him again ahhah the lieutenant was silent i have read in a newspaper that the police may believe that mr greenleaf is guilty of the murder of freddie miles if he does not speak to them is it true that they think he is guilty ah no no no the lieutenant protested but it is important that he comes forward why is he hiding himself you have absolutely no idea where mr greenleaf might be at this moment no absolutely no mr greenleaf and mr miles didnt have an argument that you know of i dont know but what about the girl marjorie sherwood i suppose it is possible tom said but i do not think so tom waited silent the lieutenant was waiting for him to say something more tom felt quite comfortable now he felt suddenly innocent and strong do you think they had an argument mr miles and mr greenleaf about miss sherwood i cannot say it is possible i know that mr miles was very fond of her too his story painted a picture of dickie as an unhappy lover tom thought not willing to let marge go to cortina to have some fun because she liked freddie miles too much do you think dickie is running away from something or do you think it is an accident that you cannot find him oh no this is too much first the matter of the checks he denied the false signatures but when the bank wishes to see him and also the police in rome wish to see him about the murder of his friend and he suddenly disappears the lieutenant threw out his hands that can only mean that he is running away from us the lieutenant stood up well thank you so much for your help mr ripley i hope we can find you more easily the next time we have questions to ask you if you like i shall keep in touch with you in rome so you will always know where i am i am as much interested as you in finding my friend the lieutenant handed him a card with his name and the address of his station in rome thank you mr ripley good day the younger policeman waved to him as he went out and tom said goodbye and quietly closed the door he felt like flying like a bird out of the window with spread arms the fools all around the thing and never guessing it never guessing that dickie was running from the signature questions because he wasnt dickie greenleaf at all tonight he was going to have a wonderful dinner and look out at the moonlight on the water he was suddenly very hungry he was going to have something delicious and expensive to eat he had a bright idea while he was changing his clothes he ought to have an envelope hidden in his suitcase with a note on it saying that it should not be opened for several months inside it should be a will signed by dickie leaving tom his money and his income that was an idea chapter nine a visit from marge venice february dear mr greenleaf i thought i ought to write you with whatever personal information i have about richard since i was one of the last people it seems who saw him i saw him in rome around february at the inghilterra hotel as you know this was only two or three days after the death of freddie miles i found dickie upset and nervous he said he was going to palermo as soon as the police finished questioning him about freddies death and he seemed eager to get away i wanted to tell you that there was a certain unhappiness under all this that troubled me much more than his obvious nervousness i had the feeling that he would try to do something violent perhaps to himself i believe it is possible that richard has killed himself at the time of writing he has not been found i certainly hope he will be before this reaches you this is a sad message to send you and i regret it i thought it my duty to write you this munich march dear tom thanks for your letter it was very kind of you ive answered the police in writing and one came up to see me i wont be coming by venice but thanks for your invitation i am going to rome the day after tomorrow to meet dickies father who is flying over yes i agree with you that it was a good idea for you to write to him i did want to say to you that i dont agree with you at all that dickie would commit suicide he just isnt the type i know youre going to say people never act like theyre going to do it but no not dickie maybe he was murdered in a back street in naples or even rome i can also imagine him running out on duties i think thats what hes doing now nice to know your address finally thanks again for your letter your advice and invitations best marge she had decided to be friends with him tom supposed shed probably changed her attitude about him to the police too dickies disappearance was causing a lot of interest in the italian newspapers marge or somebody had provided reporters with photographs there were pictures of dickie sailing his boat in mongibello pictures of dickie on a beach and a picture of dickie and marge one of the articles mentioned that mr ripley one of the wealthy young american visitors in italy now lives in a palace looking out on san marco in venice that pleased tom most of all he cut out and saved that article he was now so confident that he even wrote aunt dottie with a calm loving attitude that he had never wanted to use before or had never before been able to use he asked about her health and her little group of nasty friends in boston after he had finished the letter he typed dickies will leaving him his income and the money he had in various banks and signed it richard greenleaf the signature was perfect exactly like the thin confusing signature on dickies passport tom practiced for half an hour before he signed the will relaxed his hands then signed a piece of paper then the will in rapid order tom put an envelope into the typewriter and addressed it to to whom it may concern with a note that it shouldnt be opened until june of this year he placed it in a side pocket of his suitcase to suggest that he had been carrying it there for some time and hadnt bothered unpacking it when he moved into the house about ten days after marges letter tom began to worry because mr greenleaf hadnt written or telephoned him from rome he sometimes imagined that the police had told mr greenleaf that they were playing a game with tom ripley and had asked mr greenleaf not to talk to him each day he looked eagerly in his mailbox for a letter from marge or mr greenleaf his house was ready for their arrival his answers to their questions were ready in his head tom wanted to take a trip the famous trip to greece he had bought a travel book about greece and he had already planned his journey through the islands but he couldnt go until something happened then on the morning of april he got a telephone call from marge she was in venice at the railroad station ill come and pick you up tom said cheerfully is mr greenleaf with you no hes in rome im alone you dont have to pick me up nonsense tom said wanting something to do at last youll never find the house by yourself yes i will its next to della salute isnt it i take a boat from san marcos she was right well if you really want to come alone he had just thought that he had better take one more good look around the house before she got there have you had lunch no good well lunch together somewhere they hung up he walked seriously and slowly through the house into both large rooms upstairs down the stairs and through the living room nothing anywhere that belonged to dickie he hoped the house didnt look too upper class tom made two drinks and arranged the glasses and a plate of snacks on a small table in the living room when he heard a knock he went to the door and swung it open marge good to see you come in he took the suitcase from her hand how are you tom is all this yours she looked around her and up at the high ceiling i rented it very cheaply tom said quickly come and have a drink tell me whats new youve been talking to the police in rome he carried her overcoat and her raincoat to a chair yes and to mr greenleaf hes very upset naturally she sat down on a sofa tom sat opposite her have they found anything new one of the officers there has been keeping me informed but he hasnt told me anything that really matters well they found out that dickie cashed over a thousand dollars worth of travelers checks before he left palermo just before maybe he went somewhere with it like greece or africa certainly he didnt go off to kill himself after just cashing a thousand dollars anyway no tom agreed well that sounds hopeful i didnt see that in the papers i dont think they put it in how is mr greenleaf marge shook her head i feel so sorry for him he keeps saying the american police could do a better job and all that and he doesnt know any italian so that makes it twice as bad whats he doing in rome waiting what can any of us do tom drank his drink slowly while he thought i certainly didnt mean to upset anybody when i said what i did about dickies sadness i felt it was kind of a duty to tell you and mr greenleaf i understand no i think you were right to tell us i just dont think its true she smiled her eyes shining with a belief that struck tom as completely crazy during lunch marge asked him more questions than any police officer about dickies feelings while he was in rome tom was questioned about everything from di massimo the painter dickie had worked with to dickies eating habits and the hour he got up in the morning how do you think he felt about me tell me honestly i can take it i think he was worried about you tom said seriously i think well it was one of those situations that happen quite often a man whos afraid of marriage to begin with but i never asked him to marry me marge protested i know but tom forced himself to continue though the subject was sour in his mouth lets say he couldnt face the responsibility of you caring so much about him i think he wanted a less complicated relationship with you that told her everything and nothing they were silent a few minutes then tom asked her about her life and work marge answered very enthusiastically tom had the feeling that if she had dickie back she would probably just explode with happiness make a loud attractive pop and that would be the end of her do you think i should offer to talk to mr greenleaf too tom asked id be glad to go to rome but he wouldnt be so glad he remembered because rome had simply too many people in it who had seen him as dickie greenleaf or do you think hed like to come here i think itd be nice if you called him ill write the address down for you thats a good idea he doesnt like me does he marge smiled a little well to be honest no i think he thinks you used dickie to your advantage well i didnt im sorry the idea didnt work about my getting dickie back home but i explained all of that i wrote him the nicest letter i could about dickie when i heard he was missing didnt that help i think it did but oh im terribly sorry tom all over this wonderful tablecloth marge had turned her drink over she wiped at the tablecloth rapidly tom came running back from the kitchen with a wet cloth perfectly all right he said watching the wood of the table turn white in spite of his wiping it wasnt the tablecloth he cared about it was the beautiful table im so sorry marge went on protesting tom hated her he suddenly remembered her bra hanging over the window in mongibello her underwear would be hanging over his chairs tonight if he invited her to stay here the idea disgusted him he forced himself to smile across the table at her i hope youll honor me by accepting a bed for the night not mine he added laughing but ive got two rooms upstairs and youre welcome to one of them thanks a lot all right i will she smiled broadly at him tom called mr greenleaf from a public telephone at about seven oclock mr greenleaf sounded friendlier than tom had expected and sadly hungry for any information about dickie ive told marge all i know tom said so shell be able to tell you anything ive forgotten im only sorry that i cant provide anything of real importance for the police to work on these police mr greenleaf said angrily im beginning to think richard is dead for some reason the italians dont want to admit he might be tom was shocked at mr greenleafs honesty about dickies possible death do you really think dickies killed himself mr greenleaf tom asked quietly mr greenleaf thought about it for a minute i dont know i think its possible yes i never thought much of my sons mental health tom im afraid i agree with you tom said would you like to talk to marge shes here with me no no thanks whens she coming back i think she said shed be going back to rome tomorrow if youd like to come to venice just for a slight rest mr greenleaf youre welcome to stay at my house but mr greenleaf refused the invitation tom and marge walked to a restaurant marge was in the mood to talk and that annoyed tom through their long dinner but he made an enormous effort not to get angry the worst was coming later tonight tom thought the boat ride marge wanted a private boat of course not the regular service that took people over from san marcos to the steps of santa maria della salute it was onethirty in the morning he felt exhausted and lay back in the boats seat as lazily as marge careful to keep his leg from touching hers chapter ten the arrival of mr greenleaf tom was awakened very early the next morning by a banging on his door he grabbed his pants and went down it was a telegram and he had to run back upstairs to get a tip for the man he stood in the cold living room and read it changed my mind would like to see you arriving am h greenleaf tom shook with fear well he had expected it he thought but he hadnt really he wasnt looking forward to it he ran upstairs and got back into his warm bed to try to catch some more sleep he kept wondering if marge would come in or knock on his door because she had heard that loud knock but he finally decided that she had slept through it he imagined greeting mr greenleaf at the door shaking his hand firmly and he tried to imagine his questions but his mind was too tired and that made him feel frightened and uncomfortable marge and tom went to the railroad station to meet mr greenleaf at eleven fortyfive it was raining and so windy and cold that the rain felt like ice on their faces finally there was mr greenleaf serious and gray marge rushed forward to kiss him on the cheek and he smiled at her hello tom he said loudly putting out his hand howre you very well sir and you tom suggested they go straight to his house but mr greenleaf wanted to go to a hotel first ill come over as soon as i check in i thought id try the gritti is that anywhere near your place mr greenleaf asked not too close but you can walk to san marcos and take a boat over tom said well come with you if you want if you just want to check in i thought we could all have lunch together unless youd rather see marge by yourself first he was the old ripley again came here mainly to talk to you mr greenleaf said is there any news marge asked mr greenleaf shook his head he was looking around nervously he hadnt answered toms question about lunch tom folded his arms put a pleasant look on his face and didnt try to talk any more mr greenleaf and marge were talking very quietly about some people they knew in rome tom observed that marge and mr greenleaf were very friendly though marge had said she had not known him before she met him in rome at lunch mr greenleaf talked a little more but his face kept its serious look and he still looked around as he spoke clearly hoping that dickie would come walking in at any moment the police hadnt found anything that could be called a clue he said and he had just arranged for an american private detective to come over and try to solve the mystery this made tom swallow thoughtfully he too believed that american detectives were better than the italians the questions tom thought would come at the house probably when he and mr greenleaf were alone he knew mr greenleaf wanted to talk to him alone and therefore he suggested coffee at the restaurant where they were before marge could suggest having it at home but marge sat around with them in the living room for half an hour after they got back finally tom frowned at her and looked at the stairs and she got the message put her hand over her mouth and announced that she was going up to have a short rest well tom mr greenleaf began heavily this is a strange end isnt it end well you living in europe now and richard none of us has suggested yet that he might be back in america tom said pleasantly no that couldnt be the officials in america have been watching for him mr greenleaf continued to walk not looking at him where do you really think he may be well sir he could be hiding in italy very easily if he doesnt use a hotel where he has to sign in are there any hotels in italy where one doesnt have to sign in no not officially but anyone who knows italian as well as dickie might manage it and is that your idea of what he may be doing mr greenleaf looked at him suddenly and tom saw that sad expression he had noticed on the first evening he had met him no i its possible thats all i can say about it he paused im sorry to say it mr greenleaf but i think theres a real possibility that dickie is dead mr greenleafs look didnt change because of that sadness you mentioned in rome what exactly did he say to you it was his general mood tom said the miles thing had obviously upset him hes the sort of man he really does hate attention of any kind violence of any kind tom bit his lips he did say that if one more thing happened he would just go crazy or he didnt know what he would do im afraid i dont agree with you that richard committed suicide mr greenleaf said well neither does marge i just said its a possibility i dont even think its the most likely thing thats happened you dont what do you think is that hes hiding tom said you know he could be in several other countries besides italy too perhaps he went to greece or france or anywhere else after he got back to naples because no one was looking for him until days later i know i know mr greenleaf said tiredly later that evening tom and marge called mr greenleaf at his hotel it was still early for dinner so they had drinks at a cafe in a street near mr greenleafs hotel tom tried hard to be pleasant and to talk in a friendly manner during dinner mr greenleaf was in a good mood because he had just telephoned his wife and found her in very good spirits and feeling much better it was a quiet dinner tom told a clean slightly funny joke and marge laughed loudly mr greenleaf refused to let tom pay for the dinner and then he said he was going back to his hotel because he didnt feel too good he was going back to rome tomorrow and marge decided to go with him they walked back to the hotel and said goodnight im very sorry i wasnt able to spend more time with you tom said so am i my boy maybe some other time mr greenleaf touched his shoulder tom walked back home with marge in a kind of fog of happiness it had all gone very well tom thought marge talked to him as they walked laughing because she had broken her bra and had to hold it up with one hand she said tom was thinking of the letter he had received from bob delancey this afternoon the first letter he had received from bob in many weeks tom had lived in a room in bobs house before leaving new york in the letter bob said that the police had questioned everybody in his house about an income tax crime of a few months ago the criminal it seemed had used bobs address to receive his checks and had gotten the checks by the simple means of taking the letters out of the mailbox where the mailman had put them the mailman had been questioned too bob had said and remembered the name george mcalpin on the letters bob seemed to think it was rather funny the mystery was who took the letters addressed to george mcalpin it was a very comforting letter for tom that income tax situation had been worrying him because he had known the police would find out about it at some time he was glad the wait had ended he couldnt imagine how the police would ever could ever connect tom ripley with george mcalpin he sat down in the living room to read bobs letter again when he got home marge had gone upstairs to pack her things and to go to bed tom was tired too but the freedom of tomorrow when marge and mr greenleaf would be gone was a pleasant thought he took his shoes off so he could put his feet up on the sofa lay back on a pillow and continued reading bobs letter the police think its somebody who came by occasionally to pick up his mail because none of the people in this house look like criminals how are the girls in venice how long are you staying there anyway forever tom thought maybe hed never go back to the states it wasnt really europe itself that made him feel this way but the evenings he had spent alone here and in rome evenings by himself simply looking at maps or lying around on sofas going through travel books evenings looking at the clothes his clothes and dickies and feeling dickies rings and running his fingers over the suitcase he had bought at guccis he loved objects not mountains of them but a certain few that he wanted to keep they gave a man respect for himself the things he possessed reminded him that he existed and made him enjoy his life it was as simple as that he existed dickies money gave him the opportunity to see greece to collect whatever he wanted to join art societies if he cared to and to give money to their work he thought he might rest then read some of his book whatever the hour he felt warm and sleepy in spite of the coffee he had drunk the edge of the sofa fitted his shoulders like somebodys arm or better than somebodys arm he decided he would spend the night here it was more comfortable than the sofa upstairs in a few minutes he might go up and get a blanket chapter eleven dickies rings tom he opened his eyes marge was coming down the stairs tom sat up she had his brown leather box in her hand i just found dickies rings in here she said as if she was having trouble breathing oh he gave them to me to take care of tom stood up when in rome i think he took a step back and picked up one of his shoes mostly in an effort to seem calm what was he going to do whyd he give them to you shed been looking for a needle to sew her bra tom thought why hadnt he put the rings somewhere else like in an inside pocket of that suitcase i dont really know tom said a moment of stupidity or something you know how he is he said if anything ever happened to him he wanted me to have his rings marge looked confused where was he going to palermo he was holding the shoe in both hands in a position to use it as a weapon a plan went quickly through his head hit her with the shoe then drag her out by the front door and drop her into the water hed say shed fallen slipped on the rocks and she was such a good swimmer hed thought she could save herself marge stared down at the box then he was going to kill himself yes if you want to look at it that way the rings they make it look more likely that he did why didnt you say anything about it before i think i absolutely forgot them i put them away so they wouldnt get lost and i never thought of looking at them since the day he gave them to me he either killed himself or changed his identity didnt he yes tom said it sadly and firmly youd better tell mr greenleaf yes i will mr greenleaf and the police i think were getting closer to the truth marge said tom was twisting the shoe in his hands like a pair of gloves now but still keeping it in position because marge was staring at him in a funny way she was still thinking was she playing games with him did she know now marge said seriously i just cant imagine dickie ever being without his rings and tom knew then that she hadnt guessed the answer he relaxed and sank down on the sofa and pretended to busy himself with putting on his shoes no he agreed automatically if it werent so late id call mr greenleaf now hes probably in bed and he wouldnt sleep all night if i told him i know im sorry i didnt mention it sooner he said it was just one of those yes it makes it kind of silly at this point for mr greenleaf to bring a private detective over doesnt it her voice shook tom looked at her she was going to cry this was the first moment tom realized that she was admitting to herself that dickie could be dead that he probably was dead tom went toward her slowly im sorry marge im really sorry that i didnt tell you sooner about the rings he put his arm around her he almost had to because she was leaning against him marge called mr greenleaf at eightthirty the next morning to ask how soon they could come over to his hotel but mr greenleaf probably noticed that she was upset tom heard her starting to tell him the story of the rings she used the same words that tom had used to her about the rings obviously marge had believed him but tom couldnt tell what mr greenleafs reaction was what did he say tom asked when marge had hung up marge sat down tiredly on a chair across the room he seems to feel the way i do he said it himself it seems that dickie meant to kill himself tom sat up on the edge of the sofa and loosened his tie he had slept in his clothes on the sofa and marge had awakened him when she had come down a few minutes ago he felt awful he stood up suddenly im going upstairs to wash he called to marge tom undressed in the room next to marges then went into the bathroom and turned on the shower after a look at himself in the mirror he decided to shave first and he went back to the room to get his electric razor which he had removed from the bathroom for no particular reason when marge had arrived on the way back he heard the telephone ring marge answered it tom leaned over the stairs listening oh thats fine she said oh that doesnt matter if we dont yes ill tell him all right well hurry toms just washing up oh less than an hour byebye he heard her walking toward the stairs and he stepped back because he wasnt dressed tom she called up the detective from america just got here he just called mr greenleaf and hes coming from the airport fine tom called back he turned the shower off and picked up his razor he would be glad when she was gone and he hoped she left this morning unless she and mr greenleaf decided to see what the detective was going to do with him tom knew that the detective had come to venice especially to see him if he hadnt he would have waited to see mr greenleaf in rome tom wondered if marge realized that too probably she didnt tom and marge took the boat to san marco and then walked to mr greenleafs hotel they telephoned up to mr greenleafs room mr greenleaf said that mr mccarron was there and asked them to come up mr greenleaf opened his door for them good morning he said he pressed marges arm like a father tom tom came in behind marge the detective was standing by the window a short fat man of about thirtyfive his face looked friendly but serious this is alvin mccarron mr greenleaf said miss sherwood and mr ripley i understand youre a friend of richards he asked we both are tom said do you have the rings mccarron asked looking from tom to marge yes marge said seriously getting up she took the rings from her purse and gave them to mccarron mccarron turned to tom when did he give them to you in rome as close as i can remember around february just a few days after the murder of freddie miles tom answered what did he say when he gave them to you he said that if anything happened to him he wanted me to have them i asked him what he thought was going to happen to him he said he didnt know but something might tom paused on purpose he didnt seem more upset at that particular moment than a lot of other times id talked to him so it didnt enter my mind that he was going to kill himself i knew he planned to go away that was all where asked the detective to palermo tom said he looked at marge im quite certain he gave them to me the day you spoke to me in rome at the inghilterra that day or the day before do you remember the date february marge said in a quiet voice what else mccarron asked tom what time of day was it had he been drinking no he drinks very little i think it was early afternoon he said it would be better if i didnt mention the rings to anybody and of course i agreed i put the rings away and completely forgot about them as i told miss sherwood i suppose because id told myself so strongly that he didnt want me to say anything about them what did you do with the rings i put them in an old box that i have just a little box i keep odd buttons in mccarron looked at him for a moment in silence out of that calm but bright irish face could come anything a difficult question a direct statement that he was lying in his mind tom concentrated on his own facts determined to defend them to his death in the silence tom could hear marges breathing and a cough from mr greenleaf almost made him jump mr greenleaf looked very calm almost bored tom wondered if he had fixed up some plan with mccarron against him based on the rings story did he have any enemies that you know of mccarron asked absolutely none tom said ive thought of that any reason you can think of why he might want to hide or take another identity tom said carefully possibly but its almost impossible in europe hed need a different passport any country he wanted to enter he would have to have a passport hed need one even to get into a hotel well how do you see it mr ripley mccarron wasnt nearly finished tom thought mccarron was going to see him alone later im afraid i agree with miss sherwood that it appears that hes killed himself ive said that before to mr greenleaf when was the last time you saw him miss sherwood on november when he left for san remo marge said quickly you were then in mongibello mccarron asked yes marge said i just missed seeing him in rome in february but the last time i saw him was in mongibello he was trying to avoid everyone in rome tom added thats why when he first gave me the rings i thought he had some idea of getting away from everyone he had known living in another city and just being alone for a time why do you think tom explained mentioning the murder of his friend freddie miles and its effect on dickie do you think richard knew who killed freddie miles no i certainly dont think a minute mccarron said to tom do you think that might explain his behavior do you think hes avoiding answering the police by hiding out now tom thought for a minute he didnt give me a single reason to think that do you think dickie was afraid of something i cant imagine of what tom said mccarron was staring at tom but whether he was considering his honesty or thinking over all they had said to him tom couldnt tell mccarron looked like a typical salesman tom thought he didnt think too much of him but on the other hand it wasnt wise to ignore your enemy mccarrons small soft mouth opened as tom watched him and he said would you mind coming downstairs with me mr ripley if youve still got a few minutes certainly tom said standing up we wont be long mccarron said to mr greenleaf and marge they walked toward the elevator was this the way they did it tom wondered a quiet word alone he would be handed over to the italian police and then mr mccarron would return to the room just as he had promised tom turned to mccarron as the elevator stopped and said seriously showing his teeth in a smile is this your first trip to venice yes said mccarron he passed by the hotel desk shall we go right in here he pointed at the coffee bar he spoke very politely all right tom agreed would mccarron accuse him in a place like this quietly laying down fact after fact on the table he took the chair that mccarron pulled out for him mccarron sat with his back to the wall mccarron looked at him his small mouth smiled on one side tom imagined three or four different beginnings you killed richard didnt you the rings are just too much arent they or tell me about the san remo boat mr ripley in detail or simply leading up quietly where were you on february when richard landed in naples all right but where were you living then where were you living in january for example can you prove it mccarron was saying nothing at all only looking down at his fat hands now and smiling weakly tom heard himself speaking in an amazingly calm voice did you have time to speak to lieutenant roverini when you came through rome as he asked it he realized that he wanted information to find out if mccarron had heard about the san remo boat no i didnt mccarron said how would you describe richards character he wanted to be a painter tom began but he knew hed never be a very good painter he tried to pretend he didnt care and that he was perfectly happy and leading exactly the kind of life he wanted to lead over here in europe tom wet his lips but i think he was beginning to get depressed his father didnt like his lifestyle as you probably know and dickie had gotten himself into a difficult situation with marge how do you mean marge was in love with him and he wasnt with her and at the same time he was seeing her so much in mongibello she kept on hoping tom began to feel on safer ground but he pretended to have difficulty in expressing himself he never actually discussed it with me he always spoke very highly of marge he was very fond of her but it was obvious to everybody marge too that he would never marry her but marge never quite gave up i think thats the main reason dickie left mongibello what do you mean never gave up what did she do she kept writing to him wanting to see him he wanted to be by himself particularly after the miles murder he wasnt in the mood to see marge and he was afraid that shed come up to rome from mongibello when she heard of all the trouble he was in why do you think he was nervous after the miles murder do you think richard killed freddie no i dont i never thought of it i dont know what kind of people are likely to kill somebody ive seen him angry when tom described the two days in rome when dickie he said had been angry and frustrated because of the police questioning and had actually moved out of his apartment to avoid phone calls from friends and strangers tom also talked again about the growing frustration in dickie because he had not been progressing as he had wanted to in his painting he described dickie as a proud young man who was determined to ignore his fathers wishes if he killed himself tom said i think it was because he realized certain failures in himself its much easier for me to imagine him as a suicide than a murderer but im not so sure that he didnt kill freddie miles are you mccarron was perfectly sincere tom was sure of that mccarron was even expecting him to defend dickie now because they had been friends tom felt some of the terror leaving him but only some of it like something melting very slowly inside him im not sure tom said but i just dont believe that he did im not sure either but it would explain a lot wouldnt it yes tom said everything mccarron called the next day from rome wanting the names of everyone dickie had known in mongibello most of the names marge had already given him but tom went through them all well i guess thats about all thanks very much mr ripley youre very welcome good luck then tom waited quietly in his house for several days just as anybody would do if the search for a missing friend had reached its most serious point on the evening of the sixth day after mr greenleaf and mccarron had left tom called mr greenleaf in rome he had nothing new to report but tom hadnt expected anything marge had gone back to the united states mr greenleaf said he would be leaving at the end of the week travelling first to paris where the french police were also carrying on the search mccarron was going with him and if nothing happened in paris they were both going home its obvious to me or to anybody mr greenleaf said that hes either dead or hiding from us theres not a corner of the world where the search for him hasnt been written about in the newspapers chapter twelve tom ripleys heroic journey venice june dear mr greenleaf while packing a suitcase today i found an envelope that richard gave me in rome and which for some reason i had forgotten until now on the envelope is written not to be opened until june and as it happens it is june the envelope contains richards will and he leaves his income and everything else to me i am shocked by this as you probably are but he seemed to know what he was writing i am only very sorry i did not remember having the envelope if i had it would have proven much earlier that dickie planned to kill himself i put it into a suitcase pocket and then i forgot it he gave it to me on the last occasion i saw him in rome when he was so depressed on second thoughts i am sending a copy of the will so that you may see it for yourself this is the first will i have ever seen in my life and i dont know what happens what should i do please give my kindest hello to mrs greenleaf and realize that i feel deeply for you both and regret the need to write this letter please let me hear from you as soon as possible my next address will be co american express athens greece most sincerely yours tom ripley in a way it was asking for trouble tom thought it might make people think again about the signatures on the will and on the checks but that was the mood he was in he had bought his ticket for greece in the middle of may and the days had grown finer and finer making him more and more anxious he had only two thousand dollars in his own name moved from dickies bank and saved out of dickies income the risk of trying to get all of dickies money the danger of it was exciting to him he was so bored after the quiet weeks in venice when each day that went by seemed to remind him of the dullness of his life roverini had stopped writing to him alvin mccarron had gone back to america and tom supposed that he and mr greenleaf had decided that further search was useless tom had decided in venice to make his journey to greece a heroic one he would see the islands swimming for the first time into his view as a living breathing brave individual not as a frightened little nobody from boston if he sailed right into the arms of the police in greece at least he would first experience standing in the wind at the front of a ship crossing the dark sea like an ancient hero so he had written the letter to mr greenleaf and mailed it three days before sailing from venice mr greenleaf would probably not get the letter for four or five days so there would be no time for mr greenleaf to hold him in venice with a message and make him miss his ship besides it looked better if he was calm about the matter unable to receive messages for another week or two until he got to greece it was better to pretend he didnt care whether he got the money or not he hadnt let the fact of the will delay even a little a trip he had planned to make two days before he sailed he went to tea at the house of a woman he had met the day he had started looking for a house in venice the woman titi greeted him ah hello thomas have you seen the afternoon paper they have found dickies suitcases and his paintings right here in the american express in venice her gold earrings shook with excitement what tom hadnt seen the papers he had been too busy packing that afternoon read it here all his clothes left there only in february they were sent from naples perhaps he is here in venice tom was reading it the string around the paintings had fallen off the paper said and while wrapping them again a worker had discovered the signature of r greenleaf on the paintings toms hands began to shake and he had to hold the sides of the paper to calm himself the paper said that the police were now examining everything carefully for fingerprints perhaps he is alive titi shouted i dont think i dont see why this proves he is alive perhaps somebody killed him or he killed himself after he sent the suitcases the fact that the paintings are under another name fanshaw he had the feeling that his friend who was sitting on the sofa staring at him was surprised by his nervousness so he calmed himself down quickly and said you see theyre looking through everything for clues they wouldnt be doing that if they were sure dickie had sent the suitcases himself why should he leave them in the name of fanshaw if he expected to pick them up again himself his passports even here it says he packed his passport perhaps he is hiding himself under the name of fanshaw oh my dear you need some tea it says here that the suitcases contained everything razor toothbrush shoes overcoat tom said hiding his terror in sadness he couldnt be alive and leave all that the murderer probably took everything from his body and left his clothes there because it was the easiest way of getting rid of them will you not be so sad until you know what the fingerprints are you are supposed to go on a pleasure trip tomorrow the day after tomorrow tom thought plenty of time for roverini to get his fingerprints and compare them with the prints on the paintings and in the suitcases he tried to turn his thoughts to greece he saw handsome buildings and blue skies he didnt want to go to greece with the worry about the fingerprints in venice hanging over him tom put his face in his hands and cried greece was finished exploded like a golden ball the worst of all was that roverini whose messages had been so friendly until now sent him no information at all about the discovery of the suitcases tom didnt sleep that night and then spent a day walking around his house while he tried to finish the endless little duties before leaving for greece he expected the police to come knocking at his door at any time of the day or night by the time he got onto the ship for greece tom felt like a walking ghost he was sleepless foodless full of coffee carried along only by his nerves he remembered last night lying face down on his bed with one arm twisted beneath him and being too tired to change his position when he awoke he felt better except that the arm he had been lying on hung uselessly at his side an angry courage rose in him what would happen if the radioman was receiving at this minute a message to arrest tom ripley he would stand up just as bravely as he was standing now or he might throw himself into the sea he wasnt afraid this was it this was the way he had hoped he would feel sailing to greece to look out at the black water all around him and not be afraid was almost as good as seeing the islands of greece coming into view he considered that he had been lucky beyond reason in escaping arrest for two murders lucky from the time he had taken dickies identity until now the first part of his life had been completely unfair he thought but the period with dickie and afterwards was like a wonderful dream but something was going to happen now in greece he felt and it couldnt be good his luck had held for too long the only thing he regretted was that he had not seen all the world yet he wanted to see australia and india he wanted to see japan then there was south america just to look at the art of those countries would be a pleasant rewarding lifes work he thought he had learned a lot about painting even while trying to copy dickies bad paintings at the art museums in rome he had discovered an interest in paintings that he had never realized before or perhaps that had not been in him before when the boat approached greece tom was standing looking at the land it wasnt a dream ahead of him it was a solid hill that he could walk on with buildings that he could touch if he got that far the police were waiting on the dock he saw four of them standing with folded arms looking up at the ship tom turned and walked slowly toward the policemen he wouldnt cause trouble he thought hed just tell them himself who he was there was a big newsstand behind the policemen and he thought of buying a paper perhaps they would let him the policemen stared back at him from over their folded arms as he approached them they wore black uniforms with caps tom smiled at them weakly one of them touched his cap and stepped to one side the others didnt move closer now tom was almost between two of them right in front of the newsstand and the policemen were staring forward again paying no attention to him at all tom bought several newspapers and walked back to the dock to wait for his luggage under the rs he stopped and opened the oldest italian paper which was four days old no one named robert s fanshaw found in mystery of greenleaf luggage only the fifth paragraph interested him the police discovered a few days ago that the fingerprints on the suitcases and paintings are the same as the fingerprints found in greenleafs apartment in rome therefore it is believed that greenleaf left the suitcases and paintings himself tom quickly opened another page there is the possibility that he committed suicide another possibility is that he exists at present under the false name of robert s fanshaw or another name a third possibility is that he was murdered after leaving his bags in venice anyway it is useless to search for richard greenleaf any longer because even if he is alive he does not have his richard greenleaf passport tom couldnt believe his good luck it meant he wasnt suspected at all it meant that the fingerprints really had guaranteed his innocence it meant that he was not going to jail and not going to die but also that he wasnt suspected at all he was free except for dickies will tom boarded the bus for athens the will could ruin it all he looked out the window but he didnt notice anything maybe the greek police were waiting for him at the american express office maybe the four men he had seen hadnt been police but some kind of soldiers he got off the bus and jumped in a taxi to go to the american express he sat up when he saw the american express sign and looked around the building for policemen maybe the police were inside tom looked in nothing unusual there was a letter waiting for him from mr greenleaf he opened it june dear tom received your letter yesterday it was not so much of a surprise to my wife and me as you may think we both realized that richard was very fond of you in spite of the fact that he never actually told us this in any of his letters as you said the will does suggest that richard has taken his own life my wife agrees with me that we should follow richards wishes so you have as far as the will is concerned my personal support i have given the copy you sent to my lawyers who will keep you informed about their progress in putting richards money and other properties in your name once more thank you for your assistance when i was overseas let us hear from you with best wishes herbert greenleaf was it a joke but the paper in his hand felt real besides mr greenleaf wouldnt joke like this not in a million years tom walked to the waiting taxi it was no joke it was his dickies money and his freedom he could have a house in europe and a house in america too if he chose he grew suddenly worried and his dreams disappeared was he going to see policemen waiting for him on every dock that he ever approached in alexandria in istanbul bombay rio no use thinking about that no use ruining his trip thinking about imaginary policemen where to where to the taxi driver was asking to a hotel please tom said with a laugh the best hotel the best the best the end
