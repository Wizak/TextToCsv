 from edge to edge and for all of its length fron central los angeles through beverly hills and west los angeles and santa monica to the sea wilshire boulevard was a walkway once there had been white lines on concrete and raised curbs to stop the people from interfering with the cars now the lines were gone and much of the concrete was covered with soil and grass there were even a few trees concrete strips had been left for bicycles and wider places for helicopters carlying cargo too big for the displacement booths wilshire was wide for a walkway people seemed to hug the edges even those on bikes and motor skates a boulevard built for cars was too big for mere people outlines of the street still showed through ridges in the grass marked where curbs had been with breaks where there had been driveways some stretches in westwood had a concrete center divider the freeway ramps were unchanged and unused someday the city would do something about them jerrybeny jansen lived in what had been a seaside motel halfway between bakersfield and san francisco on longago summer nights the shady rest had been packed with transients at ten dollars a head now it made a dandy apartment house with swimming pool and everything including a displacement booth outside the managers office there was a girl in the booth when jenybeny left his apartment he glimpsed long wavy brown hair and the shape of her back in the instant before she disappeared janice wolfe too bad she hadnt waited but she hadnt even seen him nobody was ever around the booths long enough to say hello to you could meet someone by hovering outside the booths but what would they think meeting people was for the clubs a displacement booth was a glass cylinder with a rounded top the machinery that made the magic was invisible buried beneath the booth coin slots and a telephone dial were set into the glass at sternum level jenybeny inserted his cb a credit card below the coin slots he dialed by punching numbered buttons withdrawing the credit card closed a circuit an eye blink later he was in an office in the central broadcasting association building in downtown los angeles the office was big and empty only once in an aeon was all that empty space ever used though several score of newstapers saw it for a few seconds each day one wall was lined with displacement booths a curved desk down at the end was occupied by jenybenys boss george bailey was fat from too much sitting and darkly tanned by the nevada sun he commuted to work every morning via the longdistance booths at los angeles international today he waved at jeriybeny without speaking routine then jerryberry chose one of several cameras and slung the padded strap over his shoulder he studied several lists of numbers posted over the table before picking one he turned and moved to avoid three more newstapers stepping out of booths they nodded he nodded they passed as he reached for a booth door a woman flicked in in front of him rush hour he smiled at her and stepped over to the next booth consulted the list dialed and was gone he had not spoken to anyone that morning the east end of wilshire boulevard was a most ordinary tintersection between high blocky buldings jenybeny looked around even as he was dialing nothing newsworthy no he was two blocks away and dialing he punched the numbered buttons with a ballpoint pen when he remembered nonetheless his index finger was calloused the streets of the inner city were empty this early in a minute or so jerryberry was in sight of the freeway he stepped out of the booth to watch trucks and bulldozers covering this part of the pasadenaharbor freeway with topsoil old machines find new use but others were covering the event he moved on the booths were all identical he might have been in a fullvision theater watching scenes flick around him he was used to the way things jerked about he flicked west on wilshire waiting for something to happen it was a cheap effective way to gather news at a chocolate dollar per jump per man c b a could afford to support a score of wandering newstapers in addition to the regular staff they earned low salaries plus a bonus for each news item plus a higher bonus per item used the turnover was high it had been higher before cba learned not to jumble the numbers at random an orderly progression down a single street was easier on the mind and nerves jerryberry jansen knew every foot of wilshire at twentyeight he was old enough to remember cars and trucks and traffic lights when the city changed it was the streets that had changed most he watched wilshire change as he dialed at the old hatshaped brown derby they were converting the parking lot into a miniature golf course about time they did something with all that wasted space he queried bailey but bailey wasnt interested the miracle mile was a landscaped section suddenly there were people throngs of shoppers so thick that many preferred to walk a block instead of waiting for a booth they seemed stratified with the older people hugging the curbs and the teens taking the middle of the street jerryberry had noticed it before as a child hed been trained to cross only in the crosswalks with the light sometimes his training came back and he found himself looking both ways before he could step out from the curb he moved on west following the list of numbers that was his beat the mall had been a walkway when displacement booths were no more than a theorem in quantum mechanics dips in the walk showed where streets had crossed but the santa monica mall had always been a sanctuary for pedestrians and windowshoppers here were several blocks of shops and restaurants and theaters low buildings that did not block the sky displacement booths were thick here people swarmed constantly around and in and out of them some travelers carried foldup bicycles many wore change purses from noon onward there was always the tension of too many people trying to use the same space for the same purpose the argument started outside penneys department store at the time one could see only that the police officer was being firm and the woman middleaged big and brawny was screaming at the top of her lungs a crowd grew not because anyone gave a damn but because the two were blocking the walkway people had to stream around them some of them stopped to see what was happening many later remembered hearing the policeman repeating madam i place you under arrest on suspicion of shoplifting anything you say in a voice that simply did not carry if the officer had used his shockstick then nothing more would have happened maybe then again he might have been mobbed already the crowd blocked the entire mall and too many of them were shouting genial or sarcastic suggestions random insults and a thousand variations of get out of my way and i cant you idiot for any to be heard at all at jerryberry jansen flicked in and looked quickly about him while his hands were reinserting his credit card his eyes registered the ancient shops at the end of the mall and lingered a moment on the entrance to romanoffs anyone newsworthy sometimes they came the big names for the cuisine or the publicity no passed on jumped to the crowd in front of penneys two blocks down there were booths nearer but he didnt know the numbers offhand jenybeny picked up his card and stepped out of the booth he signaled the studio but didnt bother to report circumstantial details he could give later but he turned on his camera and the event was now real he jogged the two blocks whatever was happening might end without him a young bemused face turned at jenyberrys hail excuse me sir can you tell me how this started nope sony i just got here said the young man and he strolled off he would be edited from the tape but other heads were turning noticing the arrival of a lean young man with an open curious friendly face topped by redblond hair curly as cotton a tiny mike at his lips a small plug in one ear a coin purse at his belt in his hands a heavy gyrostabilized teevee camera equipped with a directional mike a newstaper one pair of eyes turned for an instant too long the woman swung her purse the policemans arm came up too late to block the purse which bounced solidly off his head something heavy in that purse the policeman dropped things happened very fast jerryberry talked rapidly to himself while he panned the camera occasional questions in his earpiece did not interrupt the flow of his report though they guided it the gyrostabiized camera felt like a living thing in his hands it followed the woman with the heavy purse as she pushed her way through the crowd shot jerrybeny a venomous look and ran for a displacement booth it watched someone break a jewelers window snatch up a handful of random jewelry and run the directional mike picked up the scream of an alarm the police officer was still down jerryberry went to help him it occurred to him that of those present the policeman was most likely to know what had been going on the voice in his earpiece told him that others were on their way even as his eye found them leaving the booths faces he knew on men carrying cameras like his own he knelt beside the policeman officer can you tell me what happened the uniformed man looked up with hurt bewildered eyes he said something that the directional mike picked up but jenybenys ears lost it in the crowd noise he heard it later on the news wheres my hat jerrybeny repeated what happened here while a dozen cba men around him were interviewing the crowd and police were pouring out of the displacement booths the flow of blue uniforms looked like far more than they were they had to use their shocksticks to get through the crowd some of the spectatorsshoppersstrollers had decided to leave a wise decision but impractical the nearest booths could not be used at all they held passengers cased in glass each trying to get his door open against the press of the mob every few seconds one would give up and flick out and another trapped passenger would be pushing at the door for blocks around there was no way to get into a displacement booth as fast as anyone left a booth someone else would flick in most were nondescript citizens who came to gape a few carried big cardboard rectangles carelessly printed in fluorescent colors often with the paint still wet a different few nondescript otherwi e had rocks in their pockets for jerryberry kneeling above the felled policeman and trying to get audible sense out of him it all seemed to explode he looked up and it was a riot its a riot he said awed the directional mike picked it up the crowd surged and he was moving he looked back trying to see if the policeman had gained his feet if he hadnt he could be hurt but the crowd surged away in this mob there was no conservation of matter there were sources and sinks in it and today all the sinks were sources the flow had to go somewhere a young woman pushed herself close to jenybeny her eyes were wide her hair was wild a kind of rage a kind of joy made her face a battlefield legalize directcurrent stimulus she screamed at him she lunged and caught the snout of jenyberrys camera and mike and pulled it around to face her legalize wireheading jerryberry wrenched the camera free he turned it toward the big display window in penneys the glass was gone men crawled in the display window looting jenybeny held the camera high taking pictures of them over the bobbing heads he had the scene for a moment and then three signs shot up in front of the camera one said tanstaafl and one bore a mushroom cloud and the words power corrupts and jertybeny never read the third because the crowd surged again and he had to scramble to keep his feet there were men and women and children being trampled here he could be one of them how had it happened hed seen it all but he didnt understand he tried to keep the camera over his head he got a big brawny hairy type carrying a stack of teevees under his ann half a dozen twentyinch sets almost an inch thick the thief saw the camera facing him and the solenm face beneath and he roared and lunged toward jerryberry jerrybeny abruptly realized that there were people here who would not want to be photographed the big man had dropped his teevees and was plowing toward him with murder on his face jerrybeny had to drop his camera to get away when he looked back the big man was smashing the camera against a lamp post idiot the scene was on tape now in the cba buildings in los angeles and in denver the riot splashed outward jenybeny perforce went with it he concentrated on keeping his feet the explosive growth of the mall riot has taken enforcement agencies by surprise police have managed to hold the perimeter and are letting people through the lines but necessarily in small numbers the screen showed people being filtered through a police blockade one at a time they looked tired stunned one had two pockets full of stolen wristwatches he did not protest when they confiscated the watches and led him away a blankeyed girl maintained a death grip on a rough wooden stick glued to a cardboard rectangle the cardboard was crumpled and torn the daygb colors smeared meanwhile all displacement booths in the area have been shut down from outside the enclosed area includes fourteen city blocks viewers are warned away from the following areas these scenes were taken by cba helicopter most of the street lights were out those left cast monstrous shadows through the mall orange flames flickered in the windows of a furniture store diminutive figures angered by spotlights in the helicopter pointed and shouted silently into the camera viewpoint the deep earnest voice went on we are getting no transmissions from inside the affected area a dozen cba newsmen and an undisclosed number of police in the area have not been heard from many of the rioters are armed a cba helicopter was shot down early today but was able to crashland beyond the perimeter close shot of a helicopter smashed against a brick wall two men being carried out on stretchers in obvious haste the source of weapons is not known police conjecture that they may have been looted from kerrs sport shop which has a branch in the mall how did it all start the square brown face looking out of the tridee screen was known throughout the englishspeaking world when news was good that wide mouth would smile enormously the filter cigarette in the middle of it smoldering delicately between white front teeth it was not smiling now that expression was more earnest it was shaken jenyberry jansen looked back with no expression at all he had thrown away his camera and seen it destroyed he had dropped his coin purse and ear mike into a trash can not being a newsman was a good idea during the mall riot now an hour after the police had let him through he was still wandering aimlessly he had no goal almost he had thrown away his identity he stood in front of an appliancestore window watching teevee the deep precise voice of wash evans was audible through the glass barely how did it all start evans vanished and jenybeny watched scenes taken by his own cam era a milling crowd mostly trying to get past a disturbance a blueuniformed man a brawny woman with a heavy purse the officer was trying to arrest a suspected shopljfter who has not been ident fied when this man appeared on the scene picture of jertyberry jansen camera held high caught in the view of another cba camera barry jerome jansen a roving newstaper it was he who reported the disturbance and reported it as a riot to this man bailey at his desk in the cba building jenybeny twitched sooner or later he would have to report to bailey and explain where his camera had gone hed picked up some good footage and it was being used a string of bonuses waiting for him unless bailey docked him for the cost of the camera george lincoln bailey sent in a crew to cover the disturbance he also put the report on teevee practically live editing it as it came at this point anyone with a teevee anywhere in the united states could see the violence being filmed by a dozen veteran cba newstapers the square dark face returned and then it all blew up the population of the mall expanded catastrophically and they all started breaking things why wash evans flashed a white grin with a cigarette in it well it seems that there are people who like riots jerryberry cocked his head he had never heard it put quite like that now that seems silly who would want to be caught in a riot wash evans had long expressive fingers with pink nails he began ticking off items on his fingers first more police to stop whats being reported as a riot second more newstapers third anyone who wants publicity on the screen behind wash evans signs shot out of a sea of moving heads a girls face swelled enormously so close she seemed all mouth and shrieked legalize wireheading anyone with a cause anyone who wants the ear of the public there are newsmen here man and cameras and publicity behind evans the scene jumped that was angela monk coming out of a displacement booth angela monk the semiporno movie actress very beautiful in a dress of loosemesh net made from white braided yarn very selfpossessed in the split second before she saw what shed flicked into she tried to dodge back inside and to hell with the free coverage a yell went up hands pulled the door open before she could dial again other hands pulled her out then there are people who have never seen a riot in person a lot of them came what they think about it now is something else again now all of these might not be a big fat percentage of the public how many people would be dumb enough to come watch a riot but that little percentage they all came at once from all over the united states and some other places too and the more there were the bigger the crowd got the louder it got the better it looked to the looters evans folded down his remaining finger and the looters came from everywhere too these days you can get from anywhere to anywhere in three flicks scenes shifted in evanss background store windows being smashed a subdued wail of sirens a cba helicopter thrashing bout in midair an ape of a man carrying stolen tridees under one ann evans looked soberly out at his audience so there you have it an unidentified shoplifting suspect a roving newsman who reported a minor disturbance as a riot good god jerrybeny jansen was jolted completely awake theyre blaming me theyre blaming me too said george bailey he ran his hands through his hair glossy shoulderlength white hair that grew in a fringe around a dome of suntanned scalp youre second in the chain im tired if only they could find the woman who hit the cop theyhavent not a sign of her jansen you look like hell i should have changed suits this one s been through a riot jerryberrys laugh sounded forced and was im glad you waited it must be way past your quitting time oh no weve been in conference all night we only broke up about twenty minutes ago damn wash evans anyway have you heard i heard some of it a couple of the directors want to fire him not unlike the ancient technique of using gasoline to put out a fire there were some even wilder suggestions have you seen a doctor im not hurt just bruised and tired and hungry come to think of it i lost my camera youre lucky you got out alive i know george bailey seemed to brace himself i hate to be the one to tell you were going to have to let you go jansen what you mean fire me yah public pressure i wont make it pretty for you wash evanss instant documentary has sort of torn things open it seems you caused the mall riot it would be nice if we could say we fired you for it but but i didnt yes you did think about it bailey wasnt looking at him so did i cb a may have to fire me too now jerrybeny stopped and started over now wait a minute if youre saying what i think youre saying but what about freedom of the press we talked about that too i didnt exaggerate what was happening i reported a a disturbance when it turned into a riot i called it a riot did i lie about anything anything oh in a way bailey said in a tired voice youve got your choice about where to point that camera you pointed it where there was fighting didnt you and i picked out the most exciting scenes when we both finished it looked like a small riot fighting everywhere then everyone who wanted to be in the middle of a small riot came flicking in just like evans said and in thirty seconds we had a large riot you know what somebody suggested a time limit on news a law against reporting anything until twentyfour hours after it happens can you imagine anything sillier for ten thousand years the human race has been working to send news farther and faster and now oh hell jansen i dont know about freedom of the press but the riots still going on and everyones blaming you youre fired thanks jenybeny surged out of his chair on what felt like the last of his strength bailey moved just as fast but by the time he got around the desk jeriyberry was inside a booth dialing he stepped out into a warm black night he felt sick and miserable and very tired it was two in the morning his paper suit was torn and crumpled and clammy george bailey stepped out of the booth behind him thought so now jansen lets talk sense how did you know id be here i had to guess youd come straight home jansen you wont suffer for this you may make money on it cb a wants an exclusive interview on the riot your viewpoint thirtyfive hundred bucks screw that in addition theres two weeks severance pay and a stack of bonuses we used a lot of your tape and when this blows over im sure well want you back blows over huh oh it will news gets stale awfully fast these days i know jansen why dont you want thirtyfive hundred bucks youd play me up as the man who started the mall riot make me more valuable wait a minute who have you got in mind for the interview who else wash evans hes fair youd get your say bailey considered him let me know if you change your mind youd have a chance to defend yourself and youd get paid besides no chance all right bailey went for eric jansen and his family displacement booths came as a disaster at first he didnt see it that way he was twentyeight when jumpshift inc demonstrated the augmented tunnel diode effect on a lead brick he watched it on television he found the prospects exciting eric jansen had never worked for a salary he wrote poetry and articles and a few short stories highly polished admired by a small circle of readers sold at infrequent intervals to lowpaying markets that he regarded as prestigious his money came from inherited stocks if he had invested in jumpshift then but millions could tell that sad story it was too risky then he was thirtyone when commercial displacement booths began to be sold for cargo transport he was not caught napping many did not believe that the magic could work until suddenly the phenomenon was changing their world but eric jansen looked into the phenomenon very carefully he found that there was an inherent limitation on the augmented tunnel diode effect teleportation over a difference in altitude made for drastic temperature changes a drop of seven degrees fahrenheit for every mile upward and vice versa due to conservation of energy conservation of momentum plus the rotation of the earth put a distance limit on lateral travel a passenger flicking east would find himself kicked upward by the difference between his velocity and the earths flicking west he would be slapped down north and south he would be kicked sideways cargo and passenger displacement booths were springing up in every city in america but eric jansen knew that they would always be restricted to short distances even a tenmile jump would be bumpy a passenger flicking halfway around the equator would have to land running at half a mile per second jumpshift stock was skyhigh eric jansen decided it must be overpriced he considered carefully then made his move he sold all of his general telephone stock if anyone wanted to talk to someone he would just go wouldnt he a displacement booth took no longer than a phone call he tried to sell his general motors wisely but everyone else wisely made the same decision and the price fell like a dead bird at least he got something back on the stock he owned in motorcycle and motorscooter companies later he regretted that it developed that people rode motorcycles and scooters for fun now with the streets virtually empty they were buying more than ever still he had fluid cash and the opportunity to make a killing airline stock had dropped with other forms of transportation before the general public could realize its mistake eric jansen invested every dime in airlines and aircraft companies the first displacement booths in any city were links to the airport that lousy halfhour drive from the center of town the heavy taxi fare in were gone forever and the booths couldnt compete with the airlines themselves of course you still had to check in early and the planes took off only at specified times what it amounted to was that plane travel was made easier but shortdistance travel via displacement booth was infinitely easier and planes still crashed cassettes had copped the entertainment market so that television was mostly news these days you didnt have to go anywhere to find out what was happening just turn on the tv a plane flight wasnt worth the hassle as for the telephone stock people still made longdistance calls they tended to phone first before they went visiting they would give out a phonebooth number whereas they would not give out a displacementbooth number the airlines survived somehow but they paid rockbottom dividends barry jerome jansen grew up poor in the midst of a boom period his father hated the displacement booths but used them because there was nothing else jerryberry accepted that irrational hatred as part of his fathers personality he did not share it he hardly noticed the displacement booths they were part of the background the displacement booths were the most important part of a newstapers life and still he hardly noticed their existence until the day they turned on him in the morning there were messages stored in his phone he heard them out over breakfast half a dozen news services and tapezines wanted exclusives on the riot one call was from bailey at cba the price had gone up to four thousand the others did not mention price but one was from playboy that gave him furiously to think playboy paid high and they liked unpopular causes three people wanted to murder him on two of them the teevee was blanked the third was a graying dowdy woman all fat and hate and disappointed hopes who showed him a kitchen knife and started to tell him what she wanted to do with it jerrybeny cut her off shuddering he wondered if any of them could possibly get hold of his displacementbooth number there was a check in the mail severance pay and bonuses from cba so that was that he was setting the dishes in the dishwasher when the phone rang he hesitated then decided to answer it was janice wolfe a pretty oval face brown eyes a crown of long wavy soft brown hair and not an anonymous killer she lost her smile as she saw him you look grim could you use some cheering up yes jerryberry said fervently come on over apartment six booth number i live here remember he laughed hed forgotten you got used to people living anywhere and everywhere george bailey lived in nevada he commuted to work every morning in three flicks using the longdistance displacement booths at las vegas and los angeles international airports those longdistance booths had saved the airlines after his father had dribbled away most of his stocks to feed his family they had been operating only two years and come to think of it doorbell over coffee he told janice about the riot she listened sympathetically asking occasional questions to draw him out at first jerrybeny tried to talk entertainingly until he realized first that she wasnt indulging in a spectator sport and second that she knew all about the riot already she knew hed been fired too thats why i called they put it on the morning news she told him it figures what are you going to do now get drunk alone if have to would you like to spend a lost weekend with me she hesitated youll be bitter yah i probably will not fit to live with hey janice do you know anything about how the longdistance displacement booths work no should i the mall riot couldnt have happened without the longdistance booths that damn wash evans might at least have mentioned the fact except that i only just thought of it myself funny there hasnt ever been a riot that happened that quick ill come with you janice decided what good you dont start drinking this early in the morning do you i guess not are you free today every day during summer i teach school oh so whatll we do san diego zoo he suggested at random sounds like fun they made no move to get up it felt peaceful in jerrybenys tiny kitchen nook there was still coffee you could get a bad opinion of me this way i feel like tearing things up go ahead mean it me too she said serenely you need to tear things up fine go ahead after that you can try to put your life back together just what kind of school do you teach janice laughed fifth grade there was quiet you know what the punch line is wash evans wants to interview me after that speech he made that sounds like a good idea she said surprisingly gives you a chance to give your side of the story you didnt really cause the mall riot did you no no janice hes just too danm good hed make mincemeat of me by the time he got through id be the man who caused the mall riot in every englishspeaking country in the world and some others too because he gets translations hes just a commentator jerrybeny started to laugh he makes it look so easy he said a hundred million eyes out there watching him and he knows it have you ever seen him selfconscious have you ever heard him at a loss for words my dad used to say it about writing but its true for wash evans the hardest trick in the world is to make it look easy so easy that any clod thinks he can do it just as well hell i know what caused the mall riot the news program yes hes right there but the longdistance displacement booth did it too control those and we could stop that kind of riot from ever happening again but what could i tell wash evans about it what do i know about displacement booths well what do you know jerryberry jansen looked into his coffee cup for a long time presently he said i know how to find out things i know how to find out who knows most about what and then go ask legwork they hammered at it in the journalism classes i know legwork he looked up and met her eyes then he lunged across the table to reach the phone hello oh hi jansen changed your mind yes but good good ill put you through to yes but oh okay go ahead i want some time to do some research now damn it jensen you know that time is just what we dont have old news is no news what kind of research displacement booths why that never mind its your business how much time how much can you afford damn little bailey cba upped my price to four thousand this morning how come you didnt see it its on every screen in the country the rioters broke through the police line theyve got a good section of venice now and there are about twice as many of them because the police didnt shut down the displacement booths in the area until about twenty minutes too late twenty minutes bailey seemed actually to be grinding his teeth we held off reporting the breakthrough until they could do it we did ab s reported it live on all stations thats where all the new rioters came from then it looks like the mall riot is going to last a little longer that it does and you want more time things are working out arent they then sorry those abs bastards how much time do you want as much as i can get a week youve got to be kidding you maybe can get twentyfour hours only i cant make the decision why dont you talk to evans himself fine put him on the teevee went on hold paleblue flow patterns floated upward in what had become a twentyinch kalliroscope waiting jenyberry said if this riot gets any bigger i could be more famous than hitler janice set his coffee beside him she said or mrs olearys cow the screen came on jansen can you get over here right now wash evans wants to talk to you in person okay jerryberiy clicked off he felt a thrumming inside him as if he felt the motion of the world and the world were spinning faster and faster surely things were happening fast janice said no lost weekend not yet love have you any idea what youve let me in for i may not sleep for days ill have to find out what teleportation is what it does where do i start wash evans youd better get moving right he bolted his coffee in three swift gulps thanks thanks for coming over thanks for jarring me off the dime well see how it works out he went pulling on a coat wash evans was five feet four inches tall people sometimes forgot that size was invisible in a teevee closeup in the middle of a televised interview when the camera was flashing back and forth between two angry faces then the deep sure voice and the dark mobile expressive face of wash evans could be devastatingly convincing wash evans looked up at jenybeny jansen and said ive been wondering if i owe you an apology take your time said jenybeny he finished buttoning his coat i dont fact is i psyched out the mall riot as best i knew how and i think i did it right i didnt tell the great unwashed public you caused it all i just told it like it happened you left some things out all right now weve got something to talk about sit down they sat their faces were level now jerryberry said this present conversation is not for publication and is not to be considered an interview i have an interview to sell i dont want to undercut myself i accept your terms on behalf of the network well give you a tape of this conversation im making my own jerrybeny tapped his inside pocket which clicked wash evans grinned of course you are my child now what did i miss displacement booths well sure if the booths had been cut off earlier if the booths didnt exist youre kidding no youre not jansen thats a wishing horse displacement booths are here to stay i know but think about this newstapers have been around longer than displacement booths roving newstapers like me weve been using the booths since they were invented so why didnt the mall riot happen earlier i see what you mean hmrn the airport booths i ili jansen are you actually going to face the great unwashed teevee public and tell them to give up longdistance displacement booths no i dont know just what i have in mind thats why i want some time i want to know more uhhuh said evans and waited jerrybeny said turn it around are you going to try to talk the public into giving up news programs no maybe to put some restrictions on newstaping practices were too fast these days a machine wont work without friction neither does a civilization but wed ruin the networks wouldnt we youd cut your own throat oh id be out evans mashed out a cigarette take away the news broadcasts and they wouldnt have anything left to sell but educational teevee nothing to sell but toys and breakfast cereal jansen i dont know good said jerryberry you question my dispassionate judgment evans chuckled in his throat im on both sides suppose we do an interview live at ten tonight thatll give you twelve hours twelve hours thats enough isnt it you want to research teleportation i want to get this in while people are still interested in the riot not just for the ratings but because we both have something to say jerryberry tried to interrupt but evans overrode him well advance you a thousand and three more if we do the interview nothing if we dont thatll get you back on time jerryberry accepted it one thing can you make bailey forget to cancel my cba card for a while i may have to do a lot of traveling ill tell him i dont know if hell do it he flicked in at los angeles international offcenter in a long curved row of displacement booths upright glass cylinders with rounded tops no different from the booths on any street corner on the opposite wall a good distance away large red letters said twa he stood a moment thinking then he dialed again he was home at the shady rest he dialed again he was near the end of the row a different row with no curve to it and the opposite wall bore the emblem of united the terminal was empty except for one man in a blue uniform who was waxing the floor jenyberry stepped out for upwards of a minute he watched the line of booths people flicked in at random generally they did not even look up they would dial a long sthng of digits sometimes making a mistake snarling something and starting over and be gone there were so many that the booths themselves seemed to be flickering he took several seconds of it on the minox beneath the united emblem was along long row of empty counters with scales between them for luggage the terminal was spotless and empty unused haunted by a constant flow of ghosts a voice behind him said you want something is there a managers office the uniformed man pointed down an enormous length of corridor the maintenance sections down that way where the boarding area used to be ill call ahead let them know youre coming the corridor was long unnecessarily long and it echoed the walk was eating up valuable time and then an open cart came from the other end and silently pulled up alongside him a straightbacked old man in a onebutton business lounger said hello want a ride thanks jenybeny climbed aboard he handed over his cba credit card im doing some research for a a documentary of sorts what can you tell me about the longdistance booths anything you like im nils kjerulf i helped install these booths and ive been working on them ever since how do they work where do i start do you know how a normal booth works sure the load isnt supposed to exist at all between the two endpoints like the electron in a tunnel diode an answer right out of the science section of any tapezine beyond that he could fake it this nils kjerulf was lean and ancient with deep smile wrinides around his eyes and mouth his hair was thick and white he said they had to give up that theory when youre sending a load to mars say you have to assume that something exists in the ten minutes or so it takes the load to make the trip conservation of energy all right what is it for ten minutes its a kind of superneutrino thats what they tell me im not a physicist i was in business administration in college a few years ago they gave me a year of retraining so i could handle longdistance displacement machinery if youre really interested in theory you ought to ask someone at cape canaveral here we are two escalators one going up one motionless they rode up jenybeny asked why didnt they build closer think of all the walking wed save you never heard a taking off sound is only part of it if a plane ever crashed here nobody would want it hitting all the main buildings at once the escalator led to two semicircular chambers one was empty but for a maze of chairs and couches and low partitions all done in old chrome and fading orange in the other the couches had been ripped out and replaced with instrument consoles jerrybeny counted half a dozen men supervising the displays a dim snoring sound began somewhere like an electric razor going in the nextdoor apartment jeriybeny turned his head seeking it was outside outside behind a wall of windows a tiny singleengine plane taxied down a runway yes we still function as an airport said nils kjerulf skydiving sport flying gliding i fly some myself the jumbojet pilots used to hate us we use up just as much landing time as a now weve got the runways to ourselves i gather you were a manager somewhere right here iran this terminal before anyone had heard of teleportation i watched it ruin us thirty years mr jansen with no offense intended whatever why did they train a professional administrator in quantum displacement physics why not the other way around there werent any experts where the longdistance booths were concerned mr jansen theyre new what have you learned in two years do you still get many breakdowns we still do every two weeks or so something goes out of synch then we go out of service for however long it takes to find it and fix it usually about an hour and what happens to the passenger kjerulf looked surprised nothing he stays where he started or rather that giant neutrino we were talking about is reflected back to the transmitter if the receiver cant pick it up the worst thing that can happen is that the link to the velocity damper could be lost in which case but weve developed safeguards against that no the passengers just stop coming in and we go out of service and the other companies take the overflow there isnt any real competition between the companies anymore whats the point twa and united and eastern and the rest used to advertise that they had better meals in flight more comfortable seats prettier hostesses like that how long do you spend in a displacement booth so when we converted over we set the dialing system up so you just dial los angeles international or whatever and the companies get customers at random everyone saves a fortune in advertising an antitrust suit would have us dead to rights nobodys done it because theres no point it works the way we run it each company has its own velocity shift damper we couldnt all get knocked out at once in an emergency i think any of the companies could handle all of the longdistance traffic mr kjerulf what is a velocity shift damper kjerulf looked startled jenybeny said i took journalism ah its not just curiosity my dad lost a fortune on airline stock so did i said kjerulf halfsmiling with old pain oh sometimes i feel ive sold out the booths couldnt possibly compete with the airlines could they they wouldnt send far enough yet they ruined us my dad figured the same way and now the booths do send that far and im working for them or theyre working for me there wasnt all that much reason to build the longdistance systems at airports lots of room here of course and an organization already set up but they really did it to save the airline companies a little late perhaps some day theyll turn us into a public utility kjerulf looked about the room then called to a man seated near the flat wall of the semicircle dan yo the man boomed without looking up can you spare me twenty minutes for a publicrelations job the man stood up then climbed up on his chair he looked slowly about the room jerryberry guessed that he could see every instrument board from where he was standing he called sure no sweat they took the cart back to the terminal they entered a booth jerrybeny inserted his c b a credit card then waited while kjerulf dialed they were in a concrete building beyond large square windows a sunlit sea of blue water heaved and splashed almost at floor level men looked around curiously recognized nils kjerulf and turned back to their work lake michigan and out there kjerulf pointed jerrybeny saw a tremendous white mass a flattened dome very regular a great softly rounded island is the united air lines velocity damper all of the dampers look about like that but they float in different lakes or oceans aeroflot uses the caspian sea the twa damper is in the gulf of mexico just what is it essentially its a hell of a lot of soft iron surronded by a hell of a lot more foam plastic enough to float it plus a displacementbooth receiver feeding into the iron look see it surge the island rose several feet slowly then fell back as slowly ripples moved outward and became waves as they reached the station that must have been a big load now heres how it works you know that the rotation of the earth puts a limit on how far you can send a load if you were to shift from here to rio de janeiro say youd flick in moving up and sideways mainly up because rio and la are almost the same distance from the equator but with the longdistance booths the receiver picks up the kinetic energy and shunts it to the united air lines velocity damper that big mass of iron surges up or down or sideways until the water stops it or someone flicks in from rio and the damping body stops cold jerryberry thought about it what about conservation of rotation it sounds like youre slowing down the earth we are theres nothing sacred about conservation of rotation except that the energy has to go somewhere there are pumps to send water through the damper bodies if they get too hot jerryberry pulled out the minox mind if i take some pictures no go ahead the minox was a movie camera but it would not have the resolution of a press camera no matter if he had the time he could comeback not that he thought he would he took shots of the men at work in the station of nils kjerulf with his back to the windows he shot ahnost a minute of the great white island itself he was hoping it would surge and presently it did sinking sideways surging up again waves beat at the station a jet of white steam sprayed from the top of the great white mass good he said briskly to himself he folded the spidery tripod legs and dropped the camera in his pocket he turned to kjerulf who had been watching the proceedings with some amusement mr kjerulf can you tell me anything about traffic control is there any how do you mean customs not exactly but tell me about customs the customs terminal in los angeles is at twa you havent been out of the country recently no well any bigcity airport has a customs terminal in a small country theres likely to be just one if you dial a number outside the country any country you wind up in somebodys customs terminal the booths there dont have dials you see you have to cross the customs line to dial out clever are there any restrictions on traffic within the united states no you just drop your chocolate dollars in and dial unless its a police matter if the police know that someones trying to leave the city they may set up a watch in the terminals we can put a delay on the terminals to give a detective time to look at a passengers face and see if hes who they want but nothing to stop passengers from coming in no except that its possible to kjerulf trailed off oddly then finished turn off any booth by remote control from the nearest jumpshift maintenance system what are you thinkingof the mall riot ali there was no more to say he left nils kjerulf in the united terminal in los angeles he dialed for customs for several minutes jenyberry watched them flicking in there were two types the tourists came in couples sometimes with a child or two they flicked in looking interested and harried and a little frightened their clothing was outlandish and extraordinary before they left the booths they would look about them mistrustfully sometimes they formed larger groups the businessmen traveled alone they wore conservative or oldfashioned clothing and carried one suitcase large or small but one they were older than the tourists they moved with authority walking straight out of the booths the moment they appeared at the barner four men in identical dark suits with shieldshaped shoulder patches jenybeny was on the wrong side of the barrier to command their attention he was thinking of dialing himself to mexico and back when one of them noticed him and pegged him as a newstaper his name was gregory scheffer small and round and middleaged he perched on the wooden barner and clasped one knee in both hands sure i can talk awhile this isnt one of the busy days the only time these booths really get a workout is christmas and new year and bastille day and like that look around you he said waving a pudgy hand expansively about four times as many incoming as there was six months ago i used to want to search every bag that came through just to be doing something if we keep getting more and more of them this way well need twice as many customs people next year why do you suppose did you know that the longdistance booths have been operating for two solid years its only in the last six months or so that weve started to get so many passengers they had to get used to traveling again look around you look at all this space it used to be full before jumpshift came along people have got out of the habit of traveling thats all there is to it for twenty solid years they have to get back into it guess so jenybeny tried to remember why he was here mr scheffer greg jenyberry customs main job is to stop smuggling isnt it well it used to be now we only slow it down and not very damn much nobody in his right mind would smuggle anything through customs there are safer ways oh diamonds for instance diamonds are practically indestructible you could rig a cargo booth in kansas to receive from oh theres a point in the south pacific to match anyplace in the united states same longitude opposite latitude you dont need a velocity damper if you put the boat in the right place diamonds you could ship in swiss watches that way though thats pretty finicky youd want to pad them good grief you could smuggle anything you pleased anywhere just about you dont need the ocean trick say you rig a booth a mile south of the canadian border and another booth a mile north thats not much of a jump you can flick further than that just in la i think were obsolete said scheffer i think smuggling laws are obsolete you wont publish this i wont use your name i guess thats okay can you get me over to the incoming booths i want to take some pictures what for im not sure yet lets see some id gregory scheffer didnt trust evasive answers the incoming booths were in his jurisdiction he studied the cba card for a few seconds and suddenly said jansen mall riot right what was it like jenybeny invested half a minute teffing him so now im trying to find out how it got started if there were some way to stop all of those people from pouring in like that you wont find it here look a dozen passengers and were almost busy a thousand people suddenly pour through those booths and what would we do hide under something thats what wed do i still want to see the incoming booths scheffer thought it over shrugged and let him through he stood at jerryberrys shoulder while jenyberiy used his eye and his camera the booth was just like a streetcorner booth except for the blank metal face where a dial would be i dont know whats underneath scheffer told him for all of me its just like any other booth how much work would it be to leave off the dial which made sense but it was no help at all they tape the tonight show at two in the afternoon twenty minutes into it the first guest is lolling at his ease just rapping talking off the top of his head ignoring the probable hundred million eyes behind the cameras this is a valuable knack and rare tonights first guest is a series hero in a sciencefiction tapezine he is saying have you ever seen a red tide its thick down at hermosa beach i was there this weekend in the daytime its just dirty water muddylooking and it smells but at night this enthusiasm that can reach through a teevee screen to touch fifty million minds this enthusiasm is in no way artificial he means it he only expresses it better than most men he leans forward in his chair his eyes blaze there is harsh tension in his voice the breakers glow like churning blue fire those plankton are fluorescent and theyre all through the wet sand walk across it it flashes blue light under your feet kick it scuff your feet through it it lights up throw a handful of sand it flashes where it hits this light isnt just on the surface stamp your foot you can see the structure of the sand by the way it flares youve got to see it to believe it he says they will run the tape starting at eight thirty tonight standard booths how standardized who makes them besides jumpsh ft monopoly how extensive skip spaceflight space exploration depended utterly on teleportation but the subject was likely to be very technical and not very useful he could gain time by skipping it entirely jenyberiy considered then turned the question mark into an exclamation point his twelve hours had become nine of the halfdozen key clubs to which he belonged the cave des roys was the quietest a place of stone and wood a good place to sit and think the wall behind the bar was several hundred wine bottles in a cement matrix jerryberry looked into the strange lights in the glass sipped occasionally at a silver fizz and jotted down whatever occurred to him sociology what has teleportation done to society cars oil companies oil stocks see back issues wall street journal watts riot chicago riot he crossed that last one out the chicago riot had been political hadnt it then he couldnt remember any other riots they were too far in the past he wrote riot control police procedure crime the crime rate should have soared after displacement booths provided the instant getaway had it sooner or later he was going to have to drop in at police headquarters hed hate that but he might learn something likewise the library for several hours of dull research then he certainly wasnt going to persuade everybody to give up displacement booths he wrote objective demonstrate that displacement booths imply instant riot its a social problem solve it on that basis for the sake of honesty he added get em off my back crowds in minutes the mall had become a milling mass of men but hed seen crowds form almost as fast it might happen regularly in certain places after a moments thought he wrote tahiti jerusalem mecca easter island stonehenge olduvai gorge he stood up start with the phone calls doctor robin whyte jerryberry said to the phone screen please the receptionist at seven sixes was no sex symbol she was old enough to be jenybenys aunt and handsome rather than beautiful she heard him out with a noncommittal dignity that he sensed could turn glacial in an instant barry jerome jansen he said carefully he waited on hold watching darkred patterns flow upward in the phone screen key clubs were neither new nor rare some were small and local others were chains existing in a dozen or a hundred locations everyone belonged to a club most people belonged to several but seven sixes was something else its telephone number was known universally its membership large in absolute terms was small for an organization so worldwide it included presidents kings winners of various brands of nobel prize its location was unknown somewhere in earths temperate zones jerryberry had never heard of its displacementbooth number being leaked to anyone it took a special kind of gall for one of jenybenys social standing to dial he had learned that gall in journalism class go to the source no matter how highly placed be polite be prepared to wait but keep trying and never never worry about wasting the great mans time funny they still called it journalism though newspapers had died and the constitution that had protected newspapers still protected the press for a while but laws could change the screen cleared robin whyte the physicist had been a mature man of fonnidable reputation back when jumpshift first demonstrated teleportation today twentyfive years later he was the last living member of the team that had formed jumpshift his scalp was pink and bare his face was round and soft almost without wrinldes but slack as if the muscles were tired he looked like somebodys favorite grandfather he looked jerryberry jansen up and down very thoroughly he said i wanted to see what you looked like he reached for the cutoff switch i didnt do it jerrybeny said quickly whyte stopped with his finger on the cutoff no i am not responsible for the mall riot i hope to prove it the old man thought it over and you propose to involve me how jerryberry took a chance i think i can demonstrate that displacement booths and the mall riot are intimately connected my problem is that i dont know enough about displacementbooth technology and you want my help you invented the displacement booths practically singlehanded jerryberry said straightfaced instant riots instant getaways instant smuggling are you going to just walk away from the problem robin whyte laughed in a highpitched voice his head thrown way back his teeth white and perfect and clearly false jenybeny waited wondering if it would work all right whyte said come on over wait a minute what am i thinking you cant come to seven sixes ill meet you somewhere lorangerie new york city at the bar the screen cleared before jerrybeny could answer that was quick he thought and move idiot get there before he changes his mind in new york it was just approaching cocktail hour lorangerie was polished wood and dim lighting and chafing dishes of swedish meatballs on toothpicks jenybeny captured a few to go with his drink he had not had lunch yet robin whyte wore a longsleeved gray onepiece with a collar that draped into a short cape and the cape was all the shifting rainbow colors of an oil film the height of fashion except that it should have been skintight it was loose all over bagging where whyte bagged and it looked very comfortable whyte sipped at a glass of milk one by one i give up my sins he said drinking was the last and i havent really turned loose of it yet but almost thats why your reverse salesmanship hooked me in ill talk to anyone what do i call you barry jerome jansen let me put it this way im robbie what do i call you oh jerryberry whyte laughed i cant call anyone jerrybeny make it barry god bless you sir what do you want to know how big is jumpshift ooohhh pretty big whats your standard of measurement jenybeny who had wondered if he was being laughed at stopped wondering how many kinds of booth do you make hard to say three for general use maybe a dozen more for the space industry those are still experimental we lose money on the space industry wed make it back if we could start producing dropships in quantity weve got a ship on the drawing boards that would transmit itself to any dropship receiver jerryberry prompted him and three for general use you said yes weve made over three hundred million passenger booths in the past twenty years then theres a generaluse cargo booth the third model is a tremendous portable booth for shipping really big fragile cargoes like a prefab house or a rocket booster or a live sperm whale you can set the thing in place almost anywhere using three strapon helicopter setups i didnt believe it when i saw it whyte sipped at his milk youve got to remember that im not in the business anymore im still chairman of the board but a bunch of younger people give most of the orders and i hardly ever get into the factories does jumpshift have a monopoly on displacement booths he saw the newstaper reaction a tightening at whytes eyes and lips wrong word jenybeny said quickly sony what i meant was who makes displacement booths im sure you make most of the passenger booths in the united states all of them its not a question of monopoly anyone could make his own booths any community could but it would be hideously expensive the cost doesnt drop until youre making millions of them so suppose chile for instance chile has less than a million passenger booths all jumpshift model suppose they had gone ahead and made their own theyd have only their own network unless they built a direct copy of some other model all the booths in a network have to have the same volume naturally in practice there are about ten networks worldwide the ussr network is the biggest by far i think the smallest is brazil what happens to the air in a receiver whyte burst out laughing i knew that was coming it never fails he sobered we tried a lot of things it turns out the only practical solution is to send the air in the receiver back to the transmitter which means that every transmitter has to be a receiver too then you could get a free ride if you knew who was about to flick in from where when of course you could but would you want to bet on it i might if i had something to smuggle past customs how do you mean im just playing with ideas the incoming booths at customs are incoming because theres no way to dial out i remember type is with the dials removed okay say you wanted to smuggle something into the country you flick to customs in argentina then a friend flicks from california to argentina into your booth you wind up in his booth in california and not behind the customs barrier brilliant said whyte unfortunately theres a failsafe to stop anyone from flicking into an occupied booth arriri sony whyte said grinning what do you care there are easier ways to smuggle too many im not really sorry im a laissezfaire man myself i wondered if you could do something with dials to stop another mall riot whyte thought about it not by taking the dials off if you wanted to stop a riot youd have to stop people from coming in counters on the booths maybe pvlnirri what was it like barry crowded like a dam broke the law did shut the booths down from outside but not fast enough maybe thats the answer cut out the booths at the first sign of trouble wed get a lot of people mad at us you would wouldnt you like the power brownouts in the seventies and eighties or like obscene telephone calls you couldnt do anything about them except get more and more uptight readier to smash things thats why riots happen barry people who are a little bit angry all the time oh all the riots i remember whyte smiled there havent been any for a long time give jumpshift some credit for that we stopped some of the things that kept everyone a little bit angry all the time smog traffic jams slow mail slum landlords you dont have to live near your job or your welfare office or whatever job hunting crowding have you ever been in a traffic jam maybe when was a little boy friend of mine was a college professor for a while his problem was he lived in the wrong place five days a week he would spend an hour driving to work you dont believe me and an hour and a quarter driving home because traffic was heavier then eventually he gave it up to be a writer gawd i should hope so it wasnt even that rare whyte said seriously it was rough if you owned a car and rougher if you didnt jumpshift didnt cause riots we cured them and he seemed to wait for jeriyberry s agreement silence stretched long enough to become embarrassing yet the only thing jenybeny might have said to break it was but what about the mall riot he held his peace drain that thing whyte said abruptly ill show you show me finish that drink were going places whyte drank half a glass of milk in three gulps his adams apple bobbing he lowered the glass well ready on madison avenue the sunset shadows ran almost horizontally along the glass faces of buildings robin whyte stepped out of lorangerie and turned right four feet away a displacement booth in the booth he blocked the hand jenybeny would have used to insert his cba card my treat this was my idea anyway some of these numbers are secret he inserted his own card and dialed three numbers twice they saw rows of longdistance booths then it was bright sunlight and sea breeze far out beyond a sandy beach and white waves a great cylinder with a rounded top rose high out of the water orange letters on the curved metal flank read jumpshwf freshwater transport i could take you out in a boat said whyte but it would be a waste of time you wouldnt see much nothing but vacuum inside you know how it works sure teleportation was like laser technology one big breakthrough and then a thousand ways to follow up on it we spent twelve solid years building continuous teleport pumps for various municipalities to ship fresh water in various directions when all the time the real problem was getting the fresh water not moving it do you know how we developed this gimmick my secretary dreamed it up one night at an office party she was about half smashed but she wrote it down and the next morning we all took turns trying to read her handwriting well never mind its a simple idea you build a tank more put the teleport pump in the top you teleport the air out when the air goes the seawater boils from then on youre teleporting cold watervapor it condenses wherever you ship it and you get fresh water want to take pictures isto then lets look at the results whyte said and dialed now it was even brighter the booth was backed up against a long wooden building far away was a white glare of salt flats backed by blue ghosts of mountains jenybeny blinked and squinted whyte opened the door jerryberry said whoooff death valley hot isnt it words fail me at a time like this but i suggest you look up the dictionary definition of blastfurnace jerrybeny felt perspiration start as a rippling itch all over him im going to pretend im in a sauna why doesnt anyone ever put displacement booths inside they did for a while there were too many burglaries lets go around back they walked around the dry wooden building and into an oasis jenybeny was jarred on one side of the building the austere beauty of a barren desert on the other was a manicured forest rows and rows of trees we can grow damn near anything out here we started with date palms went to orange and grapefuit trees pineapples a lot of rice paddies mangoes anything that grows in tropic climates will grow here as long as you give it enough water jerryberry had already noticed the water tower it looked just like the transmitter he said and the right soil well yes soil isnt that good in death valley we have to haul in too much fertilizer rivulets of perspiration ran down whytes cheeks his soft face looked almost stern but the principle holds with teleportation men can live practically anywhere we gave people room a man can work in manhattan or central los angeles or central anywhere and live in in nevada or hawaii or the grand canyon crowding caused riots weve eliminated crowding for a while anyway at the rate were going well still wind up shoulder to shoulder but not until you and i are both dead jenybeny considered keeping his mouth shut but decided he didnt have the willpower what about pollution what death valley used to have an ecology as unique as its climate whats your unlimited water doing to that ruining it i guess hawaii you said grand canyon there are laws against putting up apartment buildings in national monuments thank god hawaii probably has the population density of new york by now your displacement booths can put men anywhere right even places they dont belong well maybe they can whyte said slowly pollution hmm what do you know about death valley its hot jerryberry was wet through death valley used to be an inland sea a salt sea then the climate changed and all the water went away what did that do to the ecology jerryberry scratched his head a sea yes a sea and drying it up ruined one ecology and started another just like were doing but never mind that i want to show you some things pollution huh whytes grip on jenybenys arm was stronger than it had any right to be whyte was angry in the booth he froze with his brow furrowed and his forefinger extended trying to remember a number then he dialed in trembling haste he dialed two sequences jenyberry saw the interior of an airline terminal then dark oh damn i forgot it would be night here where are we sahara desert rudolph hill reclamation project no dont go out there theres nothing to see at night do you know anything about the project youre trying to grow a forest in the middle of the sahara trees leafeating molds animals the whole ecology jerryberry tried to see out through the glass nothing hows it working well enough if we can keep it going another thirty years this part of the sahara should stay a forest do you think were wiping out another ecology well its probably worth it here the sahara used to be a lush greenland it was men who turned it into a desert over thousands of years mainly through overgrazing were trying to put it back okay said jenybeny he heard whyte dialing through the glass he could now see stars and a horizon etched with treetop shadows he squinted against airportterminal lights he asked how did we get through customs oh the hill project is officially united states territory whyte swung the local directory out from the wall and leafed through it before dialing a second time some day youll make any journey by dialing two numbers he was saying why should you have to dial your local airport first just dial a longdistance booth near your destination of course the changeover will cost us considerable here we are bright sunlight sandy beach blue sea stretching to infinity the booth was backed up against a seaside hotel jerrybeny followed whyte whose careful determined stride took him straight toward the water they stopped at the edge tiny waves brushed just to the tips of their shoes carpintena they advertise this beach as the safest beach in the world its also the dullest of course no waves remember anything about carpinteria barry i dont think so oilslick disaster a tanker broke up out there opposite santa barbara which is up the coast a little all of these beaches were black with oil i was one of the volunteers working here to save the birds to get the oil off their feathers they died anyway almost fifty years ago barry part of a history lesson floated to the top of his mind i thought that happened in england there were several oilslick disasters almost i might say there were many these days we ship oil by displacement booths and we dont use anything like as much oil no cars no oil wells practically they shifted from an underwater dome they gazed out at an artificial reef made from old car bodies the shapes seemed to blend their outlines obscured by mud and time and swarming fish bent and twisted metal bodies had long since rusted away but their outlines remained held by shellfish living and dead ghosts of cars the dashboards and upholstery showing through an occasional fiberglass wreck showed as if it had been placed yesterday the reef went on and on disappearing into gray distance all those cars people used to joke about the east river catching fire and burning to the ground it was that dirty said whyte now look at it things floated by wide patches of scum with plastic and metal objects embedded in them jenybeny said its pretty grubby maybe but its not an open sewer teleportation made it easier to get rid of garbage i guess my trouble is i never saw anything as dirty as you claim it was oil slicks lake michigan the mississippi maybe youre exaggerating just what has teleportation done for garbage collection there are records pictures but even with your wonderful bottomless garbage cans it must be easier just to dump it in the river ahh i guess so and you still have to put the gupp somewhere after you collect it whyte was looking at him oddly very shrewd barry let me show you the next step whyte kept his hand covered as he dialed secret he said jumpshift experimental laboratory we dont need a lot of room because experiments with teleportation arent particularly dangerous but there was room lots of it the building was a huge inflated quonset hut through the transparent panels jertybeny could see other buildings set wide apart on bare dirt the sun was degrees up if he had known which way was north he could have guessed longitude and latitude a very tall very black woman in a lab smock greeted whyte with glad cries whyte introduced her as gemini jones phud gem where do you handle disposal of radioactive waste building four the physicists hair exploded around her head like a black dandelion adding unnecessary inches to her height she looked down at jerryberry with genial curiosity newstaper dont ever try to fool anyone the eyes give you away they took the booth to building four presently they were looking down through several densities of leaded glass into a cylindrical metal chamber we get a package every twenty minutes or so said gem jones theres a transmitter linked to this receiver in every major power plant in the united states we keep the receiver on all the time if a package gets reflected back we have to find out whats wrong and that can get hairy because its usually wrong at the dropship jerryberry said dropship gemini jones showed surprise at his ignorance whyte said backup a bit barry whats the most dangerous garbage ever give me a hint radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants most dangerous per pound anyway they send those wastes here and we send them to a dropship youve got to know what a dropship is of course i a dropship is a moving teleport receiver with one end open generally its attached to a space probe the payload flicks in with a velocity different from that of the dropship of course its supposed to come tearing out the open end which means somebody has to keep it turned right and of course the dropship only operates in vacuum package gem jones said softly something had appeared in the metal chamber below it was gone before jerrybeny could quite see what it was just where is your dropship circling venus said whyte originally it was part of the second venus expedition you can send anything through a dropship fuel oxygen food water even small vehicles there are dropships circling every planet in the solar system except neptune when the venus expedition came home they left the dropship in orbit we thought at first that we might send another expedition through it but face it venus just isnt worth it were using the planet as a garbage dump which is about all its good for now theres no theoretical reason we cant send unlimited garbage through the venus dropship as long as we keep the dropship oriented right many transmitters one receiver the payload doesnt stay in the receiver more than a fraction of a second if it did get overloaded why some of the garbage would be reflected back to the transmitter and wed send it again no problem what about cost stupendous horrible too high for any kind of garbage less dangerous than this radioactive stuff but maybe we can bring it down someday whyte stopped he looked puzzled mind if i sit down there were foldup chairs around a card table with empty pop bulbs on it whyte sat down rather disturbingly hard even with gem jones trying to support his weight she asked can i get doctor janesko no gem just tired is there a pop machine jenyberry found the pop machine he paid a chocolate dollar for a clear plastic bulb of cola he turned and almost bumped into gemini jones she spoke low but there was harsh intensity in her voice youre running him ragged will you lay off of him hes been running me jenybeny whispered i believe it well dont let him run you so fast remember hes an old man whyte pulled the cola bulb open and drank better he sighed and was back in high gear now you see were cleaning up the world we arent polluters right thank you i never should have raised the subject what have you got for the mall riot whyte looked confused the mall riot is still going on and theyre still blaming me and you still blame jumpshift its a matter of access jerryberry said patiently even if only ten men in a million say would loot a store given the opportunity thats still about four thousand people in the united states and all four thousand can get to the santa monica mall in the time it takes to dial twentyone digits when whyte spoke again he sounded bitter what are we supposed to do stop inventing things no of course not jenybeny pulled open another bulb of cola what then i dont know just keep working things out he drank theres always another problem behind the one you just solved does that mean you should stop solving problems well lets solve this one they sat sipping cola it was good to sit down the old mans running me ragged thought jerrybeny crowds he said right you can make one receiver for many transmitters in fact every booth in a city receives from any other booth can you make a booth that transmits only whyte looked up sure give it an unlisted number potentially it would still be a receiver of course because you have to flick the air back to the transmitter hows this sound you can put an e on the booth number the only dials with es in them are at police stations and fire stations e for emergency all right now you put a lot of these escape booths wherever a crowd might gather that could be anywhere you said so yourself yali wed have to double the number of booths in the country or cut the number of incoming booths in half youd have to walk twice as far to get where youre going from any given booth would it be worth it i dont think this is the last riot said jenyberry its growing like tourism your shorthop booths cut tourism way dqwn the longdistance booths are bringing it back but slowly would you believe a permanent floating riot a mob that travels from crowd to crowd carrying coin purses looting where they can i hate that idea jerrybeny put his hand on the old mans shoulder dont wony about it youre a hero you made a miracle what people do with it isnt your fault maybe you even saved the world the pollution was getting very rough before jumpshift came along by god it was ive got to be going there are things i want to see before i run out of time tahiti jerusalem mecca easter island stonehenge the famous places of the world places a man might dial almost on impulse names that came unbidden to the mind mecca vast numbers of muslims bowed toward mecca five times a day the koran called for every muslim to make a pilgrimage to mecca at least once in a lifetime the citys only industry was the making of religious articles and you could get there just by dialing jerusalem sacred to three major religions jews still toasted each other at passover next year in jerusalem still a forming ground of history after thousands of years and you could get there just by dialing stonehenge an ancient mystery what race erected those stones and when and why these would never be known with certainty from the avenue at the northeast entrance a path forked and ran up a hill between burial mounds and there was a longdistance displacement booth on the hill it would be eleven at night in stonehenge one in the morning in mecca and jerusalem no action there jenybeny crossed them out ejffel tower the pyramids the sphinx the vatican dammit the most memorable places on earth were all in the same general area what could he see at midnight well tahiti say tropical paradise and every stranger in earshot will murmur tahiti once hawaii had had the same reputation but hawaii was too close to civilization hawaii had been civilized tahiti isolated in the southern hemisphere might have escaped that fate everything lurched as he finished dialing jenyberry stumbled against the booth wall briefly he was terrified but hed be dead if the velocity transfer had failed it must be a little out of synch he knew too much that was all there were six booths of different makes this side of customs the single official had a hopeless look he waved through a constant stream of passengers without seeming to see them jenybeny moved with the stream they were mostly men many had cameras few had luggage english american french german some spanish and ussr most were dressed lightly and poorly in cheap clothes ready to come apart they swarmed toward the outgoing booths the rectangular common market booths with one glass side jerrybeny saw unease and dismay on many faces perhaps it was the new clean modem building that bothered them this was an island paradise air conditioning fluorescent lighting jenybeny stood in line for the phone then he found that it wouldnt take his coin or his credit card on his way to the change counter he thought to examine the displacement booths they took only french money he bought a heavy double handful of coins then got back in line for the phone they have to get used to traveling again right on the computerized directory spoke english he used it to get a string of booth numbers in downtown papeete he was a roving newstaper again dial watch the scene flick over look around while inserting a coin and dialing the coin slot was in the wrong place and the coins felt wrong too big too thin and the dial was a disk with holes in it a little practice had him in the routine there was beach front lined with partly built hotels in crazily original shapes of all the crowds he saw in papeete the thickest were on the beaches and in the water later he could not remember the color of the sand he hadnt seen enough of it downtown he found huge blocks of buildings faced in glass some completed some half built he found old slums and old mansions but wherever the streets ran past mansions or slums or new skyscrapers he found tents and leantos and board shacks hastily nailed together they filled the streets leaving small clear areas around displacement booths and public rest rooms and far more basic portable toilets an openair market ran for several blocks and was closed at both ends by crowds of tents the only way in or out was by booth theyre ahead of us thought jerrybeny when youve got booths who needs streets he was not amused he was appalled there were beggars at first he was moving too fast he didnt realize what they were doing but wherever he flicked in one or two habitants immediately came toward his booth he stopped under a vertical glass cliff of a building where the tents of the squatters ran just to the bouommost of a flight of stone steps and waited beggars some were natives men and women and children uniform in their darkbronze color and in their dress and their speech and the way they moved they were a thin minority most were men and white and foreign they came with their hands out mournful or smiling they spoke rapidly in what they guessed to be his language and were right about half the time he tried several other numbers they were everywhere tahiti was a white mans daydream suddenly hed had enough on his list of jotted numbers was one that would take him out of the city jerrybeny dialed it air puffed out of the booth when he opened the door jenybeny opened his jaws wide to pop his ears the view he was near the peak of a granite mountain other mountains marched away before him and the valleys between were green and lush greens and yellows and white clouds the bluegray of distant peaks and beyond everything else the sea it was a bus terminal an ancient greyhound was just pulling out the driver stopped alongside him and shouted something amiable in french jenybeny smiled and shook his head violently the driver shrugged and pulled away this could not have been the original terminal before displacement booths it could have been reached only after hours of driving in moving the terminal up here the touring company had saved the best for first and last the bus had looked full business was good jenybeny stood for a long time drinking in the view this was the beauty that had made tahiti famous it was good to know that tahitis population explosion had left something intact in good time he remembered that he was running on a time limit he walked around to the ticket window the young man in the booth laid a paperback book face down he smiled agreeably yes do you speak english certainly he wore a kind of uniform but his features and color were those of a tahitian his english was good the accent not quite french would you like to buy a tour ticket no thanks id like to talk if you have a minute what would you like to talk about tahiti im a newstaper the mans smile drooped a bit and you wish to give us free publicity something like that the smile was gone you may return to your country and tell them that tahiti is full i noticed that i have just come from papeete i have the honor to own a house in papeete a good property we my family and myself we have been forced to move out there was no no paysage he was too angry to talk as fast as he wanted no passage from the house to anyplace we were surrounded by the tents of the he used a word jenybeny did not recognize we could not buy an instantmotion booth for the house i had not the money we could not have moved the booth to the house because the that word again blocked the streets the police can do nothing nothing why not there are too many we are not monsters we cannot simply shoot them it would be the only way to stop them they come without money or clothing or a place to stay and they are not the worst you will tell them this when you return im recording said jerryberry tell them that the worst are those with much money those who build hotels they would turn our island into an enormous hotel see he pointed where jenybeny could not have seen himself down the slope of the mountain the playboy club builds a new hotel below us jenybeny looked down to temporary buildings and a great steel box with helicopter rotors on it he filmed it on the minox then filmed a panoramic sweep of the mountains beyond and finished with the scowling man in the ticket booth squatters the tickettaker said suddenly the word i wanted the squatters are in my house now lam sure of it in my house since we moved out tell them we want no more squatters ill tell them said jerryberry before he left he took one more long look about him green valleys grayblue mountains distant line of sea but his eyes kept dropping to the endless stream of supplies that poured from the playboy clubs type ifi cargo booth easter island tremendous longfaced solemn stone statues with topknots of red volcanic tuff cartoons of the statues were even more common than pictures and even pictures can only hint at their massive solemnity but you could get there just by dialing except that the directory wouldnt give him a booth number for easter island surely there must be booth travel to easter island mustnt there but how eager would the peruvian government be to see a mijlion tourists on easter island the other side of the coin displacement booths made any place infinitely accessible but only if you moved a booth in jerryberry was grinning with delight as he dialed los angeles international there was a defense at the police station on purdue avenue he couldnt get anyone to talk to him the patience of a newstaper was unique in a world of instant transportation he kept at it eventually a desk man stopped long enough to tell him look we dont have time everybodys out cleaning up the mall riot cleaning up is it over just about we had to move in old riot vehicles from chicago i guess well have to start building them again but its over good too right i dont mean to say we got them all some looters managed to juryrig a cargo booth in the basement of penneys they moved their loot out that way and then got out that way themselves were going to hate it the next time they show up theyve got guns now a permanent floating riot something like that look i dont have time to talk and he was back on the phone the next man jerryheny stopped recognized him at once youre the man who started it all will you get out of my way jenybeny left sunset on a summer evening it was cocktail hour again three and a half hours later jenybeny felt unaccountably dizzy outside the police station he rested against the wall too much change over and over again he had changed place and time and climate from evening in new york to a humid seacoast to the dry furnace of death valley to night in the sahara it was hard to remember where he was he had lost direction when he felt better he shifted to the cave des roys for each human being there is an optimum ratio between change and stasis too little change he grows bored too little stability he panics and loses his ability to adapt one who marries six times in ten years will not change jobs one who moves often to serve his company will maintain a stable marriage a woman chained to one home and family may redecorate frantically or take a lover or go to many costume parties displacement booths make novelty easy stability comes hard for many the clubs were an element of stability many key clubs were chains a man could leave his home in wyoming and find his club again in denver members tended to resemble one another a man changing roles would change clubs clubs were places to meet people as buses and airports and even neighborhoods no longer were some clubs were good for pickups others for heavy conversation at the beach club you could always find a paddletenrns game the cave was for quiet and stability a quick drink and the cool darkness of the caves bar were just what jerrybeny needed he looked into the lights in the wall of bottles and tried to remember a name when it came he jotted it down then finished his drink at leisure harry mccord had been police chief in los angeles for twelve years and had been on the force for far longer he had retired only last year the computerdirectory took some time to find him he was living in oregon he was living in a small house in the middle of a pine forest from mccords porch jerrybeny could see the dirt road that joined him to civilization it seemed to be fading away in weeds but the displacement booth was new they drank beer on the porch crime is a pretty general subject said harry mccord crime and displacement booths said jerrybeny i want to know how your job was affected by the instant getaway lв li jenyberry waited pretty drastically i guess the booths came in when nineteen ninety but they came slowly we had a chance to get used to them lets see there were people who put displacement booths in their living rooms and when they got robbed they blamed us mccord talked haltingly at first then gaining speed he had always been something of a public figure he talked well burglary the honors were even there if the house or apartment had an alarm the police could be on the scene almost instantly if the burglar moved fast enough to get away he certainly wouldnt have time to rob his target there were sophisticated alarms now that would lock the displacementbooth door from the inside often that held the burglar up just long enough for the police to shift in at opposite extremes of professionalism there were men who could get through an alarm system without setting it off in which case there wasnt a hope in hell of catching them after theyd left and men who had been caught robbing apartment houses because theyd forgotten to take corns for the booth in the lobby then there was lon willis his mo was to prop the booth door open before he went to work on the house if he set the alarm off hed run next door and use that booth worked pretty well it slowed us up just enough that we never did catch him but one night he set off an alarm and when he ran next door the nextdoor neighbor blew a small but adequate hole in him murder the alibi was an extinct species a man attending a party in hawaii could shoot a man in paris in the time it would take him to use the bathroom like george clayton larkin did except that he used his credit card and we got him said mccord and we got lucille downey because she ran out of coins and had to ask at the magazine stand for change with blood all over her sleeves pickpockets do you have a lock pocket sure said jerryberry it was an inside pocket lined with tough plastic the zipper lock took two hands to open theyre tough to get into but not impossible whats in it credit cards right and you can cancel them in three minutes picking pockets isnt profitable any more if it was they would have mobbed the mall riot smuggling nobody even tried to stop it drugs theres no way to keep them from getting in anyone who wants drugs can get them we make arrests where we can and so what me im betting on darwin how do you mean the next generation wont use drugs because theyll be descended from people who had better sense id legalize wireheading if it were up to me with a wire in your pleasure center youre getting what all the drugs are supposed to give you and no dope peddler can hold out on you riots the mall riot was the first successful riot in twenty years the police can get to a riot before its a riot said mccord we call themflash crowds and we watch for them weve been doing it ever since well ever since it became possible he hesitated and evidently decided to go on see the coin booths usually went into the shopping centers first and then the residential areas it wasnt till jumpshift put them in the slum areas that we stopped having riots makes sense mccord laughed even thats a halftruth when the booths went into the slums we pretty near stopped having slums everyone moved out theyd commute why do you think the police didnt stop the mall riot thats a funny one isnt it i was there this afternoon did you get a chance to look at the cargo booth in penneys basement its a professional job whoever rigged it knew exactly what he was doing no slips he probably had a model to practice on we traced it to a cargo receiver in downtown la but we dont know where it was sending to because someone stayed behind and wrecked it and then shifted out real professional some gang has decided to make a profession of riots you think this is their first job id guess they must have seen the malltype riots coming which is pretty shrewd because a flash crowd couldnt have formed that fast before longdistance displacement booths its a new crime makes me almost sony i retired how would you redesign the booths to make life easier for the police but mccord wouldnt touch the subject he didnt know anything about displacementbooth design seven oclock the interview with evans was at ten jerrybeny shifted back to the cave he was beginning to get nervous the cave and a good dinner should help ease his stage fright he turned down a couple of invitations to join small groups with the interview hanging over his head hed be poor company he sat alone and continued to jot during dinner escape booths send anywhere receive onlyfrom police andfire departments police can shut down all booths in an area except escape booths no that would let the looters escape too but there might be no way to stop that at least it would get the innocent bystanders out of a riot area hah escape booths send only to police station he crossed that out and wrote all booths send only to police station he crossed that out too to write an expanded version riot si gnal from police station all booths in area stop receiving all booths in area send only to police station he went back to eating moments later he stopped with his fork half raised put it down and wrote a million rioters stomp police station to rubble from inside and it had seemed like such a good idea he was dawdling over coffee when the rest of it dropped into place he went to a phone the secretary at seven sixes promised to have dr whyte call as soon as he checked in jenybeny put a time limit on it which seemed to please her mccord wasnt home jermybeny went back to his coffee he was feeling twitchy now he had to know if this was possible otherwise he would be talking through his hat in front of a big audience twenty minutes later as he was about to get up and call again the headwaiter came to tell him that dr robin whyte was on the phone its a design problem said jerryberry let me tell you how id like it to work and then you can tell me if its possible okay go ahead first step is the police get word of a flash crowd a mall riottype crowd they throw emergency switches at headquarters each switch affects the displacement booths in a small area thats the way it works now now those switches turn off the booths id like them to do something more complex set them so they can only receive from police and fire departments and can only transmit to a police station we can do that whyte halfclosed his eyes tothink good then the police could release the innocent bystanders send the injured to a hospital hold the obvious looters get everybodys names right brilliant youd put the receiver at the top of a greased slide and a big cell at the bottom maybe at least the receiver would be behind bars you could issue override cards to the police and other authorities to let them shift in through a blockade good whyte stopped suddenly and frowned theres a hole in it a really big crowd would either wreck the station or smother depending on how strong the cell was did you think of that id like to use more than one police station how many theres a distance him bany what are you thinking as it stands now a longdistance passenger has to dial three numbers to get anywhere you said you could cut that to two can you cut it to one i dont know its poetic justice said jerryberry our whole problem is that rioters can converge on one point from all over the united states if we could use police stations all over the united states we wouldnt have a problem as soon as a cell was full here wed switch to police stations in san diego or oregon whyte was laughing if you could see your face barry youre a dreamer you cant do it no of course we cant do it wait a minute whyte pursed his lips theres a way we could do it if there was a longdistance receiver at the police station hook the network to a velocity damper i told you theres no reason you shouldnt be able to dial to a longdistance receiver from any booth it would work then youd have to talk the public into paying for it design wouldnt be much of a problem we could cover the country with an emergency network in a couple of years can i quote you of course we sell displacement booths thats our business talk shows are one of the few remaining pure entertainment features on teevee with cassettes the viewer buys a package with a talk show he never knows just what hes getting it is a different product it is cheap to produce it can compete the tonight show shows at pm prime time around nine they start flicking in pouring out of the coin booths that line the street above the last row of houses they mill about searching out the narrow walks that lead down to the strand they pour over the low stone wall that guards the sand from the houses they pause awed breakers roll in from the black sea flashing electricblue within minutes hennosa beach is aswarm with people men women children in couples and family groups they hold hands and look out to sea they stamp the packed wet sand dancing like savages and whoop with delight to see blue light flash beneath their feet high up on the dry sand are piles of discarded clothing swimmers are thick in the water splashing blue fire at each other many were drunk or high on this or that when the tonight show led them here those who came were happy to start with they came to do a happy thing some carry sixpacks or pouches of pot the line of them stretches around the curve of the shore to the north beyond hermosa pier to the south bunching around the pier more are shifting in all the time trickling down to join the others jenybeny jansen flicked in almost an hour early for the interview the station was an ants nest a swarm of furious disorganization jerryberry was looking for wash evans when wash evans came running past him from behind glanced back and came to a jarring halt lo said jerryberry is there anything we need to go over before we go on evans seemed at a loss yah he said and caught his breath a little youre not news anymore jansen we may not even be doing the interview jenybeny said a dirty word i heard theyd cleared up the riot more than that they caught the lady shopliftef good if you say so one out of a thousand people that recognized your pictures of her turned out to be rightwoman name of inna hennessey lives in jersey city but commutes all over the country she says shes never hit the same store twice shes a kick jansen a newstapers dream no offense intended but i wish theyd let her out of jail tonight id interview her so i didnt cause the mall riot anymore now youve got irma hennessey well good i didnt like being a celebrity anything else he was thinking all that jumping around all the things i learned today all wasted unless i can get a tapezine lecture out of it evans said yah theres a new mall riot going on at hermosa beach what the hell craziest damn thing wash evans lit a cigarette and talked around it you know gordon lundt the zine star he was on the tonight show and he happened to mention the red tide down at hermosa beach he said it was pretty the next thing anyone knows every man woman and child in the country has decided he wants to see the red tide at hermosa beach how bad is it well nobodys been hurt last i heard and they arent breaking things its not that kind of crowd and theres nothing to steal but sand anyway its a happy riot jansen theres just a bitch of a lot of people another flash crowd it figures said jerrybeny you can get a flash crowd anywhere there are displacement booths can you theyve been around a long time its just that they happen faster with the longdistance booths some places are permanent floating flash crowds like tahiti whats wrong wash evans had a funny look it just hit me that we dont really have anything to replace you with youve been doing your homework have you all day jerryberry dug out the minox ive been everywhere i could think of some of this goes with taped interviews he produced the tape recorder of course there isnt much time to sort it out no jimme evans took the camera and the recorder we can follow up on these later maybe theyll make a special right now the news is at hermosa beach and you sound like you know how it happened and what to do about it do you still want to do that interview i sure go get a cba camera from george bailey lets see its nine fifteen dammit spend half an hour see as much as you can then get back here find out what you can about the flash crowd at hermosa beach thats what well be talking about george bailey looked up as jerrybeny arrived he pointed emphatically at the single camera remaining on the table fingercombed the hair back out of his eyes and went back to monitoring half a dozen teevee screens the camera came satisfyingly to life in jerrybenys hands he picked up a list of hermosa beach numbers and turned to the displacement booths too much coffee sloshed in his belly he stopped suddenly thinking one big riotcontrol center would do it you wouldnt need a police network just one longdistance receiver to serve the whole country and a building the size of yankee stadium big enough to handle any riot a federal police force on permanent guard rioting was an interstate crime now anyway you could build such a center faster and cheaper than any network not now back to work he stepped into a booth dialed and was gone
