microphone two weeks later james bond was sitting in the casino at royaleleseaux it was three in the morning and the air was filled with cigarette smoke le chiffre was still playing and still winning bond watched him for some minutes then he collected his winnings from the cashier and left the casino he walked across the road and through the gardens of the hotel splendide the concierge gave him his key for room and a cable the cable was from jamaica it read kingston jamaica bond splendide royaleleseaux havana cigar cuban factories production the number you need is ten million earlier that afternoon bond had asked his headquarters in london for more money the cable was a sort of code it meant that his headquarters were sending him ten million francs bond was pretending to be the son of a jamaican millionaire that was his cover he wrote a reply to the cable thanks information should be enough bono bond gave the reply to the concierge and said goodnight then he walked upstairs to the door of his room he took out a gun from under his jacket then he opened the door quickly and switched on the light there was nobody in the room but bond did not feel stupid he had to be very careful in his job bond undressed and had a cold shower then he lit a cigarette he had arrived at royaleleseaux two days before the last two afternoons and nights he had played roulette at the casino he had watched le chiffre at the tables the russian was a clever and lucky gambler so far bond had won three million francs he had started with ten million now london was sending him another ten so he had twentythree million francs to gamble with bond put the money under his pillow and climbed into bed for ten minutes he thought about everything that bad happened that day then he slept the next morning bond had a cold shower then he ate his breakfast at a table in front of the window he was looking at the sea when the telephone rang it was the concierge a man from radio stentor is here with the radio that you ordered monsieur the concierge said send him up said bond when mathis came in bond smiled ive just arrived from paris monsieur said mathis here is the radio he put the radio on the floor and switched it on the sound of loud music filled the room mathis walked across to bond and shook his hand bond smiled now why he began my dear friend said mathis your cover has been spoilt the russians know who you are mathis looked up at the ceiling then he pointed to the chimney a few centimetres up the chimney is a radio microphone he explained its wires go up to the room above they can hear everything then mathis smiled now for some more playacting he said he walked over to the radio and switched it off are you happy monsieur he asked very happy said bond the music is beautiful lets hear the rest of it mathis grinned and switched the radio on again now to business he said you will be pleased with your assistant your number two she is very beautiful and she is also a radio expert we will pretend that she works with me were both staying in the hotel so my assistant will he near you he smiled day or night but bond did not smile back at him why did they send me a woman he said angrily this isnt a game relax james said mathis shes good at her job and she speaks french very well she will meet you at the casino you are the rich son of a millionaire its normal for you to find a pretty girl to uh share your winnings with are there any other surprises asked bond not really replied mathis le chiffres villa is about sixteen kilometres down the coast road he has got two guards with him they speak to each other in bulgarian anything else asked bond come to the hermitage bar before lunch said mathis and meet your number two ask her to dinner then she can come to the casino with you tonight ill be there but you probably wont see me oh and theres an american called felix leiter hes staying here hes the cia man after mathis left bond sat back at the window he was not happy the russians knew that he was here they might try to kill him and then there was the problem of the girl bond did not like working with women chapter three the girl from london it was twelve oclock when bond left the hotel he decided to drive down the coast road he wanted to look at le chiffres villa an hour later bond walked into the hermitage bar he went to a table near one of the windows he ordered a drink and looked round at the expensivelydressed customers after some minutes he saw mathis on the pavement outside he was with a darkhaired girl bond waited for them to come into the bar he pretended not to see them its monsieur bond said mathis are you waiting for someone no this is my assistant mademoiselle lynd my dear this gentleman is from jamaica i took a radio to his hotel this morning would you both like to have a drink with me asked bond he called the waiter and ordered drinks then the two men talked about the weather and about royaleles eaux the girl sat silently her hair was very black her eyes were deep blue bond was excited by her beauty but the girl seemed cool and uninterested after some time mathis turned to her excuse me he said but i must telephone the dubernes about dinner tonight do you mind eating alone this evening no she answered its all right mathis went to the telephone near the bar bond looked at the girl its not good to eat alone he said to her would you like to have dinner with me tonight id like that very much she said warmly she smiled and then we could go to the casino perhaps ill bring you good luck they arranged a time and a place to meet bond felt that she was excited about the job perhaps they could work well together she was beautiful and he wanted to sleep with her but only when the job was finished mathis came back to the table and bond called to the waiter for his bill i have to get back to the hotel he said mathis and the girl watched him leave then mathis moved closer to her james is my very good friend he said im glad that youve met each other hes very goodlooking the girl replied after a moment but theres something cold and suddenly there was an explosion outside the bar the window behind them shattered mathis and the girl were pushed back into their chairs there were screams and people began to run towards the door stay here mathis said to the girl then he jumped out of his chair and climbed through the broken window chapter four the men in dark suits after bond left the bar he walked towards his hotel the day was beautiful and the sun was very hot as he walked bond noticed two men on the opposite side at the road they were standing quietly under a tree about a hundred meters away there was something strange about the two men they were both small and they both wore dark suits each man had a square camera case one case was red the other case was blue when bond was fifty meters away redman looked at blueman then blueman did something with his case bond could not see what he was doing because there was a tree in front of him suddenly there was a flash of white light and an explosion the explosion threw bond down onto the pavement then pieces of clothes began to fall around him the clothes were covered in blood black smoke filled the sky there was nothing left of the two men in dark suits when mathis got to bond he was leaning against the tree that had saved his life ambulances and fire engines began to arrive mathis helped bond back to the hotel splendide in bonds room mathis asked questions while bond took off his bloodspotted clothes when bond told him about the two men mathis picked up the telephone tell the police that bonds not hurt mathis said quickly to the person on the other end of the telephone line ill explain everything to them tell the newspapers that it was a fight between two bulgarians one killed the other with a bomb there was probably a third bulgarian watching say nothing about him hell try to get away the police must catch him mathis put down the phone and turned to bond you were lucky he said they wanted that bomb to kill you but something went wrong he smiled at bond get a drink and some lunch then have a rest several hours later bond was drinking a whisky when the telephone rang this is mademoiselle lynd said the voice quietly are you all right yes thank you replied bond good she said please take care of yourself chapter five felix leiter that evening bond walked across to the casino he had always been a gambler he liked the luxury of the cardrooms and casinos sometimes he was lucky sometimes not but bond believed that luck should he loved and not feared bond changed a million francs into plaques and took a seat at roulette table number he played seventeen games he lost some games and won some games he finished with winnings of one million francs an american was sitting opposite when bond got up from the table the american got up too let me buy you a drink the man said to bond bond guessed that the american was from the cia m had told him that they would send someone my names felix leiter said the american as they walked to the bar mine is bond james bond they ordered drinks a dry martini said bond to the barman but i want it in a large glass im pleased to be working with you leiter said he lit a cigarette our people in washington are very interested in this job our enemies already know about me said bond they probably know about you and mathis too please be at the casino this evening ive got an assistant miss lynd id like her to be with you when i start playing he smiled at leiter be careful of le chiffres two gunmen they probably wont make any trouble but we cant be sure felix leiter was about thirtyfive he was tall and thin with fair hair leiter moved and spoke slowly but bond knew that he would be a good tighter bond told him about his trip down the coast that morning leiter drank his second glass of whisky and listened carefully then at seventhirty they walked back to the hotel together leiters room was on a higher floor than bonds room the two men arranged to see each other later at the casino bond had a long hot bath followed by an icecold shower he lay down on his bed and thought about his plans for mathis leiter and the girl then he thought about le chiffre and his other enemies at twenty minutes to nine he dressed in trousers and a silk shirt next he opened a drawer he took out a light leather holster and put it over his shoulder then he took a gun from the drawer he dropped the gun into the holster and put his dinner jacket on the gun was hidden under the jacket he felt cool and comfortable as he walked out of his room and locked the door when he arrived in the hotel lobby he heard a voice call good evening the girl stepped out of the lift and waited for bond her black velvet dress was simple but expensive a thin diamond necklace hung around her throat she carried a black evening bag bond thought that she looked beautiful the girl held his arm as they went in to dinner people in the crowded restaurant turned to look at her bond watched them and smiled they went to a table in a quiet corner of the room would you like a drink asked bond i would love a glass of vodka she said bond ordered two very cold vodkas i dont know your first name he said to the girl vesper she said vesper its an old word for evening she explained and i was horn in the evening some people like it others dont i think its a fine name said bond they ordered dinner and a bottle of champagne the vodkas arrived and bond held up his glass heres to luck vesper he said yes replied the girl quietly she held up her glass and looked into his eyes then she moved nearer to him i have some news from mathis she said its about the bomb its a fantastic story bond stared at her tell me he said they found the third bulgarian vesper explained he was on the road to paris two policemen stopped him and asked for his papers the three bulgarians were part of a group here in france these three men were going to get two million francs for killing you she drank some of her vodka an agent gave them the two camera cases she went on the blue case contains a smoke bomb he told them the red case is the explosive when one of you throws the red case the other must press a switch on the blue case then you can escape in the smoke from the smoke bomb but he was lying both cases contained explosives the plan was to kill you and the bombers at the same time there was probably another plan to kill the third man very clever said bond go on the bulgarians switched on the smoke bomb first she continued then they planned to throw the explosive bomb at you but they blew themselves up said bond yes said vesper the third bulgarian was waiting behind the hotel splendide the police showed him hits of the red bomb then he knew that the agent had tricked the three of them he started talking after that but he knows nothing about le chiffre the waiter arrived with the food they ate in silence for some minutes then bond drank some of his champagne and looked at her what section are you in he asked im personal assistant to head of section s said vesper head of s asked m if i could come here m said yes but he said that you dont like working with women when bond said nothing she went on youre one of our heroes a double o agent its not difficult to get a double o number bond said if youre happy to kill people do you like the food its lovely she said smiling im enjoying myself and but she was stopped by the cold look in bonds eyes were here to do a job he said remember that then bond told her his plans as she listened vesper remembered her bosss warning bonds a goodlooking man head of s had told her but dont fall in love with him hes got a cold heart good luck and dont get hurt now bond was explaining the game of baccarat tonight le chiffre will be the banker bond said he has twentyfour million francs and ive got about the same there will he ten players and a croupier who will collect the cards ill sit opposite le chiffre at the table he drank some more champagne the banker begins with a bet of five hundred thousand francs he went on the person in the number one chair can accept the bet if he says no then number two can bet if number two doesnt want to bet then it goes to number three and on round the table ill try to accept the bet until either le chiffre or i have no money left in the end one of us must win its a simple game i get two cards and the banker gets two to win i must have two or three cards which add up to nine or the nearest number to nine if one of us doesnt win immediately we can take one more card picture cards and tens are worth nothing aces are worth one do you understand yes said vesper the banker gives me two cards if the two cards dont add up to nine then i can ask for another card ill ask for the extra card if my cards add up to less than five if they total six or seven i may not ask for another card the banker can look at his cards after ive asked for a card or decided to stand if the bankers cards total nine he wins if they dont add up to nine then he can choose another card i understand said vesper good said bond some minutes later he paid the hill and they left the restaurant it was time to gamble chapter six the casino in the main room of the casino felix leiter saw bond and came to meet him this is

to vesper he smiled and walked away bond collected his twentyfour million francs from the cashier then he walked across the room to the baccarat table he sat down in chair number six and lit a cigarette the bankers chair opposite him was empty bond looked around the table he knew most of the players in chair number seven on his right sat monsieur sixte a rich belgian in number nine was lord danvers a weaklooking man with a rich american wife she sat in chair number three at number one on the right of the bank was a famous greek gambler bond knew that the greek would play coldly and well at that moment le chiffre arrived he had a large white face wide shoulders and reddishbrown hair he smiled coldly at the players around the table then he sat down opposite bond the game started le chiffre was the banker he took a card from the shoe and pushed it towards chair number one then he took a card for himself then another for the greek and one more for himself the croupier lifted the greeks cards and dropped them next to the greeks hands the greek picked up the cards he looked carefully at them then he put them facedown on the table and looked at le chiffre no said the greek he had not asked for another card le chiffre picked up his cards and turned them over they were a four and a five a nine the croupier turned over the greeks cards he had a seven and a queen le chiffre had won seven the croupier said he removed the cards bond lit a cigarette and watched the greek make another bet the bank won again a bank of two million francs said the croupier for a moment nobody spoke two million was a very large bet then bond said banco he was ready to play chapter seven the game le chiffre and bond looked at each other coolly then bond put a packet of french francs on the table the other players watched they could feel the coldness between the two gamblers no one spoke as le chiffre took the four cards the croupier pushed bonds two cards towards him bond looked at the cards quickly then he looked at le chiffre after a moment bond turned his cards over they were a four and a five a nine there was a little cry of surprise from the other players then le chiffre carelessly turned over his two cards they were two picture cards worth nothing the game went on bond looked at the people who were standing around the table he soon saw le chiffres two gunmen they were standing behind the banker the man by le chiffres right arm was tall with a grey face the other man was short and dark he had a flat head and a thick moustache there was a wooden walking stick next to him it was one oclock in the morning and bond had won four million francs he now had twentyeight million francs le chiffre continued to play calmly the greek at number one was having a bad time he lost a bet of half a million francs and then another he passedi on the third bet a bank of two million said the croupier players two and three passed banco said monsieur sixte and lost the bet a bank of four million francs said the croupier banco said bond the croupier pushed two new cards towards him bond looked at them quickly he had a dangerous total of five but he did not take another card le chiffre turned over his two cards he had a picture card and a four he took another card from the shoe it was a three the bank has seven said the croupier he turned over bonds losing cards five he said he took four million francs from bonds money a bank of eight million said the croupier bond took the bet and lost again to le chiffres nine in two hets he had lost twelve million francs he had sixteen million francs left he looked across at le chiffre do you want to lose even more mr bond the russians eyes seemed to ask bond took some francs and plaques from his pocket he pushed them into the centre of the table his mouth had suddenly gone dry vesper and felix leiter had come to the table leiter looked worried but vesper smiled at him the gunman with the stick was now behind bond the croupier pushed bonds two cards towards him bond looked at them then he looked again he had an ace and a picture card a card he said he tried to sound calm le chiffre turned over his two cards he had a picture card and a five he took another card from the shoe the croupier pushed it to bond it was a five bond now had six and le chiffre had five the banker took another card and turned it over le chiffre needed a one two three or four to win it was a four le chiffre had won bond had lost all his money chapter eight the man with the stick bond lit a cigarette what next go back to the hotel make a phone call to london then fly home he would get a taxi to the offices in regents park then walk up the stairs to ms room he would look into ms cold face across the desk better luck next time m would say but there couldnt be a next time this had been their best chance to destroy le chiffre and bond had lost he looked at the people around the table the croupier counted the money and put the plaques in front of the banker would anyone bet against a bank of thirtytwo million francs leiter was not with vesper now vesper looked strangely calm she smiled at bond she doesnt understand the game bond thought a waiter stopped beside him he put a thick envelope on the table next to bond bonds heart began to beat fast he moved the envelope under the table and opened it his hands were shaking but he could feel the money inside excitement rushed through him he slipped the francs into his pockets there was a piece of paper with the money it had one line of writing thirtytwo million francs with best wishes from the usa bond looked towards vesper felix leiter was standing next to her again leiter smiled and bond smiled back this time bond had to win or had le chiffre already got the fifty million francs that he needed to repay soda perhaps he had then le chiffre wouldnt need to play the croupier had changed bonds notes into plaques they were in the middle of the table with the other plaques thirtytwo million francs le chiffre did not move a bank of thirtytwo million said the croupier the players were silent maybe he needs to win one more bet thought bond ive got to accept the bet it will surprise him he wont expect anyone to take the whole thirtytwo million bet bond was right le chiffre needed another eight million francs at last the banker nodded to the croupier a bank of thirtytwo million francs the croupier said banco bond said quietly he pushed the money across the table at that moment he saw le chiffre look at the gunman behind him immediately bond felt something hard against his back this is a gun monsieur a voice whispered its silent it can blow a hole in your back but it will make no sound people will think that youve fainted now take back your bet before i count to ten if you call for help ill shoot you now bond understood the walking stick was really a gun one said the voice bond turned his head the man was smiling at him two suddenly bond pushed himself backwards as hard as he could he moved so fast that the chair knocked the walking stick from the gunmans hand the chair broke into two pieces people crowded around him monsieur are you all right someone asked shall we get a doctor another person said two or three people helped bond to stand up thank you bond said im all right now it was only a moments faintness i was a little hot someone brought a new chair and bond sat down he looked across at le chitfre he could see fear in the bankers fat white face he turned to look at the people behind him the gunman had gone a waiter was holding the stick bond called and the waiter came across to him please give that walking stick to that gentleman said bond he pointed at felix leiter it belongs to a friend of his when leiter looked closely at the walking stick he would understand why bond had fainted bond turned back to the table he was ready chapter nine winner and loser it was two oclock in the morning this time bond must not lose two cards were pushed towards him le chiffre watched him from the other side of the table bond took the cards and looked at them he had two picture cards they were worth nothing a card said bond le chiffre turned over his own two cards a picture card and a three three said the croupier le chiffre took a card and slowly turned it over it was a nine a lovely nine the croupier pushed it to bond now it was le chiffres turn to decide he needed a six to make a total of nine it was a difficult decision he did not know what bonds first two cards had been le chiffre looked at bonds cards then he looked at his own cards his face was hot finally le chiffre took his card and turned it over it was a wonderful card a five the bank has eight said the croupier bond sat silently le chiffre smiled le chiffre was sure that bonds cards would add up to more than nine every person watching thought that bond had lost the croupier turned over bonds first two cards they were picture cards and worth nothing nine said the croupier the people around the table shouted with surprise bond was watching le chiffre the big man fell back in his chair his mouth opened and shut and his face was grey the croupier pushed the plaques across to bond then le chiffre took a packet of notes from his pocket he threw them on the table the croupier counted them a hank of ten million francs the croupier said thats all his money thought bond and if he loses now no one will give him any more banco said bond he looked straight at le chiffre once more the croupier pushed two cards across to him bond looked at them and turned them over nine said the croupier le chiffre looked at his own two cards they were picture cards the croupier pushed the plaques across to bond le chiffre watched the plaques then he stood up slowly he pushed past the other players people moved to let him go past they looked at him strangely he was like a man who carried the smell of death then he was gone bond stood up he asked the croupier to take his winnings to the cashier the other players were getting up from their chairs there could not be a game without a banker bond said goodnight to them then he went to meet vesper and felix leiter they walked across to the cashier bond took felix leiters money in notes and took a cheque for the rest of his winnings he walked over to the bar and gave leiter his thirtytwo million francs back for a few minutes they drank champagne and talked about the game leiter took a bulleti from his pocket its from the walking stickgun he said i gave the gun to mathis the gunman escaped but theyve got his fingerprints from the gun perhaps well find out more about him in the morning bond touched his jacket pocket ill take my winnings to the hotel he said he turned to vesper would you like a glass of champagne in the nightclub its called the roi galant id like that said vesper ill meet you in the lobby will you come too felix asked bond but he was hoping to be alone with vesper i would like to go to bed leiter said he knew what bond was thinking but ill come to the hotel with you at the hotel leiter walked with bond up to his room will you and vesper be ok asked leiter or would you like me to stay with you go and get some sleep said bond dont worry im going to hide the cheque they wont be interested in me without the money thanks for all your help leiter smiled then he went out and closed the door bond went to the bathroom and washed his face in cold water twice that day he had nearly died would le chiffres men try to kill him again or was le chiffre already on a boat was he trying to escape from smersh bond took the cheque from his pocket then he opened the door of his room there was nobody outside he began to work with a small screwdriver five minutes later bond closed and locked the door then he went down the stairs chapter ten kidnapped the entrance to the roi galant was in a corner of the roulette room the night club was small and dark a band guitar piano and drums was playing in a corner bond and vesper sat at a table near the door bond ordered a bottle of champagne and a breakfast of eggs and bacon they sat and listened to the music for a time then bond turned and looked at vesper its wonderful to be with you he said the job is finished and its a lovely end to the day he expected her to smile but she didnt yes it is she said she looked nervous maybe its because i was cool to her earlier this evening bond thought he drank champagne and talked about the day he spoke about mathis and leiter le chiffre and smersh ive telephoned paris from the hotel vesper said ive left a message for m about the game this was all she said she drank her champagne and did not look at bond bond was disappointed he drank a lot of champagne and ordered another bottle they ate their eggs and bacon silently at four oclock a waiter came to the table i have a note for miss lynd he said he gave vesper a piece of paper she read the note quickly its from mathis she told bond he wants me to meet him at the casino entrance hall hes got a message for you hes probably not wearing evening clothes and he doesnt want to come in ill only be a minute or two then perhaps we can go home she smiled quickly ive not been very friendly tonight im sorry its been a difficult day its ok said bond ill pay the bill bond watched her walk to the entrance then he lit a cigarette he was suddenly tired he called for the bill and took a last drink of champagne as he drank bond wondered about the note to vesper it seemed strange why hadnt mathis asked them both to come to the casino entrance hall something was wrong bond paid the bill and walked quickly through the gaming room he looked up and down the long entrance hall no vesper no mathis he ran to the entrance the night air was cold suddenly he heard a small cry and the sound of a car door closing then a citroen raced out of the wide entrance gate as he watched bond saw someone throw something small and black from one of the windows it fell into the flowers by the gate then the citroen raced towards the coast road bond ran to the gate he picked up vespers black evening bag from amongst the flowers inside was the note it read can you come to the entrance hall for a moment i have news for bond rene mathis it was not mathiss writing bond ran to his car chapter eleven the crash soon bond was speeding along the coast road there was no wind and the night was clear bond drove faster and faster he was angry why had m sent vesper a woman on this job he knew that le chiffres men would give him the girl it he gave them the cheque well he wouldnt do it this job was more important than vesper all right he would try and catch the citroen but if he didnt catch them he would go back to his hotel he would say nothing to mathis about the citroen he would not pay le chiffres men the forty million francs tomorrow he would show mathis the note he would ask mathis what had happened to vesper bonds bentley was travelling at kilometres an hour the citroen was only a kilometre or two ahead bond took a gun from under the drivers seat he put it on the seat beside him there were three men and the girl in the citroen le chiffre was driving the man who had carried the walking stick gun was beside him there was a thick handle next to the mans left hand the handle came from the floor of the car the tall thin gunman was sitting in the back seat vesper was next to him she had a sack over her head it was tied around her neck with a piece of rope le chiffre watched bonds car in his driving mirror the bentley was only a kilometre behind when he went round a corner le chiffre slowed to fifty kilometres an hour he could see a crossroads ahead get ready he said to the man beside him the man put his fingers round the handle at that moment the bentleys headlights came round the corner now said le chiffre the man pulled the handle up quickly suddenly the boot at the back of the car opened wide there was the sound of metal hitting the road le chiffre looked into the mirror bonds car was coming round the corner le chiffre quickly drove the car into a side road at the same time he turned off the cars lights he stopped the car and all three men jumped out they ran back to the crossroads each man carried a gun the bentley was speeding towards them chapter twelve the villa bond could not see the citroen when he came round the corner he saw the crossroads ahead and started to slow down but he was too late suddenly there was a carpet of metal spikes under his wheels they tore the bentleys tyres bond could not control the heavy car it hit the wall at the side of the road and turned over bond was thrown onto the floor of the car there was the sound of breaking glass and metal on concrete then the bentley stopped moving le chiffre and his two gunmen ran towards the car put your guns away and get him out said le chiffre be careful i dont want a dead man and hurry the two men pulled bond from the car he was not conscious tie his arms said le chiffre put him in the car take everything from his pockets and give me his gun le chiffre took bonds gun then he walked back to the citroën bond was conscious now every part of his body hurt but there were no bones broken the two gunmen pushed him into the back seat of the citroën bond felt sick and weak no one knew where he was no one would miss him until the morning they would find the bentley but they would not know the car was bonds until later then there was vesper he looked past the thin man vesper he said quietly she did not answer bond was suddenly afraid that she was dead but then she moved under the sack at the same time the thin man hit bond twice silence the man said bond lay back against the seat with his eyes closed he blamed himself for his situation he hadnt been careful enough instead be had sat in the roi galant drinking champagne with vesper all this time le chiffre had said nothing the third man shut the boot of the car the man got in and sat beside him the citroen raced along the coast road bond guessed that it was about five oclock in the morning he also guessed that they were only two or three kilometres away from le chiffres villa bond knew why the men had taken vesper they had known that bond would try to rescue her for the first time since the car crash he began to feel afraid ten minutes later the citroen turned left into a small side road it went through some open gates and stopped outside the front door of le chiffres villa le chiffre opened the door of the house with a key then the thin man pushed bond out of the car le chiffre went inside the house and the thin man pushed vesper in after him bond followed her he heard the third gunman lock the door behind him le chiffre was standing near the open door of a room he waved to bond he was telling bond to come to the room the third gunman was taking vesper away to the back of the house suddenly bond kicked the thin man hard on the legs the man cried out in pain and bond ran after vesper his hands were tied but his feet were free the third gunman heard bond coming the man turned quickly bond kicked him hard in the stomach and the man fell back against the wall bond tried to kick him again but the gunman caught his shoe he twisted bonds foot and bond crashed to the ground for a moment bond lay still then the thin man came and pulled him up against the wall he had a gun in his hand he used it to hit bond hard across the legs bond cried out with pain and fell onto his knees a door banged shut vesper and the third gunman had disappeared bond turned his head to the right and saw le chiffre come here my dear friend said le chiffre he spoke calmly in english lets not waste any more time bond walked towards him there was

chair le chiffre pointed at the smaller chair use that chair he told the thin man get him ready he turned to bond take off your clothes he said do it or we will break your fingers were serious people mr bond we dont care if you live or die le chiffre nodded to the thin man then he turned and left the room the thin man took a knife from his pocket he cut the rope round bonds arms then he moved quickly away from bond a moment later the thin man pulled bonds jacket down his back bond could not move his arms the knife cut through the cloth suddenly bonds arms were free then the two halves of his jacket fell in front of him now take off the rest of your clothes the thin man said bond slowly started to take off his shirt le chiffre came quietly into the room he was carrying a pot of coffee in one hand and a large stick in the other hand le chiffre put the coffee on the small table near the window and sat in the wooden chair he pulled the other chair across so that it was opposite him then he poured some coffee into the glass bond stood naked in the middle of the room sit down le chiffre said he pointed to the small chair bond sat down the thin man tied his arms and legs to the chair bond could not move the gunman left the room and closed the door lc chi tire lit a cigarette and drank some coffee he stared into bonds eyes then he hit bond hard in the stomach with the stick

chiffres burning cigarette against his face it was a millimetre or two below his left eye aaaagh cried bond the next time it will be in your eye said le chiffre he moved the cigarette away and drank some more coffee you wont be able to cash the cheque said bond he was breathing heavily the police will know that its mine le chittre hit bond across his legs bond nearly fainted my friend i forgot to

nobody knows where you went so that was the plan thought bond he was going to die there was not enough time for mathis or leiter to rescue him then there was vesper soon they would start torturing her too what would they do to her he did not want to think about that bond lifted his head no he whispered le chiffre made a small angry sound he hit bonds arms and legs with the stick then he pushed the cigarette into bonds face again this time it was a millimetre under bonds right eye the pain was terrible bonds face felt like a ball of fire he wanted to scream his eyes filled with tears and he could not see clearly one more chance le chiffre told him do you want to be blind mr bond he took the cigarette away again now he began you stop said a voice quietly there was somebody else in the room bond lifted his head slowly le chiffre was staring at the doorway behind bond he could see the terror in le chiffres eyes smersh le chiffre whispered no no i your two men are dead said a voice behind bond you are a thief and a traitor ive been sent from russia to kill you youre lucky that i only have time to shoot you i was told to kill you painfully the voice stopped the room was silent somewhere outside a bird began to sing bond stared at le chiffres face it was white with fear there was a soft sound then no other noise at all suddenly a small black hole appeared between le chiffres eyes a bullet hole le chiffres head fell to one side and his body hung over the chair a hand came from behind bond it pulled his head back bond looked up into two shining eyes behind a narrow black mask above the mask was a hat then the hand pushed his head down again you are lucky said the voice i have no orders to kill foreign spies but youre a gambler one day perhaps you will play against one of us i must let them see that youre a spy the man stood behind bonds right shoulder a moment later he put his hand in front of bonds face the hand was holding a long thin knife he held it like a pen he moved the knife above bonds hand which was tied to the chair he cut four lines into the back of bonds hand they looked like the roman number iii with a line underneath it was the russian letter sha it was the first letter of the russian word shpion spy blood begun to fall on to the floor bond had suffered the beatings with the stick and the burning cigarette on his face but this pain was too much everything went black as he fell unconscious chapter fourteen vesper explains james bond woke up in a bed he had been dreaming it had been a bad dream and he was shaking then he heard a womans voice he opened his eyes sunlight was shining through the window he could hear the sound of birds in the garden outside he turned his head and saw a nurse sitting beside him she smiled at him where am i he asked youre in a private hospital in royale she said i have come from england to look after you im nurse gibson ill go and tell the doctor that youre awake youve been unconscious since they brought you here two days ago weve been worried bond closed his eyes for a few minutes his head and whole body hurt the door opened and the doctor came in mathis and the nurse followed him mathis smiled at bond but bond could see that he was worried the doctor was a young frenchman he came and stood beside bond he spoke clearly in english you have a lot of questions to ask me mr bond he said i can tell you most of the answers then monsieur mathis will speak to you nurse gibson gave the doctor a chair to sit in then she left the room you have been here about two days said the doctor a farmer found your car on his way into royale he called the police soon monsieur mathis learnt that it was your car immediately he went to le chittres villa with his men they found you and le chiftre and miss lynd she was not hurt but she was very shocked shes much better now shes staying at royale she will stay until youre well enough to go back to england le chiffres two gunmen are dead the doctor went on roth men were shot in the back of the head they were in the same room as miss lynd le chiffre was shot between the eyes with the same gun did you see him die mr bond yes said bond youll continue to be in pain for several days the doctor told him you must rest then he smiled and left the room mathis came and sat in the doctors chair theres a lot for us to talk about he said our people in paris and london want to know everything so does leiter oh and m spoke to me on the telephone hes very pleased with you bond smiled to himself a tall thin man with one arm came from london mathis went on i think he was vespers boss he spoke with vesper for a long time he told her to look after you the man with one arm was head of s now said mathis who killed le chiffre smersh said bond mathis looked shocked so they were looking for him he said what did the killer look like bond explained everything that had happened he was very tired when he finished his story mathis put a hand on bonds shoulder theres one other mystery he said where did you hide the cheque weve searched your hotel room three times it isnt there it is there bond said he laughed each door has a room number when leiter left me that night i unscrewed the number from the door i put the folded cheque under it then i screwed it back on again it will still be there after mathis left bond lay back and closed his eyes he was thinking about vesper as he fell asleep four days later bond was feeling much better he asked to see vesper he had been too ill to see her before now bond had to ask vesper some difficult questions he had to write a report to m but he didnt want to tell m that vesper was stupid she could lose her job he expected vesper to look ill but she was brown and healthy from the sun she came into his room smiling ive been to the beach every day she explained the doctor said that the sunshine would be good for me head of s agreed and ive found a lovely beach down the coast i take my lunch and go there each day i dont come back until the evening bond could not think of anything to say he stared at the beautiful girl and felt angry youll be able to get up soon vesper went on the doctor told me he said that swimming in the sea will be good for you it will be weeks before i can swim said bond angrily but you you go and enjoy yourself i im sorry said vesper i i wanted to help you she began to cry im really sorry this is all my fault bond put a hand on her arm its all right vesper he said gently im sorry that i shouted at you of course ill come to the beach with you it will be wonderful bond gave her a cigarette what happened after you left me in the night club he asked i was stupid said vesper she looked away from him i couldnt see mathis so i went outside i saw a man waiting in a car i thought it was mathis when i got near two of le chiffres men jumped out from behind another car i screamed she went on but nobody heard me the men picked me up and put me in the back of the car i threw my bag out of the car window did it help you yes it did said bond but bond knew that le chiffre had wanted him to follow the citroen i think i fainted vesper went on i dont remember much about the car journey did they hurt you after they took you away asked bond no they tied me to a chair and played cards she replied then they went to sleep thats how smersh got them my chair was in a corner of the room i didnt see smersh i heard some strange noises then i heard one of the men fall off a chair after that the door closed then mathis and the police arrived that was an hour later i slept most of the time once i heard a terrible scream from very far away that was probably me said bond vesper started to cry again they did awful things to you and its my fault she said its all right said bond its finished now lets forget it i thought that youd he angry with me said vesper how can i thank you is there something that i can do i want to do something she looked at him and smiled i promise to do something something he smiled at her you promise he said she looked into his eyes and put her hand on his hand i promise she replied quietly after a moment she picked up her bag and walked to the door shall i come tomorrow she asked yes please vesper said bond chapter fifteen a small hotel vesper visited bond each day soon he was well enough to leave the hospital but he did not want to go to one of the big hotels in royale ill find you somewhere outside of the town said vesper the next day she came with his clothes a hired car and a driver where are we going asked bond wait and see she said vesper was quiet as they drove along the coast road once or twice bond saw her look into the drivers mirror is something wrong he asked its nothing she said quickly its silly i thought that we were being followed she looked behind them oh look bond turned and looked through the back window about half a kilometre away he saw a black car it was moving fast bond laughed we cant be the only people using this road he said nobody is following us were not doing anything wrong stop worrying vesper i expect youre right she said and were nearly there she sat quietly and looked out of the window but bond knew that she was nervous after a few minutes they came to a small road that went down to the sea drive down there and stop bond told the driver the driver slowed the car and turned off the coast road he stopped the car behind some trees bond and vesper watched through the back window vesper held bonds arm tightly they saw the other car getting closer it went past and a mans face looked quickly towards them vespers face was white with fear he looked at us she said i knew that he was following us dont be silly said bond he was looking at that sign bond pointed to a sign on the corner of the road the sign read fresh fruit for sale theres probably a fruit farm further down this road he said oh yes said vesper of course you must be right im sorry forget it said bond the suns shining and this is our holiday the job is finished and theres nothing to worry about is there no of course there isnt said vesper she smiled again were almost there i hope that you like it after a few minutes they saw the sea then a small brightlypainted hotel appeared between the trees its not very big said vesper but its very clean and the food is wonderful she looked at bond will it be all right i love it he told her the car stopped behind the hotel after a moment the owner came out to meet them monsieur versoix was about fifty years old versoix took bond and vesper to their rooms bonds room was on the corner of the building the window looked out onto the sea vespers room was next door there was a bathroom between the two rooms everything was clean and comfortable dinner will be at seventhirty versoix told them im sorry were so quiet more people will come at the weekend they were speaking outside of vespers room after versoix left them bond pushed vesper into her room and closed the door he kissed her gently this is wonderful bond said vespers eyes were shining and she put her hand on his arm they held each other close for a moment then bond kissed her again he kissed her harder this time and she fell back on to the bed he sat beside her and they looked at each other bond put his arm round her then she got up and walked over to the window its going to take some time to get ready for dinner vesper said go for a swim ill unpack your clothes for you bond came and stood close against her he put his arms round her not now she said quietly bond kissed her neck all right vesper he said he walked over to the door and looked back at her she had not moved then he went out and shut the door bond walked along to his room and sat down on the bed he could not decide what to do have a sleep go for a swim alter a moment he put on his swimming shorts and went downstairs he went out on to the terrace and down to the beach he walked along the edge of the water until he could not see the hotel then he went into the sea it was nearly seven oclock and the sun was setting soon it would disappear bond thought about vesper as he swam he knew that he wanted to sleep with her she was a very secretive person and there were things that she would never tell him bond found this secrecy very exciting after some time bond came out of the water he lay on the beach until his body was dry then he walked back to the hotel chapter sixteen the telephone call vesper had unpacked bonds suitcases and she had put his clothes away in the bathroom his toothbrush and shaving things were on a glass shelf vespers toothbrush was next to them there were also two small bottles bond noticed with surprise that one of the bottles contained sleeping pills perhaps she has problems sleeping he thought after what happened to her at le chiffres villa vesper had run a hot bath for him thank you darling he called as he got into the water a bath is exactly what i want now and then i want you well i want my dinner and some champagne so hurry she called back laughing all right all right said bond he washed then got out and dried himself he dressed in a white shirt and dark blue trousers vesper came into his room without knocking on the door she was wearing a blue shirt and a dark red skirt the shirt was the same colour as her eyes she held his hand and together they went downstairs their table was on the terrace they sat down and bond poured two glasses of champagne while they ate bond told vesper about his swim then they talked about their plans for the following morning they did not speak about their feelings for each other but bond could see the excitement in vespers eyes they finished the food and opened a second bottle then vesper smiled at him you give me all the things that i like best she said i wish that i deserved it what do you mean asked bond surprised vesper looked at him you really dont know much about me she said suddenly a small shadow seemed to pass between them i know all that i need to know until tomorrow said bond and the next day and the next he poured some more champagne you dont know much about me people are like islands said vesper they can be very close but they dont really touch she laughed suddenly then she put a hand on his dont look so worried my island feels very close to your island tonight the small shadow had passed they drank their coffee then vesper stood up and put a hand on his shoulder im tired she said she kissed him lightly then went into the hotel a minute or two later bond saw the light go on in her room he finished his drink then he thanked versoix and his wife for the dinner and went upstairs it was only halfpast nine when he stepped into vespers room moonlight shone through the window bond closed the door behind him he walked across to vespers bed bond woke up in his own room at dawn for a time he lay there smiling as he remembered the night before then he got out of bed some minutes later he went quietly out of the hotel and down to the beach he went into the water and swam i love her he said to himself and today ill ask her to marry me when he got back to the hotel terrace he was surprised to see vesper downstairs she came out of the telephone booth in the lobby she turned and began to walk quietly up the stairs towards their rooms vesper he called vesper turned quickly and put a hand up to her mouth she stared at him whats the matter darling he asked nnothing she gave a little laugh you surprised me thats all i was just telephoning mathis she spoke quickly i wanted him to get me another dress ive ive not got anything nice to wear have you been for a swim was the water nice it was wonderful said bond he was watching her carefully he knew that she was lying about the telephone call well have breakfast on the terrace he said he put his arms round her but she moved quickly up the stairs it it was a surprise to see you she said she laughed loudly too loudly bond wanted to tell her to relax and tell the truth but instead he smiled ill see you on the terrace for breakfast he said then he went to his room chapter seventeen the man with the patch at breakfast bond asked her to tell the truth about the mysterious phone call why do you ask vesper said angrily do you think that ive got another lover her eyes filled with tears ive ive got a very bad headache im going to stay in my room this morning for the next two hours bond walked along the beach when vesper and bond met again for lunch he did not speak about the telephone call instead he talked about his walk that morning vesper only said a word or two she did not look at him then suddenly he saw that she was staring past him her face was white with fear bond turned his head a man was sitting at a table on the opposite side of the terrace the man was about fifty years old with brown hair he wore a dark suit bond guessed that he was a businessman whats the matter darling he asked vesper its the man in the car she said the man who was following us bond turned and looked again versoix was showing the man the menu they were talking about the wine after a moment or two versoix walked away the man looked at vesper and bond for a second then he opened a newspaper and began to read he had a black patch over one eye bond turned to vesper are you sure that hes the same man he asked her face was still white she picked up her glass of wine and drank from it her hands were shaking i know that he is she said my headache is still had im going to lie down in my room she left the table and walked from the terrace she didnt look back bond ordered some coffee then he got up and walked through the hotel there was a black peugeot in the car park was it the car that they had seen before bond couldnt he sure he looked inside but it was empty the boot was locked he made a note of the cars number then he walked back to the terrace the man was eating and didnt look up bond sat in vespers chair and watched the other table a few minutes later the man asked for the bill he paid it and left bond heard the peugeot drive away towards royale versoix brought bond his coffee who was the man at the other table bond asked the hotel owner he looked like a friend of mine i dont know said versoix ive never seen him before but he enjoyed his lunch he said that he would come here again in a day or two he comes from switzerland miss lynd made an early telephone call said bond i must remember to pay for it a call to paris an elysée number i think mathis had an elysee telephone number bond remembered thank you monsieur but theres nothing to pay said versoix there was no reply to miss lynds call to paris but it was an invalides number not an elysee number chapter eighteen gettler two days later a taxi came to take vesper to royale she told bond that she needed some medicine that night vesper tried to be cheerful she drank a lot of champagne when they went upstairs she took him into her bedroom they made love but afterwards she cried into her pillow bond went to his room feeling very unhappy he could not sleep early in the morning he heard a door open softly some small sounds came from downstairs bond was sure that vesper was in the telephone booth very soon after he heard her door close softly this was saturday on sunday the man with the black patch came back again bond had telephoned mathis and asked him to check the number of the peugeot mathis had telephoned back a little later the car was hired two weeks ago mathis had told bond the mans name is adolph gettler and he comes from switzerland gettler gave the carhire company the address of a bank in zurich did you contact the swiss police asked bond of course said mathis the bank does have an account in gettlers name he doesnt use it very often they believe that gettlers business is clocks and watches bond had told this to vesper now the man with the patch had appeared again vesper quickly got up from the table and went to her room bond finished his lunch then followed her her door was locked but she opened it for him bond took her across to the bed and they sat down vesper we cant continue like this bond said you must

said let me think im trying to do what is best please believe me she took him to the door and they kissed again then bond went out and she shut the door behind him that night at dinner she seemed happy and excited they sat and finished the bottle of champagne then they went up to her room they made love for two hours you must go now said vesper after bond had slept for a short time in her arms he kissed her eyes and her mouth look at me she said and let me look at you she looked at every line of his face her eyes were full of tears as she kissed him gently goodnight my dearest love she said he went to the door and looked back sleep well my darling he said dont worry everything is all right now he closed the door softly and walked back to his room chapter nineteen the letter versoix brought him the letter in the morning he ran into bonds room holding the envelope there has been a terrible accident he said madame bond jumped out of bed and ran to her door it was open and sunlight lit up the room vesper was lying on the bed bond could see only her black hair above the sheet he fell down on to his knees beside the bed and pulled back the sheet she was asleep he told himself she must be her eyes were closed but she was not breathing versoix touched bonds shoulder he pointed to the sleeping pills bottle on the floor beside the bed the bottle was empty bond stood up and took the letter from versoix he walked back to his room and sat on the bed he looked out of the window at the sea for a moment or two then he opened the envelope it was not a long letter after the first
