john mortimer rumpole and the heavy brigade from rumpole of the bailey the story of my most recent murder and my defence of petey delgardo the youngest and perhaps the most appalling of the disagreeable delgardo brothers raises several matters which are painful not to say embarrassing for me to recall the tale begins with rumpoles reputation at its lowest and although it has now risen somewhat it has done so for rather curious and not entirely creditable reasons as you shall hear after the case of the dartford post office robbery which i have recounted in the previous chapter i noticed a distinct slump in the rumpole practice i had emerged as i thought triumphant from that encounter with the disciplinary authority but i suppose i was marked for a while as a barrister who had been reported for professional misconduct the quality of briefs which landed on the rumpole corner of the mantelpiece in our clerks room were deteriorating and i spent a great deal more time pottering round magistrates courts or down at sessions than i did in full flood round the marble halls of the old bailey so last winter picture rumpole in the november of his days walking in the mists under the black branches of bare trees to chambers and remembering thomas hood no warmth no cheerfulness no healthful ease no comfortable feel in any member no shade no shine no butterflies no bees no fruits no flowers no leaves no birds november as i walked i hoped there might be some sort of trivial little brief waiting for me in chambers in november an old mans fancy lightly turned to thoughts of indecent assault which might bring briefs at london sessions and before the uxbridge justices i had started forty years ago defending a charge of unsolicited grope on the northern line and thats what i was back to in my end is my beginning i pushed open the door of my chambers and went into the clerks room there was a buzz of activity very little of it i was afraid centring round the works of rumpole but henry was actually smiling as he sat in his shirtsleeves at his desk and called out mr rumpole stern daughter of the voice of god oh duty oh my learned clerk what are the orders for today henry mine not to reason why mine but to do or die before some court of summary jurisdiction theres a con waiting for you sir in a new matter from maurice nooks and parsley henry had mentioned one of the busiest firms of criminal solicitors who had a reputation of being not too distant from some of their heavily villainous clients in fact the most active partner was privately known to me as shady nooks new matter the stepney road stabbing mr nooks says youll have read about it in the papers in fact i had read about it in that great source of legal knowledge the news of the world the delgardo brothers leslie and basil were a legend in the east end they gave copiously to charity they had friends in show business and went on holiday with a certain police superintendent and a wellknown member of parliament they hadnt been convicted of any ortence although their young brother peter delgardo had occasionally been in trouble they ran a club known as the paradise rooms a number of protection rackets and a seaside home for orphans they were a devoted family and leslie and basil were said to be particularly concerned when their brother peter was seen by several witnesses kneeling in the street outside a pub called the old justice beside the bloodstained body of an east end character known as tosher macbride later a knife liberally smeared with blood of macbrides group was found beside the drivers seat of peter delgardos elderly daimler he was arrested in the paradise rooms to which he had apparently fled for protection after the death of tosher the case seemed hopeless but the name delgardo made sure it would hit the headlines i greeted the news that it was corning rumpoles way with a low whistle of delight i took the brief from henry my heart leaps up when i behold a rainbow in the sky or a murder in the offing i have to admit it i suddenly thought of the fly in the ointment i suppose theyre giving me a leader in a murder they havent mentioned a leader henry seemed puzzled i suppose itll be featherstone well at least itll get me back to the bailey my proper stamping ground i moved towards the door and it was then my clerk henry mentioned a topic which as you will see has a vital part to play in this particular narrative my hat now i am not particularly selfconscious as far as headgear is concerned and the old black anthony eden has seen it must be admitted a good many years service it has travelled to many farflung courts in fair weather and foul it once had a small glowing cigar end dropped in it as it lay under rumpoles seat in pommeroys it once blew off on a windy day in newington causeway and was run over by a bicycle the hat is therefore it must be admitted like its owner scarred and battered by life no longer in its first youth and in a somewhat collapsed condition all the same it fits me comfortably and keeps the rain out most of the time i have grown used to my hat and in view of our long association i have a certain affection for it i was therefore astonished when henry followed me to the door and in a lowered tone as if he were warning me that the coppers had called to arrest me he said the other clerks were discussing your hat sir over coffee my god they must be hard up for conversation to fill in a couple of hours round the abc and they were passing the comment its a subject of a good many jokes in the temple well its seen some service i took off the offending article and looked at it and it shows it quite frankly mr rumpole i cant send you down the bailey not on a topclass murder in a hat like it you mean the jury might get a peep at the titfer and convict without leaving the box i couldnt believe my ears mr featherstone wears a nice bowler mr rumpole i am not leading counsel henry i told him firmly i am not the conservativelabour mp for somewhere or other and i dont like nice bowlers our old clerk albert managed to live with thfs hat for a good many years theres been some changes made since alberts time mr rumpole henry had laid himself open and im afraid i made the unworthy comment oh yes i got some decent briefs in alberts time the penge bungalow murder the brighton forgery i wasnt put out to grass in the uxbridge magistrates court the chairs in my room in chambers have become a little wobbly over the years and my first thought was that the two large men sitting on them might be in some danger of collapse they both wore blue suits made of some lightweight material and both had gold wrist watches and identity bracelets dangling at their wrists they had diamond rings pink faces and brushed back black hair leslie delgardo was the eldest and the most affable his brother basil had an almost permanent look of discontent and his voice easily became querulous in attendance balanced on my insecure furniture were shady nooks a silver haired and suntanned person who also sported a large gold wristwatch and his articled clerk miss stebbings a nicelooking girl fresh from law school who had clearly no idea what area of the law she had got into i lit a small cigar looked round the assembled company and said our client is not with us of course hardly mr rumpole said nooks mr peter delgardo has been moved to the prison hospital hes never been a well boy our petey leslie delgardo sounded sorrowful our clients health has always been an anxiety to his brothers nooks explained i see i hastily consulted the brief the victim of the murder was a gentleman called tosher macbride know anything about him i believe he was a rent collector nooks sounded vague not a bad start the jury be against murder but if someone has to go it may as well be the rent collector i flipped through the depositions until i got to the place where i felt most at home the forensic report on the blood bloodstains on your brothers sleeve group consistent with ten percent of the population said nooks including tosher macbride and exhibit i a sheath knife mr macbrides blood on that or of course ten percent of the population knife found in your brothers ancient daimler fallen down by the drivers seat bloodstains on his coat sleeve bloodstained sheath knife in his car i know it looks black for young peter leslie shook his head sadly i looked up at him sharply lets say its evidence mr delgardo on which the prosecution might expect to get a conviction unless the judge has just joined the fulham road anarchists or the jurys drunk youll pull it off for petey it was the first time basil delgardo had spoken and his words showed i thought a touching faith in rumpole pull it off i shall sit behind my learned leader i presume youre going to guthrie featherstone qc in these chambers then nooks uttered words which were i must confess music to my ears well actually mr rumpole on this one no mr rumpole my brothers and i weve heard of your wonderful reputation said basil i did the penge bungalow murder without a leader i admitted but that was thirty years ago they let me loose on that weve heard golden opinions of you mr rumpole golden opinions leslie delgardo made an expansive gesture rattling his identity bracelet i got up and looked out of the window no one mentioned the hat pardon me leslie sounded puzzled and nooks added his voice to the vote of confidence mr delgardos brothers are peifectly satisfied mr rumpole to leave this one entirely to you now is the winter of my discontent made glorious summer by a firstclass murder i turned back to the group apologetic im sorry gentlemen insensitive im afraid all these months round the uxbridge magistrates court have blunted my sensitivity to your brother it can hardly seem such a sign of summer were perfectly confident mr rumpole you can handle it basil lit a cigarette with a gold lighter and i went back to the desk handle it of course i can handle it as i always say murder is nothing more than common assault with unfortunate consequences well arrange it for you to see the doctor nooks was businesslike im perfectly well thank you doctor lewis bleen said leslie and nooks explained patiently the wellknown psychiatrist on the subject of mr peter delgardos mental capacity poor petey hes never been right mr rumpole weve always had to look after him leslie explained his responsibilities as head of the family you could call him peter pan basil made an unexpected literary reference the little boy that never grew up i doubted the accuracy of this analogy i dont know whether peter pan was actually responsible for many stabbings down stepney high street but thats it mr rumpole leslie shook his head sadly peters not responsible you see not poor old petey no more responsible than a child doctor lewis bleen diploma of psychological medicine from the university of edinburgh headshrinker extraordinaire resident guru of whats bugging you answers to listeners problems had one of those accents which remind you of the tinkle of cups and the thud of dropped scones in edinburgh tearooms he sat and sucked his pipe in the interview room at brixton and looked in a motherly fashion at the youngest of the delgardos who was slumped in front of us staring moodily at nothing in particular remember me do you doctor b bleen petey had his brothers features but the sharpness of their eyes was blurred in his his big hands were folded in his lap and he wore a perpetual puzzled frown he also spoke with a stammer his answer hadnt pleased the good doctor who tried again do you know the time petey n n no disorientated as to time better pleased the doctor made a note that might just be because hes not wearing a watch i was unkind enough to suggest the doctor ignored me where are you peter inthen n nick i suggested hospital wing peter confirmed my suggestion orientated as to place was my diagnosis doctor bleen gave me a sour look as though id just spat out the shortcake possibly he turned back to our patient when we last met peter you told me you couldnt remember how macbride got stabbed nno there appears to be a complete blotting out of all the facts the doctor announced with quiet satisfaction mightnt it be worth asking him whether he was there when tosher got stabbed i was bold enough to ask at which nooks chipped in mr rumpole as a solictor of some little experience may i interject here if you have to i sighed and fished for a small cigar doctor bleen will correct me if im wrong but as i understand hes prepared to give evidence that at the relevant moment so far i have no idea when the relevant moment was i lit the cigar nooks carried on regardless mr delgardos mind was so affected that he didnt know the nature and quality of his act nor did he know that what he was doing was wrong you mean he thought he was giving tosher a warm handshake and welcome to the rent collectors union thats not exactly how i suggest we put it to the learned judge nooks smiled at me as though at a wayward child then how do you suggest we tell it to the old sweetheart guilty but insane mr rumpole we rather anticipated your advice would be that guilty but insane in law and have you anticipated what the prosecution might say peter has been examined by a doctor stotter from the home office i dont think youll find him unhelpful said doctor bleen charles stotter and i play golf together weve had a word about this case rum things you get up to playing golf it always struck me as a good game to avoid i turned and drew peter delgardo into the conversation well peter youll want to be getting back to the telly peter stood up i was surprised by his height and his apparent strength a big pale man in an old dressing gown and pyjamas just one question before you go did you stab tosher macbride the doctor smiled at me tolerantly oh i dont think the answer to that will be particularly reliable even the question may strike you as unreliable doctor all the same im asking it i moved closer to peter because if you did peter we can call the good shrink here and doctor stotter fresh from the golf course and theyll let you off lightly youll go to broadmoor at her majestys pleasure and of course her majesty will be thinking of you constantly youll get a lot more telly and some exciting basketweaving and a handful of pills every night to keep you quiet petey and if youre very good they might let you weed the doctors garden or play cricket against the second eleven of male warders but i cant offer you these delights until i know did you stab tosher i think my patients tired i turned on the trick cyclist at last and said hes not your patient at the moment hes my client doctor bleen has joined us at great personal inconvenience nooks was distressed then i wouldnt dream of detaining him a moment longer at which point doctor lewis bleen dpm left in what might mildly be described as a huff when hed been seen off the premises by a helpful trusty i repeated my question did you do it peter i c c c the answer whatever it was was a long time in coming nooks supplied a word killed him but peter shook his head couldnt of he was already c cut when i saw him like you see i cant let you get sent to hospital unless you did it i explained as though to a child if you didnt well just have to fight the case i wants you to f f fight it im not going into any nut house peter delgardos instructions were perfectly clear and if we fight we might very well lose you understand that my b b brothers have told me youre hot stuff they told me tip top awyer once again i was puzzled by the height of my reputation with the delgardos but i wasnt going to argue tip top really well lets say ive got to know a trick or two over the years a few wrinkles sit down peter peter sat down slowly and i sat opposite him ignoring the restive nooks and his articled clerk now hadnt you better tell me exactly what happened the night tosher macbride got stabbed i was working overtime a few days later when my door opened and in walked no less a person than guthrie featherstone qc mp our head of chambers my relations with featherstone ever since he pipped me at the post for the position of head have always been somewhat uneasy and were not exactly improved when i seized command of the ship when he was leading me in the matter of the dartford post office robbery we have little enough in common featherstone as henry pointed out wears a nice bowler and a black velvet collar on his overcoat his nails are well manicured his voice is carefully controlled as are his politics he gets on very well with judges and solicitors and not so well with the criminal clientele he has never been less than polite to me even at my most mutinous moments and now he smiled with considerable bonhomie rumpole youre a late bird just trying to feather my nest with a rather juicy little murder featherstone dropped into my tattered leather armchair reserved for clients and carefully examined his wellpolished black brogues maurice nooks told me hes not taking in a leader thats right i know the last time i led you wasnt succesfou im a bit of a back seat driver im afraid of course youre an old hand at crime featherstone conceded an old lag you might say but its a question of tactics in this case maurice said if i appeared it might look as if theyd rather overegged the pudding you think the jury might prefer a bit of good plain cooking i looked at him and he smiled delightfully you put things rather well sometimes there was a pause and then the learned leader got down to what was i suppose the nub and the purpose of his visit horace im anxious to put an end to any sort of rift between the two senior men in chambers it doesnt make for a happy ship aye aye sir i gave him a brief nautical salute from my position at the desk im glad you agree serieusement horace we dont see enough of each other socially he paused again but i could find nothing to say ive got a couple of tickets for the scales of justice ball at the savoy would you join me and marigold to say i was taken aback would be an understatement i was astonished lets get this quite clear featherstone oh guthrie please very well guthrie youre asking me to trip the light fantastic toe with your wife and if youd like to bring your good lady i looked at featherstone in total amazement my your missus are you referring at all to my wife she who must be obeyed do i take it you actually want to spend an evening out with she itll be great fun do you really think so he had lost me now i went to the door and unhooked the mac and the old hat preparatory to calling it a day however featherstone had some urgent matter to communicate apparently of an embarrassing nature oh and horace this is rather embarrassing its just that its well your name came up on the bench at our inn only last week i was lunching with mr justice prestcold that must have been a jolly occasion i told him like dinner with the macbeths i knew mr justice prestcold of old and he and i had never hit it off or seen eye to eye in fact you might say there was always a cold wind blowing in court between counsel and the bench whenever rumpole rose to his feet before prestcold j he could be guaranteed to ruin my crossexamination interrupt my speech fail to sum up the defence and send any rumpole client down for a hefty six if he could find the slightest excuse for it prestcold was an extraordinarily clean man his cuffs and bands were whiter than white he was forever polishing his rimless glasses on a succession of snowy handkerchiefs they say and god knows what truth there is in it that prestcold travels on circuit with a portable loo seat wrapped in plastic his clerk has the unenviable job of seeing that it is screwed in at the lodgings so his lordship may not sit where less fastidious judges have sat before he was asking who we had in chambers and i was able to tell him horace rumpole inter alia i cant imagine frank prestcold eating i suppose he might just be brought to sniff the bouquet of a grated carrot and he said you mean the fellow with the disgraceful hat mr justice prestcold was talking about my hat i couldnt believe my ears he seemed to think forgive me for raising this that your hat set the worst possible example to younger men at the bar with enormous selfcontrol i kept my temper well you can tell mr justice prestcold the next time youre sharing the benchers vegetarian platter that when i was last before him i took strong exception to his cufflinks they looked to me just as cheap and glassy as his eyes dont take offence horace its just not worth it you know taking offence at her majestys judges well look forward to the savoy best to your good lady i crammed on the hat gave him a farewell wave and left him i felt that evening that i was falling out of love with the law i really couldnt believe that mr justice prestcold had been discussing my hat i mean wasnt the crime rate rising wasnt the state encroaching on our liberties wasnt magna carta tottering whither habeus corpus what was to be done about the number of yearold girls who are making advances to old men in cinemas what i thought was hadnt judges of england got enough on their plates without worrying about my hat i gave the matter mature consideration on my way home on the inner circle and decided that they probably hadnt a few mornings later i picked up the collection of demands final demands and positively final demands which constitutes our post and among the hostile brown envelopes i found a gilded and embossed invitation card i took the whole lot into the kitchen to file away in the tidy bin when she who must be obeyed entered and caught me at it horace she said severely whatever are you doing with the post just throwing it away always throw bills away the first time they come in otherwise you only encourage them if you had a few decent cases rumpole if you werent always slumming round the magistrates courts you might not be throwing away bills all the time at which she pedalled open the tidy bin and spotted the fatal invitation whats that i think its the gas it was too late she had picked the card out from among the potato peelings i never saw a gas bill with a gold embossed crest before its an invitation to the savoy hotel she started to read the thing horace rumpole and lady you wouldnt enjoy it i hastened to assure her why wouldnt i enjoy it she wiped the odd fragment of potato off the card carried it into the livingroom in state and gave it pride of place on the mantelpiece i followed her protesting you know what it is boiled shirts prawn cocktail watching a lot of judges pushing their wives round the parquet to selections from oklahoma itll do you good rumpole thats the sort of place you ought to be seen in the scales of justice ball its quite impossible the situation was becoming desperate i dont see why i had an inspiration and assumed an expression of disgust were invited by marigold featherstone the wife of your head of chambers an old boot a domestic tyrant you know what the wretched guthrie caus her she who must be obeyed no the ball is out hilda you and marigold wouldnt hit it off at all well i thought she and sweet marigold would never meet so i was risking nothing i seized the hat and prepared to retreat got to leave you now murder calls why didnt you tell me we were back to murder this is good news hilda was remarkably cheerful that morning murder i told her is certainly better than dancing and i was gone about my business little did i know that the moment my back was turned hilda looked up the featherstones number in the telephone book you cant do it to peter i tell you you cant do it fight the case how can he fight the case leslie delgardo had quite lost the cool and knowing air of a successful east end businessman his face was flushed and he thumped his fist on my table jangling his identity bracelet and disturbing the notice of additional evidence i was reading that of bernard whelpton known as four eyes whelptons evidence doesnt help im sure youll agree mr rumpole nooks said gloomily you read that you read what four eyes has to say leslie collapsed breathless into my clients chair i read the document which ran roughly as follows tosher macbride used to take the mick out of peter on account he stammered and didnt have no girl friends one night i saw peter try to speak to a girl in the paradise rooms he was asking the girl to have a drink but his stutter was so terrible tosher said to her come on darling itll be breakfast time before the silly git finishes asking for a light ale after i heard peter delgardo say as hed get tosher he said hed like to cut him one night hes not a well boy leslie was wiping his forehead with a mauve silk handkerchief when i came out of the old justice pub that night i see tosher on the pavement and petey delgardo was kneeling beside him there was blood all over i looked up at nooks you know its odd no one actually saw the stabbing but petey was there wasnt he leslie was returning the handkerchief to his breast pocket and whats the answer about the knife in my humble opinion nooks opinions were often humble the knife in the car is completely damning oh completely i got up lit a small cigar and told leslie my own far from humble opinion you know id have had no doubts about this case if you hadnt just proved your brother innocent i did the big man in the chair looked at me in a wild surmise when you sent doctor lewis bleen the worldfamous trick cyclist the head shrinker extraordinaire down to see petey in brixton if youd done a stabbing and you were offered a nice quiet trip to hospital wouldnt you take it if the evidence was dead against you you mean peter turned it down leslie delgardo clearly couldnt believe his ears of course he did i told him cheerfully petey may not be all that bright poor old darling but he knows he didnt kill tosher macbride the committal was at stepney magistrates court and henry told me that there was a good deal of interest and that the vultures of the press might be there i thought i should warn you sir just in case you wanted to buy i know i know i interrupted him perhaps henry theres a certain amount of force in your argument vanity of vanities all is vanity said the preacher here was i a barrister of a certain standing doing a notable murder alone and without a leader the type of person whose picture might appear in the evening standard and i came to the reluctant conclusion that my present headgear was regrettably unphotogenic i took a taxi to st james street and invested in a bowler which clamped itself to the head like a vice but which caused henry when he saw it to give me a smile of genuine gratitude that evening i had forgotten the whole subject of hats and was concerned with a matter that interests me far more deeply blood i had soaked the rubber sponge that helps with the washing up and standing at the kitchen sink stabbed violently down into it with a table knife it produced as i had suspected a spray of water leaving small spots all over my shirt and waistcoat horace horace you look quite different hilda was looking at the evening paper in which there was a picture of pete delgardos heroic defender arriving at court i know what it is horace you went out and bought a new hat without me i stabbed again having resoaked the sponge a bowler daddy used to wear a bowler its an improvement hilda was positively purring at my dapper appearance in the paper little splashes all over the place i observed committing further mayhem on the sponge horace whatever are you doing to the washing up all over in little drops not one great stain little drops like a fine rain and plenty on the cuff your cuffs soaking oh why couldnt you roll up your sleeve i felt the crook of my arm and was delighted to discover that it was completely dry now i know why you didnt want to take me to the scales of justice annual ball hilda looked at the evening standard with less pleasure youre too grand now arent you rumpole new hat picture in the paper big case horace rumpole defender of the stepney road stabber big noise at the bar i suppose you didnt think id do you credit thats nonsense hilda i mopped up some of the mess round the sink and dried my hands then why i went and sat beside her and tried to comfort her with keats look were in the autumn of our years season of mists and mellow fruitfulness close bosomfriend of the maturing sun i really cant understand why i where are the songs of spring ay where are they think not on them thou hast thy music too but not jigging about like a couple of punk rockers at a dance i very much doubt if they have punk rockers at the savoy doesnt it occur to you rumpole we never go out im perfectly happy im not longing to go to the ball like bloody cinderella well lam i thought hilda was being most unreasonable and i decided to point out the fatal flaw in the entire scheme concerning the scales of justice ball hilda i cant dance you cant what dance i cant do it youre lying rumpole the accusation was so unexpected that i looked at her in a wild surmise and then she said would you mind casting your mind back to the ith of august what happened then you proposed to me rumpole as a matter of fact it was when you proposed i shouldnt expect you to remember of course the year i did the euston bank robbery led by your father led by daddy you were young rumpole comparatively young and where did you propose exactly cant you try and remember that as i have said i have no actual memory of proposing to hilda at all it seemed to me that i slid into the lifetime contract unconsciously as a weary man drifts off into sleep any words i felt sure were spoken by her i also had temporarily forgotten where the incident took place and hazarded a guess at a bus stop of course it wasnt at a bus stop its just that your father always seemed to be detaining me at bus stops i thought you might have been with him at the time you proposed to me in a tent hilda came to my aid at last there was a band and champagne and some sort of cold collation daddy had taken me to the inns of court ball to meet some of the bright young men in chambers he told me then youd been very helpful to him on blood groups it was the year before i did the penge bungalow murder i remembered vaguely hopeless on blood your father he could never bring himself to look at the photographs and we danced together we actually waltzed together thats simple thats just a matter of circling round and round none of your bloody jigging about concerned with it it was then that hilda stood up and took my breath away well we can waltz again rumpole youd better get into training for it i rang up marigold featherstone and i told her wed be delighted to accept the invitation she gave me a little smile of victory and i tell you what she didnt sound like an old boot at all i was speechless filled with mute resentment id been doublecrossed my toilette for the delgardo murder case went no further than the acquisition of a new hat as i sat in court listening to the evidence for the prosecution of bernard four eyes whelpton i was vaguely conscious of the collapsed state of the wig the traces of small cigar and breakfast egg on the waistcoat and the fact that the bands had lost their pristine crispness and were forever sagging to reveal the glitter of the brass collarstud i looked up and saw the judge staring at me with bleak disanoroval and felt desperately to ensure that the fly buttons were safely fastened fate span her bloody wheel and i had drawn mr justice prestcold frank prestcold who took such grave exception to my hat and who now looked without any apparent enthusiasm at the rest of my appearance well i couldnt help him i couldnt even hold up the bowler to prove id tried i did my best to ignore the judge and concentrate on the evidence mr hilary painswick qc the perfectly decent old darling who led for the prosecution was just concreting in four eyes story mr whelpton i take it you havent given this evidence in any spirit of enmity against the man in the dock the man in the dock looked as usual as if hed just been struck between the eyes with a heavy weight bernie whelpton smiled charmingly and said indiscreetly no im peteys friend we was at university together at which rumpole rose up like thunder and to prestcold js intense displeasure asked for the jury to be removed so that he could lodge an objection when the jury had gone out the judge forced himself to look at me what is the basis of your objection mr rumpole on the face of it the evidence that this gentleman was at university with your client seems fairly harmless this may come as a surprise to your lordship may it mr rumpole my client is not an old kings man he didnt meet mr four eyes whelpton at a may ball during eights week the university referred to is in fact parkhurst prison the judge applied his razorsharp mind and saw a way of overruling my objection mr rumpole i very much doubt whether the average juryman has your intimate knowledge of the argot of the underworld your lordship is too complimentary i gave him a bow and a brassy flash of the collarstud i think no harm has been done i appreciate your anxiety to keep your clients past record out of the case shall we have the jury back before the jury came back i got a note from leslie delgardo telline me as i knew verv well that wheloton had a conviction for perjury i ignored this information and did my best to make a friend of the little cockney who gazed at me through spectacles thick as ginger beer bottles mr whelpton when you saw my client peter delgardo kneeling beside tosher macbride did he have his arm round mr macbrides neck yes sir supporting his head from behind i suppose so rather in the attitude of a nurse or a doctor who was trying to bring help to the wounded man i didnt know your client had any medical qualifications mr justice prestcold was trying one of his glacial jokes i pretended i hadnt heard it and concentrated on bernie whelpton were you able to see peter delgardos hands when he was holding tosher yes anything in them was there not as i saw he wasnt holding this knife for instance i had the murder weapon on the desk in front of me and held it up for the jury to see i tell you i didnt see no knife i dont know whether my learned friend remembers hilary painswick uncoiled himself beside me the knife was found in the car exactly i smiled gratefully at painswick so my client stabbed tosher ran to his car dropped the murder weapon in by the drivers seat and then came back across the pavement to hold tosher in his arms and comfort his dying moments i turned back to the witness is that what youre saying he might have slipped the knife in his pocket mr rumpole prestcold j had something to communicate yes my lord this is not the time for arguing your case this is the time for asking questions if you think this point has any substance you will no doubt remind the jury of it when you come to make up your final address at some time in the no doubt distant future im grateful and no doubt your lordship will also remind the jury of it in your summing up should it slip my memory it really is such an unanswerable point for the defence i saw the prestcold mouth open for another piece of snappy repartee and forstalled him by rapidly restarting the crossexamination air whelpton you didnt see tosher stabbed i was in the old justice wasnt i you tell us and when you came out tosher might it not be more respectful to call that good man the deceased mr macbride the judge interrupted wearily if you like that good man mr macbride was bleeding in my clients arms that was the first i saw of him yes and when he saw you mr delgardo let go of tosher of that good man mr macbride ran to his car and got into it and then he drove away exactly you saw him get into his car how did he do it just turned the handle and pulled the door open so the car was unlocked i suppose it was i didnt really think you suppose the door was unlocked i looked at the judge who appeared to have gone into some sort of a trance dont go too fast mr whelpton my lord wants an opportunity to make a note at which the judge returned to earth and was forced to take up his pencil as he wrote leslie delgardo leaned forward from the seat behind me and said here mr rumpole what do you think youre doing having a bit of fun you dont grudge it to me do you the next item on the agenda was the officer in charge of the case a perfectly reasonable fellow with a grey suit who looked like the better type of bank manager detective inspector you photographed mr delgardos antique daimler when you got it back to the station yes the officer leafed through a bundle of photographs was it then exactly as you found it outside the old justice exactly unlocked with the drivers window open yes we found the car unlocked then it would have been easy for anyone to have thrown something in through the drivers window or even put something in through the door i dont follow you sir something i found my prop and held it up exhibit i a flick knife something like this knife could have been dropped into peter delgardos car in a matter of moments i saw the judge actually writing i suppose it could sir by the true murderer whoever it was when he was running away the usher was beside me handing me the fruit of mr justice prestcolds labours a note to counsel which read dear rumpole your bands are falling down and showing your collarstud no doubt you would wish to adjust accordingly what was this a murder trial or a bloody fashion parade i crumpled the note gave the bands a quick shove in a northerly direction and went back to work detective inspector weve heard tosher macbride described as a rent collector is there to be an attack on the dead mans character mr rumpole i dont know my lord i suppose there are charming rent collectors just as there are absolute darlings from the income tax laughter in court from which the judge remained aloof where did he collect rents business premises the officer was noncommittal what sort of business premises cafes my lord pubs minicab offices and if the rent wasnt paid do you know what remedies were taken i assume proceedings were taken in the county court the judge sounded totally bored by this line of crossexamination alas my lord some people have no legal training if the rents werent paid sometimes those minicab offices caught on fire didnt they detective inspector sometimes they did i told you he was a very fair officer to put it bluntly that good man tosher macbride was a collector for a protection racket well officer was he said prestcold more in sorrow than in anger yes my lord i think he was for the first time i felt i was forcing the judge to look in a different direction and see the case from a new angle i rubbed in the point and if hed been sticking to the money hed collected that might have provided a strong motive for murder by someone other than my client stronger than a few unkind words about an impediment in his speech mr rumpole isnt that a question for the jury i looked at the jury then they were all alive and even listening and i congratulated the old darling on the bench youre right it is my lord and far no one else in this court i thought it was effective perhaps too effective for leslie delgardo who stood up and left court with a clatter the swing doors banged to after him by precipitously leaving court leslie delgardo had missed the best turn on the bill my double act with mr entwhistle the forensic expert an old friend and a foeman worthy of my steel mr entwhistle as a scientific officer i think youve lived with bloodstains as long as i have almost the jury smiled they were warming to rumpole and you have all the clothes my client was wearing that night have you examined the pockets i have my lord entwhistle bowed to the judge over a heap of peteys clothing and there are no bloodstains in any of the pockets there are none so there can be no question of a bloodstained knife having been hidden in a pocket whilst my client cradled the deceased in his arms of course not entwhistle smiled discreetly you find that a funny suggestion yes i do the ideas ridiculous you may be interested to know that its on that ridiculous idea the prosecution are basing their case painswick was on his feet with a welljustified moan my lord yes that was a quite improper observation mr rumpole then i pass from it rapidly my lord no point in wasting time with him my business was with entwhistle had mr delgardo stabbed the deceased you would expect a spray of blood over a wide area of clothing you might have found that with small drops spattered from a forceful blow i should have expected so but you found nothing like it no and you might have expected blood near the area of the cuff of the coat or the shirt most probably in fact all we have is a smear or soaked patch in the crook of the arm mr entwhistle picked up the overcoat looked and of course admitted it yes totally consistent with my client having merely put an arm round the deceased when he lay bleeding on the pavement not inconsistent a double negative the last refuge of an expert witness who doesnt want to commit himself does not inconsistent translated into plain english mean consistent mr entwhistle i could have kissed old entwhistle on the rimless specs when he turned to the jury and said yes it does so when i got outside and saw leslie delgardo sitting on a bench chewing the end of a cigar i thought he would wish to congratulate me i didnt think of a gold watch or a crinkly fiver but at least a few warm words of encouragement so i was surprised when he said in a tone of deep hostility whatre you playing at air rumpole why didnt you use bernies conviction you really want to know other members of the family were thronging about us basil and a matronly person in a mink coat dabbing her eye makeup with a minute lace hanky we all want to know said basil all the family i know im only the boys mother sobbed the lady in mink dont underestimate yourself madam i reassured her youve bred three sons who have given employment to the legal profession then i started to explain point one i spent all this trial trying to keep your brothers record out if i put in the convictions of a prosecution witness the juryll get to know about peters stretch for unlawful wounding back in you want that we thought it was helpful basil grumbled did you i looked at him im sure you did well point two the perjury was forging a passport application ive already checked it and point three point three mr rumpole youre sacked leslies voice was high with anger i felt grateful we werent in a turning off stepney high street on a dark night may i ask why you got that judges back up proper hell do for petey good afternoon mr rumpole im taking you off the case i dont think you can do that hed started to walk away but now turned back with a look of extreme hostility oh dont you the only person who can take me off this case is my client mr peter delgardo come along nooks wed better go down to the cells your brother wants to sack me petey looked at me with his usual lack of understanding nooks acted as a smooth interpreter the position is mr leslie delgardo is a little perturbed at the course this case is taking mr leslie delgardo isnt my client i reminded peter he thinks weve got on the wrong side of the judge i was growing impatient would he like to point out to me strictly for my information the right side of mr justice prestcold what does that judge imagine he is court correspondent for the tailor and cutter i stamped out my small cigar look peter dear old sweetheart ive abandoned the judge hell sum up dead against you thats obvious so let the jury think hes nothing but a personal antipollution programme who shoves airwick up his nostrils every time he so much as smells a human being and we might have got somewhere mr leslie delgardo is definitely dissatisfied this puts me in a very embarrassing position nooks looked suitably embarrassed cheer up nooks i smiled at him your positions nothing like so embarrassing as peters then i concentrated on my client well whats it going to be do i go or stay peter began to stammer an answer it took a long time to come but when it did it meant that just one week later on the day of the scales of justice ball i was making a final speech to the jury in the case of the queen against delgardo i may say that i never saw leslie or basil or their dear old mum again members of the jury may i call your attention to a man we havent seen he isnt in the dock he has never gone into that witness box i dont know where he is now perhaps hes tasting the delights of the costa brava perhaps hes very near this court waiting for news ill call him mi x did mr x employ that good man tosher macbride to collect money in one of his protection rackets had tosher macbride betrayed his trust and was he to die for it so that rainy night outside the old justice pub in stepney mr x waited for tosher waited with this knife and when he saw his unfaithful servant come out of the shadows he stabbed not once not twice but you have heard the evidence three times in the neck the jury was listening enrapt to my final speech i was stabbing violently downwards with my prop whenprestcold cleared his throat and pointed to his own collar meaningfully no doubt my stud was winking at him malevolently so he said hm mr rumpole i ignored this no judge alive was going to spoil the climax of my speech and i could tell that the jury were flattered not to say delighted to hear me tell them of course you are the only judges of fact in this case but if you find peter delgardo guilty then mr x will smile and order up champagne because wherever he is he will know hes safe at last frank prestcold summed up as i knew he would dead against petey he called the prosecution evidence overwhelming and the jury listened politely they went out just after lunch and were still out at when i telephoned hilda and told her that id change in chambers and meet her at the savoy and i wanted it clearly understood that i wasnt dancing i was just saying this when the usher came out and told me that the jury were back with a verdict after it was all over i looked round in vain for nooks he had apparently gone to join the rest of the delgardos in the great unknown so i went down to say goodbye to peter in the cells he was sitting inert and staring into the middle distance cheer up peter i sat down beside him dont look so bloody miserable my god i dont know how youd take it if youd lost peter shook his head and then said something i didnt wholly understand i was meant to lose who meant you to the prosecution of course air justice prestcold undoubtedly fate destiny the spirit of the universe not as it turned out it was written in the stars not guilty of murder and is that the verdict of you all thats why they ch chose you i was meant to lose what the man said puzzled me i admit it i found enigmatic i saidi dont follow bloke in the cell while i was w w waiting used to be a mate of bernie foureyes he told me why me brothers chose you to defend me well i thought i knew why i had been chosen for this important case i stood up and paced the room no doubt i have a certain reputation around the temple although my crown may be a little tarnished done rather too much indecent assault lately he heard them round thep p paradise rooms talking about this old feller rumpole peter seemed to be pursuing another line of thought the penge bungalow murder is in notable british trials i may have become a bit of a household name at least in criminal circles they was looking for a barrister whod be sure to lose after this i suppose i may get back to better quality crime the full force of what peter had said struck me i looked at him and checked carefully what did you say they wanted me defended by someone they could c count on for a guilty verdict thats why they p p picked you for it it was appallingly what i thought hed said they wanted to fit me up with doing tosher peter delgardo went on remorsetessly let me get this clear your brothers selected me to nobble your defence thats it you w was to be the jockey eke that pulled me back how did they light on me exactly me rumpole of the bailey my entire life sherlock holmes stories law degree knockabout apprenticeship at bow street and hackney days of triumph in murder and forgery down to that days swayed jury and notable victory seemed to be blown away like autumn leaves by what he said then the words came quickly now tumbling out of him they heard of an old bloke got p past it down to little bits of cases round the m m magistrates courts bit of a muddler they heard with a funny old biokendown hat on him the hat again at least i had bought a bowler so they r reckoned you was just the bloke to lose this murder like and dear old nooks shady nooks did he help them to choose me i suspected it id dont know im n n not saying he didnt so thats my reputation i tried to take stock of the situation and failed abysmally i shouldntve told you he sounded genuinely apologetic get rumpole for the defence and be sure of a conviction perhaps its all lies was he trying to cheer me up he went on you hear lots of s s stories in the cells under the bailey and in the bar mess too they rubbish your reputation small cigar i found a packet and offered him one all right we lit up after all one had to think of the future so where does this leave you peter i asked him id say mr rumpole none too s safe what about you i blew out smoke wondering exactly what i had left perhaps not all that safe either i had brought my old dinner jacket up to chambers and i changed into it there i had a bottle of rum in the cupboard and i gave myself a strong drink out of a dusty glass as i shut the cupboard door i noticed my old hat it was on a shelf gathering dust and seemed to have about it a look of mild reproach i put it on and noticed how comfortably it fitted i dropped the new hard bowler into the wastepaper basket and went on to the savoy you look charming my dear hilda resplendent in a long dress her shoulders dusted with powder smiled delightedly at mrs marigold featherstone who was nibbling delicately at an afterdinner mint really rumpole hilda looked at me gently rebuking she she marigold was mystified but anxious to join in any joke that might be going oh she i said casually a woman of fabulous beauty written up by h rider haggard a waiter passed and i created a diversion by calling his attention to the fact that the tide had gone out in my glass around us prominent members of the legal profession pushed their bulky wives about the parquet like a number of freshfaced gardeners executing elaborate manoeuvres with wheelbarrows there were some young persons among them and i noticed erskinebrown jigging about in solitary rapture somewhere in the vicinity of miss phyllida trant she saw me and gave a quick smile and then she was off circling erskinebrown like an obedient planet which i didnt consider a fitting occupation for any girl of miss trants undoubted abilities your husbands had a good win guthrie featherstone was charting to hilda he hasnt had a good win guthrie she put the man right hes had a triumph entirely thanks to my old hat i raised my glass heres to it what little of what rumpole said made much sense to marigold my triumph indeed my great opportunity is to be attributed solely to my hat i explained to her but she couldnt agree nonsense what youre talking nonsense she explained to our hosts he does you know from time to time rumpole won because he knows so much about blood really featherstone looked at the dancers no doubt wondering how soon he could steer his beautiful wife off into the throng but hilda fixed him with her glittering eye and went on much like the ancient mariner you remember daddy of course he used to be your head of chambers daddy told me rumpole daddy told me in fact he told me that on the occasion of the inns of court summer ball which is practically the last dance we went to hilda i tried unsuccessfully to stem the flow no im going to say this horace dont interrupt horace rumpole daddy told me knows more about bloodstains than anyone weve got in chambers i noticed that marigold had gone a little pale do stop it hilda youre putting marigold off dont you find it marigold turned to me well sordid sometimes what crime dont you find it terribly sordid there was a silence the music had stopped and the legal fraternity on the floor clapped sporadically i saw erskinebrown take miss trams hand oh do be careful marigold i said dont knock it i think it must be sordid marigold patted her lips with her table napkin removing the last possible trace of afterdinner mint abolish crime i warned her and you abolish the very basis of our existence oh come now horace featherstone was smiling at me tolerantly hes right hilda told him rumpole knows about bloodstains abolish crime and we should all vanish i felt a rush of words to the head all the barristers and solicitors and dock officers and the dear old matron down the old bailey who gives aspirins away with sentences of life imprisonment thered be no judges no lord chancellor the commissioner of the metropolitan police would have to go out selling encyclopaedias i leant back grabbed the wine from the bucket and started to refill all our glasses why are we here whyve we got prawn cocktail and duck iorange and selections from dear old oklahoma all because a few villains down the east end are kind enough to keep us in a regular supply of crime a slightly hurt waiter took the bottle from me and continued my work dont you help them marigold looked at me doubtfully dont i what help them doing all these crimes after all you get them off today i said not without a certain pride today let me tell you marigold i was no help to them at all i showed themno gratitude you got him off what you got peter delgardo off just for one reason what was that he happened to be innocent come on horace how can you be sure of that featherstone was smiling tolerantly but i leant forward and gave him the truth of the matter you know its a terrifying thing my learned friend we go through all that mumbo jumbo we put on our wigs and gowns and mutter the ritual prayers my lord i humbly submit ladies and gentlemen of the jury you have listened with admirable patience abracadabra fee fo fi bloody fum and just when everyone thinks youre going to produce the most ludicrously faked bit of cheesecloth ectoplasm or a phoney rap on the table it comes clear as a bell quite unexpected the voice of truth i was vaguely aware of a worried figure in a dinner jacket coming towards us across the floor have you ever found that featherstone bloody scaring sometimes all the trouble we take to cloud the issues and divert the attention suddenly weve done it there it is naked and embarrassing the truth i looked up as the figure joined us it was my late instructing solicitor nooks shady nooks i greeted him but he seemed in no mood to notice me he pulled up a chair and sat down beside featherstone apparently it was on the nine oclock news theyve just arrested leslie delgardo charged him with the murder of tosher macbride ill want a con with you in the morning i was left out of this conversation but i didnt mind music started again playing a tune which i found vaguely familiar nooks was muttering on it seemed that the police now knew tosher worked for leslie and that some member of the rival watson family may have spotted him at the scene of the crime an extraordinary sensation overcame me something i hadnt felt for a long time which could only be described as happiness i dont know whether youll want to brief me for leslie nooks i raised a glass to old shady or would that be rather overegging the pudding and then an even more extraordinary sensation a totally irrational impulse for which i can find no logical explanation overcame me i put out a hand and touched she who must be obeyed on the powdered shoulder hilda oh yes rumpole it seemed i was interrupting some confidential chat with marigold what do you want now i honestly think i could find no coherent explanation i think i want to dance with you i suppose it was a waltz as i steered hilda out onto the great open spaces it seemed quite easy to go round and round vaguely in time to the music i heard a strange sound as if from a long way off ill have the last waltz with you two sleepy people together or words to that effect i was in fact singing singing and dancing to celebrate a great victory in a case i was never meant to win the end
