 pure entertainment espionage at its best the times its been two years since quiller was in bangkok now hes back at the request of loman a top control in the bureau quiller loathes the man but has to listen to what he says in three weeks time a representative of the queen is to visit bangkok on a goodwill tour since he is neither a statesman nor a diplomat there will be no political functions there will be a days yachting a polo match visits to hospitals and welfare organisations one might say he will be our representative of the humanities loman pauses and then during the visit we want you to arrange for his assassination nobody writes better espionage than adam hall new york times adam hall quiller the th directive the bloodstone the place was halfway along soi suek and i walked there from the main road where the trishaw had dropped me it was a narrow street of shophouses roofed at this moment by the twilight there was no one in the gem shop except the small old thai at the workbench behind the counter he did not hear me come in because of the noise of the gem tumbler that churned at the back of the shop there was no air conditioner and the heat was as bad as in the street from a room above came the weird notes of a pinai i stood watching the old man he was making a ring setting an opal in gold it was a cabochon stone and the blade of his burnisher closed the bezel deftly the light of the hooded lamp reflected the gold and struck fire in the gem when the bezel was pressed home he turned to look at his work under the lamp and saw me i said at once mr varaphan he put the ring down onto the black cloth and made me the wai greeting with his hands gently as a priest i asked is the bloodstone ready it has been lost he said but it was worth more than a million pounds much more yes then you must pay me i am a poor man he said you cannot get blood out of a stone even a bloodstone then give me my pound of flesh he bowed slightly in passing me and went to the open doorway watching the street his head turning from left to right i waited listening to one stone heavier than the others falling against the side of the tumbler as it went on turning slowly like a miniature concrete mixer mr varaphan came away from the doorway if you will be so kind i followed him through the back of the shop passing some steps in the center of the house the piping of the pinai became louder from above then faded as we came to the other room much of it was taken up with cabinets and safes but there were some rattan chairs and a table the walls were timbered and there was the smell of sandalwood the bleakness of the fluorescent tubes took half the value from a rosewood buddha in the corner but at least you could see where you were in strange places i hate not being able to see things your presence in my house does me great honor said mr varaphan you are most hospitable the westerner suspects the extravagant courtesies of the east and i am always constrained i added a bit in his own language to please him when he left me i noticed three things a telephone was in this room you could make an exit through a second door near the rosewood buddha and you could still hear quite distinctly the pebbly sound of the gem tumbler in the shop it had been a long trip and i hadnt liked being shot out here without any notice so i tried to relax by looking at the display case on top of one of the safes it was decentenough stuff lapis lazuli obsidian rase quartz a few gemquality microlines and a very hypnotic moonstone this place was obviously a lapidary not just a front loman arrived in ten minutes punctually he came in by the second door near the buddha and asked at once when did you get here a few minutes ago we shook hands as perfunctorily as boxers i mean when did you get into bangkok this evening at air france paristokyo but what were you doing in paris oh my god is it important i thought you were still in london when we put out the call for you he turned away and turned back his small feet nervous everything is important very i hope that includes the fact that im here at rendezvous dead on time as per signal because im fed up with bloody airplanes of course of course he managed to stand still there were beads of sweat on his face there was one thing they didnt tell me about this place theres no air conditioning he was wearing gray alpaca and a spotted bow tie i have a dislike for men with small feet and bow ties and a dislike anyway for loman it has been mutual for years but has never affected our work so that neither considers it important except when we find ourselves shut up together in the confines of a nonairconditioned lapidarists back room in bangkok and similar places where it is barely possible to breathe loman is like that room in london with the lowry on the wall he smells of polish his shoes and nails and nose shine brightly and even his manners take on a spurious polish when he has time to rub them up just now he was too busy with his nerves i was beginning to feel better seeing him so worried was doing me good i said why couldnt they have told me where this door was instead of sending me through the shop you had to introduce yourself to varaphan of course with that rigmarole he isnt a contact we couldnt use established technique he was looking around the room his bright eyes ferreting out the details this is our safehouse for the present sometimes we shall meet at the british embassy but the most important business will take place here let us sit down we will ask for something to be sent in there is no need for any rush none at all the rattan creaked under his slight weight and now he was completely relaxed and looking up at me as if it were i whose nerves had been showing just tell me one thing i said is this a mission or has something come unstuck he tapped the little brass bell on the table its a mission and nothing must come unstuck i didnt sit down yet because i was too uneasy with the whole thing loman was very high up in the bureau echelon and he rarely left london to direct an operator in the field he had never personally directed me before and it wasnt going to be any picnic i said uncivilly ive just flown seven thousand miles at the drop of a hat and you say theres no rush not now that youre here it might have been varaphans daughter who came in to answer the bell a willowy child with a mane of black hair loman said to me i havent very much grasp i told her in english wed like something to drink is that possible scotch soda lime juice and ice i will bring yes you play the pinai beautifully she denied it in delight and left us its the lingua franca i told loman well youd better give yourself a crash refresher course in thai youll be meeting people who dont speak anything else also you will want to be able to hear things how proficient are you im all right outside esoteric terms he got up feeling restless again what i meant when i said that there was no rush now that youre here is that if youd been too long delayed we should have had to pull styles out of java and hes very busy there you know bangkok as well as he does and youre between missions or i was thats right its nearly two years since i was here there is a simple tradition in the bureau that protects any given operation from failure we can refuse a mission there has to be a reason and we have to give it and it has to be a good one but in the final analysis we have a getout if we want it this is intelligent because it means that nobody is ever sent into the field with misgivings any operator taking up a mission has therefore a positive approach and is selforientated toward success there is only one thing london control can do when a man wants to opt out they have to give him an incentive that will make him opt in again they tried this on me once in berlin and it worked they gave me a man to go after a man i could hate talking now to loman i was already putting up the odd objection rationalizing the situation to cover the one main misgiving which was simply that we didnt like each other the work we had done together in the past was bureau stuff intelligence breakdown communications liaison so forth but now he was going to be my director in the field and that was different because the success of a mission and even your life could sometimes depend on whether you got on well with your director you had to like him trust him respect him and live with him my opinion of loman despite his brilliance and his record was that he was a wellpolished little pimp it didnt help that he looked on me as a roughhaired sheepdog with more guts than gumption and a chip on each shoulder and one on the wick after two years i told him i dont remember much about this place you will now that youre back his point the memory relies strongly on environment recollective recall if examinations were taken in the familiar surroundings of the lecture rooms where the stuff was learned there would be fewer failures i dont know this place for a start whos varaphan the embassy gave us his name dont tell me you trust the embassy weve checked on him of course he was educated on the burma road liaising with our escape parties since then hes been useful very useful to several of our operations he travels a lot with gems that takes him to london a great deal hes not an agent not strictly he took a good look at the street to see if id been followed before bringing me in here hes not a fool we had to stop talking because the girl was coming in with drinks as soon as she had gone we set on the lime juice at least he could rig up a fan in here i said we will see what can be done some of the mutual antagonism went out of us now that the thirst was slaked is this local control bangkok he considered we dont quite know where control is yet its officially at the embassy though of course they dont know that they think were security this is our safehouse for the moment but if things get too hot we shall have to move on my ears were still buzzing a bit from the altitude and i had come straight here from don muang airport with no time to get into fresh things so i said lets put it on the line shall we he was nervous again at once and i knew hed been holding me off because he sensed i would try to refuse the mission and that would mean pulling styles out of java he poured some more lime juice to give himself a last chance of planning his run in this is a special job he began very i fingered a chunk of ice out of my glass and sucked it while he turned away and looked at the rosewood buddha then he turned back and at last managed to stand still plumb in front of me you may know there is an official visit planned for the end of this month three days in bangkok as part of a larger southeast asian itinerary no i said you dont read the newspapers not often then let me put you in the picture politically one can even say militarily in view of local wars thailand is becoming drawn into the vortex of affairs involving china india malaysia and of course also laos and cambodia global interest is now centered on this capital which has been a focal point in southeast asia for half a century in any case thailand is a stable kingdom with close ties with the us and to a lesser extent with britain we have nato here in this city and we have the seato headquarters here as well bangkok is a key city in the southeast asian complex and geographically it finds itself in the middle of the chinaindia situation loman is one of those people who make whatever they are saying sound dull perhaps i was showing boredom he began talking faster so that he could reach the point relations between britain and thailand have always been good partly because each is a democratic monarchy and partly because many people close to the thai throne princes ministers financiers and men of affairs spent much of their youth in english public schools and universities at this time when the whole of the southeast asian picture is confused and threatening her majestys government considers it highly desirable that a goodwill mission be undertaken by someone who is neither a statesman nor a diplomat but who commands international respect and admiration particularly in thailand he waited for me to digest this some of his nervousness had gone it had been soothed away by the reassuring sound of his own voice thus in three weeks time a representative of the queen is to visit bangkok on a goodwill tour most of the ice in the bowl had melted but i found a bit and slaked my thirst with it since the person by the way that is how we already refer to him for security reasons so please adopt the habit since the person is neither a statesman nor a diplomat a tour of this kind entails no political functions there will be instead a days yachting in the gulf a polo match on the lumpini grounds i am told that prince udom is to play and a drive through the city in an open car the person will also visit those centers of traditional interest to him youth clubs welfare organizations hospitals and of course sports grounds he will be one might say our representative of the humanities with careful precision he said during the visit we want you to arrange for his assassination pangsapa the two fish circled their heads turned towards the center to watch each other the smaller was the more beautiful its colors less diffuse but both were caparisoned in the flowing splendor of their fins they moved like rainbows through the pearly water faintly reflected in the glass was the face of pangsapa an enormous moon the strange sweet smell of opium was in the air the fish sped suddenly together dartquick and murderous with the fins drawn close to the body as they met a torn fin could unbalance them and bring almost immediate death the eyes of pangsapa were unblinking in the great moon on the glass the fish circled near the sides of the tank with their colored raiment flowing reminding of medieval warhorses on the battle field the next charge was mutual and explosive they closed met held and span in a whirlpool with their razorteeth working for a kill three times they attacked and withdrew and now the water was tinged with carmine and from the spine of the decent price on them so far nobodys found out what he will not do for money we had talked for another hour at the safehouse in soi suek loman and i his bit about my making arrangements for the assassination had caught my interest at last but i didnt say anything im sure you get the point loman said im to make the arrangements and then give you the setup so that you can take countermeasures against any similar plan thats right its bloody silly you can plan it a dozen ways we think your way would be the most efficient we think we are up against somebody very clever dont misunderstand me i am not buttering you up so that youll cooperate his smile was smooth you dont want this mission or any mission with me as your intelligence director in the field we dont like each other do we but i was asked in london to choose a man who could plan this kind of job an assassination so efficiently that it couldnt fail i think youll agree that theres more at risk than a few hard words between us if we do this job together so i chose you i said youll just have to go on talking get me out of the dark i suppose theres been a threat has there of course then why dont they just call it off the visit for the same reason that they didnt call off the queens visit to canada your anglosaxon doesnt panic easily also this visit is part as i told you of a larger itinerary in southeast asia they cant leave out bangkok because its the most important stop and they cant cancel the whole thing because of one threat in one place even if the government decided to back out i doubt if the person would let them hes not quite the type so were all in it he drank off the rest of the lime in his glass and looked at me again and asked sulkily or arent you included oh for gods sake stop mucking about and give me the guts of the thing so i can make up my mind i dont know a bloody tenth of whats going on do i but i knew more now than hed told me i knew why hed arrived with his nerves in the upper register this kind of mission wasnt in his line he is a specialist in shortrange penetration operations with a disciplined cell and planned access and good communications not such a pushover as it sounds if the opposition is the best he is brilliant at it five adverse agents neutralized in the european area and two on home ground sent down for a fourteenyear stretch all in the past eighteen months why had control sent him out here on a lark like this he was still smiling gently he knew i was angry because i was interested and therefore afraid of being coerced into this mission someone had said in that room with the lowry he wont fall easily for this one unless we can sting him up send someone out there he doesnt like someone wholl get his goat loman was perfect casting let me give you the other ninetenths he said equably this is of course a job for security and a few people have been flown out here quietly to help take care of the threat and its implications the thai home office is being very cooperative and wait a minute what sort of threat was it it was sent by ordinary letter to london written in english it said simply that if the person came to this city he wouldnt leave it alive of course the yard has taken the letter apart in forensic and sent a couple of people out here to confer with the thai cid they are working on it now all right as i say the home office is being very helpful and all the routine inquiries and searches are under way the uk is well represented unofficially who roped in the bureau then the bureau was not roped in he said stuffily certain information came in and it was decided that action was indicated no fewer than eight directives were planned and examined before the decision was formalized this is the ninth and it has now become a definite mission because the bureau thinks do hope you feel they are right that we should do something to ensure that nothing happens on the day they consider the person to be how shall i say rather valuable i mentally blasted him and his ninth directive to hell and got a clean glass and began on the whisky this approach of lomans was deliberate i was meant to feel frightfully unbritish if i didnt immediately choke with rage at the thought of anything happening to our valuable person the bureau could have spared a minute in sober thought i always like a clear field to work in and i work best alone and if they were sending me into a mission where the uk was already well represented i could risk fouling up the whole operation by getting in the way the only thing to do was to let him go on giving it to me until i had the complete picture and then say yes or no of course he said smoothly you will be working alone quite alone theyd sent the right man give them that he knew me to the bone this isnt a joint operation you see how could it be the bureau doesnt exist it never has no the idea is very simple unless theyre unlucky the security branches will make quite certain that nothing happens on the visit they are planning every conceivable precaution but there may be a thousandtoone chance that the adverse party will organize a plan that will come off a plan so efficient that there is no countermeasure possible a plan as i suggested to control that only you could devise he began walking about talking as if there would be no interruption perhaps he was trying to convince himself of the mechanics of this thing before he could successfully sell it to me this isnt blandishment you see your work in egypt cuba and berlin has proved that if youre left on your own when things are sufficiently hot you are capable of pulling off a certain kind of operation at which a dozen better men or a hundred better men would fail simply because its an operation requiring one man working alone and requiring the kind of man who works best alone that is why you were chosen he stopped in front of the display case and stared at the moonstone until his feet couldnt keep still any more he came back to stand in front of me there is nothing else i can tell you until the information starts coming in from the foreign office youll be in on every conference at the embassy here and we shall this isnt in your field loman i was suddenly fed up with him and its not in mine its no go you need time to think ive thought this is a police job im a penetration agent if you want to play with terms its no go tell them theyve made a mistake i dont think they have i chose you myself then its your own mistake i dont think it is tell them to pull styles out of java no its you i want for this one quiller you he wasnt smiling any more and all the polish had gone to his eyes they were very bright lets get it over with he said it would take too long for you to tell me what you think of me and it wouldnt affect the issue because im mudproof in my unfortunate experience youve proved yourself an agent who is obstinate undisciplined illogical and dangerously prone to obsessive vanities and wildcat tactics very difficult to handle in the field and an embarrassment in london whenever you choose to report there in person if you accept this mission and you will accept it i shall be your director and will be responsible for everything you do so theres nothing in this for me but a filthy time of it the whole way through and i settle for that here and now that is my position this is yours you now have information that a man revered in his own country and respected abroad is going to have the guts to expose himself to a threat of death because he wont refuse his duty you also know that if the very elaborate machinery for his protection breaks down and if this valuable life is lost because of your own petty feelings against me as your director in the field its going to be your fault your fault alone and you wont be able to live with it he gazed at me with his eyes shining and i knew i had never hated him more than i did then in a minute he half turned fiddling about on the table saying i see youve hogged the last of the ice thats typical he banged the bell so you cant refuse this mission i knew that when i left london you cant refuse when that man arrives in bangkok youll be here with him right in the thick of it so youd better lay into me and then well have another drink and then ill brief you we havent long kuo the english word assassin is borrowed from the french but stems originally from the arabic hashshashin meaning hashisheaters there were two good reasons why loman had given me pangsapa as a possible informant modern man will take great risks for money and greater risks for sex but when he has need of drugs he will hazard himself the most fearfully driven beyond all caution he will expose sell and surrender himself to the despotic sovereignty of men like pangsapa pangsapa was a narcotics contrabandist and would therefore know people who were prepared to kill for a fix of snow or who were prepared to expose the most sacrosanct confidences of friends and inform on them we wanted information and we wanted information about assassins so loman had sent me here he knew in addition that the only good contact i had ever had in this city was dead because that evening on rama iv road in the poor light they had mistaken him for me pangsapa wanted to talk and i let him i remember when your princess alexandra made a visit here a few years ago it went off marvelously everyone loved her on sight and we coined a new title for her the gentle ambassadress shes having the same success with her current excursions and last year she went over wonderfully in tokyo its so intelligent for the british to send interesting people abroad as a change from those dreary diplomats with rumpled waistcoats and derby winners teeth i hadnt told him why i had come loman must have given him a hint i had only one question for him where were the professionals but he wanted to go on talking you may think it odd that i hold such an affection for members of the british royalty after all i was born in poverty i remember very clearly the time when i was beaten by a merchant for thieving my choice was to steal or starve in those days it happened when i was ostensibly watching a state procession on the river with the royal barge and all the trimmings have you ever seen that barge the sri supanahongs its quite enormous and covered entirely with pure gold leaf the bag of rice i was filching at the time from one of the market canals was half soaked in filthy water but it kept me alive for six days he smiled wistfully it wasnt likely to endear me to the monarchy my own or any other but events happen so quickly my father or the man i believe to be my father was toying with a certain hazardous operation in cahoots with a ships captain not long afterwards and the wind was fair five years later i was at oxford of all places he sat with remarkable stillness and his smile was seraphic my degree is in economics but i cherish far more the spiritual experience the life of your country vouchsafed me it was in those years that i learned to bear a certain love for complete strangers im talking again of the monarchy he leaned toward me an inch and his lisp became more pronounced i would be sorry if anything happened in a few weeks time on the th you might be able to prevent it i would welcome the chance all i want to know is where the professionals are if any of them are here in bangkok the professionals i got up from the cushions to walk about maybe he hadnt been briefed fully enough did loman come to see you i dont know that name who told you i was coming no one i stopped and stood looking down at him you didnt expect me not before you telephoned he sat like a small dark effigy only the light in his yellow eyes showing that he was alive i said all right pangsapa what was all that about your undying love for the monarchy patiently he said you forget that the whole city is preparing for this important visit on the th the police and security branches are very active and it is obvious that trouble is expected specific trouble what else could you have come about you seek information i said youve never seen me before you have been in bangkok before i accepted that hed been given to me as a source of information and no source of information was much good if it had never heard about my job here two years ago i pressed him though have you ever been in contact with us before i know a man called parkis all right parkis was in london control lets talk about the professionals i want to know their travel patterns he looked perplexed im not quite sure what you mean by the professionals i mean vincent sorbi kuo ah yes quicky the greek hideo the mafia boy whats his name zotta thats it zotta i relaxed again he hadnt denied knowing zotta the mafia channelled most of their stuff from bangkok through naples to recife now that the buenos aires route was blocked following the death of primero and it was zotta who did the bump pangsapa would know about that it was his business zotta is in recife he said you can forget him he stood up suddenly and without effort without even taking his hands from the folds of his robe vincent hes in prison in athens theyre getting him out of course but that will take longer than three weeks because his people are disorganized sorbi his hands appeared pale against the black robe who ever knows where sorbi is kuo hideo the greek when i have had a little time he said i will get in touch with you i know that the information would be valuable to you it depends london is precise on this when you go shopping you have to do a bargain when you can we can arrange it later he shrugged where can i find you takchong hotel as we went toward the door i noticed the water in the tank was clear again changed by the filterflow system the fish swam alone a sixinch compact rainbowcolored killer a professional in two days i was ready to tell loman the mission was refused it was a security job and that wasnt in my field the place was slopping over with security people anyway and any one of them could handle this thing better than i could they knew the formula and they were trained to work with it i had gone to see pangsapa because i might need him one day if a real mission ever brought me back to bangkok thered been no point in not sounding him on the travel patterns of the professionals i always like to know where people are but if his sources were as good as loman believed he would have contacted me by now even if only to report on their whereabouts he would know that london would cough up a little even for negative information but he obviously couldnt get any it was no go the thing had no shape i was drifting about the city without even a decent cover or a cover story and every time i checked for tags there werent any because no one wanted to know where i went or what i was doing i knew why loman had called me in it was typical of him he hadnt given any real answer when id asked him who roped the bureau in hed done it himself sold this abortive scheme to parkis and the others and chosen me for the field he must have talked well his whole project was based on the spurious premise of a threat anyone planning an assassination would never put out a threat before the attempt all it would do would be to alert the security forces and that was precisely what it had done security was geared to combat any action by a psychopath reasonably enough there were always psychopaths in the crowd whenever a vip did the rounds the popes visit to new york in put eighteen thousand city police on special duty with bomb squads combing the route and riflemen manning the rooftops simply because of a few letters from anonymous religious eccentrics this was routine work the bureau never took that kind of thing on it was set up to promote specific operations why the hell had they listened to loman i tried contacting him through soi suek but he hadnt shown up since the day i flew in so i went to the embassy and asked for room he had said it was all right for me to do that the young man looked nervous room yes that will be miss maine wont it will it if youll just take a seat i watched him making tentative hops toward the next office he hadnt even asked for my name if loman was in room i would tell him i knew why hed roped in the bureau and why hed roped me in then watch his face the harrow type came back and took me along the passage into another room the door said cultural attache i was alone five minutes and a girl came in a woman i never know their ages can i help you do you know where i find room she looked at me a long time i didnt mind the staffs of embassies always need a few days to put one thought after another its almost relaxing theres nobody there at the moment perhaps i can help you are you the cultural attache his secretary well that schoolboy hasnt got his sums right i want room if that doesnt mean anything i want to see a man named loman mr loman isnt here oh for the lords sake well if you ever see him just tell him ive tried contacting him all the afternoon and now im taking the night plane on the london run undisciplined behavior tell it to the lowry just a moment please she walked well and had a calm clear voice i found it mollifying maybe thats what she was here for to stop people blowing up about the malorganization a man came in next and she wasnt with him he shut the door and offered his hand have a chair all right i said theyre all yours i dropped my papers onto the desk with the flap on about the th they were probably securitychecking the ambassador himself every time he came back from the lavatory now i knew why no one had asked for my name names dont mean a thing he gave the papers a quick runthrough youre based in where exactly he peered at page as if he couldnt read the writing i said whitehall liaison group lovett sees to me ah yes lovett how is he these days he pushed a cigarette box across like to smoke hes very well to save time i went through the lot he was in rome last week on the carosio thing and bill spencer took over in london your boys were simms and westlake they thats all right yes but i thought you were there too it says paris on my passport doesnt it he pulled back the cigarette box took out a cigarette and lit it are you going to be in bangkok long no no im flying out tonight unless loman turns up he wont be here until tomorrow then give him my love i stood up and held out my hand for the papers he said with a wrinkled smile im surprised youre not staying you dont need me here youll do all right if you dont mind ill ask miss maine to show you out i know my way it was stinking hot in the street and i took a trishaw back to the pakchong trying not to think about loman when youre meant to be directing someone in the field you dont slide off and subject him to security checks at the hotel twenty minutes later the desk called me and said my visitor would not give a name so i went down i dont like nameless people in my room the lobby of the pakchong has one of those beautiful trellis arches at the entrance to the fountain court and she was standing framed by it her lean body sideways on her throat shadowed by the angle of her head as she looked across to the staircase her eyes regarding me coolly as they had before a shantung suit tan shoes no jewelry only her head moved as i crossed the mosaic the place was very quiet and she pitched her voice low may i use your name nobody knows it i said your cover name who cares i came to apologize mr quiller i should have recognized you at the embassy im not often recognized by the secretaries of cultural attaches yehudi menuhins more their type i wasnt far from rama iv two years ago now that i was close to her i could see that something had happened to her face on the left side it didnt quite balance the skin was perfect but someone someone very good had done a job on it what are you i asked her mil she didnt answer didnt seem interested i said not security no she changed the slim tan bag into the other hand i just came to apologize you cant be used to the indignity of security checks i didnt quite laugh youd be surprised at the indignities im used to along with dewhurst and comyngs my cover name on file had the suffix reliable under torture will you have a drink i cant stay they say youre leaving tonight yes have a good trip i watched her cross the mosaic not many women can walk like that when they know a mans watching them not many women can walk like that anyway i went up andfinished packing to apologize she couldnt have thought that one up for herself she was too intelligent why had they wanted to know that i was physically and in all truth at the pakchong hotel they could have checked on me in a dozen better ways blast their eyes i was on flight the only other thing that happened that day was a phone call from pangsapa asking me to go along there it was dark but most of the shops were still open and some of them were already redressing the windows with colored bunting and goldframed photographs of the person i had the trishaw drop me some distance from the house in klong chula road and walked along the river in the evening heat pangsapa received me straightaway and said the information i have for you is worth something in the region of fifty thousand baht it was too late but i didnt say so it would be amusing to milk lomans expense account and let them fry him when he got back to london fifty thousand i said all right you can guarantee that sum verbatim your word is quite sufficient i knew now that i shouldnt have come it was a lot of money and it would be a lot of information and i didnt want it didnt want to be involved pangsapa said softly three days ago one of the professionals crossed over the maekong river from laos into thailand and tonight he arrived in bangkok which one kuo the mongolian so there was nothing i could do about it now the specialists they are specialists and each has his own method sorbi is a strangler but never uses his hands it is nearly always a nylon stocking infrequently a cord he is a lecher and runs with the nightclub set in european capital cities finding most of his work there he calls himself a private operator half his kills are women and he is offered his work by rich men or men of high position who cannot afford exposure sorbi was behind the blue room mystery of the june paris headlines and the autostrada angel case in milan which entrained the resignation of three members of the italian government sorbis client was not of course implicated this operation brought sorbi into touch with politicals and be is now said to hold himself available for political work the fees being very high quicky the greek uses the knife and has made only two killings but both were important and both political and so wellarranged that in one case the record still shows a verdict of suicide the greek never asks for money but for deeds of title and he is said to own fifteen thousand acres of land in the key development areas of the argentine and venezuela he may not live long to enjoy his possessions as pangsapa himself told me that quicky is hooked on snow vincent works wild and nobody trusts him though he is so persistent that once a name is given to him the man of that name can be considered as dead vincent will use anything a gun or a knife poison a bomb or his bare hands also he is cheap and they say he would work even for nothing the japanese hideo is a technician and one hundred per cent efficient he always uses a cyanide spray possibly impressed by the clinical success of the kgb agent bogdan stashinski who in acknowledged the killing of rebet and bandera in munich hideo has three major political assassinations on record including that of the turkish ambassador to the united kingdom hideo the technician has the most elaborate model railway in japan zotta is the son of a member of one of the mafias original murder inc groups and his specialty is the miniature bomb he claims that his weapon is personalized and that accurate placing will ensure a quick clean kill with no danger to anyone else in the vicinity of the victim this is probably true sherman wills president of the charter and equity bank was opening his pen in the board room at the start of a meeting and nobody else was hurt a year later the half brother of king riyadh ali switched on his electric shaver in the royal yacht standing off damascus and the stateroom windows remained unbroken zotta is a technician like hideo but far less stable when he dies there will be a woman there who will not grieve they are all specialists and each has his own method kuo uses the gun pangsapa was very good he sent someone with me a small nervous hindu halfscared of himself or of someone perhaps of pangsapa to find kuo the mongolian and look at him he was watching the professional karate training bouts in the gymnasium of the royal thai athletic association not far from the lumpini polo grounds a fight was in progress and we chose a seat on the side of the main entrance the place was airconditioned but smelled of embrocation resin and sweat my guide sat for a few minutes idly watching the spectators and suddenly looked down murmuring he is in the second row up halfway along on the right side he is the one in smoked glasses by his tone i knew that it was kuo he was scared of i slowly raised my eyes you can go now i said if you are certain yes i knew him well once i looked down again at the fighters until the hindu had gone in case his movement was noticed then i looked across again at kuo even if my guide had not pointed him out i would have known him for what he was a man of authority a man of affairs he was in european clothes a white tergal suit impeccably cut and worn with indifference a dark blue tie with a gold motif small gold cufflinks his authority was in the way he sat in the angle of his body and the poise of his head nothing of this was deliberate he was engrossed in the fight on each side of him sat a bodyguard dressed also in western clothes their deference was as explicit as his authority i wished i could see his eyes i would have to recognize him later recognize him immediately even at a distance even in bad light the eyes are so important the eyes and the walk i would have to stay until he left so that i could see him walk the feet of the karate fighters stamped you could hear their breath they were the thai champions and would fight here during the visit their shadows fought on the resined boards under their feet sharply thrown by the grouped lamps kuo was sometimes tense and i remembered pangsapa watching the fish sometimes he tilted his compact head and laughed to one of the bodyguards he was enjoying himself i watched him for an hour every gesture every movement of his head when some people came into my row i got up and sidled between the seats with my back to the arena and made my way round the end of the gymnasium finding a seat above and to one side of kuo so that i could impress his back view on my memory tomorrow i would begin to follow him to live with him and learn him until i knew him as if he were my brother when he left the gymnasium i watched him walk across the clear space at the end where there were no seats it was a good walk his arms swung easily the hands relaxed he placed his feet with deliberation his head halfturned attentively as one of his men spoke to him he could have been a president leaving the conference hall he reached the doors and i let him go if he did not come here again tomorrow pangsapa could find rum then i would take over first thing in the morning i telephoned varaphan and told him i wanted the bloodstone ready as soon as possible loman rang me within the hour and i went down to soi suek he looked wary they said you were flying out im not i said what changed your mind do you know who arrived in bangkok yesterday pangsapa told me what made you see pangsapa i thought you meant to keep clear i meant to yes then i heard you were restive so i wanted to know if hed turned anything up i was getting bloody tired of trying to contact you and i didnt like being vetted at the embassy whos that woman theyve got there he said curiously there are quite a few women shes in the cultural attaches office is she mil or security or what you mean vinia maine i think she is our group oh no well tell her to keep out of my way she had me checked and then followed me i dont like her listen i said im accepting the mission but on my own terms this job isnt in your field but you roped in the bureau the minute you caught wind of this thing because theres the chance of a tin medal isnt there i was watching his face if anything comes unstuck on the visit and its left to me to stop kuo therell be credit owed in high places and you know what i think of medals but someones going to cop for one and youre ready at the head of the queue the bureaus director in the field who pulled the whole thing off his eyes were very bright and he kept perfectly still looking me back shining with hate i said thats all right all i want you to get quite clear is that im not working for you im working for him because i dont like to think of a decent man with a wife and kids getting shot in the guts and i dont care if hes the postman or the king of hong kong now ill tell you my terms he moved away and put both hands on the glass top of the display case leaning on it and looking in at the gems but he was listening you said therell be conferences at the embassy count me out im working alone but ill need uptotheminute information from you that i wont have time to get for myself arrival schedules on the th program and final itinerary for the tour of the city stoppingoff points so forth if things get hot i want to be put into contact with you at a minutes notice whether its here or a new safehouse unless theres any change of plan i want to be left alone he stood for a while leaning on the case and then turned to me and asked is that all yes what have you in mind his tone was even i was a louse and he was interested in lice and wanted to know how they worked kuo thats all ive got in mind you know his reputation hes top in his class as a longrange rifleman and hes never been known to miss he nodded pangsapa tells me he has come to bangkok simply to watch the karate fights theyll be putting on a very special show of course and hes a keen aficionado it may be true we shall just assume hes here to attempt an assassination and work on that youve briefed me to make the arrangements and give you the setup and thats what im going to do first ive got to learn the man and try getting his local travel patterns if im in luck i might even get a lead on his arrangements theyll be more efficient than mine hes done it before i suppose he said carefully you have been giving some thought to the threat the actual threat received in london it wasnt from kuo it wasnt from anyone who means to have a go im not interested of course it was valuable to us we wouldnt have been alerted we wouldnt be here now you and i with no rancor i said what a bloody shame he smiled quickly hed swallowed the hate it was still there all right and one fine day he would catch me wide open and slam me down or try to youll need to know the security picture he said its not easy for me to get information in that area we dont exist and weve no official access or liaison also theyre cagey by nature but i know this much theyre keeping three suspects in view one is of course kuo himself but they dont rate him very highly kuo is respected and the moment he crosses a frontier they double the security guard round every head of state as a matter of routine on the other hand he travels a great deal even when hes shall we say off duty providing he remains in view and doesnt at any time go to ground theyll be content to keep a routine watch on him if he goes to ground theyll try to find him but theyll use routine methods and it might be too late but you will have been concentrating solely on him and with any luck youll know where hes gone he gave me one of his bright stares dont ever lose him will you and i wont eat too many sweets they were all like that the london mob talked to you like a governess remember he said in precisely the same tone that the thai home office and security departments have been told of the threat received in london and are giving our people unlimited facilities king aduldej has been kept informed and has made it very clear that he expects every conceivable effort to be made for the protection of his guest quite apart from anything else he is jealous of his capital citys reputation as a place where one can walk in the streets unharmed when loman wasnt talking like a governess he was talking like an official spokesman for the junior conservative society i went on listening the city police are already mounting a dragnet operation to round up all known or suspected agitators and subversives the first wave of arrests will take place in two days time routine checks are already going on at don muang airport the royal palace and the major stoppingoff points along the route the motorcade will take all mail and messages addressed to the person to await his arrival are being given the infrared and there is a permanent police guard in the palace kitchens and garage the guest suite now being prepared is look i said wearily its up to them what they do theres a dozen ways prussic acid in the caviar the parcel bomb the snakeinthemattress trick but youve told me yourself that weve got to assume that kuo has been sent in to do this job so let me concentrate on him as far as im concerned its going to be the classic method the one thats most difficult to stop the longrange shot a public execution to ground a simple rule of mnemonics is that if a face is to be remembered it must be forgotten in its absence attempted recall in the absence of the image is dangerously prone to distort it a man of sour disposition and small stature may have a short gray beard and high skin coloration these two features are easily accepted on sight by the memory but later in the absence of the image the memory will concentrate on the only data in its possession and exaggerate it the beard will become longer and whiter the face rosier small additions to the image then build up since the need to remember flogs the mechanism that must do it the eyes are now remembered as being light blue the figure as large and lumbering and the man is now certain to be remembered the next time he is seen in fact he is not even recognized in place of the almost wholly fictional image of santa clauss twin brother is the real thing a small irascible man with brown eyes and a tobaccostained gray beard most instances of poor memory are examples of retroactive interference producing qualitative changes the memory goaded into conscious service begins making things up if left alone the initial neural traces will remain absolutely clear and will recognize the image immediately the next time it is seen because no change has taken place kuo the mongolian was a difficult image partly because he was mongolian and partly because his features were not typically mongoloid he could have passed for a manchurian a sikhote alinese a kunlunese or even a cantonese so i made no attempt to remember him after establishing the initial image in the gymnasium there was thus no remolding of the recall process recognition was immediate the next day just before noon when he came out of the gymnasium i knew there were training fights each morning and evening of this week and i was waiting for him the machine i had chosen from compact hire was tailormade for the work in hand a small toyota corona with a milesperhour peak and quartermile standingstart acceleration performance being small it could cope with even a new road rushhour tangle being fast it could keep most other cars in sight along the exurban fringe highways even if they were trying to slip the tag the windshield was only a few degrees raked and the fasciaboard reflection across the lens of my field glasses was not serious i had kuo in them at x magnification as he came down the steps we started from there for six days he made no attempt absolutely no attempt to hide his movements this worried me he as too accommodating i didnt like his display of confidence i knew and he knew he must have known that he was never let out of sight by the thai special branch i had trouble in keeping out of heir way it meant a lot of longdistance surveillance with the field glasses and meant giving the little toyota the gun on a cold engine then kuo came out of somewhere after a long stay it meant risking time after time losing him altogether there was no particular travel pattern emerging his excursions were haphazard and his timing flexible he made vague sightseeing tours of the city a motorboat trip along the chao phraya and the market canals a look at the monastery of the dawn and the emerald buddha in the wat phra keo doing the rounds taking his time enjoying himself while i had to sit with the ao jupiters focused at a hundred yards and one foot over the clutch one hand on the starter switch the gear already in one eye on the mirror so that i didnt smash someone up if i had to take two seconds to get out of a parking gap it had taken twenty minutes to find one morning i had to spend over an hour watching them grab the king cobras and squeeze the venom out of their fangs at the pasteur snake farm because kuo was so interested the only reward had was the certain knowledge that kuo was behaving out of character he was in character as a tourist but he wasnt a tourist hed been in this city before during the six days of kuos sightseeing tour the only incident was when he stopped his hino contessa for too long outside the royal palace at the main sanam chai road gates four men in neat suits got out of the car that had pulled up behind his and spoke to him through the window then they got him out of his car and put him in theirs driving off i had to wait two hours outside phra ratchawang police station near the river before i could pick up the tag the information filtered to me through loman the next day theyd grilled him searched him and taken the film from his camera this was an unnecessary move he had known theyd been shadowing him and they didnt have to show their hand nor could they have hoped to find any excuse for either keeping him under the key or escorting him across the frontier they could have done that anyway without an excuse their very evident object was to let him run loose and keep him in sight and hope he would set up the machinery for a kill on the th and then scotch it at the fiftyninth second so that he couldnt make a break and set up a reserve operation this was my object too but i couldnt see why theyd shown their hand the snatch outside the palace was the equivalent of my going up to him on the steps of the royal thai athletic association gymnasium and telling him that if he didnt watch out i was going to tread on his face there was no point the only thing i could suppose was that the patrol crew had panicked seeing a professional sitting in the dim interior of a car parked within easy range of the open windows of the palace and had roughed him up a little to justify their interest in him they couldnt have been serious about it two of the known internationals zotta and vincent never openly cross a frontier into the country where they have i killing to do sometimes they are never seen in the country at all it is only the manner and pattern of the killing that identifies them much too late but kuo has style and will wave his passport at the immigration officers on his way in perhaps he likes the fuss it causes perhaps he likes it to be assumed that whenever he crosses a frontier the life of the president is suddenly in hazard though ninety per cent of his journeys are made simply to watch the olympic games or take in a worldchampionship fight if they had been serious about him this time they could have fixed the interrogation at phra ratchawang police station and got him out of the country they didnt want to do that didnt want to lose him because he would at once cross into thailand again incognito from laos or cambodia or burma and go straight to ground if he went to ground they might just as well shoot the target vip themselves because the outcome would now be certain kuo would hole up only if he had business to do so they had probably panicked it wasnt pleasant for them with the highest orders to ensure safety they were watching a known professional assassin touring their city at a time when colored lanterns were being strung across the bridges and flags were going up across the facade of almost every building in readiness to greet a most important visitor thirteen days from now i thought of contacting loman to ask one question had they in fact panicked or were they changing their tactics he might not even be able to find out we had no liaison we didnt exist they would have to make their own plan we would make ours kuo came out of a restaurant when i was blocked in by a solid jam of traffic for five or six minutes and i had to balk an ambulance and take a oneway street in the wrong direction clearing two blocks and cutting across the end of the street where kuo was pointed before i could backtrack in a square series and get behind him i must have caned the toyota to the limit would it amuse control if i sent a signal tonight am slowly wrecking compact hire machine suggest a discreet check for damage due to misuse be tendered to them on surrendering vehicle on the sixth day i managed to get a city paper and read some of it while kuo was in the turkish baths in sukhumvit soi there were one or two interesting items a second wave of arrests by the bangkok metropolitan police command had rounded up more than five hundred suspects and seized stolen property valued at some ninety thousand baht it was referred to as a drive against crime and there was no mention of any action against subversives or political undercover agents the front page reported considerable difficulty being encountered in choosing the best itinerary for the motorcade through the city on the th of this month loman had told me that the exact itinerary would be kept secret until as late as possible and that at least five routes would be announced during the few days prior to the tour so that no one could get a solid fix on it there was nothing else in the paper about the threat situation so i took out the kuo travel pattern i had logged and tried to read some kind of significance into it again certainly there were pointers but they didnt add up to much five visits to phra keo three to the lumpini polo grounds three to the pasteur snake farm two trips along the river by motor launch and one halfhour stop in the parking lot on the new link road parallel with rama iv only the chapel and the lumpini visits had any bearing the chapel was close to the royal palace and a polo game had been arranged for the th among several oneshot visits in the kuo pattern were government house the james thompson thai art exhibition and the phra chula chedi a temple overlooking the link road near rama iv there was only this one relationship in the whole pattern the temple and the new road i had begun resenting the police shadows they could take it in shifts and i was on what amounted to a twentyfourhour tour of duty six days of it so far with biscuit crumbs trodden in on the floor of the toyota because there was no chance of proper meals and a jaded reflection in the windshield under the street lamps because there hadnt been time for more than snatched intervals of sleep the work was more difficult because i had to keep clear of the police patrols and still hold the tag on kuo and since they were tagging him too it took a lot of doing loman had been firm on this the director general of the police department knew we were operating but had made it clear that if we got in the way wed be told to pull out i didnt know how much power loman had as the director of the only agent in the field if pushed i believed he could stir up london but it might mean official telegrams from ambassador to foreign secretary to cover unofficial requests and permissions and we didnt have time for that i had one single preliminary mission to keep kuo in sight to tag him till his travel pattern showed significance or until he made a move that would give us a clue to his intentions twice loman had brought me to the point of a brawl he had used the same polished junior conservative society phrase each time i neednt impress on you the fully urgent necessity of keeping kuo in sight the first time i had diluted the adrenalin with a quick drink and the second time i had said look ive been keeping myself alive for five days on a gutful of biscuits and something like a dozen hours of sleep and ive torn the tires off the toyota and changed it for a new one so if you think im not impressed with the fully urgent necessity of keeping that bastard in sight you must be off your bloody head he gave a smooth smile and said that he expected i felt better now i probably did i wouldnt have minded so much if he wasnt always so beautifully shaved id been keeping the stubble down by quick jabs with a clockwork thing in the car on the evening of the sixth day kuo and his two bodyguards went into the lotus bar in the indochinese quarter not long after seven oclock i took the chance and stretched my legs noting a police car standing off and the twoman shadow patrol taking up station on the far side of the bar we were comfortably within habitual patterns kuo always picked somewhere to drink at this hour and stayed for an average of thirty minutes then he would go somewhere else to dine the thirty minutes took us to by i was back in the car and fretting a bit and by was worried at got out of the car crossed the road and went into the bar he wasnt there so i knew i had lost him kuo had gone to ground blank so i had learned him and lived with him and now i knew him as i would know a brother and in a strange and terrible way i missed him he had always been there in the intimate round window of the x jupiters and now it was blank i went on working until midnight taking a trajectory across the town from the lotus bar to the residence florale to the thai room at the plaza to nicks no i and the shangrilla and the sbaithong in rajprasong and the roulette room at the vendome and he wasnt in any of them his two favorite maisons privees blank the opium house near the phra chao blank the hermaphrodite show at the emerald gate blank all the way to midnight drawing blank loman was waiting for me in my room at the pakchong i had signaled the safehouse fully urgent he took it very well the police lost him too and they were in strength it was a difficult assignment very he didnt look so wellgroomed tonight bags under the eyes i asked what are they doing about it very little oddly enough kuo isnt their chief interest the last wave of arrests brought in a wellorganized subversive group under orders from peking they think the real danger was there they think one of their number defected recently and sent the threat to london theyre working on it now with some of our security people giving them a hand after all we hold the actual written evidence i knew why he said that security were having trouble with the thai home office there were too many of them a good half dozen the written evidence of the threat was their only card doesnt your air conditioner work loman wanted to know his pink skin was gleaming i told them to switch it off all day in the heat of the street and a few hours up here with that thing on and youve got pneumonia i sounded like an old man fretting about his health then what are they doing about kuo nothing routine search of course they wont find him that way how will they find him he was standing in the middle of the room looking at me hard in the eyes he wasnt sure of me not sure how seriously i was taking this thing by keeping out of my way and out of his way i dont know if the kuo cell is on to me ive worked in strict hush for six days but then i had to show my hand by combing the town the lotus bar and all the other places but if theyre not on to me ive still got a chance i know the whole cell now two bodyguards and four operatives he works with a team like a matador with a cuadrilla always has i can recognize any one of them and god knows i can recognize kuo if the police lay off theyll show themselves sooner or later then its a question of time thirteen days he was standing there sweating like a pig i want you to know something loman this job didnt appeal to me when it was sprung on me cold but i finally took it on and now im in deep and im not backing out i know whats happened ive lost the adverse party and hes gone to ground and nothing can stop him setting up the kill the person isnt safe any more dont think it doesnt mean anything to me i was too tired to think of the right words but he must have caught the tone because he drew a breath and nodded im quite sure you realize the extreme gravity of the situation for the first time i felt sorry for the poor bastard even his bow tie wasnt straight he wished hed never roped in the bureau and he wished hed never chosen me for the running boy and now it was a bit too late to do anything about it i turned away from him and looked down from the open windows the only open windows in the whole hotel the air was like cotton wool against the skin the street was still sliding past in a gold stream down there bumper to bumper colored lanterns flowering right across the park a pulse of occidental wayout rhythms rising from latenight garden rooms people dancing under the lights under the leaves no one wanted to sleep how is it going i asked him in room everyone is very occupied of course his pedantic phrases sounded thin now running on like a ticker tape oblivious to the crash it was announcing the ambassador takes the chair himself when he can there are continual telegrams exchanged with london but they mostly concern the security situation as such does the po know what were doing i cant say of course all i can do is send our own regular signals and leave it to control whether or not to inform the minister the first confidential press conference was held yesterday christ i said i realize thats a contradiction in terms but they are being cooperative and of course we dont have to give them everything they have been given nothing about us i dont like press conferences at a time like this dont like them at all one has to show that one isnt um screaming with fright that one isnt worried yes i stared down at the flow of lights mesmerized a sleepy calm creeping over the jangle of nerves the wayout music from the leafy gardens stifling my own inner scream of fright it was time to shut everything down what are your immediate plans he was asking me coming toward the windows sleep i said for twelve hours and god help anyone who tries to stop me the maltz system of psychocybernetics breaks newround in that it likens the subconscious to a computer to which the forebrain submits problems for resolution some of its concepts derive from accepted disciplines deluding that of the sleep processes the dreams i experienced during the next twelve hours were variations of the same dominant theme and the only clear memory of them was summarized in a repetition of what loman had told me a week ago you now have information that a man revered in his own country and respected abroad is going to have the guts to expose himself to a threat of death because he wont refuse his duty you also know that if the very elaborate machinery for his protection breaks down and if this valuable life is lost because of your own petty feelings against me as your director in the field its going to be your fault your fault alone and you wont be able to live with it the data was fed to the computer in the form of images the person hands tucked behind him the eyes quizzical a quick laugh as he got the point an instant before the others a tilt of his chin as he turned and moved on beside his companion and kuo strong shortbodied and welltailored placing his feet with deliberation his asiatic features made half anonymous by the smoked glasses and loman smoothly shaven the mind cold behind the hard bright stare the images merged as the computer collated the data kuo with his deliberate steps taking him past the shop window where the photograph looked out with quizzical eyes and suddenly the crowds and the flags and the flowers and the crosshairs of the telescopic sight bearing on the moving target and the crash of the shot with lomans face distorted by the longdrawn scream of fright the kill its going to be your fault your fault alone the data wasnt new it had been going into the computer since the day i had accepted the mission but in sleep there were no distractions and the subconscious was totally engaged the sleep curves had shallowed out by noon of the next day and i woke and spent an hour getting clean and drinking coffee and thinking about nothing then i began looking for kuo the streets were more festive every day and there were flags everywhere and flowers people began cheering the ambassadors car when they saw the standard the florists along plern chit road competed with one another making immense displays round the goldframed photograph red and white flowers blue ribbons i was a specter at the feast haunting the streets the stubble growing again the toyota taking me through the city in a maze of my own making and spinning out a travel pattern that somewhere and sometime must coincide with his loman wanted me to make contact every day but i kept clear of him when i could because there was nothing to report on the sixth day of the hunt he intercepted me in the lobby of the pakchong i may have to tell london to advise the minister he said i stood looking at him aching for sleep he said we have five days more ive tried to convince police colonel ramin that we are on to the suggest danger kuo its a case for a dragnet he wont hear of it he was keen enough before never left the bastard alone ramin believes the only danger was from the subversive group he rounded up hes already taking credit for having cleared the city there are rumors that kuo has left thailand naturally hes circulating them himself he asked me what do you think of your chances its a question of time i told you before if the police have stopped looking its a help ive got a clear field the person is due here in five days and you dont have to keep im not just rubbing it in dont misunderstand me i mean simply that the visit cant be called off at the last minute its a very big affair there has to be time to announce the diplomatic cold at least two days so we have three days left its no longer practical to call it five i thought hed begun swaying on his feet but the trellis archway into the fountain court was swaying too all right three i would like you to report daily from now on ill report he nodded you need some sleep now how did you know i said and went up the stairs leaving him standing there it was no go the next day i took long loops through the city checking and rechecking the points where the kuo cell had shown itself finding myself again and again in the temple and link road area it was the psychocybernetic computer sending me there correcting my course with negative feedback data it had the answer the phra chula chedi perhaps it was right i didnt know for the third time i drove out to the airport across the unending rice fields vetting the few buildings and trying to arrange a setup that kuo might use if he meant to kill early and make sure of it before the security net could stop him there were only a dozen or so buildings that would allow less than a degree shot and only two of these were placed on a curve in the road or at an angle that would bring a car headon in the sights the airport looked very gay decked out with flowers filling the main terrace it looked welcoming i wondered whether he would come and if he came whether he would live the duotone chevrolet in the main parking area was moving forward as i turned toward the gates and i suddenly got fed up and made a quick full circle and forced it to a stop against the fence leaving my own car and climbing into the back of hers she just sat there not turning her head but giving me her steady direct gaze in the mirror as i said i want to know what youre doing here and why youve had me tagged for the last fifteen days just straight answers beginning now the ritual theres nothing she said that i can tell you i had been leaning forward now i slid back and rested my head on the rear seat squab my halfclosed eyes on the mirror where hers watched me it was a big car comfortable it would be nice to be driven some where along a road that ran straight and had no danger spots no traps the airport was suddenly aglow with light as the dusk fell the flowers became vivid what is your name i asked maine all of it vinia maine she turned her lean body and laid one arm along the back of her seat and looked at me directly instead of in the mirror there wasnt any expression in the wide clear eyes they were just alert i said it doesnt sound very likely your cover name is it she said nothing who were the tags the thin one and the one with the splayfooted walk who were they the vivid flowers were reflected in her eyes who were they i watched the pulse beating in her slim throat she didnt look away from me where are they now why are you having to do their job why did you tag me here her lips parted a seconds hesitation then i thought you might be getting on a plane her voice was low and its clear timbre made my drowsiness worse it was a voice to send a child to sleep what would you have done i asked her if id got on a plane it would have depended where you were going oh come on come on i was suddenly sitting up straight loman was a hell of an intelligence director if he couldnt keep this bitch out of my way id told him to id made a point of it just give me basic answers will you where dyou think i might have been going in a plane into china what would you have done stopped you how by warning you warning me by telling you why you cant cross into china im taking the midnight so tell me now the smile was tentative starting in the eyes and then touching the mouth no youre not i looked away from her through the window a car had come into the parking area a taxi i watched the people get out she said i came alone there was no time to tell anyone where i was going i looked back at her for an instant because i was tired and because the big car was comfortable i wondered what had happened to the left side of her face what outfit are you in i asked you and the two tags security why cant you do your job on your own instead of following me about like pilotfish hanging on for the pickings ive lost the bastard you know that but im going to find him and when i find him you wont be there by god ill make sure of that i opened the door tell them to lay off keep out of my way i dont like hangerson i got out and slammed the door the driving window was open and i leaned in and jerked the ignition key out and threw it across the flower beds if you have to cross into china she said looking up at me intently please see me first i can always be contacted at the embassy you wont see me again i got into the toyota at noon the next day i reported to loman at the safehouse in soi suek he didnt ask if id made any progress because he knew id be only too damned glad to tell him if i had that bitch at the embassy i said who is she he said curiously thats the second time youve mentioned her i told you to keep her out of my way she tagged me last night and shes had me tagged for the past fifteen days who the hell are they after a bit he said ill try to find out its the secretary to the cultural attache you mean is it scarface ive had no information on her of course it was never possible to tell when he was lying in his game it was one of his assets i let it go he talked for a bit to see if he could gleam anything from my mood he would have given a lot just for one crumb one small crumb of hope before i left him i said all right ive got two more days i went straight back to the pakchong and had my two cases sent down to the car it looked as though loman didnt know who she was or why she was hanging on so i would just have to fade occasionally you get a fool girl with a builtin doityourself matahari kit in her wig and they play hell all over the departments picking bustickets out of the wpb and sending them to codes and ciphers this was one of them they lived in their own coldwar dream world and talked out of the side of their mouths dont cross into china that sort of thing this one had roped in a couple of clerks from cultural aid for distressed pomeranian pavement artists and put them onto my track in between cozy bedtimes i spent ten minutes in the thick of the city with both eyes on the mirror and jabbing the toyota heelandtoe through the corners to shake off any possible tag then made a straight line for a safe hotel near the panam office i had used it before and the management was still the same then i worked till midnight and drew blank there was a message from loman the next day pangsapa was trying to contact me it took an hour to find him but i didnt lose patience if he had information on kuo it was worth the whole day he was supervising a shipment at one of his wharves along the chao phraya and i had to wait until he had given orders for his overseer to take charge we will go into my office he lisped you will have some tea i hope theres no time pangsapa tea in this latitude meant a protracted ceremony he wore western clothes today and his office was functional in design so that our meeting had the appearance of the mundane as if a householder were taking out a mortgage with the help of life insurance except that looking into these quiet yellow eyes i remembered the beautiful fish i understand he said considerately people tell me that your time is very short and very limited i wish i could be of some further use thats why i hoped you might come to see me he had the manner of a bargainer and i tried mentally to put a price on his information if he had any and if it would lead me to kuo but there were the imponderables even if i found kuo it wasnt certain that i could stop him from making his kill how much would the bureau go to with the life of the person in hazard there was no time for bargaining theyd have to pay what it said on the ticket lets use short words pangsapa you wanted to see me and im here he nodded very well ill be brief first ive no information for you i dont know where he is but i would like to help you find him before its too late that might expose me or friends whom i cherish to some danger he got up from his desk and looked from the big low window the shadow of a crane swung across him i believed him to be genuinely interested in the loading of his shipment and i cursed him for not being as interested in kuo you see he said without turning from the window i dont know much about you mr quiller i dont know how dangerous your work is or to what degree i and my friends would share your dangers if we took he swung his head and looked straight at me exceptional measures to help you i said its no go im on a mission you know that and you know what it is theres nothing i can add his wistful smile appeared if you want me to help you find this man it would be natural for me to ask you more about your mission after all they are practically the same thing but i wont press you just tell me about yourself as distinct from your present work i leaned forward and cupped my face in my hands the light from the big window burned my eyes particularize i said i heard him sitting down again are all your missions dangerous mr quiller id be safer in bed it was all my subconscious could think about sleep do you always work in an official capacity theres an office behind my work just as theres an office behind the work of shipping snow a bit impolite to hell he had no bloody information does the government reward you sufficiently for the dangers youre asked to face god knows id asked him to use short words but this was getting basic i said make me an offer and tell me for what i emerged from my hands because i needed to watch him now you mustnt misunderstand me he said quickly its so difficult you see having to put my questions without any concession to subtlety it makes them seem so crude the occidental can do it and it has its advantages it must save so much time at the conference tables but short words are difficult currency east of he mediterranean so you must forgive me with what seemed an effort to be accommodating he leaned toward me and said ill put all my questions into one what is your status in london i didnt like his drift but the only alternative to following it was to shut up and i had to find kuo and pangsapa might work the trick tomorrow was the last day you mean how important am i to the government that would be a way of putting it yes maybe he was just bargaining wanting to know how much i could call on the last time i had been good for fifty thousand baht i said youve heard of abel i have lonsdale i have id say im about their weight he nodded slowly thank you you see i like working with big people i can do more for them and they can do more for me i got up annoyed with him it was quite simple he had impressive information sources and his network had told him that i was up against it and having a bad time trying to find kuo so hed got me along to question me and assess the price there was nothing wrong with bargaining a value has to be set on goods i was annoyed with him only because the deadline was so appallingly close and money wasnt important maybe that was because the bureau was going to fork out not me all right pangsapa if you can give me a lead on kuo before noon tomorrow whats it going to cost he came round the desk and stood as close to me as any oriental will ever stand to his companion nothing he was known to be a man who would do anything for money unless lomans dossier on him was duff i asked with how many noughts he really took my little indiscretions remarkably well you may put it down to what you called my undying love for the monarchy if you wish i will tell you simply that although i have no information at present on the whereabouts of this man i will make every effort to help you find him i may not be lucky but i will try and if i succeed it will cost you nothing he opened the door for me and we stood on the timber balcony overlooking the dockside where the crane was still swinging there was no point in asking him to explain and i was too jaded to worry the thing so i just said you can always contact me through loman i went down the steps the heat was worse now the sun was turning the city to brass and it burned under the haze the toyota had become an oven because i couldnt always park in the shade that day i worked nineteen hours and i drew blank there was no word from pangsapa the next morning i tried to contact loman by telephone at three places his hotel the british embassy and the safehouse and had no luck so it was at twelve noon when we met in soi suek according to routine he looked knotted up with nerves and didnt even ask for my report going straight into one of his toneless monologues we held an emergency conference two hours ago in room it has now been agreed to signal london and add a recommendation that the minister himself should be informed of the kuo situation the risk is quite unimaginable if we leave it any longer than ive found him i said i hadnt had time to question what had happened its always dangerous on a mission not to have time to think but the morning was mine within an hour of putting the toyota through the routine travel pattern i saw one of the kuo cell coming out of the gunsmiths in new road it had been bound to happen the only question was how long it would take i had told loman that much because you cant spend twenty hours a day day after day combing a town for a man without finding him in the end unless he has holed up permanently i knew that kuo couldnt hole up permanently because he had work to do and it was work that must take him into the open for eight days i had been following the established kuo pattern and keeping watch on every single place where he had ever shown himself the entire pattern had been committed to my memory beginning with his points of call that i had checked in the few hours after losing him in the lotus bar low flora ties nick by thongs angrily to emigrate lotus bar residence florale thai room nicks no i sbaithong shangrilla emerald gate there were some thirtyodd places and i had mentally listed them in descending order of priority at the top of that list was the templelink road sector my instincts homed strongly on that area and i knew why the maltz psychocybernetic mechanism kept sending me back there there was also a second reason the man in the kuo cell had a taxi waiting for him near the gunsmiths and i put a tag on him that it was impossible for him to flush simply because i couldnt afford to let him go at noon i would have to report to loman and this was the day of the deadline i think i had never tagged a man so mercilessly well he never knew i was there he led me straight to an apartment block on the river side of the city and i was still there at the curb in the toyota half an hour later when kuo came out with his two bodyguards and got into a car he got in first and the two men handed him very carefully a roll of gold cloth the temptation to throw blind was strong to hang back and let them go remove all risk of their sensing me to take the series of short cuts that would get me there before them and give me time to climb the stairs of the botanical museum but there was a greater risk that they were going somewhere else somewhere i didnt know about in the end it was a compromise after ten minutes the kuo driver sensed me and began square turns block after block playing the lights on the amber and using his speed through lumpini park it was no go he would never lead me anywhere useful now that he knew i was there in his mirror kuo would order him to keep on driving until he flushed me however long it took so i dropped back putting up a fair show of being balked by the traffic at the angle of sukumvit and rama iv and making a couple of feints and turning back up sukumvit into dheb prasit lane and into rama iv and speeding up dead straight and due west toward lumpini working on a seventythirty chance it was all i had they didnt come into the mirror the botanical museum was in the link road area and i left the toyota in the driveway and took the field glasses with me at the museum there is a staircase at one side with a small window on each landing i had been there more than once in the last eight days going up to the reading room on the top floor so that the girl at the desk in the main hall wouldnt hear my footsteps halt at the third landing and wonder why then coming quietly down to the small window that overlooked the phra chula chedi the temple on the link road they came within minutes i focused the jupiters one of them not kuo got out of the car and went through the temple gardens coming back with a man in a yellow robe a priest he leaned at the window of the car in the x lens i could see his lips moving then he straightened up and they handed him the roll of gold cloth he carried it with reverence through the temple gardens and the car drove away i am not easily moved to repugnance but it was the ritual that was so ugly the ritual diabolus the whole thing nearly came unstuck it was typical of our relationship wed known from the beginning that we werent going to get on together wed known also that somehow we would have to but this time it wasnt personal it was on a question of policy i cant sanction it that was his first reaction he spent most of the time walking about and i had to suffer his long silences while he stopped to stare at the rosewood buddha and the moonstone and the panorient jewel company calendar on the wall i cannot see how i could sanction it after a bit i just sat down and shut my eyes except when he came up to talk to me even then he was talking half the time to himself playing it aloud trying to get a grip on it i was hard up for sleep and would have dozed off in the chair if i hadnt been sitting on a bomb it is the most sensitive operation i have ever been presented with i could hear by his footsteps that he was standing in front of me again so i opened my eyes and said you asked me for a setup its the only one that can work there are plenty of others but theyre all chancy youve thought of them and ive thought of them and theres something wrong with all of them except this one so dont lets waste time going over everything is wrong with this one and everything is right i sat watching him struggle certainly there was a lot to this operation that would put the fear of christ into a seasoned agent the whole setup was pivoted on a needle point but it had advantages big ones bigger than any of the other plans could give us he wanted to launch it he would give a great deal to see it run he was an intelligence director of long experience and this thing excited him fascinated him it was sensitive and it was elegant what he was doing as he shifted about and stared at things he didnt see was trying to talk himself into saying yes i let him struggle with it while i sat there with thoughts of my own i had already made my decisions if he agreed to directing this operation i would set it up and push through with it win or lose if he couldnt sanction it i would sign off the mission and get out of bangkok no half measures if he tried to talk me into one of the other plans it was no go the second reason for the strong homing of my instincts on the temple near the link road was that it was one of the alternative setups i had given loman some time ago it was the feature of one of the assassination arrangements he had first asked me for the phra chula chedi with its whitefrescoed walls and golden tower and beautiful gardens was a perfect vantage point for kuo it was a gun sight commanding the whole length of the link road it was to the temple that kuo himself had taken the roll of gold cloth consigning it to the safekeeping of the man garbed as a priest there had been people about passing along the pavement it didnt matter gold clothtapestries sacred draperies were common enough in the city temples this one had been something over three feet long and its weight judging by the way they had handled it had been ten or twelve pounds gold fiber is heavy the cloth itself would weigh in the region of five or six pounds it didnt matter that people had been passing along the pavement there in full daylight and had seen the gold cloth in another way it did matter it was kuos hallmark stylishness he had taken a braggart pleasure in bringing to this sacred place in view of the people of this city the instrument of cain that would send this city and all england into mourning the thing had been done with the semblance of a ritual kuo the mongolian was a man short in the body and with a deliberate gait his face disguised by smoked glasses but he would be more accurately described as a man who would do this thing in this way here was his whole character expressed in one gesture he was diabolus so lomans misgivings didnt count with me he was standing over my chair again and i opened my eyes he said almost pettishly you know perfectly well that in any case i cant sanction homicide im not asking you to but the entire operation hinges on for gods sake loman were wasting time i got out of the chair fed up with him one of thems going to die isnt he which dyou want it to be he started off again fretting up and down till i stopped him and made him talk and go on talking in half an hour we reached a deadlock and it took another half an hour to break it talking had helped him helped us both we were getting used to the operation and it didnt scare us any more we are always up against the same difficulty quiller lack of peripheral support we havent any junior agents to do the general background work tagging guarding manning a courier line all chiefs and no indians thats why you lost kuo at the lotus bar we didnt have a man on the other exit we cant ask for assistance from any police department as ive told you colonel ramin will have nothing to do with me for this reason we have very little information plenty of raw intelligence but nobody who can analyze it for us and give us a complete picture therefore we know practically nothing of what plans the bangkok metropolitan people have in mind or even what our own security is doing their responsibility is very high and theyre jealous of it he took a couple of turns and came back giving me a hard bright stare by which i mean that if we launch this operation we shall be on our own entirely on our own i said its the only way i can work you know that i had to sell him this point the mission suited me but it didnt suit him he specialized in operations with a wellorganized cell established access and firstclass communications this wasnt in his field it hadnt been mine until the kuo pattern had shown me the way in there was no point now in telling loman that he had roped in the bureau and me with it and that it was his own responsibility he had to be sold my operation by positive not negative argument i told him lack of peripheral support isnt a difficulty in this case its because were on our own that we can work as we like were responsible to control for results and the means dont count no one is responsible to us there arent any junior agents to get caught in the blast when we light the fuse thats the whole idea about the bureau isnt it youve said it yourself we dont exist it lets us do things that no other department can do i stood close to him you cant lose loman with a bit of luck and some good organization the security people sent out with the person are going to give him all the protection he needs if they cant stop kuo then the local networks will the thai home office special branch and metro police with luck but if he gets through them all and if all the luck runs out well be there you and i plugging the hole we stood so close that i could see my own reflection in his hard bright eyes i need do no more than to murmur and we can bring it off and if we bring it off whos going to ask how we did it control control never asks it would never keep an agent if we had to account for our methods so were in the clear and were on our own and the setups waiting i moved away from him and gave him five seconds to think he had to have those few seconds without my eyes on him so that he could look into himself for his own counsel but i gave him no more than five because the final shot had to go in timed to exactitude and its a beauty isnt it sensitive elegant simple brutal and just a classic dog eat dog it was absurd hed spent so long before talking me into this mission now id had to sell it back to him what do you need he asked and i knew it was a deal three things a base a darkroom a look at the car nothing else your general supervision im out of sleep i could make a mistake there wont be much time for sleep ive got your direction in any case im all right jack how are you he asked me what kind of base do you need he spoke with the dulled tone of a punchdrunk he had committed himself and had no time to think about it yet i wished him joy in the small hours of the night theres an office block at the intersection of the link road and ramaiv facing east with the name taylorspeers on a board theyre demolition contractors and the work doesnt start till the middle of next month because theyre held up with their schedule theyve wrecked an electric main under the tram terminal sheds theyve just pulled down its a british outfit and youll find them in the book i want any one of the topfloor rooms at the front and no ones to know im there he didnt like it colonel ramin he said tells me that the police will be checking upwards of three hundred uninhabited rooms overlooking the motorcade route on the morning of the th they are already working on the lists of residents of several thousand other rooms i can deal with that ive been in there he still didnt like it taylorspeers are bound to let their workers into the building on that day to watch the motorcade its declared a national holiday and it would be natural for them to do that i said thats what i want fixed no one goes into that building on the day except the police its a british firm and youve got a set of official credentials pick any one this is a big chance for messrs taylorspeers to demonstrate their steadfast loyalty to the country whose ancient soil so forth ill do it in my own way he said stuffily thats our motto the means dont count what kind of darkroom do you need nothing special somewhere lightproof enough to use an enlarger in the daytime somewhere as near the condemned building as you can find i dont want to show myself in the open street camera gear ill choose it myself when do you want to look at the car as soon as you can fix it our voices sounded hollow everything we said now every small word took us nearer the thing we were going to do i shant waste any time he said i know you wont he went first to the door i would wait five minutes that was the routine one thing i forgot loman he turned to look at me can you get me a guest membership card at the rifle club i need a couple of hours on their yard range were working on a longshot and we dont want to miss the oriel bangkok is a city whose temples have towers of gold and whose hotels rise alabaster from emerald palms here fountains play in marble courts and women walk in silk with jeweled hair the air is heavy with the perfumes of all araby it is a paradise expressly fashioned for the beguilement of princes by day the sun spills rose light along private paths and the blue of night is webbed about with music the tramp curled up on his sleeping mat in the corner of the duty floor where flakes of plaster fell softly from the walls with a deadmoth flutter mildew smelled on the air water from the last rains had leaked from fissures in the roof and was rotting the ceiling battens it would never dry out the hammers would be here first felling the whole edifice like a beast in the abattoir loman had worked fast say that for him taylorspeers had rallied to the flag and this rotting hulk was my lair for the last of its days the ghost had moved in early his nose quick for the smell of a death sometimes i slept but waked often on a thought that had to be examined loman had also found me a darkroom in the next block and i had permission to use it as required he had even convinced the palace security of his bona fides and we had been fetched in a police car our papers were checked by guards at two points in the private grounds before we reached the royal garages it was an interesting vehicle a cadillac fleetwood eldorado in ivory white with gold metal fittings and amber hide the horsepower engine would push the twoton gross weight to miles per hour the coachwork had been converted to provide six seats two of them folding into the midsquab the main rear seat being raised nine inches for a better view four aerials gave radio linking with outriders and the command security vehicle steelreinforced side platforms dressed with ribbed white rubber provided foothold for a guard if he had to perform his prime duty that of getting his body between the bullet and the man he is protecting special equipment included a builtin police siren emergency lights fire extinguishers medical kit and bulletproof tires there were five dismountable roof sections one of sheet steel four of bulletproof transparent plastic i had told loman its important to know which sections are going to be mounted if any that may be difficult its nobodys particular decision our security people and thai security will ask for all the plastic sections to be put p the person himself will opt to dispense with all of them because that is his character prince udom will be in the car with him and the palace directive is almost certain nobody here wants it to be demonstrated that one can travel safely through bangkok only by virtue of bulletproof shields find out what you can thats all i ask it was important these shields formed part of a pattern that comprised a lot of factors distance trajectory trigonometry ballistics take one shield away and it would affect the whole setup it could even shift the location of the sniping post and we had to work on the premise that whatever we knew kuo could find out kuo wasnt just a thug with a gun for hire he wouldnt be in the crowd at the edge of the route hoping to get in a chance shot and run before they lynched him hope and chance werent in his reckoning he was a professional in a way he was like loman he worked best with a disciplined cell and good communications since kuo had come to this city he had been directing his cell with precision and they would have gone out hard for information they had to know the defense pattern and they had to find its weaknesses they had to break it before they could kill assume they know everything everything except that i am where i am curled on the floor like a dog in its den waiting the chance to eat dog the tilt of the planet itself was a factor framed in the window of my small high room was the phra chula chedi magnificent in the morning sun the walls were white and had no apertures except for the immense golden doors halfseen among the temple gardens above the walls rose the dome in a half globe of shimmering gold supporting the slender tower between dome and tower was a ring of small unglazed openings and only from these oriels could a marksman sight the link road at a range of some two hundred yards i could look directly into them at eye level but it was summer and the sun was high and they were at all hours in shadow the field glasses couldnt beat this light factor no optical lens of whatever magnification could define detail inside the ring of oriels it could be done only with a camera a camera set for time exposure can produce a detailed image of a room so dark that objects in it are barely visible to the human eye the camera is a lightgathering device the place loman had found for me in the next block didnt sell much equipment because they were mainly in business for processing and the highest magnification they could offer was x there was a shop half a mile down rama iv but i was holed up and didnt want to show myself in the street more than i had to they let me take my pick from what they had on the shelves and i came up with a compromise a pentax x millimeter single lens reflex with a millimeter lens that took a x auto teleconverter and a stock adapter for my jupiters x x gave a total focal length of millimeters and a magnification of sixteen times i set it up on a tripod with a turret mounting that was rigid enough for the weight but the building was old and the traffic would cause vibration so i played safe with a pan plusx frames the depth of field wasnt critical because seen through the jupiters the wall inside the middle oriel appeared to be less than six feet back from the aperture tocut through the heat haze i used in h vivo yellow filter to mask out the glare of the fold dome a makeshift hood was essential and i had brought one of the threefoot cardboard cylinders they had at the shop for mailing blowups the gates of the temple gardens were hidden by a cloud of magnolias and only the top half of the doorway itself was visible the doors were some fifteen feet high and priests and worshipers would pass into the temple without my seeing them i had therefore to concentrate on the ring of oriels it was two hours before movement showed there and i ran off half a dozen frames at onefiftieth varying the aperture from f to f and using a cable release against vibration because of the slow speed and extreme focal length he showed twice again before noon and took a further ten speeds from onehalf to onethirtieth same f stops the haze was worse now as the heat mounted in the street so i left it at that and went down to the shop and spent half an hour in the darkroom even the wet negs looked promising three of the frames being sharp it was worth staying on i wouldnt get better than these today because of the haze in two hours the sharpest blowups were hanging up to dry of the sixteen essays five were successful and one perfect a headandshoulders pose framed in the oriel even the shape of the smoked glasses was recognizable rather flat at the top with the sides tapering downward a metal nosepiece almost level with the top of the lenses this one was all i needed and from this moment there came the onset of nerves there was no doubt left if the protection officers failed because they were too few in number and if the bangkok organization failed because colonel ramin believed wrongly that he had covered every contingency the shot would be fired from there from the middle oriel of the phra chula chedi a shrine to a god who held life sacred and it would make no difference that i could afterwards present as evidence a portrait of diabolus the onset of nerves began now because i was committed by certainty and because a rendezvous had been established between the two of us and nothing must stop my keeping it the date was the th in three days time the hour was not precise but it came to a matter of seconds there would be a period of some ten seconds in which i would have to operate loman had said it is the most sensitive operation i have ever been presented with the portrait had begun curling at the bottom corners as it dried on the clips the face looked out from the frame of the oriel confident authoritative the face of a professional i hung two more clips at the bottom and left it there it wouldnt matter if anyone saw it but it would matter if someone took it away so i put the heatdried negatives in my pocket and went into the street it took half an hour to reach the gun shop a mile away three blocks on foot and checking for tags a trishaw and another block on foot to check again because absolute security was now essential i was alone and i had to stay alone and when i came to climb to the top floor of the condemned building in three days from now to keep the rendezvous no one must know i was there the shop had a firstclass stock and i made my choice it was a superb instrument and kuo himself would have approved husqvarna the place was cavernous and light came dimly from somewhere high under the roof it was very quiet as soon as i came in i saw the thing in the gloom a fullsized male of the species a chula rearing taller than a man and with livid colors streaking its head there must have been a hundred of them in here male and female i stood listening there was no sound but the faint rush of the traffic along rama iv a vibration underfoot the light had been on when i had come in and i felt it might be dangerous to look for switches and try them then he came out of the shadows his eyes brighter than the rest of him its the best i could do he said how safe is it safer than the gem shop nobody comes in here we approached each other under the vast roof like two people meeting on a railway station the last train gone what about exits i wanted to know i dont like big places the smaller the place the quicker you can get out he pointed one door there another one in the far corner ive got the keys to two of them here are yours i took them he hadnt done badly the place was within three minutes walk of the condemned building and i had reached the first door through an alley where cover was fair several entrances and some kind of fueloil tank on timber props my eyes had now accommodated and i took a final look around the kites were hung from horizontal poles in orderly rows so that even if they were set moving by a draft their fragile paper wouldnt be damaged the male chulas were barbed the female pakpaos had long tails and were smaller many had painted faces some bore the design of a dragon empty crates littered the floor when is the fight i asked loman on the first of the month nobody will be here to fetch them until after the motorcade id had no time to watch the papers but there would obviously be a kite fight organized during the visit loman was being very efficient did you have any success he asked me and i showed him the print its not fully dry he got his pocket lamp and the face with the smoked glasses stared back he said and you are one hundred per cent certain and i am one hundred per cent certain he took a slow breath and i knew that he felt as i had when this picture had slowly appeared from the sodium sulphite we were committed i asked him what about the itinerary nobody knows yet weve got to know he looked up sharply because of my tone it was going to be trickier than ever now to keep patience with each other because of the nerves i am watching the situation he said as evenly as he could it is difficult very i have to take care not to provoke them into shutting every door on me my efforts to interest colonel ramin in kuo have already annoyed him cant they find out at the embassy as soon as the ambassador knows i shall know i was nervous about two things that there was a rendezvous and that there might not be one look i told him either kuo has got his information and he knows the route there may have been a leak a leak or his agents have done their job well it doesnt matter a damn does it either he knows the route or hes setting up more than one gunpost so that he can use any one of them at the last minute he could even be training his cell to man several posts at the same time so theyll be certain of a kill so weve got to know when id had a minute to cool down he said what do you think what do you really think all right but theres a risk you know that i think hes got the information because of the roll of gold cloth because of the ritual if kuo hadnt found out the exact and final itinerary of the motorcade he wouldnt have made such a show of personally handing the weapon to the priest at the temple that had been the act of a man who is certain of what he is doing it was all i had to go on my intimate knowledge of the man and his character but i knew him like a brother from the inquiries i have made loman said there seems very little doubt that whatever the final route it will include the link road there are several good reasons the new hospital is the subject of some pride in the city and the person will want to see it it is easier to control large crowds lining the route along the link road than along that section of rama iv which is the only alternative it is virtually certain that the itinerary will run from the royal palace northward turn east to take in the british embassy then south to the lumpini polo grounds then westward back toward the palace the single major thoroughfare from lumpini to the railway station en route for the palace itself is rama iv and the only possible deviation from rama iv is through the link road it may be of course that kuo is working on the same theory hed be a fool not to i agree with all your reasons but for gods sake get some definite information for me tell the ambassador to get off the bloody pot what the hell is he for he is not loman said with viciously quiet pauses under any obligation to us we do not exist he knows me simply as a member of the special services if i were to ask him point blank for information he would merely tell me to liaise with the other groups mil mil the special branch overseas unit and security tell him hes indirectly responsible for the safety of the person while hes here he is well aware of that he began walking about to get rid of his frustration and his footsteps padded without echoes despite the size of the place the big paper kites hung as thick as clothes in a crowded wardrobe and muffled the acoustics the ambassador is a worried man he stopped in front of me from time to time in case i wasnt listening the situation at the embassy is extremely sensitive quite apart from the normal rivalry between the special services there is an added reluctance to acknowledge each other i have never seen security so tight and of course its natural you must see that every group feels that it alone is chiefly responsible for the safety of the person and that if it gives any information at all to another group that other group may jump the gun and wreck the most carefully made plans and it is the person whose life is in danger do what you can i said it wasnt really meant to rile him he was doing all he could and i knew it but i had the setup on ice now and it was all i could think about i was scared that something would bust it up something like a lastminute decision by the bangkok security people to take the link road off the itinerary it wouldnt worry kuo he had a cell of four picked marksmen and he would just shift the pattern so that whatever route the motorcade used it would come under fire from one of them with kuo himself manning the most likely area there is only a given number of main streets in any city where a public procession can be run you cannot in london send it up and down curzon street and half moon street to avoid piccadilly loman hadnt answered he had gone off on one of his therapeutic walks around the empty crates to get his anger down i was sorry for him i had once seen him briefing five crack operators at the bureau giving them a mission as complicated as an electronic computer access courier lines letter drops radio hookup cover stories timing factors liaison patterns and the whole picture all within one hour because there was a plane waiting and the complete operation depended on moonlight it was a masterpiece and nothing went wrong but he was out here on the far side of the world from his natural base with only an embassy to work on instead of fifty official departments and reference sources and with one single bloodyminded agent whod sold him a setup that had shocked him to the guts next time hed choose someone else and amen to that one thing i want to know i said when he came up to have another look at me youre trying hard to get information out of the security people at the embassy how hard are they trying to get information out of you he was suddenly interested it was just a flicker of the eyes but even in the poor light i caught it everyone is trying to keep information from the other groups as i have just said its just as natural that everyone is also trying to get it im still waiting loman he said obliquely its part of my task as your director to attend to every fringe aspect of the mission and leave you to concentrate on the actual the one thats trying the hardest is the maine girl correct i really cant expose you to problems that shes outside now did you know she tagged you here his face went stiff but i took every possible look it was bound to happen the minute you sanctioned my operation i cleared out of the hotel and went to ground and she lost me for the first time in fifteen days and it must have sent her hysterical youre my only contact and she knows it because i asked for you by name at the embassy the first time i met her there so shes had you tagged since she lost me must have she needs me badly and all i want to know is why and all you have to do is tell me he didnt provoke me by asking if i were certain she was there outside it was my job to know where people were he hadnt sensed the tag because he wasnt an agent in the field he was an executive who did most of his work at a desk but i had checked him for tags every time we had met since id left the pakchong hotel and tonight he wasnt clean shed been using one of the cover availabilities id examined in the alley the fueloil tank on the timber props i am very disturbed to it doesnt matter i said youre not expected to know the drill thats why i always make sure youre the first to arrive just tell me what she wants i dont know he said it quite spontaneously and i knew he wasnt lying it always had to be watched a good intelligence director will tell his agent precisely what he chooses precisely what is good for him and will lie his way out of any risk that his agent will be worried or confused by anything that he does not specifically need to know an agent is sent like a ferret into a hole and he is not told if there is a dog at the other end its control that takes care of the dog i said you dont know but you must have some ideas im in a red sector now loman i cant trust in local control bangkok to deal with fringe aspects for me while im in the field because local control bangkok is one man you and it isnt your field he said nothing but he compromised he didnt walk away i knew he was worried about loss of face because he hadnt sensed the tag but he could worry about it some other time when i didnt need him i said shes trying to milk us isnt she her groups been following me ever since i took the mission over i do the work they get the results if they want to protect the person theyll have to do it on their own and in their own way you know the danger if they balk me now it can spoil my aim and well miss you know the risk call it a national tragedy he studied my face for a bit and then broke a rule because he had to because he was local control bangkok and one man wasnt enough to keep an agent alive in a red sector theyre not concerned he said with protecting the person is that an idea or do you know for certain ive told you i dont know anything you asked for my ideas the maine group isnt trying to get information about the person from me or anyone else theyre not interested in the official arrangements or the itinerary or the kuo setup to prove his worth as a director and save some of his face he said parsonically that is why i made no comment when you twice asked me about the woman my conviction was that her group was not running a mission similar to yours and was therefore unlikely to get in your way that is still my conviction and i still believe its my duty to tell you simply to forget it and concentrate on your operation but i knew he was ready to talk so i didnt waste time on persuasion i told him stick to principles and youll have a death on your hands his and maybe mine if theyre not on a protection mission whats their field they are on a protection mission but you said their mission is not to protect the person its to protect you i shut up because i had to think it checked they had been tagging me the woman herself and the two men the thin one and the one with the splayfooted walk and no one else they had seen that i was logging the kuo travel pattern but they had never switched their attention from me to him and when i lost him they went on tagging me they werent interested in kuo and the woman had been there at the airport in case i took a plane the kites had begun moving we are too old too animal to let ourselves become lost in thought lost in our environments our environments are the jungle a draft from the street had begun moving the kites and they danced grotesquely the big male chulas and the female pakpaos someone had opened a door so i spoke more loudly then tell them to get out of my field loman composed his face in suffering thinking i had raised my voice merely in anger go out and pick up scarface and tell her to mother someone elses chick im a big boy now the only protection i need is from her im relying on you to do that for me loman strictly urgent i took the photograph from him and turned away ten minutes be enough then im leaving clean it would be no good putting the rifle clubs yard range anywhere else because bangkok is surrounded by rice the heat shimmer spreading from the rice fields grows steadily worse as the day advances and makes for a distortion factor with telescopic sights i therefore drove eastward out of the city early enough to put in a couple of hours on the range while the air was stable there had been no time to catch the light after leaving the kite warehouse the previous afternoon i had gone to ground in the condemned building as soon as the area had been checked for tags i had seen neither loman nor the girl outside the warehouse he must have snatched her or scared her off this morning the air was cold and nothing showed in my mirror but i selected a couple of harmlesslooking saloons and kept between them to make it difficult for anyone to raid me either with a shot or a smash my membership card got me straight through to the suits and for the first hour i was alone with the husqvarna the dealer had sent it to the club for me on my instructions with the scope sight already mounted my needs had been for a bigbore rifle capable of longrange accurate fire with a heavy compact bullet achieving high velocity and killing power it was thus necessary to choose a boltaction which is the slowest of all repeaters for followup shots but it is the most reliable all the husqvarnas are beautiful but the finest they make is the it is a magnum centerfire with a threeshot magazine x inch barrel handcheckered walnut stock corrugated buttplate and sling swivels the foreend and pistolgrip are tipped with rosewood the total weight is pounds and the breech pressure is in the region of tons psi giving a high muzzle velocity and an almost flat trajectory with a grain bullet a rifle is no better than its sights so i had chosen an exemplary balvar by bausch and lomb with an optical variable from x to x its feature is that as the magnification power is increased the crosshair reticle remains constant in size and does not therefore tend to obscure the target the report and recoil of a big gun are fairly massive and i went to the range partly to learn the husqvarnas characteristics and align the high overbore scopesight and partly to condition my nervous system to the unaccustomed shock effect the eye must get used to the closeup shrouding of the sightmounting and the figures on the lens the ear must learn to ignore the heavy percussion of the report the shoulder must accept the blow of the recoil above all the perfect marriage must be made between the index finger and the trigger so that shot after shot the automatic memory of the finger muscles takes over from the forebrain and provides a confident pull through the double springs that will not deflect the aim in two hours i put in fifty or sixty shots taking time and taking care checking the target and resetting the alignment of the scope gradually allowing the negative feedback data to correct the aim until i was bunching a dozen inside the tenring then i stopped the flinch that had accompanied the first shots had been exorcised the right shoulder throbbed but had got the measure of the recoil the eye was so used to the reticle that as i walked back to the clubhouse the afterimage was superimposed on my vision true to emmerts law true to my own law i was ready for kuo it had been unsafe to ask anyone at the club to deliver the husqvarna there was no one to receive it at the condemned building or the kite warehouse and i had no other reliable port of call i therefore took it with me in the toyota as far as the new car park just off rama iv near the link road and walked from there rounding three blocks to make sure of security bangkok is a city whose temples have towers of gold and there are men of subtle style who must choose gold cloth for the adornment of their ritual i made my way to the condemned building like an unsuccessful salesman a roll of cheap carpet under my arm the schedule my last meeting with loman before the day of the action took place at midnight on the th he was much affected by the news that had gone out on the radio a few hours earlier in the sultry heat of the warehouse he looked cold and as he talked to me his white face floated against the colors of the hanging kites his eyes were bright but the rest of the polish had gone it had been rubbed off over the days by the gradual realization of what he had set in train when he had first proposed to the bureau in london that he should personally direct an agent to combat the assassination threat and that the agent should be myself loman had handled big operations involving the life and death of men who worked for him and the fact that three of his agents had lost their lives under his direction was to his credit a less brilliant officer would have suffered greater losses in the achievement of similar ends he had taken risks personal and physical risks in the actual field and had proved his ordinary courage as distinct from the extraordinary courage of responsibility to those men whom he sent out on missions known to be grossly dangerous but he had never exposed himself to the risk of failing in a mission that had to be carried through in the glare of international limelight and that concerned the safety of a man whose death would grievously shock the whole of the civilized world the effects of even a big intelligence operation are never dramatic except to those who are immediately involved the public reads that a russiancanadian wheat deal has fallen through that the us has withdrawn one of her nuclear submarine bases from spain that general x has resigned his post as coordinator to the combined services division the public is not told that such events are often the outcome of intelligence missions and that the success of a given mission had depended upon the illegal duplicating of a certain document or a journey by an unknown man across a certain frontier with a microdot apparatus strapped beneath the chassis of his car or the placing of a bangdestruction unit inside the cupboard where a certain foreign office messenger keeps his dispatch bag it may happen that the unknown man crossing the frontier is arrested searched and detained and is subsequently shot dead trying to escape a bangdestruction unit has twice been known to start a major fire and burn the building down small beer the world goes on with its turning the mission inaugurated by loman was unique worse he was in the field with it worse still he had persuaded the bureau to let firm mount a routine operation that really belonged to other parties and had then been himself persuaded by a wildcat agent to sanction homicide as the mainspring of the most sensitive operation he had ever been presented with the polish was gone the shine was off the plum and the fruit was bitter his own fault have you been tunedin he asked me somberly i said i had since yesterday my intelligence sources lad been implemented by a pocketsize transistor and i had sat with it in the quiet of the condemned building with the volume turned right down and the speakergrill pressed against my ear there was an hourly broadcast every day until midnight giving the latest details of the official arrangements and there were clues to be had no plans were as yet definite but there were some significant pointers buried among the handouts the staff of the childrens hospital were looking very spruce in their new uniforms as a result of the charity drive butri and kaewsanan two of thailands champion boxers had been engaged in an entertaining series of training fights for the past few days a visit to the childrens hospital would include rajvithit road a stop at the lumpini boxing stadium would take in part of rama iv it was bad security on the part of the authorities and i was grateful i still had to know the itinerary before we could be certain the setup would work the main item of news had come in at pm tonight prince udom had been taken ill whats your reaction loman asked me does it make any difference prince udom was to have accompanied the person in the motorcade sitting at his side in the cadillac either hes got cold feet or the governments put pressure on him to keep out of danger since hes a minister and the strong man of the cabinet in either case the palace fears an attempt i looked at him in the dim light you must be pretty far gone the palace fears an attempt were better informed ive seen the gun delivered and located the sniping post and got a picture of the man whos going to do the job are you worried because the palace fears what we know i mean he said bleakly that it wont make things easier for us if the general alarm sets in they might decide to change the itinerary thered be some point to that if we knew what the itinerary was we know come on then it will go via the link road thank christ so it was on the setup would work the rendezvous was safe the temple the condemned building kuo the husqvarna the gold cloth and the cheap carpet and the flowers and the crowd and with luck the overkill i asked him how did you get it loman from pangsapa he had an odd look in his eyes because of the way id spoken id sounded jubilant why shouldnt i it was what i was here for kuo he made contact loman said he gave me the whole route anything else one item he reports that another man has joined the kuo cell total of seven let em all come i should have given it thought i didnt i was too busy feeling cocky kicking my heels what was pangsapas price he didnt ask for payment civil of him pangsapa had a nose for a bargain it would pay him to keep in with us and share the success it would cost us nothing but the slight trouble afterward of confirming officially that he had helped to safeguard the guest of his own beloved country loman wasnt the only one eager for honors but pangsapa would use them to gain favor in high places inspection of his shipments would become perfunctory he urged me to keep him in contact with us loman said so that he can signal further information as soon as he has any all right i said but dont lead him to me dont let him know where i am look out for tags he hung one on me when i left his office two days ago and i had to flush him dont let him crash the party what about scarface did you warn her off me she wasnt outside when i looked for her you bet she wasnt i found she was tagging me as soon as you bet she was hoping youd lead her back to me at some new place where we thought wed be safe i just led her to the embassy he added reflectively shes with mil you know shes what someone tipped me off mil is protecting the bureau from what from precisely what he said tonelessly we dont know thats just it we dont know jesus christ the blind leading the blind but something warned me i was too jubilant too cocky everything was set up the rendezvous kuo the husqvarna but there was this thing this damned thing that didnt fit into any pattern at all i dont like mysteries the bounce had gone out of me like poor old loman i was sobering up from kuo i asked him what does mil think it can protect me from the kuo cell you are in no danger from kuo he is in danger from you all right what are they trying to protect me from the colored kites hung motionless muffling any echo but it seemed my question echoed and i wished i could have bitten it back i was getting too interested in my own skin getting frightened because there was something i didnt know about couldnt recognize couldnt fit in with known patterns stomachthink unhealthy let fear take over and youre in the worst danger of all danger from yourself there was only kuo i had to deal with and he was a sitting duck whatever it was that i didnt know about wasnt important it seemed important just because i didnt know about it turn the bloody thing inside out make it make sense rationalize brainthink it out and forget it there are always areas of the unknown in any operation you start your mission and you light your lamps as you go picking your way through the dark making your journey from lamp to lamp and never looking back but there are patches of dark and you skirt them have to because your lamps are too small to show you everything they light only the way the kites hung without moving their shapes strange and their colors garish and meaningless those nearest me were welldefined identifiable the others gathered behind them in the deeper gloom were the hosts of the unknown i must needs take comfort in the ancient lore of my trade fear springs from imagination and without imagination we cannot survive loman hadnt answered me it didnt matter the question shouldnt have been asked i said lets have the dope schedule people so forth very well he looked more confident this was his home ground the schedule remains unchanged the person will arrive in bangkok tomorrow at hours in an aircraft of the queens flight captained by jf wooldridge on board will be wing commander gmg thompson medical officer rear admiral charles nixonthorpe superintendent forsythe and inspector lw johns special branch larry johns theyd blown up a river police launch from under us on the estuary thing in what was he doing shepherding vips the plane will be met by the following hrh prince ruchirawong foreign minister marshal sumate photicharoen governor of bangkok general luen punnaken of the army air marshal gorinajdela admiral suwannasorn sir william coleverity british ambassador others present will you be there of course is that when you start calling me up he had sold me the idea of a twoway radio to keep me in touch with what went on since radios can become jammed inadvertently i had insisted on a failsafe in lumpini park a boy with a kite he said they leave the airport at arriving at the palace at that is when youll receive my introductory signal leaving the palace after luncheon the person arrives at the embassy at he will stop there for fifteen minutes to congratulate the ambassadors staff on the success of british week he will therefore leave the embassy at and take the shortest route to rama iv by lumpini park turning right toward the link road no stops no he drew a breath and got it over quickly the motorcade will arrive at the link road at or thereabouts ten minutes to four the rendezvous thered be a bit of heathaze but less exhaust gas than there was normally because traffic would have been stopped it wasnt a bad time of day for the job i looked at my watch fair enough fifteen hours from now then youre off the hook the mission will be over he replied thinly whichever way it goes ill tell you which way itll go you havent pushed me up and down every bloody street in this town for nothing one fine day youll get your medal loman he didnt answer his anxiety even inhibited anger i asked him only one thing left what reactions have they been getting from the person theyve had a lot of trouble with him of course hes very difficult to handle in a case like this he has refused to let them put any of the shields on the car rear plastic quarterlight including that it was important the rear shield would cover a following shot if for any reason at all kuo failed to make a kill headon the oriels formed a ring round the temple and there was a gallery inside and he could move round within a hundred and eighty degrees if he had to no shield no cover i said then i wont have to miss he looked away the subject was distasteful to him then he shouldnt mix with the wrong people i said why didnt the palace override his orders they tried the king had given instructions about shields but the person got wind of it and wrote him a private letter the gist of it was a reminder that his majesty had been pleased to drive through the city of london in an open car at the time of his state visit the letter suggested that the rigors of an english april were surely more treacherous to the health than any inclemency to be expected in the city of bangkok public relations stuff no the letter was vouched for you know how private a letter is once the tenth secretary has passed it on for filing besides its typical of the person he put his feelings in a nutshell for the evening standard when he said i want to be able to see the people and some of them may want to see me behind the whole story is of course a very definite request no shields and behind that decision is his personal view of the situation he feels he will best serve his country by demonstrating that anonymous threats are for the wastepaper basket he looked down at his feet i rather wish we werent quite so responsible for the safety of quite so good a man ive told you i said id do it for the postman his bright eyes came at me again but its a matter of consequences isnt it you must have given it some thought all right you tell me youve got one foot in the embassy and the other in london what are the consequences if we miss another sarajevo i dont know almost petulantly he said ive never worked in an area of which ive known so little well know a bit more tomorrow his mouth quivered silently blocked by a rush of too many words he was really very cross with me he finally managed to speak i wish i had your limited view quiller my views limited by crossed hairs in a circle someones got to concentrate on that you look after the consequences while i pop the weasel then there wont be any how much he asked me as if id never spoken do you think kuo will be paid if he succeeds he doesnt work that way the cost of a dead body is a few bob and the cost of a bullet is a few pence its the setup thats expensive and the fees already in his pocket id put it at five hundred thousand pounds loman nodded who can afford a sum like that only a government thats why i cant ignore the question of consequences i turned away from him he could stay awake all night if he wanted to i had to be fresh for the job worry it i said turning again and watching him from a little distance worry it out ive got my limited view all i need to know is that the consequences of crooking the index finger are a hole in a skull he didnt answer i shall always remember him standing there among the colored kites fearful and bright of eye wondering what hed got into and wondering how to get out it was easier for me and my terms were simpler a dog hungered for dog goodnight loman it was the last time i saw him before the kill the setup one of the vital duties of an intelligence officer is to see that the agent he is directing in the field is left unworried by every aspect of the mission that does not directly concern him thus loman had angered me because he had broken this rule and tried to saddle me with considerations of the consequences but i knew that subconsciously he was rationalizing and that the real basis of his fear was more personal more intimate and more closely concerned with my precise operation than any general thoughts on wide scale repercussions he was worried because i had to kill i might fail to kill i might kill for nothing and whichever way it went he was going to lose because one of those things was going to happen that was why he had immediately refused to sanction my proposed operation when i put it to him in our room in soi suek and why i had to work on him so hard to make him finally agree he knew at the outset that one of those three things was going to happen and his real struggle had been to decide whether it was worth it i dont think he ever reached a conclusion he reached a decision to sanction my proposal but he was never certain how much it would be worth letting me do what i wanted he brought me to the day of the th in the hope and nothing more than the hope that we would be proved right in allowing the mission to swerve into this new and very dangerous direction that was why he had talked about consequences the last time i saw him before the action but i think he meant the consequences to us not to the broad southeast asian scene my proposal could not have been more simple it comprised seven factors with two corollaries although there was a threat to assassinate a british subject the responsibility for his protection rested with the thai government those few british groups who were able to set up collateral protection were the special branch protection officers security mil and fringe departments at the british embassy bangkok and they would work on their own according to the longestablished tradition of interservices rivalry loman and i could not even through our bureau in london convince either the thai security forces or the british groups of the danger to be expected from kuo because it would imply lack of efficiency on their part further we did not exist therefore it would be similar to an unknown herbalist seeking to advise a panel of harley street surgeons for the same reasons that the bureau does not exist we could do nothing officially we could not warn advise or call upon anyone at all anywhere supposing for a moment that we could warn colonel ramin of the danger expected from kuo he might feel disposed to hunt him and arrest him on suspicion but from my intimate knowledge of kuo gained during many days of observation and conclusions it would then be left to one or more of his cell to proceed with their plans for the assassination and colonel ramin would not even concern himself since the chief danger would seem to have been eliminated by kuos arrest therefore we had no hope of invoking colonel ramins cooperation to any useful effect it was point less to insist that he take action against kuo because if he took action the danger would remain it was to be hoped that the thai home office departments security cid and metropolitan police plus the small british groups offering collateral protection would succeed in stopping an assassination attempt but if they failed we would try to prevent it by a lastditch action the two corollaries were lomans ability to sanction homicide was by virtue of the fact that the bureau does not exist discipline within its own walls is uncompromising but it is not officially responsible to any department or minister it can operate only on the understanding that it fills a gap in the intelligence complex that it takes no action without the most serious prethinking and that if an action falls outside the dictates of national and international law it will guarantee to face the consequences in the event of exposure and will involve no one else there are many reasons why the existence of the bureau is officially denied but the most important reason is that it sometimes resorts to illegal methods for the sake of expediency these include homicide given that loman as my intelligence director was able to consider sanctioning an act of homicide it could not take the form of random murder on the principle that we suspected kuo to have arrived in bangkok for the purpose of assassination i could have killed him out of hand before now up to the time of his going to ground there had been many opportunities but loman had rightly made the proviso that if we were to kill a man we must kill him in the very act of attempting the thing we had to prevent otherwise we would never be sure of our moral right to do it there was only one time then and one place where he should be killed at what i had now come to think of as the rendezvous a word expressing both a time and a place summarizing my proposal to loman was that if all else failed and it was up to us to stop an assassination we must let kuo plan his setupand perfect it so that once his finger was on the trigger there would be no time for him to put a reserve plan into operation it was feasible that he could post a guard inside the doorway of the temple so that even if colonel ramin decided to search the place and arrest kuo at the fiftyninth minute as the motorcade entered the link road the guard could make a prearranged signal to a reserve marksman in the area who was briefed to shoot in those circumstances that would be a professional setup and kuo was a professional regardless of whatever action both the thai and british protection groups would take there was only one method that was a hundred per cent certain to shoot first and at the last minute in three major waves of arrests the police had neutralized upward of two hundred known agitators subversive elements and communist agents as part of their drive against crime today on the morning of the th a thousand police were combing five thousand unoccupied rooms along the motorcade route uncountable bouquets of flowers would be examined for hidden bombs but the only certainty lay in an overkill loman was worried because in sanctioning my proposal he was going to let one of three things happen if i killed kuo it would be a premeditated act and if i were caught and put on trial i would have to involve others in my defense however indirectly in order to plead justifiable homicide and the bureau would be seen suddenly to exist and in the moment of its existence it would be blown apart if i failed to kill because of the heat haze or sweat on my finger or a fault in the mechanism of the gun the person would suffer public execution if i killed for nothing that is if kuo had arranged for a reserve marksman to take over regardless of what happened to kuo himself the person would still be shot dead loman had angered me by voicing his fears even though they were not his true fears he had angered me not by breaking a rule strictly enforced on intelligence directors in the bureau but by reminding me of my own fears the ones that were with me now as i crouched in the small high room of the condemned building the husqvarna across my knees let him be damned for that for me the day passed slowly through three stages during the first few hours of the morning the link road below my window looked fairly normal the only difference being that it was a national holiday and the pavements were filled with strollers at eleven oclock i heard the news on my transistor the main item was that prince udom had passed a comfortable night but was expected to be confined to his bed for several days his place beside the distinguished visitor was to be taken by hrh prince rajadhon who was on leave from his studies at basel university in order to participate in the palace receptions the news contained an announcement of the definite itinerary of the motorcade it was the first time the exact route had been made public and within half an hour the strollers on the pavement below the condemned building had grown thicker and the police began setting up guardropes on each side of the road motorcycle patrols were now slowing the traffic because of danger to the crowds halfway between the condemned building and the temple the link road curved at a boomerang angle of some and the people pressed more thickly at that point because it offered a better view the street looked pretty flags flowers bunting women in silk soon after two oclock the traffic was diverted along rama iv and the link road was quiet except for the voices of the crowd a chapter of brahman priests made a patch of bright yellow among the other colors the sun was hot and parasols opened like big flowers softdrinks men worked their way through small children were delighted as their fathers lifted them to let them look the police moved systematically taking the bouquets from some of the women and weighing them briefly handing them back firstaid men of the thai red cross had posted themselves at intervals along the guardropes i heard a door open below me in the building i had been listening for it and went along to the elevator their voices were amplified by the central well of the staircase and other doors banged as they began searching the second floor i went into the elevator there was no electric power in the place it had been cut off when the building was marked down for demolition but i had tested the manual emergency handle the day before and now i turned it winding the elevator down to the blank walls between the fifth and sixth floors all my gear was with me leaving the room bare for the inspection cheap carpet sleeping bag tripod and camera field glasses and gun it looked like a secondhand store i waited their footsteps echoed sharply on the stairs they opened every door calling to one another they were part of the army of a thousand police who were searching five thousand uninhabited rooms in buildings along the route colonel ramin was being very thorough the blanket operation of a fullscale search is typical police routine and in most cases it is of value even on this day it had a certain advantage the colonel would be able to claim later that his men had searched every room they reached the top floor i stood watching one of the elevator cables which was frayed two strands had parted the ends curling in the bottom of each curl was a crescent of dust and plaster congealed by the damp that had leaked through the roof the cable would never be repaired now they were taking their time the heat was stifling but it was a stray thought that made the sweat spring would the emergency handle still work all right when they had gone how much would the southeast asian complex of warbrink policies be affected by one man getting stuck in an elevator they were checking every room my watch said and loman would be calling again in ten minutes if the schedule were running to time i felt for the onoff switch of the twoway radio again to make sure lomans voice couldnt come through that was bad you shouldnt have to check things more than once at a time when the nerves ought to be at their optimum pitch about twothirds up the scale in the heat i could smell the oil on the mechanism of the gun a sound came and one of them opened the metal doors above me on the sixth floor to see if anyone were on the top of the elevator they didnt see anyone so they shut the gates thoroughness is an admirable quality i had been thorough too there was a main emergency handle in the elevator well at ground level for winding it up and down and yesterday i had taken the grub screw out the first of them began going back to the stairs and when the rest followed i looked at my watch again we were running it close for lomans next call the main exit doors were slamming shut and i waited another minute and then grasped the handle overcoming the half second of irrational fear that it wouldnt work and wound the elevator back to the top floor a lot of the stuff could stay where it was all i needed was the carpet the tripod and the gun the jupiters gave x magnification and the balvar scope was only x but since first light this morning i had stopped using the field glasses so that i could get used to the scope it was the scope that would give me my last sight of him the second stage of the day now began the police had made their search and the main doors below had been shut yesterday i had made a hole in the plaster above the door of my room with a rusty nail and now i hung up the cheap carpet this was sufficient the sound of the report would be trapped before it reached the ground floor inside the building the main doors would provide additional silencing most of the sound would remain trapped in the room itself because the husqvarna would be mounted far back from the window the residual sound would be diffused in the open air impossible to place because of the height of the window from the street the second stage of the day was easier than the first there had been a lot of lastminute doubts to cope with mentally and they had been worrying until i caught the first sign of movement in the middle oriel of the phra chula chedi with the husqvarna resting on the camera tripod i took three sightings within half an hour the details of his face were blurred by the heat haze but every time he stopped moving i found i could keep the point of the crosshairs within the target area the face and head when the time came he would be perfectly still in the same attitude as i the most worrying doubt was now eliminated the rendezvous would be kept loman had called me up for the first time at one oclock from that moment the whole mission suddenly became real for me and i understood the measure of the thing he had taken on last night in the kite warehouse i hadnt grasped it all he said on the radio was he has arrived at the palace until that moment the bureaus th directive hadnt been much more than a theoretical exercise a practice operation interesting but without substance the person was very much a part of his official background a public figure pursuing his onerous affairs for the public good essentially a londoner his image inseparable from the image of tall gates and monuments westminster and the mall london was a far cry from this city of golden towers where the petals of magnolia fell to the monsoon wind but suddenly he was here among us and the theory and practice took on substance and the mission was thrust into our hands cold hard and uncompromising as a cocked gun overkill isolated in the small high room of the condemned building i was kept in touch with events by the transistor and twoway radio a general report was now in from loman and it added a few details to the public announcements it was as follows the arrival of the person at don muang airport was without incident he looked very fit and said he was delighted to see the sunshine there was great enthusiasm from a large crowd the police were present in strength it was confirmed that forsythe and johns of the special branch were accompanying the person prince rajadhon was among the official welcoming party and it was therefore certain that he would take his place beside his distinguished guest in the public procession details of this had now been made official the motorcade would be led by ten motorcycle outriders of the bangkok metropolitan police traveling in the royal car would be the person prince rajadhon the british ambassador the first counselor of the british embassy and two bodyguards of the kings household the second and third cars would contain ministers equerries and security men the central section of the motorcade would be flanked by twelve outriders and there would be a rear guard of fifteen motorcycle police all officers would be armed some time before my building was entered and searched there had been a further signal from loman and for the first time there was the suggestion of nerves in his voice the motorcade has just left the palace and is now heading north toward rajdamnoen central avenue it was from that point that the worst of the waiting began it was broken up by the police search of the building but once i had gone back to my room and fixed the carpet over the door there was nothing else to do when i switched on the twoway radio again it was apparent that loman had been trying to signal me quitter can you go ahead i said thered been fright in his tone he must have thought the radio had packed up is everything in order still talked like a bloody textbook yes police have made their search on my own now and all set there was silence and then he came in again his tone a bit steadier fiveminute halt at government house next halt will be at the embassy i said all right and cut the switch the sound of the crowd floated up on the warm air it was like a vast aviary the womens voices pitched sharply the children piping now and then in little bird cries it was odd not to hear the traffic i kept away from the window now when i took a sighting through the balvar scope it picked up movement at once in the oriel of the temple he still had the smoked glasses on i had never seen him without them i wondered how he was feeling he was a professional and hed done this before but he was putting something like half a million on one shot and that would be important to him there would be time to get in a second and even a third even with a boltaction but it was the first that would count because it would be unhurried a slow sure pull against the springs a second or third shot would be affected by the knowledge of a miss a nervous block difficult to get through because the aim had to be better not just as good he wouldnt miss he was kuo the mongolian there would be a period of some ten seconds in which he and i must operate the signal sounded and i cut in can you hear me quiller go ahead the motorcade has arrived at the embassy they will be here for fifteen minutes after ten minutes from now at i want you to keep open for me please acknowledge keep open from will do i cut him out i didnt like the sound of his voice it wasnt just speaker distortion there was that scream of fright trying to push out past every word a period yes of some ten seconds in which kuo and i must operate it would begin when he sighted the vanguard of police outriders coming into the link road and it would end when the leading car of the motorcade was lost from his sight below the trees of the temple gardens putting it more precisely the period of time was for me alone narrowed down to about half because i would wait until he raised his gun i had decided on that without reference to loman without reference to anything really it seemed good manners msieur tirez le premier or try the noise of the crowd was making me restive i wanted to look down from the window to look at the road where it curved through the gay colors of the silks and the flowers and the parasols i mustnt go near the window the room was very hot and i had to keep wiping my hands from the back of the room all i could see was the great gold dome of the phra chula chedi brilliant against the afternoon sky and the ring of oriels loman came through without a signal because i had done what hed asked and kept open from can you hear me go ahead he had to talk slowly it didnt fool me a dog has a nose for the smell of fear he is just getting into the car prince rajadhon following i could hear the crowd in the background now the ambassador two muffled reports the car doors shutting the motorcade is moving off it was i said all right loman its over to me now he began saying something but i cut the switch eight or nine minutes to go speed would be twentyfive miles per hour or thereabouts plern chit road turning right down vithayu and past the arabian embassy crowds lining the route all the way spanish embassy flags flowers people clapping japanese embassy children being lifted so that they could see the distinguished man who had come such a long way to visit them netherlands embassy firstaid parties pressing a gangway for a fainting case american embassy the softdrinks men profiting from the heat the thirst the excitement lumpini park i had already moved to the side of the room and could see the trees of the park and above them the fragile shape of the kite yellow with a blue cross unsteady because there was only a low breeze across the open space of the lawns but lifting higher all the time in little jerks the heat seemed worse and the handkerchief was damp from wiping my hands three minutes at the most four i could see part of the link road below the building patches of color parasols an ambulance moving very slowly in reverse down the side road stopping when it reached the back of the crowd a man selling balloons a false alarm there always is the roof of a police car mistaken for the vanguard of the motorcade the voice of the crowd rising in a sudden wave subsiding about a minute the mission had seemed very long all those weeks living in the toyota living with the jupiters learning him like a brother soon we would be strangers sound came from the distance clapping cheering at first faint loudening so i moved round to the back of the room and wiped the sweat from my hands for the last time wrists palms between the fingers carefully between the fingers of the right hand there was a flat square top to the tripod with a setscrew proud in the center to take the camera and i had put a cloth pad over it with elastic bands the blue steel barrel of the husqvarna had left its impression on the pad from previous sightings i raised the husqvarna and laid the barrel across the pad and flicked the safety catch off the smell of the machine oil was strong a good smell clean and efficient the sound of the crowd was rising in a slow wave from the distance and the people directly below the condemned building began calling his name and i had the crosshairs centered dead on the face in the oriel his gun came up and i saw the long glint of the barrel and my finger took up the tension of the preliminary spring and went on squeezing and when the big husqvarna kicked i kept the sights on the target and saw redness color the face and head but something was wrong because the crowd had begun screaming and i knew that id killed for nothing because something was wrong down there shock burnt cordite reeked in the room and my head still rang from the explosion when i looked down from the window they were still screaming and the change in their sound was terrible seconds ago they had been calling his name and now they cried out in agony it was impossible to focus on details but the overall scene had the dreadful clarity of a slowmotion picture the vanguard escort of ten motorcycle police had rounded the degree curve in the road but the royal car had run straight on to plunge into the crowd and the wall of living bodies had been breached before its momentum was arrested the long white cadillac was halted now in the midst of the swaying people the vanguard escort was wheeling and coming back the motorcycle police on the left flank of the procession were sliding to a stop the first of these surprised by the course of the royal car had swung their machines flat onto their sides in an attempt to avoid ramming the crowd gasoline had spilled and a spark from the friction of metal against flint had fired a tank and the rider was rolling on the ground to put out the flames that had caught his uniform the right flank of the escort was halting and turning back two of the patrols colliding the second and third convertibles had slowed to a stop and the rear guard of fifteen police was pulling up stretcherbearers had already driven a lane through the stricken crowd from the ambulance near the curve and the ambulance itself was backing in their wake with both doors held wide open an intermittent buzz began on the floor beside me and i ignored it loman was trying to call me up on the twoway radio but there was nothing to tell him nothing that would make sense the police were first attacking the gasoline fire dragging the overturned machines clear before another tank went up other riders were pressing their way along the front of the crowd and trying to force them back from the flame area but the crowd was helpless cut off from escape by its own mass the ministers and equerries were getting out of the two convertibles to help the police sirens began sounding from the distance beyond the temple as the nearest firefighting unit was called into action the sun made everything bright and the colors of the crowd were gay flags flowers women in silk the flutter of parasols the screams still came even from the top floor of the condemned building i could not see what was happening around the royal car because it lay buried in frenzied movement it seemed a long way to the elevator a long time tearing the carpet down from the door and wrenching at the handle the empty passage the metal gates i came back running knocking the glasses by accident against the door and lunging for the window kneeling there to focus them and swing the white cadillac into the center of the lens loman kept on signalling they had put out the flames fire foam smothered people and frothed across the roadway the chapter of brahman priests had made their way across and were helping the police only two men were still inside the royal car the driver in the front sitting motionless the other man slumped on the floor at the back even through the x jupiters i could not distinguish the whitedress tunic of prince rajadhon because the uniforms of the police were also white and the first of them had now reached the royal car the crowd was spilling through the broken guardropes and the roadway was inundated but for the lanes kept open for the bringing out of the injured two ambulances of the thai red cross were thrusting their way to the central area the screams had died away there was no more fire i picked the thing up and flicked the switch loman he asked what were those sirens he had been listening to them from the distance trying to get through to me i told him the car left the road and hit the crowd he said something i couldnt catch just god or something like that i went on talking a gasoline fire started but theyve got it dealt with a lot of injured and some dead it went straight into them there was an ambulance near the spot and its just leaving i cant see much detail when i cut him in he asked what happened to kuo hes dead the smell of the cordite was still in the air loman was silent there was a question he had to ask and it wanted courage it is always agreeable to make your report at the end of a successful mission the risks have been taken and the dangers are past and nothing can go wrong any more and you are still by luck alive in the sight of your director and the whole bureau you have scored a point in the sight of whatever paltry gods you call your own you have smashed a hand into the amorphous face of the enemy and earned a perch in whatever far heaven you can fleetingly believe in till it all begins again and your hand still bruised and bleeding must smash again into the same face and the same fear and show that the day for another day is yours yea even in your own sight the one that counts the most no go from where you are loman put his question can you see the person no another short silence ill get down to the link road contact later when i cut the switch i knew that the mission was over and that it had failed so the dog had eaten dog and to no purpose it crouched here licking its wounds in the small high room i could have stayed for a long time trying to think to piece together the smashed bits of a mission manque and set the record straight no one would have found me until they came to knock the building down but there were some bits missing and i had to go and pick for them among the rubble i put everything into the elevator with the rest the field glasses cheap carpet tripod gun the tools of my trade and went down by the stairs it is difficult to walk without thinking the bodys movement stirs the mind a few thoughts came there had been no accident but why had they taken so much trouble made it so elaborate perhaps to be certain only in the midst of a dense crowd made powerless by shock could they be absolutely certain of getting to him at close hand and killing him before his protectors could reach him eight bodyguards and thirtyseven armed police cut off from him by the living and the injured and the dying and the dead by one massive psychological barrier shock hadnt they been then certain of kuo of one straight shot from a master killer so many questions kuo would answer them it wasnt far to the phra chula chedi the temple with the golden dome the crowd was greater now because the link road was filling from both ends of the two masks humor has less appeal for the human heart than tragedy i picked and pressed my way broken parasols and a crushed bouquet a child crying a lost shoe a priest praying a torn paper flag vehicles moved through the narrow lane that had been the road the sirens had begun again and bells rang for gangway a crowd is a fever and will not abate until its course is run magnolia blossoms hung across the gates of the temple and the leaves gave shade the tall doors were open and there was no one inside the steps began near the great golden buddha and followed the curving wall and i climbed them through the cool shadows reaching the platform that spanned the base of the dome a spiral staircase twisted upward from the center and i climbed again sunlight lay in gold bars across the dark trellis ironwork of the stairs the murmur of the crowd was loudening as i neared the ring of oriels at every tenth stair i stopped and listened for any sound from inside the temple because they might come for him soon not knowing he was dead and unable to join them the sunlight struck in from the oriels and for a moment blinded me i had reached that part of the gallery that faced lumpini park and had to move round past five oriels before coming to the one that was directly opposite the condemned building then i looked down at the floor in compliance with the rules of international warfare the military bullet is manufactured with a full metal shield so that the lead tip is not exposed and so that no expansion occurs on striking the target the idea is that unnecessary pain should be avoided i had used a game bullet a highvelocity load with a blunt nose this type kills quickly by expanding on impact it provides greater shocking power and will drop an animal at once if accurately placed the disadvantage of a heavycaliber expanding bullet is that it will spoil the meat or spoil the hide i had used a grain game bullet to ensure a quick kill and this had been achieved but the effects of the expansion had left the face unrecognizable at the last minute before raising his gun he had taken off the smoked glasses they were folded neatly on the ledge of the oriel the sunshine fell across the light gray alpaca jacket and the polished shoes it was only the face that was out of character with so fastidious a man perhaps this was his true face bestial and bloodied the face of a jungle soul no longer disguisable by the tricks and artifice of civilized dress let it be said a soul not unlike my own it was only that our laws were different stepping over him to look at the gun i noticed that the gold cufflinks were missing the sleeves had ordinary buttons it was therefore becoming clear to me even before i took up the gun and examined it and the need to think and think straight was suddenly urgent the gun was a cheap thing a sixshot yungchow carbine with a redwood butt there was no time now to listen for any sound that might come from inside the temple and i bruised a shoulder on the top rail of the spiral staircase as i swung into it and dropped with my feet touching every third step and my hand hitting at the rail the beams of sunlight flashed across my eyes and the framework shivered under me until i reached the platform and ran for the curving steps that followed the wall below the dome the temple was still deserted but three priests in yellow robes stood at the gates in the shade of the magnolias and one of them stepped toward me thinking perhaps i was a thief disturbed but i ducked clear and reached the road still at a run and made for the bar on the other side seeing the telephone before there was need to ask for it all three lines were busy and i began redialing the numbers without a stop so that the moment a call ended id get my chance but it took a dozen gos and i had to stand there thinking about the mission reviewing the whole thing getting it into perspective his mission not mine kuos mission the one id never guessed at the one that hed so beautifully brought off you light your lamps as you go picking your way through the dark there are patches of dark and you skirt them have to because your lamps are too small to show you everything everything a line cleared at the embassy room i told them give me room the snatch i didnt want to talk to loman yet because he would have a lot of questions to ask and i wanted to be sure i knew the answers when i had given the signal to room i left the bar and walked along the link road the crowd had broken up but the roadway was still full of people talking about the accident the scene in the center was different now the police had made a barrier and there was a water cart at work where the royal car had come to a stop the last ambulance had gone steam rose as the sun began drying the water that streamed from the pavement onto the road the sense of shock still hung over the people and i passed women in tears their husbands comforting them those near the scene of the accident would not easily forget reporters were interviewing people and photographers hurried about there was no one anywhere near the condemned building because the crowd was still attracting people to the scene at the curve of the link road and i climbed to the top floor in the clammy heat looking down from the window of my room i composed the whole picture in terms of geometry findings kuos mission had been to place the shot loman and i had known that the shot was the pivot of the entire operation but after the shot had been placed the course of his mission had changed completely and this we had not known kuo was a professional and his intelligence was far beyond that required for the efficient handling of a rifle as precisely and as carefully as a rifle is pieced together from its components he had dovetailed every part of his mission with my own assembling a setup in which i took my place as obediently as if i were under his direct orders his mission was a total success and all i had to show for weeks of work was the dead man in the phra chula chedi the seventh man that pangsapa had told me about a man who was not kuo because he wore no cuff links and because his cheap yungchow carbine was a weapon that a marksman of kuos caliber would never demean himself to use all i had done was to kill a decoy while kuo placed his shot rage against ones own stupidity does no good but in the heat of the room i stood shivering there was a thumbtack stuck in the door of the kite warehouse so when i had dumped the useless tools of my trade i phoned varaphan in soi suek is the bloodstone ready for me there has been so little time everyone is always in such a hurry but you could make inquiries at our workshop if you are passing that way i decided to walk instead of taking a trishaw because the rage was still burning and i had to deal with it before i met loman cold thought was the only antidote there were five press vans parked outside the embassy and i had to show my pass so that the police could get me through the pack of reporters they flashed off pictures of me in case i was important caption the man who knew too little i got shunted into the cultural attache office again and the girl came in i hardly recognized her everything was the same beautiful walk good clothes an oddness to the left side of the face but her eyes flickered to the aftermath of shock and her voice had lost its certainty for the first time she looked like a woman instead of a mechanical goddess maybe i had changed too she took a few seconds to focus we stood listening to distant sounds phone bells and doors the sounds of a complacent embassy shaken to the core i said room yes she still didnt move or look away all the words she wanted to speak all the questions she wanted to ask were held silent in the flickering of her eyes did you manage to do anything i asked her it was her voice that had answered my call from the bar on the link road when id told them to get me room yes it came out in soft little jerks theyre making a priority search it was reported missing about a half hour before the motorcade started they needed a little persuading but i persuaded them she couldnt even stand still her nerves had set the whole line of her lean body trembling loman had said she was with mil they shouldnt have kids like this in their outfit because things were bound to break them up it was happening now i said are they going to use helicopters calling the army in its for them to work in their own way all i stressed was the importance of watching docks airports and the land routes to the laos frontier laos the quickest route to china loman might know i would ask him i said what have you told loman nothing what has he told you nothing wheres room ill show you it was an effort for her to look away from my face i followed her out to the corridor and we saw coleverity the ambassador surrounded by flapping minions a big man still in his ceremonial dress decorations gold epaulettes ashenfaced and halfshouting at them tell them its an emergency news blackout get that mob off the steps and block the switchboard outgoing calls only mcmahon come in here and bring straker with you they peeled off as he pushed open a door loman had come up from the other direction and he had the same look in his eyes and i knew now what was wrong with the girl and some of the rage came back for christs sake someones got to do it havent they loman took my arm and we went into room and he locked the door and i said thank christ shes gone theyre all the same they dont like it when they know theres been a killing even after two world wars they look at you as if its never been done before even when they know theres a bump on the program and youre the louse thats got to do it they look at you afterward as if youve just climbed out of a drain how did she know loman how much have you told her whats a mil trollop doing in our bloody woodshed sit down and control yourself you couldnt get rid of her could you is she your type or something stomach full of adrenalin full of acid sweating like a pig a feeling of great age responsibility failure and defeat getting old too old for it he went on waiting leaning by the window looking down at his shoes i went twice round the room looking at nothing and trying to think of a word one word that would tell him what i thought of his talent as an intelligence director and what i thought of the crowd out there in the link road where the water cart was washing away the blood and what i thought of a mission that had run smash into ruins because we couldnt even handle a monkeysized mongolian thug whose answer to everything was a bullet there wasnt a word for all that when you are ready he said his calm helped the whole of the embassy was rocking under us but he was calm did you go down to the link road i asked him my voice sounded quiet maybe the contrast maybe id been shouting yes what did you see i couldnt get near anything so i arranged for you to meet me here and came along to wait so you dont know anything no perhaps you will tell me it was a snatch he came away from the window and by the look on his face i could see that he really hadnt known he said softly do you mean the person is still alive i tell you it was a snatch he was never in the sights it was the driver they shot in the face of his surprise i felt suddenly in control and for the first time saw the room in detail and took an interest in it because i had to orientate find bearings relearn the familiar white paint frescoed ceiling blue carpet companymeeting table chairs telephone ashtrays a sunny room hospitalclean the kind of place you always hope youll be taken to after the accident that was in a way the way it was go on he said i took action as soon as i knew it was no good telling ramins bunch so i got to a phone and asked for room and the girl answered i told her to get a dragnet put out for the ambulance anyone here could use more pressure than i could they could make it an embassy alert call ambulance loman said it was difficult to remember that in the instant of firing the husqvarna i had been as ignorant as he was now and that it was only by going to look at the dead man in the phra chula chedi that id been able to see the whole picture they got him away in an ambulance i said look ill give you the setup his setup kuos hes moved into the snatch game the person wasnt down for killing somebody wants him dont ask me what for and theyve got him we worked on the premise that he was the target of the kuo gun and he wasnt the target was the driver of the cadillac and he was shot dead precisely where the road curved so that the car would just run straight on into the crowd then they did the snatch you imagine the confusion three tons at twentyfive miles an hour ramming into living people i saw the driver myself still at the wheel and a man slumped in the back both dead loman asked how was the other man killed i dont know it wasnt with a second shot kuo shot once id have heard a second shot i didnt hear the first one because it was covered by the sound of my own bound to be because we were both operating within a period of a few seconds and it was a few seconds before i got my hearing back even if id heard his shot i would have thought it was an echo of mine where did he shoot from look i said impatiently and hit the table with the flat of my hand heres the temple heres the condemned building link road between them get out of your mind for a minute that the target was the driver suppose as we did suppose that the target was the person the car is running almost headon toward the temple and its a perfect site for a marksman because the visual effective speed is about five miles per hour instead of twentyfive from the temple you could shoot the person because he was sitting in the back on a seat raised nine inches you couldnt shoot the driver because he was behind the windshield you could only shoot someone in the back over the windshield i knew this its simple geometry i didnt question it but i would have questioned it if id known the target was the driver he was here then kuo his polished nails flashed in the light as he tapped the table somewhere in this area near the condemned building you could only shoot the driver from behind same data car moving tailon visual effective speed five miles per hour instead of twentyfive and no windshield in the way he went back to the windows maybe it was all he wanted to know it wasnt all i wanted to tell him for gods sake loman if theyd meant to shoot the person theyd have done it shot him cold and we couldnt have done a thing about it not a damned thing about it cant you get that id lost it again and the room span and i heard him saying hes alive and thats what matters shot him cold in front of our bloody eyes youll have to get over that voice coming closer talked like a bloody governess there are more things i want to know quiller london will ask for a very full report who was the man you who was the man in the temple pox on london id knocked something over bits on the blue carpet an ashtray who was the man in the temple eyes very bright the room steadied what i dont know the seventh man pangsapa told us a decoy id have to watch it always a strain knowing youve got to do a bump even when you know its an overkill and always a strain by god when you see the whole mission go smash for all the effort youve made brains got to go on ticking or youve had it he wasnt one of the original kuo cell i said no kuo uses picked men he wouldnt waste one look i keep telling you i had to stop and think i havent told you listen loman there are some bits i dont understand yet i dont suppose they matter i found i was sitting in one of the chairs they were on to me very early knew i was tagging them for some reason they didnt do anything about it thats one of the bits i dont understand maybe it was orders from on high that girls always talking about china does that mean anything to you china you put his fee at five hundred thousand pounds he said remember he was down on his haunches arms on his knees hands folded together perched in front of me not letting me get away or think about anything else only a government could afford that but i dont know anything about china particularly they were on to you very early well they could have put me in the crosshairs a dozen times i knew that but when they missed the first few chances i didnt worry any more christ dyou think id have stood in front of an open window like that at the pakchong hotel with the light on and dark outside id taken damn good care believe me before i knew they were letting the chances go look i dont mind what risks i take providing theres they were on to you very early you said all right i shut my eyes they werent certain of me till kuo went to ground then i had to show my hand went into the lotus bar other places all over the bloody town brothels the lot then they knew i was interested but they still didnt take a crack at me you knew that loman when you told me that mil was protecting me i asked you what the hell they were meant to be protecting me from kuo you said i wasnt in any danger from kuo dead correct but i was being a nuisance to them so they began fitting the two missions together his and mine they let me pick up their track gave me a man to tag led me to a hotel let me tag their car down rama iv made a show of being worried when i got into their mirror i knew where they were going where they were taking the roll of gold cloth because id haunted the bloody place for days the phra chula chedi and theyd seen me haunting it when i that isnt sufficient he got up from his crouch and walked about a lot youre filling in gaps making things fit all right theres a gap a big one but somehow they knew my setup they knew i was going for an overkill ive tried till im sick to find out how they dont worry it quiller well find out go on ive finished no you havent oh for gods sake i got out of the chair and fiddled with the telephone cord i suppose they knifed them the man in the back driver was shot man in the back was knifed so was the other one the other bodyguard gasoline on fire people lying crushed under the wheels you could have got away with anything they couldnt have planned the fire no but the rest was enough i twisted the telephone cord garroting my wrist we dont know how many dead do we i think hes a bit of a shit and im keeping my gun the husqvarna never know your luck he was standing close to me again i must ask you to make your report a little more precisely you propose that the kuo cell six of them four operators and two bodyguards had an ambulance waiting at the spot and brought stretchers ostensibly to remove the dead and injured and that in the confusion knifed the two guards in the royal car knocked the person down hit him behind the knees rabbitpunch as he fell and took him to the ambulance with a blanket over him and drove off tell me how else they did it the cord had left a weal on my wrist it was probably like that the police couldnt have reached the scene the immediate scene in time to realize what was happening and those in the car wouldnt have gone on sitting there like dummies with people all round them in agony they would have climbed from the car to help even knowing that their driver had been shot dead it was a nightmare the perfect setting for an abduction the cell would have trained for weeks hes a professional listen loman how much chance have we got of what i would like you to do is to pick up where you left off you say that they laid a false trail for you letting you see the gun being delivered to the temple and letting you see kuo himself at the oriel more than once i take you to mean that you said they began fitting the two missions together tell me how else oh i accept most of what you say its glaringly logical i am only trying to help you complete the picture well thats it his calmness was beginning to stink the mission was over and it had failed but the person hadnt been shot dead so everything was all right now and loman could go home and make his report tell london i said and dont forget the cost of the thumbtacks or they wont sleep to continue he said equably you believe they set up a decoy for you a live dummy you could shoot at the seventh man who joined the cell late why to keep me out of their way to stop me finding out their real setup to keep me busy fiddling while the whole of bloody rome was burning down why why did they want to keep you busy to keep you alive instead of killing you off in the early stages how the hell do i know we were facing each other without meaning to both of us wandering round the damned room looking at nothing coming up against each other perhaps you were wanted too as well as the person i stared at him then why didnt they come and get me perhaps they will he said newsbreak i went on staring at him now but its over for gods sake theyve made a perfect snatch he turned away with distaste in view of the persons standing i do wish you would refer to it as an abduction my laugh exploded unreal like the squawk of a mechanical doll abduction i said abduction trying to make sense of the word listen what would they want me for bumping that thug the decoy he was just a hired tool a live dummy set up as a target for me you think he meant anything to kuo there must have been ten killed in that crowd and the decoy meant as little to kuo as any one of them do you really believe he swung round on me suddenly that they would have set up such an elaborate device to prevent your defeating their mission unless someone had given the most express orders that your life was not to be taken havent you admitted that they could have killed you time and time again all right but now he didnt answer and i had time to think it had all gone so damned fast and there were things i hadnt been able to see things in the background that had formed the overall pattern while all i could think of was getting my eye in the balvar sight and my finger on the tit listen to me quiller the room seemed to have gone cold and my head was clearing as if a fever were dying out the thing had looked so big because someone as big as the person was involved beyond it was there something bigger this was why the bureau made it a rule the intelligence director tries to ensure that his agent in the field is left free of all information that doesnt directly concern his mission the ferret is sent into the hole and he is not told about the dog at the other end listen to me he said again you have been concentrating on a very limited and very calculated operation you have had no time to think beyond the simple mechanics that is understandable but before long youll realize theres a very big question left in the air why has the person been abducted id never thought about it he knew it and left me hooked on it because it was important for me to get it into my head or he wouldnt have sprung it after a bit he went on i have made little or no contact here with the official embassy staff or with the fringe groups operating under its aegis vinia maine has told me nothing about her cell or about her mission but one picks up signs here and there and for your information i would say this mil is running a special operation the subject of which is yourself you have been under close observation and protection since you flew in from paris you will remain under observation and protection until the kuo mission is completed and that wont be until the person has left thailand still under restraint and duress the kuo cell has taken great pains to see that you stay alive and they havent done that for humanitarian reasons or do you think so i thought of the water cart busily cleaning up not really no he suddenly began speaking softly and urgently the ambassador is now back from the link road as you know he was on the spot when the person was abducted and he will by now have heard that your signal to room has warned the police into action he will follow that up very hard further in a few hours when the new blackout is lifted the bombshell will burst over england the news that the person is missing and believed to be in danger enormous pressure will be brought to bear on thailand to redeem its failure in protecting a most distinguished visitor the hunt will be mounted on a vast scale he paused and i said nothing my head was now perfectly lucid the feverish residue of a concentrated inept and mucky operation had found its own level and my subconscious would have to deal with it as best it could brainthink was again available lomans bright stare was on me and his hands beat the air like trapped birds as he drummed into me the importance of what he was saying kuo will know what he is up against he wont have come to bangkok without having made the most meticulous plans to get out again with his prisoner his mission will be completed only when the person has been transferred from thailand to the soil of the country which mounted that mission and hired kuo to perform it he will almost certainly have to lie low in a prearranged place here in this city with his cell and with his prisoner for days or even weeks while the hunt passes overhead that will have been an alternative plan he turned away and when he spoke again i knew why he didnt like buttering lice to their face it will console you to know that i call it an alternative plan because he had probably counted on fast and immediate clearance which is no longer open to him it is unlikely that anyone would have realized that one of the dead bodies taken to the ambulance was in fact the persons there would have been ample time for that ambulance to reach a private airfield and take off for the frontier your call to room prevented it ambulances carry radio and this one which was almost certainly stolen would have monitored the policepatrol radio system they will have already heard of the search and will have gone to ground as the prearranged alternative to flying out he made a tour of the room and came up behind me i didnt turn round so he had to pass me and turn himself and face me again the compliments were over and we were both pleased the point is this quiller until such time as the kuo cell can get their prisoner to a frontier their mission is still running and your situation is unchanged from the signs i have picked up i think youll remain under the observation and protection of mil so that their mission is still running they are a rival group but we know they are far from idiots watching me he began nodding and his tone lost its headlong urgency you already see the point the kuo cell has so far left you alone and left you alive though of course im not saying you couldnt have survived any attack as an experienced agent should be able but up to now mil has thought that there is good reason for your having been shall we say preserved and as long as you are of interest to the kuo cell and to their operations our mission is still running and it wont finish until we know why the person has been abducted and why you appear to be linked with him as a subject for preservation it wont finish until we can restore him to safety if everyone else fails or until we too fail he left me again going to the windows vaguely i listened to the sounds outside the room bells doors slamming voices they were sounds of disorderliness and i was angry because i could have prevented all this and the bombshell that would soon break over england and the mess that the water cart had been clearing away how much did you already know loman his short body looked black silhouetted against the glare of the window he didnt turn round i had a lot of pieces but they wouldnt fit they would have fitted the theory of an abduction but we didnt consider that why should anyone abduct him but now most of it fits most of it one thing i want to know how did they find out my setup how did they know i was going to try for an overkill that is not for you to worry i thought of pangsapa again it didnt add up pangsapa had given us the motorcade route and he had told us that a seventh man had joined the kuo cell i might even have seen the light a seventh man could mean a decoy the telephone had started to ring and loman answered it i looked round the room again seeing things id missed before two desks a typewriter tape recorder wall safe i will see he said and pressed a switch for one of the internal lines miss maine theres a call for you before she came in i said i thought they were blocking incoming calls mil has a special line he began moving toward the door and i thought it would be a good thing when the bureau realized that an important facility for any mission is a decent local control i was getting fedup with gem shops kite sheds and rooms we had to be chucked out of whenever the phone rang she came in and looked at loman not me please stay i shant disturb you for more than a few minutes she went to the telephone loman hesitated i asked him what is room he decided it would be difficult to shepherd me out its a clearinghouse for those groups not on the official embassy staff but for all practical purposes it belongs to mil hence the number all she was saying on the phone was yes and no they were doing the talking i asked loman why the hell should mil lend us a facility patiently he said is there a better way of making sure they can maintain contact with us since you are the subject under their protection why did you let them do it when an organization of good repute offers protection to one of my agents i dont refuse you may one day profit from that he was listening to her too but there was nothing useful she must have known what kind of call it was or she wouldnt have asked us to stay while she took it i looked at her once and in that same second she looked back at me to break it up i asked loman why isnt the cultural attache ever in his office hes there most of the time but he lets miss maine bring people through there so that they can be vetted when necessary he must spend a lot of time in the lav dont forget loman said that mil have more facilities than we do they exist when she put the phone down we werent talking she said the first news has just gone out over radio thailand loman was attentive then its a worldwide release she smiled faintly it had to happen sometime with an oblique glance at me she said the ambulance has been found abandoned it was reported as having a radio fault about an hour before the motorcade left the palace no one could get an acknowledgement half an hour later it was reported stolen now its been found the crew had their uniforms taken then they were trussed up unconscious in a sampan on klong maha nak she was moving round so that the left side of her face was away from the windows loman asked is there a search mounted oh yes she looked at him as if he ought to have known everyones in the metro police special branch cid auxiliary services crime suppression division radio and antiriot units even the army the king issued an emergency decree commando units are recalled to barracks she was repeating what theyd been telling her on the phone and i got fedup and said look is your outfit going to keep on getting in my way loman looked upset and i felt better she moved toward me a bit head poised at an angle on the slender neck the eyes still flickered sometimes but she didnt look at me any more as if i were frankensteins pet we dont want to lose you she said youll have to im going to ground i dont know what i would have said if loman hadnt been with us other things or the same thing in other ways she said quietly we shall still do what we can to hold you its important it wasnt clever and i shouldnt have tried it but i couldnt stop halfway once id started any particular reason i saw loman go pokerfaced she said yes we know why the abduction was made do you lee the city was under siege roadblocks had been set up at all major points of exit and were manned by units of the royal thai army traffic attempting to leave the city had to pass through a bottleneck of tank traps machinegun posts and barbed wire in depth outward passage was permitted only after credentials had been examined by teams from the bangkok special branch and all vehicles rigorously searched passenger coaches serving the eighteen international airlines operating through don muang airport were given mobile police escort through the roadblocks after each passenger was examined and screened at the airline offices in the heart of the city bus train and road services were interrupted and all travelers entering bangkok were warned that there would be serious delays before they could be permitted emergencyexit passes units of the us special forces permanently stationed in the country had been drafted into the area following the immediate acceptance of an offer by the us government to place certain troops and facilities at the services of the thai army infantry search parties were linked across the ricefield areas working in radio liaison with military helicopters flying a nonstop schedule seagoing traffic moving southward down the chao phraya river was caught in the dragnet set up by naval gunboats on the north side of kratumban all ships were searched by auxiliary units of the river police inland from bangkok the river was blockaded on the south side of nontaburi with a machinegun post on each bank and a group of armed inspection vessels patrolling the midstream lanes a ring of armed guards was drawn round don muang and every other airfield in the southern provinces and the owners of all private airplanes were ordered by special emergency decrees to immobolize their machines by draining the fuel tanks and removing their distributor rotors and to report immediately any attempt by strangers to approach hangars or mooringareas in the besieged city the flags had been taken down five thousand police drawn from the north and south bangkok metropolitan and auxiliary forces had begun a systematic search of every room in every building in every street mobile patrols cruised on a twentyfourhour schedule covering a search pattern especially devised by the city trafficcontrol planners all crews were armed theaters cinemas and dance halls had closed and few people dined out there was music by night the gold domes of the temples stood among silent trees the city was numbed by the shock of the realization that its streets were not safe by fear for its missing guest and by grief for its dead fourteen people had lost their lives when the royal car had plunged into the crowd by nightfall three of the injured had died a memorial service was arranged to take place in the palace grounds on the day following the tragedy news of world reaction reached the city hourly by radio and cable little news went out naturally it will prove ineffective pangsapa said to me an effort must be seen to be made and anxiety for the safety of so distinguished a person must be expressed therefore they are throwing whole armies into the search well and good but ineffective he had signaled me through the embassy before id left room and i had come straight to his house because i was ready to snatch at any straw any bit of information from anyone at all that might give me a direction to follow i said you think theyve still got him here in the city of course he sat in his black robe on the cushions and there was incense burning somewhere and i felt i had come to delphi inaction when action is most desperately needed begets false hopes i didnt think pangsapa had anything i could use the nearest airfield is an hours drive i said too far they had no time to reach it in the ambulance before the hunt was up and they had no time to switch vehicles theyre still here in the city and you could deploy all the troops and airplanes in asia quite ineffectively armies need room to move the police may have better luck among the cellars and the ruined temples and the riverside wharves but there are only two people in the whole city with any real hope of finding the man you so discreetly call the person i refer to our two selves today something was different about him about his eyes or voice or the way he sat and i couldnt even name this difference but it was there i began watching him more carefully in your case he said his tone slightly singsong you know kuo and his cell better than anyone in the whole of bangkok because the police observed them for a few days and they did it in shifts whereas you made a study of them and you worked alone you had after all certain intentions toward kuo and these necessitated your observing him with far greater care than the police the topazyellow eyes did not glance in my direction in my case he went on in the same slightly lilting tone i possess information sources which the police would find it difficult to tap since they spring from what is called the underworld plaintively he added i dont know why it should always refer to cities every man has his own underworld and a part of him never leaves it the difference showed itself in all three aspects eyes voice posture still couldnt name it quite however that may be we make a formidable team mr quiller we have an enormous advantage it would be a pity to waste it leaning toward me suddenly he said it is essential that we keep in close contact i have people working for me now at this moment working for us they are questioning those whom the police cannot question at least with any hope of a straight answer and they are searching places of which the police have no knowledge at all i cannot tell you when i shall have information for you it may be tomorrow it may be five minutes after you have left my house nerves the name of the difference that was in him today he was showing nerves when the eyes moved they moved quickly the english university speechforms were remembered with less ease and the asian lilt and pedantic phrasing showed through the stillness of the lotus pose was irksome to him the limbs wanted to express the speed of thought that drove his mind pangsapa was nervous i could see no reason so my question is obvious he said how and where can i contact you with immediacy just as there is calculated risk there is calculated trust and sometimes they are the same thing there was a calculated risk in trusting pangsapa and it was worth taking this kind of thing nearly always happens toward the end of a mission you move into increasingly dangerous areas because the risks you must take become greater the adverse party has been seen and marked down and he knows it and is provoked and you are yourself marked down because he too is fiercely determined to survive but you cannot both survive the pakchong i told pangsapa the link road thing had happened only a few hours ago and i was homeless and my time in the condemned building was at an end mil knew a dozen places now where they could pick me up until i went to ground and the pakchong might just as well be one of them it would be amusing for a night or two to sleep like a gentleman in a bed you wont always be there he said loman will know where i am and if mr loman is not at that number he meant room and was careful not to say it i think that about covers it i wasnt giving him soi suek would i have permission to contact you through mr varaphan i didnt answer id taken care nothing showed in my face he would expect surprise but i didnt want him to see actual shock a safehouse is no ordinary place it is a cornerstone of security and bad security can wreck a mission and kill you off youve got local control if youre lucky but you cant always rely on getting there if the operation hots up and youre jumping a safehouse is a home and sometimes its the only place you can run to we think of it as a shrine sacrosanct its really a bolthole how did you get it pangsapa because hed got it and it was bo use asking him who mr varaphan was he knew i had never seen anger in him before there wasnt much difference he sat as still and didnt raise his voice anger in an asian is no more and no less than sudden cold please remember that mr loman gave you my name and that he gave you also varaphans how much do you trust in your own intelligence director his yellow eyes remained fixed on me i said lets say then that you can contact me at the pakchong through loman or through varaphan my own anger didnt show either loman hadnt given it to him i knew that a safehouse didnt have that name for nothing pangsapa must have tags out that was unusual he was an informant and informants are not active they are found among news vendors and clerks maitres dhotel cloth importers stockbrokers and road sweepers they can be anyone they are businessmen who listen and who buy and sell what they hear and they trade outside their ordinary occupation they take no action they dont put tags out kuo was a professional killer but he had moved into the snatch game pangsapa was a narcotics contrabandist and an informant on the side now he was on the move and that was why he was different today and why his nerves were poking through the black silk and the lotus pose and the lilt in his speech he said carefully i gave you the motorcade route i gave you the man who joined kuo i can give you more it is up to you whether you are prepared to take your advantage im ready to take everything i can get you still dont mention the price why should i it is not you who will have to pay i had walked half a block from pangsapas house when the car began slowing behind me and i caught the sound and turned sharply to face it because that is the only chance you can give yourself to look straight at the car at the windows on the pavement side the reflection of the street lamps went sliding across the metal roof i watched it coming the windows on my side were open but nothing portruded the driver was alone she reached across and opened the passenger door as the car stopped and i got in without saying anything she drove easily taking her time along the empty streets the cinemas and most of the restaurants were dark and the only patch of light along charoen krung road was made by the police station where patrol crews were assembled for rebriefing under floodlights we were slowed and a man looked in and then nodded waving us on it was all they could do check everyone search every house question everything they saw they had no direction any more than i had they would have asked for statements from people who had been at the scene and they would have drawn blank because no one can remember anything after an accident knowing that they are expected to remember they rationalize and put up a show to avoid being thought a halfwit their testimony is worse than useless because it is unconsciously false they would have extracted the bullet from the head of the dead driver and again they would have drawn blank because theyd never find the gun that had fired it kuo was a professional they would have asked to see anyone who had been using a camera at the time and they would have drawn blank because there was no point in studying amateur photographs of a car hitting a crowd the press photographers had been bunched in special enclosures and there had been no enclosure in the link road blank even from my raised viewpoint in the condemned building i had seen nothing clearly even with field glasses but they had to go on trying because routine work by massed forces will sometimes repay the effort at worst the effort is seen to be made south sathorn road with the klong running parallel on our left there were no rings on her hands they were coollooking and longfingered tenderly moving on the hard rim of the wheel sometimes her reflection came against the windshield a ghost face flying along the streets facade it was too late now to do anything about it the tricks wouldnt work any more calling her a bitch calling her scarf ace resenting her telling loman to get her out of my way loman had seen the signs he had said thats the second time youve mentioned her i should have shut up after hed said that north sathorn passing the immigration office we were heading for the pakchong hotel my last known address before id gone to ground and shed lost me for three days didnt she bloody well have anywhere else to go it didnt work any more i didnt want her to have anywhere else to go toward lumpini park a police patrol was throwing a man into the van he ducked once and nearly got clear enough to start running then they chopped him short and picked him up and threw him in one of his shoes had been wrenched off and they threw it in after him he was one of hundreds the cells were crammed with suspects held for questioning since the search was mounted vithayu road turning north far over to the left a beam of light stood against the dark sky tapering upward a helicopter probing along the river the night was warm and her arms were bare she must have tagged me from the embassy when id left there to answer pangsapas call then she had waited for me to come out of his house i had been there for nearly an hour and she had used the time thinking sitting alone in the car undistracted thinking it all out then she had decided and picked me up until now we had driven in silence through the city leaving each other in peace her head lifted a fraction but she didnt turn to look at me do you remember she said a man named lee norwich england july last year and i knew why kuo had made the snatch the swap the maximum sentence that can be imposed on a foreign national convicted of espionage in the united kingdom is fourteen years and the man calling himself peter lee had received this term at the hands of the lord chief justice in no court old bailey in july the real name of the prisoner was huang hsiung lee and the affair became known as the norwich case a group of distinguished physicists headed by sir arthur hare and professor james kw fadieman had been working on a project for the past two years at norwich physical research establishment under a special treasury grant and with certain technical facilities provided by the usa three of whose scientists were among the team the project concerned a refinement of the laser device this is an electromagnetic oscillator producing light waves massed into an ultranarrow wave length band and directed along a fixed path in a ray one million times brighter than is possible in any normal way the laser beam has been used successfully in surgery of the eye operating at a distance of a few inches a beam directed by the same method at the surface of the planet venus at a distance of miles has been reflected back to earth and picked up by optic receptors between these two extreme instances of its remarkable range the laser has capabilities that make it essential that strict security covers all research into its further development data produced by the harefadieman project during the past two years had automatically passed onto the secret list mil and the cia set up a special unit to protect every aspect of the norwich research but in january an agent seconded to the technical branch of a uk mission in teheran intercepted a signal concerning an entirely different subject and triggered a snapinquiry that sent a special branch car to no beacon street norwich within twentyfour hours peter lee a student in applied physics with friends at the research establishment was arrested and charged with being in possession of information coming under the secrets act a second and immediate inquiry among the harefadieman research team established that the leak was of the most serious proportions on the same day an exhaustive search of lees apartment in beacon street revealed microdot photographs of two comprehensive files and thirdphase technical drawings on the subject of a stage in the development of the laser instrument so far in advance of its current potential that any government on a war footing would take the most extreme measures to possess its raw data further inquiries revealed that peter lee whose family was in singapore had recently asked permission to curtail his studies at norwich owing to his fathers illness he had planned to leave england three days after the teheran signal had set in motion the inquiries at the time of his arrest he had been in the process of settling small local bills and one of his travel cases was already packed at the trial in july the lord chief justice had made a point of congratulating those agents responsible for the action and public opinion swung from alarm at the first news of the leak to reassurance that it had been stopped in time by however fine a limit the microdot material had been destroyed and lee was sent down for the maximum term he could do no further damage the norwich case was closed the street lamps swung overhead their light throwing the reflection of her face against the windshield i watched it as it brightened and faded block after block i said where are you dropping me she said nowhere i knew what she meant ive got some things to pick up at the warehouse she knew where it was the place where she had tagged loman and opened a door to listen the night when knowing she was listening had called her scarf ace lee i thought about him the public had been reassured and only a few people had gone on worrying i was one of those we knew that huang hsiung lee had an intellectual quality that came very high on the list among technical operators he had a brilliant and photographic memory it didnt matter so long as he was in prison it mattered now a straight swap i said she said yes but they cant do it it cant be on government level i suddenly felt annoyed no government can admit theyve ordered a snatch on this scale with someone as big as the person she was silent i said they cant play outside the rules a spy for a spy they cant just the sensation was almost physical bright light flooding into my head you light your lamps as you go picking your way through the dark there are patches of dark and you skirt them because your lamps are too small to show you everything now she had thrown a floodlight across the whole area and for a minute i was blinded in the reflection of her face the eyes had moved she was watching the reflection of my own she said thats right quill its a straight swap but if they cant get him to the frontier theyll get you i remembered loman our mission is still running and it wont finish until we know why the person has been abducted and why you appear to be linked with him as a subject for preservation i said to her thats why they held off why they didnt try putting me in the sights yes youre the reserve a substitute if they cant get him to the frontier we turned back through lumpini park on the way to the kite warehouse and i asked her to pull up under the trees over to our right was the hazegray jet of the fountain they had turned the lights off normally it was illuminated but tonight its gaiety would not become this city she moved in her seat and her face had all the warmth the reflection had lacked i knew she would talk now because shed already given me the whole picture i said when did your group come in some weeks ago she no longer spoke in nervous snatches her eyes were cool and steady as theyd been when i had first seen her in the cultural attaches office the flickering had gone we got a lead from one of our people in hong kong that an attempt was going to be made to spring lee from durham no one in london could confirm they said we must have duff info but we kept checking and found it was right lee was down for exchange the only snag was that the chinese republic didnt have a candidate there was no one to exchange for lee we knew theyd have to find someone and that hed have to be someone fairly big then we got wind that your bureau was sending a protection man to deal with the assassination threat we knew it was likely to be you because of your work in bangkok two years ago you know this place blindfolded so we set up a protection mission of our own you were looking after the person we were going to look after you i glanced away through the windshield because i wanted to think with a cold forebrain i said you didnt think it was the person himself up for a swap she said impatiently did you i just wondered mil can be a bloody nuisance but it works who sent the threat i was hoping to ask her something she didnt know rivalry is insidious mil mil the fbi and the cia theyre at each others throats trying to do the same job in the same way you find yourself caught up in it no excuse the threat was sent by a thai who had picked up a clue by accident hed heard that kuo the mongolian was coming to bangkok he chose the safest way to tip off london anonymously kuo is very much feared and you dont sign your name to information against him headlights swept the lawns and flower beds and a police van pulled up quietly near the fountain another followed and they doused their lights i asked her why did you have me checked when i showed up at the embassy i wasnt sure of you id never seen you before she watched the vans too as soon as you were identified without any doubt my group knew the mission was on from that minute we never lost sight of you except when you took evasive action ten uniformed police five from each van made a ring and closed in on the fountain under the great jet there was a flowercovered blockhouse with a small iron door it was where the pump was installed i said without wanting to but you lost sight of me this morning when the motorcade began you didnt know where i was her voice became tremulous again just by a degree we knew you were holedup in the link road area it seemed that she was going to leave it at that the ring of police had reached the small iron door it all looked very efficient she said they have found the man in the phra chula chedi in the temple did you know it must have been the three priests who had been at the gates they had wanted to know what id been doing in there i looked at her again and saw the faint flickering of the eyes i asked her how much did you know about my setup we knew you had to shield the person in the only way possible i looked back to the fountain she wanted me to talk but there was nothing interesting to say about the man in the phra chula chedi they had opened the small iron door and searched the pumphouse and were coming back to the vans it was going on throughout the city but they wouldnt find him kuo was a professional and he wouldnt go to earth in any obvious place like a ruin or a wharf or a fountain pumphouse how long i asked her have you been in the trade perhaps it wasnt just that death had a fascination for her perhaps she was unused to it three years on active ops mil all the time except for the karachi show i looked at her she was watching the police i said yes she still didnt turn her head the bureau hadnt been in on that show because it amounted to an almost military operation including an air drop and briefing liaison with the pakistani opposite numbers and we hadnt enough operators free it was successful but very messy and it might have been after that mission that shed had to undergo plastic surgery three people two of them mil had got killed davis chandler browne no it wasnt that she was unused to death then why the morbid interest in one dead duck a couple of policemen were coming across to vet us they had their right hands loose against the hip just over the holster who was your chief in that field i asked her karachi she still wouldnt look at me there was answer enough in the slight jerk of her head i forget they ordered me out of the car and checked our papers with flashlamps doublechecking with a few questions about the embassy staff before they stood back politely and gave us a salute they went across to their vans and i got into the car again she started up and we drove out of lumpini because i didnt want to talk about the man in the temple and she didnt want to talk about the karachi thing it is a commonplace that once a sensitive subject comes up in a conversation reference to anything in the world will somehow lead back to it we turned right into rama iv and headed for the link road and i reviewed a final thought about lee at the time of his trial he had been called a brilliant and perceptive student by his mentors and it was fairly certain that his studies were a cover therefore the data and drawings contained in the microphotographed material were probably within his range of understanding this fact taken together with his excellent memory meant that he still carried valuable information on laser development in his head overlapping this factor was a second probability that he would have taken duplicate copies in microdot for his own keeping in case it were unsafe to transmit the others or in case there were a risk of their being lost in transit the republic of china determined to take its place among the power elite of nations possessed no decisive weapon of war a refinement of the laser ray turned to hostile use could provide that country with the power to threaten a power far greater than the fission bomb that nobody dared throw their most brilliant agent huang hsiung lee must have got one signal through to peking before he was arrested he must have told his control that he was in possession of valuable material they knew what he had been looking for they had then known that he had got it from that moment they must have set up a priority ways and means committee entrusted with one task to get lee home at whatever cost the warehouse stood dark against the stars which door she asked the one in the alley all i took was the overnight case the rest of the stuff was too wellconcealed to worry about we were stopped twice on the way to the pakchong hotel by police patrols and i knew it must be even more difficult on the routes out of the city that led to the roadblocks bangkok was a trap the same room at the hotel was still reserved for me i had made a point of that because rooms werent easy to find anywhere the persons visit had filled the town i had the travel case sent up and we took the stairs while the night porter was still in the elevator we had nothing to say to each other it was now too urgent for that in the glow from the bedside lamp she moved without awkwardness revealing her lean body with feline arrogance until she was naked except for the waferflat that was bolstered on the inside of her thigh she undipped it deftly and dropped it onto her clothes halfmask she had cried out the first time and afterwards the heat of her tears touched my hand she had said his name richard without meaning to without knowing it davis chandler browne one of them god grant that the dead can be consoled we had both wanted the light and then i had turned it off at last in the early hours of the morning we had both slept but i was awake again the phosphorous dial said the animal is easily satisfied the encephalon is more demanding my head felt clear and thought had begun streaming through it because questions had to be answered question had the decoy known he was going to die doubtful suicide missions were a wartime phenomenon even among orientals no he had been put up like a clay pipe expendable probable mechanics he was recruited by cash and told that he was to be a reserve his orders were to take over the sniping post set up by kuo to man it in readiness and to shoot into the royal car once it had passed the curve if it passed the curve it would mean that kuo had shot and missed or had jammed his gun or was for some reason holding his fire and leaving the kill for his reserve it was the decoys photograph i had taken unless he had shown himself in the oriel only within the final hour before the motorcade when kuo had had to make for his own post care would have been taken that there was a reasonable likeness the smoked glasses were the finishing touch the heat haze was taken into account also the range question how had kuo known my setup loman had told me not to worry about that one he would look after it question why had a distinguished vip been chosen for the exchange an ordinary businessman wynne had been a good enough swap for lonsdale answer it was getting too easy if the practice of exchanging captured agents were to become common it would give rise to a grossly dangerous situation agents would take absurd risks to get hold of information knowing that a fourteenyear sentence would be cut short the moment a candidate for exchange was available the greater the risk taken the greater the chances of seizing the information required on these terms every major powerwould be tempted to build up and maintain an exchange pool so that the moment an agent was caught he could be flown home with his valuable information fresh in his head or in microdots smaller than a grain of rice concealed on him innocent tourists would no longer be safe in any country whose exchange pool was running low a trumpedup charge of suspicious behavior would be enough to hold a man indefinitely as a future exchange candidate in the case of huang hsiung lee it was known that he had gained access to material of the highest value to a potential enemy and for this reason peking had been forced to extreme measures their candidate had to be someone for whom the uk was prepared to surrender even such a prize as the harefadieman project discovery question how could any government admit that it had ordered the blatant abduction of a distinguished person and had entrained the slaughter of innocent citizens during the operation it was a deliberate act of violence greville wynne and others had been held on charges of espionage abduction of a person against whom no such charge could be made even falsely was a new dimension the thought persisted uncertain of itself this couldnt be on government level but loman and vinia both knew more than i loman who can afford a sum like that only a government vinia i thought you might be getting on a plane you cant cross into china vinia again if they cant get him to the frontier theyll get you she had meant the chinese frontier end of questions they werent important the mission was still running target locate the kuo cell and get the person out of their hands with a whole skin before the uk was forced into an exchange that would spring lee and surrender a super weapon to a communist state that would turn it immediately against the free world sounds rose from the street through the insect screens at the windows a car pulling up challenged by a patrol it was cleared and drove off one question above all where was kuo somewhere in this city in this trap making his plans to get out and take his prisoner with him kuo the mongolian being a professional had pulled off a major snatch in full daylight and in the presence of massed police and bodyguard protection a simple roadblock wouldnt stop him now is it morning the sound of the car had wakened her or she had been awake for some time and i hadnt known its nearly four i said she slid from me and stood for a minute looking down and in the faint light from the street i saw that she was smiling it feels like morning it feels like the morning after a lifetime i put the lamp on before she came back from the bathroom she saw the gun in my hand its not for show she said quietly i had picked it up to admire it never having seen a gun so flat it was an astra cub a twelveounce miniature with a threeinch barrel potent at short range the special holster was exquisitely designed adding no more than oneeighth of an inch to the thickness i dont imagine so i said and gave it to her its for killing clipping it against her thigh she looked up at me through the silky fall of her hair her voice had gone cold and i knew that before we had made love she wouldnt have told me this but that she was going to tell me now i want to apologize quill i said nothing the little gun was beautiful but against her slim thigh it was a hideous disfigurement i said his name aloud she told me i remember doing it at those times we often say things it was because you were so magnificent i forgot where i was who you were she began dressing i said i never heard you she glanced her thanks his name was richard and i was with him when they shot him dead through both his eyes she spoke very fast very softly i dont know who they were they were just the enemy but they could have done it some other way couldnt they not through the eyes of course its not really important you remember people as they were not as they were when they died but they neednt have done it in front of me and they neednt have done it like that her dress was on and she lifted her hands drawing back her hair shutting her eyes for a second to blot out the scene she had made herself remember then her hands came down and smoothed the dress over her lean hips look she said softly nothing shows but its there and its for killing and suddenly i remembered it was one of those stories that do the rounds you hear it first in a pub in the strand and a different version in a paris boite and a different version again in a cairo bar until you recognize it for what it is an amusing legend that you pass on or leave alone the trade is full of them and most are invented we take the mickey out of ourselves with tales of exotic spies but this one was about a woman called halfmask a beauty born of the devil too deadly for any man to touch she wore a mask that covered only half her face so that she could disguise herself by simply turning her head and any man the legend ran would be a fool to take her to his bed because she carried death between her legs legends survive their source is forgotten or sometimes never known we touch wood to placate pan the god of the trees to every legend a truth though we seldom see it she turned to the mirror getting a comb she was right the line of the dress was perfect nothing showed she said you thought it was something freudian when you saw it envy it isnt i could hear the electricity crackling in her hair as she used the comb one day one fine day i shall get the chance i need i wont know who they are theyll be the enemy they will just be they the people who did that to him i still said nothing shed wanted me for a listener you werent just a standin quill she was still by the mirror when i came back from washing i got into my clothes and before we opened the door we kissed just our fingers touching for what i knew was the last time then we went down to the street and she got into her car through the window i said theres a legend about you did you know she laughed softly looking up at me is there it must be incomplete one day ill write the ending one fine day the telephone rang just before dawn pangsapa said please listen carefully mr quiller his tone was utterly calm i said if its important we should meet it would be safer kuo was holed up and in no position to bug the line but we keep to the rules a rule is a failsafe mechanism it is important said pangsapa but there is no time for us to meet listen please i have had some of my people at work constantly and one of them has just reported to me by telephone can you recognize the man i sent with you to the gymnasium the little hindu yes he is waiting for you near the steps of the usom in phet buri road go there very quickly show yourself at that place if he doesnt appear telephone me at once and if he appears he will tell you he rang off and i knew there was some thinking to be done but i could do it on the way there because there was no question of not going pangsapa had said all that was needed and the situation was clear enough the hindu was tagging someone and would have to move on if the quarry moved on that would mean that he wouldnt be able to show up when i reached the spot he would keep up the tag and telephone pangsapa the minute he had a chance and report his new position pangsapa would give me that position when i phoned in to ask where the hindu had gone we call it musical chairs and any number can play when the quarry stops we all sit down and with any luck therell be a telephone within reach if not we go on playing till there is it was a tenminute walk so i walked because patrols were stopping every car including taxis and the calmness of pangsapas voice alone had said hurry two patrols lay north of lumpini but i saw them first and worked round them wasting two whole minutes but saving five while they checked my papers it happened again at the crossing of plern chit and raja damri by the erawan hotel and another two minutes got lost but i was nearly home he was still behind me and was working well i had to waste another minute flushing him using the side road past telephone house he was the one with the splayfooted walk and id seen him opposite the pakchong just after shed driven away although she had been with me it was his shift and they werent taking any chances good of them but i wanted to go alone where i was going because pangsapa had sounded businesslike and we could be in action again flushed him checked the flush and found it stood up brain singing like a dynamo because the waiting might be over now and the waiting had been very uncomfortable worse than could be admitted the mission is still running loman had told me but all it meant was marking time and listening to the helicopters over the river and watching the patrols checking the fountain pumphouse and stopping cars while the subconscious kept up its rotten little signals you fell for a decoy and watched them make the snatch and now youve lost him and he might not live you used to be good getting old a patrol car turned down the street and i used shadow until it was past light was in the sky eastward but the lamps still burned outside the usom building i stood on the steps there was no traffic yet except for the police cars the trishaws were late coming onto the streets the city had faltered in its rhythm and the day was beginning hesitantly somewhere a helicopter throbbed in the low sky i was counting automatically and the second minute was up give it another then phone movement caught my eye on the other side of the road was one of the tiny public gardens that form oases among the streets of bangkok the movement was being made by two hands the head and shoulders of a man were framed by the leaves of the oleanders he stood facing toward me his opened hands moved slowly in a gesture that i should go to him for some reason he could not come to me and i checked the street with great care before i crossed into the gardens they were silent the sun was touching the first blooms and gilding a temples dome beyond the magnolia trees dew was still dark on the leaves where there was shadow he stood alone in the gardens waiting for me it was the hindu he spoke very softly i could not move from here he told me in case he went he was looking through a gap in the leaves and i saw the man beyond them in the street that made a right angle with the one i had just crossed the distance was some fifty yards and the gap in the leaves was no bigger than a spread hand but i recognized the man immediately he was one of the kuo cell the shroud the new day was fragile it seemed to have dawned only here in the flowered garden beyond the garden the streets were still nightquiet petals opened as the sun touched them a branch of orchids hung above water where pond lotuses widened their waxwhite cups in the warmth the scent of camellias grew heavy on the honeyed air and small sights small sounds were colored and sharp alerting the senses as if they were significant a bee hummed a leaf fell a bead of dew shone among shadows he moved again and i at once moved with him to keep him in sight through the gap of leaves it was half an hour since i had sent the hindu away he had been glad to go nor was i sorry his fear of kuo and anything to do with kuo was distressing to be near and i was happier now that i was alone the chinese moved back and i kept him in sight he was waiting for someone and they were late and he was nervous because the patrols were everywhere i could do nothing about that only pray that a patrol wouldnt decide to question him and pick him up because then i would lose him and lose kuo and the chance of reaching the person it was the chance that made the new day fragile i had a thread in my fingers drawn fine so fine that it seemed that the drop of a single leaf would break it if they picked him up they would take him for questioning and he wouldnt answer them from somewhere not from a ruin or a wharf or any place obviously to be searched this one member of the kuo cell had come into the open purposefully theory kuo was sending them out one by one to set up an escape route for himself and his prisoner if they were left alone they would make contacts extend the route more surely protect it with strength in numbers if they were picked up they would protect the route by their secrecy the death pill is proof against every method of interrogation known to man the chance was so fragile i had to keep him in sight move when he moved follow him and find his contacts and follow them through a city where police teemed and where police action against any of these men would snap the thread and smash the whole day down pangsapa knew whatever his reasons he was dedicated to tracing the person and he knew that to put the police onto this man would be to kill the only chance we had the heat was coming haze was forming above the trees as the sun drew moisture from the green places in the city traffic was beginning a soft rush sounding from the wider streets the man moved and i moved with him he was standing with his head turned away from me and i looked beyond him and saw the car coming contact the operation was already planned in my mind it didnt follow that his contact would arrive on foot simply because he was himself on foot i could have told the hindu to bring me a car or send a taxi here to wait for me in case i wanted it but the situation was so delicate the chinese was living these minutes on his nerves and the unexplained appearance of a car might scare him enough to break his rendezvous and get clear he wasnt scared by the car that was coming because he knew about it and had been waiting for it and was already moving to the edge of the pavement as it slowed under quiet brakes i watched it until it stopped then took ten paces toward the entrance of the gardens and held myself ready it was a lincoln sedan a sevenseater executivestyle transport flatsided massive in black and discreet steel fittings the chauffeur was alone he leaned nearer the chinese and they spoke together and then the chinese opened the rear door and climbed into the car and i did the only thing possible if i lost sight of them the fragile thread would snap and i might never see them again the chinese kuo the person i had to follow them and the only transport i could use was theirs the great lincoln was gathering speed past the entrance of the gardens when i judged correctly and got the rear door open and lurched inside pulling the door shut behind me as the chauffeur screwed his neck round and called something slowing the chinese told himkeep driving he was a young man younger than kuo but not unlike him slimhipped and wide at the shoulder and with the calm eyes of a top athlete who had dedicated his life to challenge his control of the situation was perfect he had made successful contact and the nervous strain of waiting was over and his tone was as calm as his eyes be careful please the arm rest was down and between us and i looked at it the barrel lay along it a few inches from my liver the sole advantage of the springgun is silence it is more silent than any powder gun however heavily baffled even at medium range six feet and over it is inefficient if it has to fire through clothing even at four feet an overcoat will shield the body from most of the impact the springgun can kill through light clothing at any range below two feet providing it can be aimed to strike a vital organ without hitting bone as a useful weapon it has value only if its limitations are known and allowed for it would take its natural place among those weapons carried by a cell such as kuo a professional marksman controlled the sound of a gunshot in a city patrolled by massive police forces on the watch for anything even slightly unusual would provoke immediate alarm the man beside me carried a springgun against the necessity of having to threaten or shoot while he was in the open and cut off from his base and it was simply his good luck that this necessity had arisen in the confines of a closed car there would be another gun on him for use in extreme circumstances and at longer range at present the spring was the perfect weapon it was aimed well within killing distance and the needle point steel dart could pierce a vital organ the liver without risk of hitting the bone of hip joint or lower rib the chinese spoke again to the driver in mandarin with a shanghai accent make for the park and circle it the lincoln turned down phayathai road toward rama iv we had begun heading away from their base that was inevitable they would be embarrassed by having to look after a second prisoner at a time when they were desperate to move the first one to a safer place my only hope had been to get the upper hand and either force them to reveal the location of their base or give them to the police after making sure they had no access to a death pill it was still my hope he asked me in good english where is the woman the lincoln had a benchtype front seat that was solid from pillar to pillar and immovable the leather seat at my back was luxuriously cushioned and would indent up to a good six inches at the safehouse i told him it was natural for them to think we were in the same group they had seen us together in the streets when she had been tagging me they had possibly seen us singly entering or leaving the british embassy his immediate idea was two birds one shot six inches was sufficient the barrel of the springgun would be aimed past the front of my diaphragm by the time he fired where is the safehouse he asked me we were turning left along rama iv and heading for lumpini park the kite warehouse was nearer than the gem shop and there would be more room to move about in there and a chance of doing some work on him in soi narong i told him and took a breath and kicked hard at the front seat to jackknife and press back into the cushion to give him the sixinch clearance that would send the steel dart wide as i brought my right hand down in a strong chop for his gun wrist be careful please he said blood began trickling from the edge of my hand there had been only a slight phutt from the gun its barrel had swung up a degree to meet my hand and the dart had ripped flesh away a trained athlete reacts as fast as a cat and muscle obedience to the motor nerves is almost instantaneous he said to the chauffeur go to soi narong drive at a moderate speed a police car overtook us and the crew raked us with a long hard glance and the barrel bit into my side as a reminder and i sat still and watched the police car slot in between us and the car ahead then it pulled out and we lost it what number in soi narong the warehouse i told him he spoke again to the chauffeur slowly and looking at the chinese i moved my hand forward so that the blood could drip onto the carpet instead of my trousers he smiled nodding when we reached the warehouse he asked which door do you use please the one in the alley he told the chauffeur to reverse the lincoln as far as the first door that was normal procedure because the alley was a dead end and he had seen as much and wanted the car to be pointing in the right direction in case anything happened it wasnt because he was nervous and this fact worried me he showed no emotion at close quarters i like the adverse party to feel something preferably fear though hate is as useful the category matters less than the degree the stronger the emotion the more it will blur his thinking he showed none that one word please was an indication of his absolute confidence he was a man typical of kuos choice the brain and sinews of a cat the heart of a machine the car stopped and i had three or four seconds to review the chances they didnt look very good with an ordinary thug i could have guaranteed success even though there were two of them because there was so little room to move the lincoln blocked the alley and both the door of the car and the door of the warehouse had to be opened and shut lack of the freedom to move is an asset when the adverse party is toadslow to react fast reactions such as i would get from this man were dangerous at close quarters this was why i had chosen to take him into the warehouse and avail myself of elbow room and why nothing could be done until we got inside the throb of the v engine was loud in the narrow passage in mandarin when i have left the car drive to the place tell them i will be there in an hour in english is the door locked yes i said you have the keys yes go in there and be careful please they watched us come in the big male chulas with their livid coloring the female pakpaos with their slender tails they hung motionless the morning was airless and the opening of the door made no draft i heard him shut it behind us the throb of the lincoln rose and then died away in the cavernous shed there were no echoes his footsteps were muffled their sound told me that he was backing away four paces five i knew why turn to face me please he had changed weapons at five paces the springgun was ineffective he held a automatic and it had a silencer silencer is a misnomer no gun can be made silent a full baffle will absorb a lot of noise but it will also cost a lot of impact and can make the difference between a kill and a maiming wound and a man with a maiming wound can run and can even fight and can even close in before the second shot comes this was a half baffle designed to cut down the noise without costing too much fire power it would be heard in a building or a street it would make noise in here but no one outside would hear it because the kites were themselves a massive silencer seeing them and noting the acoustics as we came in he had changed weapons with the instinctive judgment of a professional where is the woman sunshine fell from the skylights we stood on our own shadows at five paces i could do nothing he would pump the stuff into me as i leapt for him there was the chance only of selling him a reason for taking me out of here for taking me to his base so that kuo himself could question me shes not here i said time was needed i had to think of a reason to sell him you told me she was here it was a flat statement made without surprise he looked around with small and precise jerks of his head allowing me less than half the time i needed for a spring but i cannot wait for her to come he faced me fully again my orders are to kill you on sight if possible it is possible the same for the woman but she is not here i cannot wait for her my spine had begun crawling it wasnt a human being inside that suit of clothes but a little killing machine set ticking by a specialist kuo theyve got a plan i said the police it was the only reason i could sell him the police it was going to be difficult because he was a machine set for the kill and the ticking could not be stopped a clock wont stop if you shout at it i felt the blood gathering at my fingertips congealing as the flow became slower like wax congealing on a candle the wound was closing by infinite degrees the body had set up the automatic process of healing itself given two weeks it would do it even without medicaments there was no point it would not be given two minutes theyve got a plan ready for action i said it will leave you absolutely no chance of getting out of the city with or without your prisoner i know the details of their plan i helped them with it he wasnt listening with small jerks of his head he studied the area immediately around me i said when their plan is put into action and kuo is caught hell realize that i knew the details and could have told him in time hell realize that in killing me you allowed him to walk into the trap they have set what will he do to you the processes of my body congealed the blood to staunch the wound and preserve life the processes of my brain worked to the same end but i knew i had begun to die stand by the box please he jerked the gun indicating the nearest of the long crates it was to my left he was a strong youth and could easily lift my dead weight into the crate but why should he one dislikes shifting garbage in front of the box please at this end of the box the gun jerked again i said i value my life like most people take me to kuo and i will guarantee his and yours quickly please he said the sweat began and i was suddenly angry it had always worked before id thought my way or fought my way out of corners worse than this there were scars on me but they were living tissue that was what mattered final appraisal of situation if i didnt move over to the box he would shoot if i moved over to it he would shoot if i tried to go on talking he would shoot if i leapt for him i would leap against the first bullet and the second and the third would go into me as i dropped no go i turned my head and looked down at my coffin move please he said and there was a slight shrillness in his tone not command worse impatience one always thinks if one thinks of it at all that when it comes to the point therell be a fighting chance or at least a dogs chance however big the odds and that ones many gods will at least allow that one is not led into the dark like a beast into the abattoir i moved over to the box not in obedience but because it would prolong my life by a few seconds and in those few seconds something might happen that would allow a fighting chance or at least a dogs chance standing in front of the box i looked at him the anger had gone and my thoughts were clear and i was even interested in what he would do with my remains he had allowed himself an hour to return to his base so my remains must be concealed temporarily to prevent any alarm being raised he would probably unhook one of the kites and lay it across the box and go a bizarre enough shroud his hand moved fractionally into the killing attitude pressing the gun against his side to cushion the recoil he said if you wish you may close your eyes i said i thank you for your courtesy i prefer to leave them open very well because of the silencer the report of the gun was not very loud though the fragile paper kites shivered to the vibration the negotiators there were three people in room with loman and he got rid of them as soon as i came in but the telephone rang and he did a lot of listening sometimes looking across at me without any expression then he hung up and said tartly i have been trying to contact you you got some news yes he looked at my hand again i have some news what happened to you nothing useful is it official then the swap he went shutfaced and i got fed up with him because he never liked people knowing more than he did i stuck one haunch onto the edge of the table and waited he couldnt stop himself asking how did you know it was an exchange for snatch read abduction for swap read exchange never a bloody spade i said mil told me how did they know theyve known all along he stared at me brightly he looked very polished this morning like a balloon at bursting point they cant have he said flatly they would have done something about it they heard there was a swap coming up but they didnt think the person was in the running they thought it was me his small hands flew in the air that is the stupidity of interservices rivalry they knew there was an attempt going to be made against the person if we had shared information we would have put two and two together and pulled off a joint mission why dont christ i said have we got time to reorganize whitehall now just give me the news my day had begun badly and i didnt want it to go on like that i didnt even know how i could face pangsapa hed given me a chance in a million on a plate and id mucked it loman span a sheet of paper toward me across the table read that there was no heading it was just a plain typewritten original hastily done precis of release no l official approach made through ambassadorial channels as follows the republic of china informs the uk that certain parties at present unidentified have offered to negotiate the immediate transfer of the person to chinese territory against payment of the sum of eighty million hong kong dollars while the republic of china has no interest in this offer it appreciates the grave anxiety felt by the united kingdom over the situation in bangkok and is willing to effect the safe release of the person by such payment given an undertaking that the uk will release a patriot of the republic by name huang hsiung lee at present under detention in durham prison england and will escort him to whatever place agreed upon so that proper exchange of the two parties can be made the republic of china would demand full reimbursement at the same time for the sum paid out the offer is made as a gesture of amity among nations and in recognition of the inviolable rights of man loman was watching me with impatience i said so he exploded with talk the approach was made in the early hours of this morning and it is of course being given priority consideration there is no question of declining the deal because no one can be sure of finding the person before he is harmed or even killed i am told that the exchange will in fact be made and that the arrangements are now being planned in parallel with the intensive search currently mounted it is thus a question of time the exchange will take place within days from now public anxiety in england is exerting enormous pressure on the situation and the public will not be informed of the exchange until it has been effected for obvious reasons he was walking about and i stopped watching him my hand was throbbing and i savored the pain it was the pain of a living body and i hadnt expected to feel such a thing again one more answer to one more question had come in this thing was on government level although i had never thought it could be china had it made the snatch had been done by unidentified parties not by the chinese it had been done in thailand on territory that was not chinese it had been done for the simplest of motives ransom it was a motive quite unconnected with a chinese agent under detention but as a gesture of amity among nations and since there was in fact a chinese agent under detention why couldnt we all get together and live happily ever after even commercially it was a neat setup china would pay kuo hong kong dollars for the snatch and would get it back from the uk huang hsiung lee was being bought for nothing thrown in was an item of scientific data that would enable communist china to build a weapon capable of challenging the whole world east and west a question of time said loman again how long precisely we dont know yet but the moment the person is known to be on chinese soil i am assured that the offer will be officially accepted i am told that huang hsiung lee has already been released from durham and is on his way to london airport that will give you some idea as to how fast things are happening i have been on the direct embassy line to the bureau twice in the last hour and the orders are specific locate the person and bring him to safety before the exchange can be made the telephone had begun and he had the receiver to his ear before the second ring speaking he jerked his head to me and i went over and took the line her voice was cool and slow and all she said was i have a call for you now i would have to face it were you successful he didnt give his name no what happened i lost the chance we couldnt say anything much in case the line was bugged he asked evenly it was not the fault of our contact he meant the hindu no he was very efficient it was my own fault loman was staring at me and i looked away it is difficult for you they are desperate now i hope for further information if i obtain it i shall need to pass it to you without any delay can you hold yourself immediately available yes rely on that i shall do so someone was banging at the door and loman went over to it as i put the receiver down it was one of the embassy staff and loman spoke to him and turned back to me important fishmonger will it wait yes he nodded and went out we had given pangsapa that cover name because of the tank with its bloodred water i was alone and wanted to pick up the phone again and ask her was she all right but there was no point she was all right all i really wanted was to hear her voice again just because it was possible as the pain in my hand was possible the police surgeon had put five stitches in and asked some questions but i told him id caught it in the lavatory seat and hed shut up and got on with the job the strangeness had lingered because of the big paper kites and because of the close companionship to death in the final second imagination had flared up one of the kites had been directly behind the chinese as he stood there with the gun held in the killing attitude and the kite was one of those with a face painted on it so that i saw their three faces in succession the face of the chinese was impassive in the instant of the guns firing then it opened in surprise as he began falling he fell slowly and as he fell he revealed the second face the face of the paper kite fierceeyed and cruelly fanged she moved from the edge of the kite to watch him fall and her face the third face was squeezed in a grimace of loathing as she stood looking down then it cleared and she closed her eyes and her face had the calm of a sleeping child the chinese hadnt moved blood came from the hole in his neck she had shot for the third vertebra in the cervical region smashing it and severing the nerves it was a surgically accurate shot consideration having been taken of the limitations of so small a gun the fumes rose from the little barrel gray in the sunshine that fell from the skylights she opened her eyes and i stepped over the body and took the gun from her she wouldnt want it any more this was her one fine day and the legend of halfmask was ended we walked to the embassy taking our time the park was on our way and we walked slowly under the magnolias like lovers i didnt speak because she had the trauma to deal with but she felt like talking and she talked about ordinary things lawson phoned me soon after dawn and said youd flushed him near telephone house so we put out the usual alert he went back to your hotel and green was sent to cover soi suek i took the warehouse it was just the way things went it could have been any permutation she reached once for my hand quickly and suddenly and i felt the tremor shaking her she had killed because of what they had done to richard i had given her the excuse that was all it would take time for her to justify and forget her fingers moved and i let them free she said i saw the car backing up the lincoln so i went in by another door in case there was something i could do i knew that her group had the keys to the place she had opened a door there before the night she had tagged loman he would and she had to get a breath and have another go he would have killed you wouldnt he otherwise in the next half second justify and forget i dont mean i know i said id have done it anyway one day for any reason im glad it was you the magnolias floated their leaves on a sky bluer than i had ever seen it we walked through gold light i said im not complaining she began laughing softly but it went on and turned strident and i said sharply cut that out she was all right after that and i put her into a cab and told the driver the british embassy and walked on to the police hospital a few blocks away to get the hand fixed up loman came back in ten minutes and didnt say why hed been called away they like playing it big when theyre in the field with the agent i have been on the direct embassy line to the bureau twice in the last hour that sort of thing what did fishmonger want requests availability he is a very good man loman said dont underestimate his resources as an informant christ i know that he gave me a lead this morning and it could have been good damned good he stood absolutely still listening well no go i got myself cornered one dead he nodded do you need any smoke out no it was like that with loman just when you wondered how much longer you could stand him he said something nice he should have stood on my face for losing a good lead when we were desperate for one he was halfway to the phone when i stopped him i passed it to local sb from the hospital when i was waiting for them to fix my hand black lincoln bangkok registered number and everything springgun dart lodged in the rear door inside if they ever get the chance to look for it he asked me about directions coming and going so forth and i told him the essentials he didnt ask about the bump providing i didnt need smoke out he was satisfied perhaps they can find it he said there arent many lincolns but they wont pass it to the metropolitan for a general search you know special branch sensitivities the world over he turned away and asked you didnt report the casualty no it is always left to the discretion of the intelligence director in the field whether a killing is reported or not circumstances vary you mind holding off loman reason theres some more to do in that area and id like it kept clear for a bit give it a few hours he considered very well he was playing me softly today because we looked like losing the mission and he didnt want to stack up any blame for wrong decisions he was leaving things as much as possible to me it was the only lesson hed learned i liked working alone and he knew hed have to let me but he still thought we were going to lose i looked at my watch theyd had an hour and a half ill report as necessary if pangsapa has anything for you have you a lead quiller straight run or a dead end one or the other there was nothing for him to do but give me the overall score we have something like fortyeight hours he said that is the period within which they can get huang hsiung lee from durham to london and by air to the chinese frontier the kuo cell will know this they will know that the deal is going to be accepted and that no one must waste any time in getting both parties to the exchange point kuo will make an allout attempt to leave bangkok today or tomorrow he came with me as far as the door the feeling in england is still one of shock and grave anxiety the general public knows only that the person is missing and in danger that is of course still true among those few in whitehall who know of the exchange offer there is an added anxiety that the exchange will have to go through and that we shall hand over with lee a weapon of awesome potential to a communist state i said fortyeight hours you can do a lot in that time but well want some luck christ well want some luck i took a cab there and got out near the warehouse and walked as far as the door in the alley i didnt hope for much but it had to be tried the chinese had told the chauffeur that he would be back at base in an hour thirty minutes ago they would have begun to worry it would take another thirty to convince them that hed got fouled up somewhere if they could stand the strain of not knowing theyd forget him i didnt think they could stand the strain in their present situation they had to find out for certain that he hadnt been grabbed that he wasnt being grilled by professional police interrogators after the potassiumcyanide pill had been forced out of his fingers in time they had to know if they were still safe that their base wasnt quietly being ringed around with police in depth at this precise minute they would have to pick a lock or break a door and i didnt know which door theyd go for so id have to be inside when they came i didnt have a gun because there wouldnt be any necessity if they came at all they wouldnt even know i was here the operation would begin when they left and tried to get back to base without my tagging them there if i could do that the alley was clear i had gone the whole way round the warehouse catseyed now i went in using the keys and locking the door after me because that was how theyd expect to find it then i turned round the dead chinese had gone i stood very still small pool of blood still on the boards darkening kites motionless no sound the nervechill was creeping down my spine but i made myself stand and watch the big paper kites for two minutes they were excellent cover because of sound absorption but anyone taking a single step from behind any one of them would set it moving however slightly they hung dead still findings chauffeur reported situation but kuo had not waited had been worried that chinese was alone with adverse party even though in control a man ordered here straight away to ensure security body found and removed i was a little too bloody late very quiet in here five minutes to look around a lot of selfanger frustration contempt churning up in the stomach while i tried to think tried to hope there was still a chance that they still hadnt gone but theyd gone and i unlocked the door and went out and caught sight of sudden movement at the edge of the vision field i plunged into a run that pitched me down a dozen yards from the door as the blast came and the shrapnel tore at my clothes and my ears were blocked by the explosion bait reaction time covers three phases time required to sense the signal to decide on the correct response and to respond

the warehouse into the alley the signal was visual and in the top sector both fastgroup stimuli but my biggest advantage was in the residual effects of training it was two years since my last refresher at the house in norfolk known as the box of squibs but good habits were still operative the result was that my prone body was sliding facedown against the wall a fair distance from the burst when the thing went off and that i finished up in the correct attitude pointing away from the explosion with my face protected and my legs together with the soles of my shoes acting as a shield the three phases went like this sighting of signal and interpretation a man on the roof opposite the warehouse was raising one arm and his hand looked big interpretation the bigness was probably a grenade decision evade the danger specifically relevant to an explosion response in this case the response factor took far longer to operate than in the case of a pilot taking action to avoid another aircraft because all he has to do is hit the controls to respond to the threat of a grenadeburst the subconscious has to evaluate a mass of data the angle of the throwers arm which governs the time period from the beginning to the end of the throw the size of the grenade data which affects the time taken to throw it and the degree of explosive force the distance of the thrower to the intended point of impact the height of the thrower above that point and all factors pertaining which include mass inertia trajectory air resistance so forth response passes to action the body moves but it must know how to move data evaluated has advised that the throwers hand will take something like one second to swing back jerk forward and release the grenade and that the grenade will take longer than one second to travel to the intended impact point and will take a further second to fire and disintegrate the response thus takes one of two almost opposite forms with less than one second available for the evasive action the target will simply drop flat and try to swing his body away from the direction of the throw but with more time available he will try to put distance between himself and the explosion the decision made for me by instinct was to respond according to the second form but the responsibility of the instinct did not end there i was to run but must be in a prone position in the instant of the explosion instinctual commands to the motor nerves were thus elaborate i must run as fast and as far as possible but allow time for my body to drop flat and draw its legs together a millisecond before the grenade burst three psychological factors were helpful i was under the influence of mixed emotions shock at the discovery that the body of the chinese had been removed anger because i had arrived too late and fear that it was a trap set for me the nerves were therefore prestimulated and conditioned to fast action during the full period of three and a half seconds conscious thought was uninvolved the instinctive animal processes took over complete control in a spontaneous attempt to protect the organism it was successful the blast wave ripped the jacket from my back and shrapnel fragments hammered into the soles of my shoes masonry broke into chips and fluted through the air something crashed down near my head and broke up as the eardrums were relieved from the sonic pressure of the explosion i heard the scream of sirens half a minute later there was the sound of running feet as police approached from one end of the alley i began slowly to get up and they helped me two hours later i telephoned the british embassy and asked for room and got loman look im stuck in a private ward at the police hospital and they want to ask a lot of bloody questions get me out will you slight pause this road yes do something soon im fed up he said he would come it was less than five minutes walk the surgeon had had me on the operating table for fifty minutes shrapnel lacerations left calf both shoulders back of skull abrasions and contusions both knees elbows rib cage stitches in left hand opened up he was the same one who had fixed the hand this morning and i told him id fallen down a lift shaft but this time he was annoyed and said the injuries werent consistent he reported wounds inflicted by foul play and satisfied himself that the special branch knew about me they were on to me anyway because the explosion had shaken everyone up and they thought it might be connected with the abduction crisis three of their people were round my bed when loman came i told him i cant give them anything loman a man slung an egg and then took off and thats all i know for gods sake get them out of here so i can think they understood english perfectly and didnt like it and loman had to promise them a full statement as soon as i was fit enough to prepare one for them when we were alone i gave him a quick breakdown on the whole thing lincoln sedan scene in warehouse return to warehouse bodysnatch grenade attempt i didnt name vinia but said it was someone who happened to be handy he knew it must have been one of the mil group but it was safe enough rivalry and friction is rife between all hush services but there is a tacit law that i have never once seen flouted nobody sneaks loman said conclusively it was a trap not quite they got there first thats all and took away the body to make sure it gets proper burial theyre chinese remember then kuo thought i might possibly show up there to see if they showed up there when the man was missed so he sent someone along with orders to kill on sight those orders loman said will remain in force at a time when the kuo cell is desperate to conceal its activities and leave the city they alert the entire complex of police services in an attempt to kill you in the noisiest possible way believing a grenade to be more certain than a bullet he stood looking down at me brooding they are quite determined on getting you therefore and when they realize they have failed theyll try again i didnt want to talk any more because my hearing wasnt back to normal and the room was tilting about a bit theyd shot some dope into me in the operation room but it was important that loman should know that he still had a useful agent in the field and i told him of course theyll try again we can rely on that this is our first real break its probably the only break well get before both candidates are taken to the exchange point and we lose the mission weve got to find them and the quickest way is to let them find me so they can try again the whole room tilted and i heard loman say something but i shut him up listen get me some clobber i finished up in rags you know my size and fix me some transport something fast case i need it his bright eyes shone through darkening mist and i cursed the dope and said youll do that for me loman wont you togs and a banger soon as i come to only chance give the bastard some bait put me on the bloody hook and swing it listen loman do what i blackout i slept for eight hours and it was night it took an hour to get into the new clothes loman had sent in for me and to argue the toss with the hospital superintendent who didnt want to release me without a medical clearance from the surgeon but i forced a personal responsibility quit form out of him and signed it and left pm the pain was coming back as the last of the dope drained out of the nerves and was glad of it because it goaded me into resolve theyd set up a decoy and taken me in theyd done an alltime snatch under my nose pangsapa had given me a lead and id mucked it and they were still holedup and ready to make their break for the frontier now i had a chance and it was the only one id get and i would use it the streets were empty except for police they wouldnt be much help because a marksman if kuo had set one up could pick me off as i went down the steps of the hospital there had to be risks theyd try again loman knew it i knew it but if the risks didnt stack up too high there was a chance of exposing myself and surviving and getting a sight of them as they got clear it was all we needed they knew the danger of that the man on the roof knew he could get clear even if i survived the grenade because even if he missed i wouldnt be in any condition to sight him and follow up but they meant to finish me and theyd have to take chances because they wanted to do it before they left the city and they were in a hurry now i walked down the steps and into the red sector there was no one waiting for me they hadnt expected me to leave so soon they might not even know i was still alive i would have to show them that i was the bait had to be fresh the embassy was five minutes away but it seemed a long walk because one of the fragments had pierced a shoe and bruised the foot and because every movement in the whole of the vision field had to be checked i wanted the pain to go on life to go on five minutes for thinking there were several reasons why they had suddenly decided to kill me they thought i might have learned something from the chinese before he was killed and might try to use it for a solo operation without telling the police they believed it now to be certain that they could get the person out of the city and to the exchange point i was therefore no longer a reserve candidate and had become expendable so that any danger i might offer must be taken care of vengeance the chinese had been valued by the cell question were they so determined to kill me that one of them would be ordered to stay behind for that purpose when the main cell left i reached the british embassy and went up the steps i dont like steps they are placed at exits and entrances where a watch can be kept and the target is raised and has no cover i wanted to be shot at not shot and the fine distinction got on my nerves loman wasnt at the embassy but hed left some keys for me and i went down to the street again and found the allblack hardtop etype parked at the curb a little way along i had told loman something fast and he had picked a black one to be inconspicuous with a hardtop in case i rolled it he was good about details like that assume the adverse party knew that the grenade had only injured me and that the nearest emergency medical post from the warehouse was the police hospital they would look for me in three places the police hospital the british embassy and the pakchong hotel first two places negative i drove to the pakchong hotel and they tried again breakout the pakchong had taken on the chimerical quality of a fellini film people appeared from the shadows bearing candles their faces floating in the light and vanishing as they turned away gold leaf glimmered along fluted columns supporting invisible skies voices piped through the gloom the concierge wreathed me in garlands of apologies the mains had fused but there were electricians already at work the elevator was inoperative but a page would of course escort me lighting the way to my room i said it was not necessary and took the proffered candle on a dish going up by the stairs more candles burned along the passages in bowls and basins on the floor and my shadow leaped on me and sprang away as i passed them there was one of the usual saraburi rugs in the alcove near the stairhead and i rolled it into ten or twelve thicknesses and held it in front of me as a shield before i kicked the door of my room wide open and went in five shots in rapid succession heavily silenced at each shot i crumpled lower and brought the rug higher because the face always feels so vulnerable and you know the surgeon will have more room to work in the gross flaccid organs of the body if he can get at you in time but its not pleasant even with some kind of shield a bullet has a lot of force behind it and your stomach shrinks and feels knothard until its over the vague form had gone from the window by the time i was on the floor but i gave him a few seconds and lay there with the sweat breaking out and the fibrous smell of the rug against my face the candle had gone out when it had fallen and the dish had made a crash on the mosaic it took half an hour to make sure id lost him survey of balconies adjoining rooms fire escape street then i went into the bar and drank a greek metaxa brandy ashamed at the weakness and then angry with the shame flinging up excuses my brain had pushed my body into almost certain gunfire when id gone into that room because i never believe in a natural cause for a mains fuse in any hotel where im staying and the grenade wounds were still fresh enough to make the body cringe at the thought of further punishment the bloody thing got its own back now it wanted to sleep brandy or no so i just telephoned loman and found him in and told him thered been another party and then went upstairs again and dragged a blanket into the bathroom and locked the door went out like a light it was tricky the next day because they wanted to keep me under observation at the hospital when i showed up there to have the dressings changed and it finished in a row the medical staff was all right because as far as they were concerned there was a bed waiting for me and if i chose to trot about the town and burst all the stitches it was up to me but it was a police hospital and they knew i was working on the snatch pitch and they were getting desperate for a lead the warehouse area was still under hawk like surveillance on the typical police principle of shutting the doors after the horse etc the closeknit saraburi rug had absorbed all five shots because the silencer had cut down the fire power and there was nothing to show on me if the nurse had seen a new injury especially bullet she would have made a report and theyd have put me into a straitjacket till ramin came to grill me i had to send for loman to help me with the row and he got me clear of the place in the car outside he looked at me and said how long are you going to keep this up till they expose their location or until you push the risk too far we havent started yet i think im on the point of pulling you out for christs sake loman you cant stop me now its our last chance he went on watching me and i was fed up with it im responsible for you quiller youre nearing the stage when youll no longer be in operational condition mentally or physically he would not speak english and it annoyed me and i said listen i know i look like a bit of dried shit on a doorstep but you cant expect me to look like anything else you know that pull me out now and the mission goes right up the spout it worried me because he had the authority to do it he never liked his people to get into a red sector typical governess i said were using me as the bait arent we thats our policy dont start getting the wind up now that it looks like paying off we went on for a bit like that and then i got rid of him by saying i was going to bed for a couple of hours at the hotel he knew mil was still on the job watching the place though i hadnt seen vinia if i saw her i would tell her to clear out it was getting dangerous now loman went back to the embassy and i took the etype to the pakchong and left it round the back the kuo cell knew i had it but i didnt want to keep impressing it on their memory then i walked about in the area and nothing happened so i walked as far as the embassy and back giving them easy chances but not before checking and doubling so that if they missed i could try following up nothing happened after the grenade thing theyd found out fast enough that i was still alive theyd sent a man to the pakchong as soon as id left the hospital now they were being slow and it scared me because it looked as if they were concentrating on the final breakout and couldnt waste any more time on me loman had said we had fortyeight hours and half that period had already gone while was wandering uselessly round bangkok there was an airplane somewhere over the near east land mass heading for the chinese frontier with huang hsiung lee sitting with two special service guards from london the cablelines would be crackling with coded signals detailing final arrangements for the exchange in the afternoon i decided to increase the risk the main kuo cell would be too busy setting up the break to spare more than one man to look after me he might not be very good a firstclass marksman but not so good at tagging or static surveillance he might have lost me a dozen times while he tried to set up a shot from a point safe enough to guarantee his getting away without alerting the police patrols a vehicle of known aspect provides a better image than a walking man i got into the etype and drove to the embassy leaving it right outside in the prohibited area for ten minutes behind the ambassadors humber imperial and then coming out again taking the steps a bit quick and checking doorways windows parked cars i was willing them to shoot and the nerves were sickening for death i could hear the discharge and feel the bullet breaking through the flesh could taste the blood in the mouth the street was innocent down from plern chit into vithayu and through to lumpini southward driving slowly checking the mirror taking time at lights in getting away giving them a chance at every fifty yards the midafternoon traffic was heavy along rama iv and a jam was piling up near the link road the suns heat pressed down its light shimmered across the facades of buildings the hum of engines was a soporific my eyes were hypnotized by the wink of the sun on glass exhaust haze hung mauve along the streets canyon the jam began clearing and i changed from first to second and kept to the slow lane and heard the faint tinkle of glass breaking somewhere near me somewhere inside the car something had flashed but i didnt know what it wasnt a gun the animal brain was already at work anxious for explanation the forebrain went into the routine check environment and note essentials then the body took control as the first fumes of the cyanide reached the lungs the throat blocked and the diaphragm contracted and i was fighting to keep the car in a straight line as the tears began blurring the vision and the lungs gaped for oxygen and the throat remained blocked because the brain knew there was no oxygen no air only a cockpit full of colorless cyanide gas the quick one the deadly one cn the one the germans had chosen for the jews because it was the most efficient metal shrieked and someone called out and a front wheel bounced against the curb and i had the door open as the handbrake dragged the treads along the tarmac slowing the car to a stop doubled up on the pavement blinded by tears hands at the stomach the first clean air soaring into the lungs through the inflamed throat and pushing out again the smell of walnuts from the fumes still clinging to my clothes people gathering voices taken sick only the lamppost telephone a doctor going slowly nearly hit i lurched across the curb and got between them and the open window of the car in case they went too close even whispering was painful all right now please go away im better now go away the tears kept on streaming and i saw the people through them their faces distorted a woman pulling a child away a man nodding encouragement as i straightened up please go away im all right now the air was dragged in forced out dragged in as the lungs hungered for it the body could look after itself it was the brain i was more concerned with because wed pulled off the trick i knew where they were now i knew where they were wed pulled off the bloody trick it took fifteen minutes to clear the cockpit using the door as a slow fan standing with my breath held and my eyes shut moving away to breathe at intervals coming back to proceed with the fanning until it was safe to get in the front wing had clipped the lamppost and there were skidmarks but that was about all the fragments of the glass bulb were in the footwell they had taken their chance waiting for the traffic jam to clear and then accelerating past lobbing the gas bomb through the open window on the other side and speeding up without a hope in hell of my following it didnt matter the forebrain routine had been running automatically checking environment and essentials three were significant the driver of the honda alongside had his head turned away from me he had accelerated fast into the gap ahead and the car had diplomatic plates loman was wrong the kuo cell had not set up an alternative plan for holding the person immediately after the snatch they had been confident of getting him clear of the city in the ambulance when my call to room had stopped their run they had made for the only place available to them the only place where they would be admitted without question and sheltered in absolute secrecy the only place in bangkok that stood on chinese soil the chinese embassy i drove there now leaving the etype at the top end of soi som kit and walking into phet buri road going into the maprao bar and using the telephone the time factor was critical now because they might think the gas bomb had worked and if it were for some reason essential to kill me before they left the city they would make their break as soon as the honda returned to base it would now have done that i couldnt see the entrance of the chinese embassy from where i stood at the telephone but i was near enough to be on hand if anything happened i didnt know what was likely to happen because it depended on loman i thought he would probably signal ramin and get a cordon round the place that was all right it would take the pressure off me two of the shrapnel wounds had broken their stitches and my jacket was stuck to the shoulder blade the left hand felt tender and the cyanide had inflamed the throat id located the kuo base and the police could take it from there the only thing that mattered was getting the person to safety and stopping the exchange and it made no odds who did it the line to the british embassy was engaged and i tried another one watching the street watching every face that passed listening to the ringing tone and the raised beat of my pulse in the eardrum the line opened and i asked for room the late afternoon sun fell obliquely across the street and cast strong shadows opposite a chinese came into the bar and i checked him but he wasnt one of the cell embassy staff vinia came on the line and my thoughts tripped fractionally as they always would whenever i heard her voice again loman i told her urgent hes talking to the ambassador shall i get him please fast i waited she wouldnt wear it again because the legend was ended her thigh would lose the disfiguring mark it had made and her mind would lose the disfiguring mark left by the memory of what they had done to him and the way they had done it you shouldnt think about anything but the mission every day hour minute second because you can miss a trick if you even blink i nearly missed it but not quite dropped the phone and threw a note on the bar and got out and walked fast but not too fast to the top of soi som kit not too fast because if theyd left a cover hed be on to me and drop me with a shot because now they were serious and it was the breakout it was a black rollsroyce silver shadow that had passed the window and it was flying the british embassy pennant at the wingtip and there were only two things wrong with that coleveritys official vehicle was a humber imperial and the pennant would be flown only when he was riding in it at this moment he was at the embassy talking to loman there was a series of oneway streets in the area and had to go left and left again down soi chitlom and left again along plern chit road wanting to drive fast but having to think it out because the chances were that theyd be coming south down asoke lane there wasnt an exit from phet buri to the north and they could only come south from it my hands were trembling on the thin rim of the wheel because this was an allornothing run and i couldnt get to a telephone again without losing them if i found them i found them they came south by asoke and i was waiting for them in plern chit on the east side of the lights they swung westward and against the fierce clamor of the hunting instinct i forced myself to wait until there were three other cars between us before i drew out and followed the trap procedure remained wellordered for thirty minutes the silver shadow kept a steady medium pace within the sector and for most of the time i managed to fit in a couple of cars between us nothing showed up permanently in the mirror two or three police patrols overtook us and the shadow got a salute in passing kuo would be pleased by that they had meant to use the lincoln but when the grenade didnt work they decided to change the image they were pushed for time and couldnt find a humber imperial and settled for the rollsroyce because it had a britishenough profile and the union jack at the wingtip made the finishing touch the rear window was shallow and the glass was darkened so i couldnt see the people inside mental note if it came to a showdown the person would normally be relied on to pile in with a will but he was probably being kept under mild sedation for that reason and would have to be counted out it was bound to be awkward when the time came to get him out of the shadow because at the last minute kuo would throw the ace and use his prisoner as a hostage for his own protection it might even be his plan to get through the nontaburi roadblock on those terms with one smallcaliber pistol held and seen to be held at the persons head they could pass right through the thick of a machinegun battery and dare the first man to shoot the only thing against that plan was that if kuo shot his prisoner it would be his own suicide and he would die with his limbs torn off but i didnt like it and part of the sweat that was gathering on the rim of the wheel was because of these considerations it was no ordinary prisoner riding in state out there ahead of me behind the darkglass window and to free him would be as chancy as picking the detonator out of a delayed action bomb the traffic grew less thick as we cleared the suburbs because only those people with urgent business outside the city were prepared to suffer the delay in being cleared at the roadblock north the police patrols were less in evidence too the sections between the city limits and the nontaburi block had become a deserted nomansland situation at the end of the first half hour speed now a little lighter direction north along route almost no other traffic sun lowering in the west to five or six diameters above the ricefield horizon etype all readings normal tank threequarters full distance from shadow three hundred yards a single knock vibrated through the bodywork and a chip of paint flew up into the slip stream from the nearside front wing and the shape in the mirror was identifiable as it closed up very fast and sat there at fifty feet honda the light was difficult because of windshield reflection but a compilation of sightings gave me a solid image only one man in the honda kuo very sharp sound above my head to the left as the second shot pierced the hardtop twice and traveled on leaving a hole an inch above the windshield i whipped down to third second foot on the floor rear wheels powerspinning a fraction as i closed hard on the rollsroyce and evened off at thirty feet kuo would have to be more careful now to avoid hitting anyone in the leading car he wanted to get his prisoner to the exchange point alive i slid the driving seat back a notch and my buttocks forward to bring my head low sighting through the top arc of the wheel the situation was bad now and i let myself admit it so that fear could alert the brain to survival pitch there was no point in overtaking the shadow it would expose me to a battery of five or six guns i had to stay where i was within fifty yards easy range of a topflight professional marksman whose intention was to kill he was having to fire without sighting in the mirror i saw his hand at the side of the windshield with the gun steadied against the pillar he had fired a third time when i had reached up to tilt the mirror to suit my new position but a bump in the road sent the shot wide that was all right he had time and he would have enough ammunition he had seen the etype somewhere along plern chit when id begun the tag and he had done as i had done keeping two or three cars between us and waiting until he could close up on me out here in nomansland where there were no more police patrols he had moved in for the kill as a shark moves in when it is satisfied that there is no danger to be expected from the prey the rear window went snowy and the bullet came on with force enough to shatter the windshield and i had to punch a hole through the opaque fragmentation so that i could see the wind pressure took the rest of it away and the small hailstorm struck my face and left me driving blind for some seconds then the rear window blew out to the airrush and i could see the honda again filling the mirror he had closed up i didnt shift down for motor assist because the exhaust note would warn him i just hit the brakes for maximum drag a degree below locking point so that a skid wouldnt carry me on the mirror went dark as the honda came piling against the back of the etype and his tires howled as he used the brakes too late and smashed into me so hard that i was worried about the fuel tank then he was smaller again in the mirror rocking badly and then straightening and coming on taking up his position again no go there was nothing else i could do now he would be ready the next time if i tried it again i was inside a trap and moving with it at an easy fortyfive miles per hour and there was no way out a pale blur showed permanently in the darkened rear glass of the shadow they understood the situation and they were observing it closely even if the shunttrick had sent the honda into an uncontrollable series of skids and turned it over it wouldnt have done much good because they would have pulled up and forced me to stop and they would have got out of the shadow with their guns raking me in a crossfire i had tried it only because kuo might have been smashed up as the honda overturned and it would have evened the score a bit before they finished me they werent firing back at me from the shadow because they could be certain of a killing hit and kuo might not be ready when i smashed they didnt want to involve him in a pileup in addition they knew they could rely on him to make the kill and when he made it he would be ready to avoid the mess they were working as a perfectly disciplined cell controlled by a professional of talent only men like these could take possession of a man so great in rank that the free world flinched as it watched for the headlines in a score of languages there was no chance now for me to save him or to prevent the exchange action by the armed forces manning the roadblock ahead of us might do it though kuo must have planned a foolproof operation for getting through nontaburi or there would have been no point in his making the breakout from bangkok a sudden rattle of shots sounded from somewhere aft he had changed to a biggercaliber arm and was going for the tires the sun was one diameter above the horizon and the sky was a sheet of amethyst and very beautiful herons flew up from the flatlands startled by the crack of the gun the big shadow rode rocksteady along the perspective of the road the air rushed against my face the shape of the honda sat squatly in the mirror numbness was coming into my body into my brain it would happen soon so be it sooner even than i had thought in the mirror the gun flashed again and the sharp crack was echoed as a rear tire burst and already i was fighting instinctively to keep on a straight course as the whole tire broke up and jammed the wheel rim and sent the etype slewing badly without any hope of correction because the rim was plowing into the tarmacadam no response from the steering she ran on at an angle and set her own course the honda was suddenly smaller in the mirror he was slowing to avoid the wreck when i smashed the terrain to the right of the road was stony a few small rocks and some timber and then a drop to the ricefields i tried for the last time to correct the course but it was no go so i cut the ignition and snapped the doorlock home and waited with my knees bent double and my feet braced against the fascia board she hit the first rock and shuddered and hit the next and flicked over and there was thunderous sound as the first roll slung her against a timber pile a lot of sound a lot of pain vision disorientated partial blackout as the blood was piled to one side of the brain by centrifugal force my voice shouting something against the shriek of metal on stone then it was over and the world grew still return to full consciousness was almost immediate i could hear the low tiresqueal of the two cars as they were braked to a halt on the road above kuo would come down for me and use one final bullet so i found the window gap and crawled through onto the warmsoaked earth of the ricefield because i wanted to die in the open under the sky and not trapped in a metal coffin it is most mens wish pain was in total possession of my body but i kept my eyes open lying on my side watching them as they stood grouped at the top of the bank their dark figures silhouetted against the strange green light of the sky then one of them began coming down and i knew that he would be kuo the flare the scene was strange because of the green light in the sky and i had to make a series of small tests to prove that i was fully conscious a finger moved when i directed it the eyes could close and open my head was capable of movement the greenness did not go the smell of gasoline was sharp on the air the tank of the etype had burst the fumes seared my throat and i breathed shallowly i lay watching kuo he had turned and was calling to the group of men at the top of the bank the chinese dialect was unfamiliar to me but i thought he was talking about the green light and he pronounced a name in the thai tongue nontaburi he was giving them orders of some kind they vanished from the skyline and i heard the rollsroyce starting up kuo came down alone and his face darkened slowly as the green light faded from the sky he held the revolver loosely confidently but watched me as he came i lay still and watched him back my brain was working by habit just as the clock went on ticking inside the smashed etype i was aware that the pain would disallow the movement of my body unless there were extreme necessity unless by moving there was a chance of perpetuating life this wasnt conscious thought but the consciousness was aware of the findings pure thought arrived at further information kuo was not yet ready to kill me because he could have put an easy shot into me from the top of the bank or ordered a fusillade from his men his shoes squelched across the flooded earth where the tender rice shoots stood in little blades taller than the level of my eye he stopped and looked down at me the gun held ready in case i moved his body looked enormous standing over me surely there was no chance but an old dog is full of old tricks and i lay without blinking holding my breath and letting only a little air seep in and out of my lungs blood was still gathering on me from the reopened wounds and a cheekbone had been skinned raw in the smash and in the twilight i could pass for dead my heart beat but he could not hear that only i could hear it and feel the quiet ferocity of the bodys ambition that this heart should go on beating quiller i had come to know this man so well but we had never spoken he wanted to talk but there could be nothing to say between us because he had the gun he stooped over me suddenly black against the sky can you hear me the accent was educated authoritative i lay without blinking without breathing his tone became hateful whether he spoke to the living or the dead he had to deliver himself of hate can you hear me damn you it was my brother you killed where they keep the kites i want you to know that was my brother his voice shook and he spoke in his own tongue cursing my spirit saying the words softly like a prayer saying them deliberately reverently ushering my shade into hell everlasting then he spat against my face and brought the gun up pain shivered through me as i moved but i went on moving and the shot was deflected because i had gone for his wrist stooping above me and unprepared his mind engaged with its hate for the thing that he thought was dead he was easy to bring down arid i worked on him with the strength of the mad reason was not totally absent with one arm locked round his neck i was forcing his head down until his face touched the flooded earth on which we churned i worked for a drowning he was a strong man but the dying are more desperate his face went under the film of water and a shrill bubbling came his legs kicked convulsively and his left hand scrabbled to reach the gun but i felt for the thumb and eased it back until it snapped and he screamed under the mud then i brought pressure to the necklock freeing my other hand and feeling for the gun his fingers were nerveless and i prised them away and jerked the gun clear it splashed somewhere behind me as i fought him i sensed a strangeness in it in engaging an opponent one reckons instinctively the degree to which he will oppose kuo was young strong cruel a man without pity yet there was a lack in him courage there was strength in him but no effort and i knew why he was a chinese and vulnerable like all his race to superstition and when he had spoken to me in his own tongue he believed that he cursed the dead my sudden attack had seemed monstrous to him and the terror had withered him it was not a man but a spirit that rose up against him and he was powerless the process is not intellectual small mammals are frozen by the same terror in the mere presence of a snake so it was with kuo the mongolian his paralysis had passed within a few seconds as a man of sophisticated action he realized what had happened i had used the oldest trick of them all the possum trick but it was too late the strength that had been bled away by terror within an instant would take minutes to return sometimes he moved and violently his legs kicking his body twisting his empty gun hand crawling for purchase on me but the lock i had on his neck was unbreakable sometimes his face came out of the mud and his lungs heaved for air but he was choking now words came among the other sounds at first in chinese and then in english and i listened to them he was asking me not to kill him above us the last of the days light was leaving the horizon the young night was fragile lit by the first stars and very quiet mist came across the ricefield and covered us another spasm of choking shook him and the words started again asking me not to kill him i wasnt surprised the deepest cowardice takes shelter behind the gun and the gun was this mans trademark not that it is cowardly to wish for life it is cowardly to beg for it wish for it fight for it to the last breath but when you know its going let it go dont beg like a bloody dog i wrenched his neck again and forced his nose and mouth under the mud and kept him like that because i wanted to weaken him or that was my excuse the crowd had screamed when the big car had gone into them and that sound was still louder to me than his frenzied bubbling then i jerked his head up and waited till the choking was over and gave him the edge of my uninjured hand at the side of the neck a lowpower chop to paralyze it took a few minutes for him to rally and by that time i was standing above him i told him to get up and we lurched together through the mud and crawled up the bank to the road where pangsapa was standing his dark figure stood between two others they were one pace behind him in the attitude of bodyguards it was only when he spoke and i heard his lisp that i knew who it was i was uncertain of what was happening mr quiller or i would have sent assistance a big american car stood behind the honda it must have come up when kuo was choking or i would have heard it it was difficult for me to stand properly and blood showed through the mud that smothered me so for prides sake i said it wasnt necessary kuo moved and pangsapa said to the two men cover the chinese kuo stopped moving his breath sounded slow and painful pangsapa said to me let us go back to the city mr quiller i straightened up and tried to stop the onset of giddiness im going on to nontaburi the roadblock stop them getting him through it is too late pangsapa said no theres a chance as i began moving toward the honda the first sounds came into the night from the north rifle fire then machinegun distance was a few miles about where the roadblock was it is too late mr quiller ill take you back to the city you need medical attention i stood staring northward there were flashes in the sky grenades over my shoulder i said dully too late why didnt you see the green light ten minutes ago the parachute flare yes i saw it it meant that the attack on the roadblock was about to begin sixty assault troops of the vietcong were flown in earlier today from the laos battle area in a few minutes resistance will have been overcome and the rollsroyce will pass through the airplane is waiting at a private field three miles beyond there were no more flashes a single machine gun puckered the silence for a little time and then it stopped vaguely i heard pangsapa telling his men to take the chinese into the car and guard him then he came up to me you need to rest mr quiller there is nothing you can do now the exchange will take place as arranged the ride the guards arranged matters expertly and without troubling pangsapa for orders one drove with kuo beside him the other sat on the tipup behind the front seat the muzzle of his gun just brushing kuos neck pangsapa and i sat in the back the tendency to drift off mentally had to be checked it was not only fatigue and loss of blood the roadblock was down and the prisoner was through and that was that the th directive was wiped out but suddenly i was leaning forward and shouting at kuo it may have been only a croak but it felt like a shout inside my skull because i wanted to know why the mission was wiped out kuo how did you know my setup how did you know he was groggy and took a minute to answer i ordered a microphone to be placed inside the rosewood buddha i sat back numbed so theyd heard the lot got on to me from the moment i began searching the town for him tagged me to varaphans picked the lock and rigged the mike and heard the lot and the two missions had begun merging his and mine one had succeeded his i must have drifted off again my brain shying from reflections on my gross stupidity pangsapas voice was fading in and out but they said you had gone my head lifted heavily what i asked him he turned to look at me you are fatigued mr quiller i will leave you in peace so that you can sleep i hitched myself up on the seat im not too bloody tired to talk i was thinking of something else thats all he smiled in the pale backwash of the headlights the english hate losing dont they it makes them so cross i was just saying that the moment i had news that our friend here was making a run for it i called your embassy in the hope of finding you they said you had just been on the line to them but that you had gone knowing your predilection for working alone i said nothing to them but drove out myself along route in case there was something to be done we were about to overtake the honda when the shooting began so we pulled back and awaited events the big chrysler flew smoothly along the deserted highway the air conditioner providing us with coolness to breathe i found the switch and got a window open i am not a goldfish sweet air rushed in when did you know i asked pangsapa about the assault troops two days ago but you know how it is with random information i was told merely that a local commander of the pathet lao in the communistheld area round tha khek had released sixty combat troops and ordered their transit into thailand under cover i failed to connect it with your operation until i saw the green signal light just now i had wondered what plan kuo had made for leaving the country and it was suddenly obvious its galling isnt it when one is faced with an event one should have anticipated long before listen i said what kind of plane have they got waiting i suddenly realized that we could get information direct kuo what kind of plane he didnt answer and rage flared up in me faster than i have ever known it kuo i was leaning forward and my hand had the shape of a claw the driver turned his head an inch he is only just conscious does mr pangsapa wish that we should stop and revive him no pangsapa said and touched my arm you should control your disappointment mr quiller i have already dismissed my own and it was as painful as yours i let my hand fall and sat back the adrenalin had nothing to do and it ran without purpose through my system and my pulse throbbed flashing behind the eyes i shut them and heard pangsapa lisping on there is nothing more that we can do you see i am informed that the exchange is officially arranged to take place at the laos frontier on the kemaraj bridge across the maekong river the territory on the other side is in the hands of the pathet lao which takes orders from peking kemaraj is throe hours flight from here so that the personage in the rollsroyce will reach there at ten oclock tonight he will then be placed under military guard until dawn tomorrow when the exchange will take place you see how absurd it is to fret mr quiller im human i said through my teeth you are an occidental they are not philosophical my chagrin is quite as sharp as yours when you first came to me for information i saw reward in it we settled for fifty thousand baht if you remember but when i began tapping my resources and learned that an abduction was planned and not a simple assassination i saw the opportunity of earning a reward of really immense proportion you surely thought me impudent when i asked you to estimate your importance as an international agent i wanted to know you see what your value was to the republic of china you gave me your estimate in the most appropriate terms when you named abel and lonsdale as a measure of your status both were agents but they had more in common than that they were agents who had been exchanged he had turned his head and was watching me i thought you had divined my intentions mr quiller when you named them but it was just a felicitous accident wasnt it so this was the measure of pangsapas fury at losing he was taking it out on me well i wasnt going to show any bloody interest i shut my eyes again my intentions were from that moment clear in my mind mr quiller i would assist you with all my power to prevent the abduction and the exchange without financial consideration unfortunately we were opposed by a specialist of high talent and we lost it was said with sudden impatience and i knew he had no stomach for more he couldnt take it out on me and remain detached i felt a little better and opened my eyes and looked at his profile it had the aspect of a sulky child i said did you have contacts an agreement oh yes through an intermediary at the chinese embassy kuos price for the person was five million pounds for you i asked half and it was agreed they were very confident that the deal would never be concluded they were certain that the person would be made available at the exchange point as indeed he has now been made but it was an insurance for them if kuo could not offer them the person i would offer them you that was why hed brought the bodyguards along if i had got the person out of kuos hands tonight i would have walked straight into pangsapas how much had the mil group known vinia had said if they cant get him to the frontier theyll get you it was ridiculous when did they promise to pay for me pangsapa on exchange something was getting trapped inside my chest i said thats rich two and a half million quid i turned to look at him i was shaking now with the oddest kind of laughter and it came out in a series of jerks together with what i was saying there wouldnt have been any exchange you stupid bastard you think england would hand over an alltime blockbuster like that to the redandyellow bloody peril just to get me back there was something wrong with the laughter but i couldnt stop it tears were on my face two and a half million quid for one piddling little ferret up to his arse in mud i couldnt say any more because of the shaking but it stopped after a bit and left me weak as a wet rag i think i slept for a few godsent minutes on the way into the city the chrysler dropped me at the british embassy the place was ablaze with light and there was a mob of journalists milling round the police guard kuo had pulled himself together and got out of the car without anyones help the man with the gun was ready to shepherd him into the building for me but i said i could cope i looked in at pangsapa thanks for the ride it was a cheap enough double entendre but the best i could do a brace of police closed in on us because of the state we were in and it took a minute to find my papers kuo never made a move he probably knew that if he made a move id kill him they took us through the mob and the flash guns made me dizzy i walked kuo in front of me all the way up to room no one was there and i told a scaredlooking clerk to find loman he took his time coming the whole place was buzzing with panic when he saw us he didnt look shocked he looked as if nothing could shock him now i said as clearly as i was able this is kuo all i could salvage loman just nodded and went across to the telephone while i leaned against the door kuo didnt look at either of us he was very pale his hand had swollen a lot because of the broken thumb and he stood holding it loman was asking someone for a doctor and a police guard when he rang off he came back to me and said what happened at nontaburi some garbled news had obviously trickled through a bunch of vietcong wiped out the roadblock far as i know the persons on a plane by now exchange points the kemaraj bridge laos frontier dawn tomorrow he nodded i hoped he would snub me for sending the mission down the drain so i could shout at him he didnt say anything whats come up loman i saw kuo move an inch nearer one of the windows and told him to stand still told him i was only waiting for an excuse loman said huang hsiung lee was flown in half an hour ago hes here now here in the building yes the charge daffaires will be taking him to the exchange point at hours you are quite correct its to be the kemaraj bridge coleverity is making the final arrangements now with the chinese embassy he turned away and dug his hands into his pockets id never seen him do that before he probably didnt know he was doing it but he couldnt have expressed his feelings more exactly the show was over when the two officers came loman told them who our prisoner was and they clapped a shackle on his wrists at once it was then that i remembered there was a lot to do and i mustnt fall asleep on my feet loman dont let them take him away we dont want him if he could do anything he would have said so by now to save himself loman meant a telephone call from kuo to the laos frontier ordering his cell to hold the person on this side then we could have made our own swap kuo would do it all right because he didnt want to die he was due for trial conviction and the firingsquad because seventeen people had lost their lives when he had shot the driver and thered be no chance of a life sentence but he couldnt telephone any orders to his cell because by tomorrow they would have collected the sum agreed on eighty million hong kong dollars theyd take it and run his share as well the lions share there was nothing he could do on a telephone i still want him kept here loman in this room i got myself a bit straighter im not as far gone as i look and i know what im saying and i know what im doing he stared at me with that glassy look that meant he was going to be obstructive he said there is no point at all in keeping him here he is wanted for murder by the bangkok oh for gods sake shut up i lurched over to the two officers and spoke in rapid thai we wished to detain the prisoner for a short time and would guarantee his safe custody until we surrendered him formally to an escort of the metropolitan police in due course ambassadorial prerogative british soil so forth but thank you for coming the one with the superior rank said it would mean putting a cordon round the embassy if the prisoner remained inside the building and i said that would be a very sensible thing to do they saluted with good grace and went away and a man came in before the door was shut and i asked loman who the bloody hells this the man was english and had a black bag and gave me one straight look and said right we shall need an ambulance straight away christ i said dont you start i went over and blocked the door again because kuo was fully alert and handcuffs dont stop a man running loman was looking inquisitive hed lost face in front of the police officers but he knew that even a guttersnipe like me wouldnt have done that unless there was a good reason i told him slowly listen theres a thing ive got to work out ive only just thought of it give me a bit of time i cant do it without you without your authority and there are some things i need his bright stare was hypnotic and i had to look down there was a messy little patch of blood drying on the floor where id been standing before i heard the doctor fiddling about in his bag so i told him i dont want any dope local anaesthetic if you like all i wants a good wash loman was still waiting and i made an effort and got my head up again to look at him get some kind of a guard in here ask mil those two bright lads green and someone tell them to bring in some guns that bastards tricky my voice sounded tired and i had to make loman understand so i got some more force into it dont lose him for me loman dont lose him the doctor was trying to ease my jacket off and i had to stop him wait till the guards come theres a good chap because youre helpless for a minute with your jacket half off and kuo was watching me waiting for me to pass out then loman told me all right stop worrying and i saw the little black walther in his hand pointing at kuo thats it i said thats the stuff the doctor started again getting the jacket off and bits of halfdried mud pattered onto the floor what time is it loman whats the time he brought his wrist up close to his line of vision and only flicked a glance away from kuo and back i said taking lee out of here two in the morning yes the doctor said impatiently i shall need the assistance of a nurse and some equipment hed got a better look at me with the jacket off loman i said urgently because my legs were trying to go ill have time to sleep few hours dont let me down will you look after things no dope no injections wake me at midnight the doctor asked if someone could send some blankets in for putting on the table hot water things like that and loman said he would see to it i heard him on the phone and my eyes came open with a jerk but he still had the gun on kuo i was in a chair and there were scissors at work on my shirt loman you listening yes sometime before midnight get it for me from the warehouse you know where it is the husqvarna need it you do that for me yes he said something more but it all went fuzzy dawn at hours the next morning the police helped us across the pavement to the car in a storm of photoflash there was no actual cordon because loman had spent a lot of time with coleverity and it was decided that the thai home office should be told what was on we now had permission to hold on to kuo and to escort him out of the city we had him in the car with us i had insisted on that his broken thumb had been seen to and his clothes like mine had been given a brushing they were crumpled and patches of dried mud still remained but we didnt look too bad after loman had woken me i had privately told him the setup he didnt like it he said it was a hundred to one against and there were risks i said it was all we could do and if there were anything we could do we had to do it i hadnt said anything yet to kuo because i wanted to spring it cold at the last minute so that he would have no time to think beyond the simple terms of the proposal life or death he hadnt spoken once except to thank the doctor that was all right it meant that he knew there was no getout for him otherwise he would have talked hard putting up some kind of an offer there was nothing he could offer us the humber imperial was full the charge daffaires third secretary loman kuo one armed guard and myself the police car behind us was bringing huang hsiung lee i had seen him for a few minutes young ascetic dedicated a lot of assurance they might not have told him much but he knew he was up for a swap soon after theyd woken me loman had said weve had a call come through the person landed on the other side of the frontier ninety minutes ago he is being held ready for the exchange thank god for that loman had said icily i dont quite follow hes still alive isnt he i had been worrying about the nontaburi roadblock action thered been a lot of stuff flying about and the rollsroyce crew might have panicked and tried to push through too early all the way to the airport kuo sat facing me on the tipup seat sometimes he looked at me but there was no particular expression he had the eyes of a nocturnal animal the pupils large and black in the gloom i had no feeling of being watched by anything human there was a thai air force transport waiting for us at don muang and by hours we were airborne and heading east to the laos frontier at kemaraj the maekong river is wide and the new bridge is substantial tarmacsurfaced and with two traffic lanes it was closed after the vietcong had overrun the area on the laos side and military posts were established at each end we reached the bridge just before dawn in a small army convoy the post was normally manned by a unit of thai guards a dozen strong but today a special detachment had been ordered up from the military base near kuchinarai and immediately we arrived the commander reported to our charge daffaires he was to lend us all assistance in the event of difficulty short of firing into laotian territory on the far side of the bridge i wanted to look at things so i walked a little way from the car it was very quiet there were upward of a hundred armed troops standing at readiness here in the half dark there would be as many on the other side but it was quiet a man coughed a light flicked on and went out metal made a ringing sound instantly silenced and the quiet remained it was the battlefield hush of the hour that comes before the attack in the stillness i could hear the mosquitoes whining in the glare of the lamps above my head beyond the lamps the sky was black but in the east a crack of light showed my watch said six loman had not let me down walking was painful it meant he hadnt allowed the doctor to dope me even with one aspirin my head felt clear with the superawareness that comes from not eating i was unhopeful lomans estimation of the odds seemed about right the new day came into the sky quickly and a car was started up at the far end of the bridge and there were commands i went back to the military convoy and got into the camouflaged saloon where the guards had kuo the dawn light showed his face to be pale he watched me steadily i ordered the guards out of the car only a few of us knew what was going to happen loman the charge daffaires the two mil people it was going to be tricky and we didnt want anyone else to know especially the soldiers one man unnerved might fire by accident and entrain wholesale bloodshed i had to bring the person safely across to us without a shot and send lee back to england kuo i said carefully you understand english perfectly i think yes his fear was revealed even in that one word it came out on a breath his fear was all i gambled on his fear of dying that was why i had not killed him in the ricefield no weapon is so powerful as fear in the enemy then answer my questions was the proposal made direct to you from peking the proposal to abduct the english dignitary yes there was no hesitation he was in my hand what precise powers were you given over the military chinese and vietcong to help you mount the operation i do not quite understand he watched me the whole time in the growing light that came into the car we sat so close that i could hear his breathing and feel his fear for instance you engineered the assault on the nontaburi roadblock by signaling peking from our embassy is that right yes i was able to do that because peking offered me facilities before i crossed into thailand i did not use them before the assault operation and have you papers giving you any kind of temporary authority over the military in general he produced two guard passes and a special letter countersigned by the commanderinchief of the vietcong forces in laos i read this slowly asking him for a translation of the words i didnt understand the letter gave him access to the operational chiefsofstaff of whatever area in which he found himself and power to request armed assistance in strength according to the situation it looked official and was obviously genuine but i didnt like its vagueness i gave it back to him with the two passes it should suffice i had to encourage him it wasnt the time for doubts now listen to me carefully you will have to make a choice one alternative is that you are taken back to face your trial in bangkok you are certain to be convicted and executed perhaps you know the method of execution in this country the religion is buddhism which is against the taking of life the condemned man is therefore put behind a sheet of fabric on which a target is painted the squad fires at the target not at the man but you will die just the same and it seems a fitting death for a marksman i watched his eyes and i was satisfied the other alternative is that you walk to the middle of that bridge out there and make it understood to the chinese officer in charge of the exchange that you are replacing the agent lee you are the candidate to be exchanged for the english dignitary there were engines being started up outside the guardpost a party of soldiers went past the windows of the car the lamps across the bridge had gone out and it was full daylight kuo said on a breath they will not agree i turned back to face him that is up to you you can use your papers tell them you have received instructions from peking at the last moment or tell them that you have spoken to huang hsiung lee and that he wishes to return to england because he is about to gain certain information far more vital than the information he has now tell them that his memory is not sufficient to retain so many technicalities and that he has a chance of acquiring essential documentation from sources with a contact inside the prison he urges you that if he is exchanged it will cost the republic of china the loss of scientific data that he could otherwise obtain given a few more months in england i paused so that he could think but he said almost at once i could not convince them i leaned nearer him and spoke quickly tell them what you like lie bluff throw your weight about threaten them in the name of the commanderinchief of the vietcong forces general kweiling who has countersigned your written authority and will punish those who disobey use any means you can i paused again to give him time the alternative is execution in bangkok he said nothing his eyes were blank only the quickened breathing told me that he was hooked and i knew what was in his mind i said to him there is a white line painted on the roadway in the middle of the bridge it is for the purpose of the exchange you are to walk as far as that line then stop the other side of that line is your freedom this side you will die the other side you will live you may cross that line only if the englishman is allowed to come over to us unharmed a klaxon sounded a jeep drove past the first rays of the sun touched the wall of the guardpost yes kuo said nodding quickly yes will try to do this he breathed as if he had been running i got out of the car at once the police officer was waiting for me and i took the husqvarna from him when they brought kuo out i let him watch as i put a full magazine into the chamber and flicked the bolt and set the catch to fire kuo i said the people of bangkok are in mourning for those you murdered your execution would ease their grief since it would avenge the dead i was given permission to bring you here and it is unthinkable that i should allow you to escape across the line if you fail to bring about the exchange if they insist on our sending the agent lee you will be brought back and will return to bangkok he could not look away from the husqvarna better than most men he recognized its terrible power and if you make any unexpected movement if you run for cover if you cross that line before you see the signal i shall give you i shall shoot you dead his head swung up at last and he looked into my eyes and saw in them what i knew was there my readiness to kill the klaxon sounded again from the far end of the bridge i could hear someone talking on the telephone in the guardspot loman was coming across to me kuo said to me in slow strained accents what signal will you give i will lower the gun they took him away loman spoke to me before i followed the others does he agree to make the attempt he wants to live doesnt he i had taken up my position halfway from the guardpost to the middle of the bridge there was a low plinth and i had pulled myself up to stand on it using one of the iron stanchions as a support for the husqvarna the effort of climbing had opened the left shoulder wound and the pain burned there it wouldnt affect my aim our party had been given orders to keep at a short distance from kuo so that i would have an unobstructed line of fire when he reached the white line he looked back once and it was then that i put my eye to the telescopic lens the range was close and he was looking straight into the gun then he turned and began speaking to the chinese commander of the exchange party several military vehicles had driven to the middle of the bridge from each end making a uturn and lining up facing the way they had come a few minutes ago some civilians had got out of the leading car and i saw the person among them he was bareheaded and wore no topcoat he took the few paces to the white line with an easy deliberation his hands clasped behind him with my finger clear of the trigger i swung the gun and sighted on him strain showed on his face if he had slept during the past three nights it would have been with the help of the sedation the memory of the incident in the link road was fresh in his mind together with an anguish more personal his family did not know at this moment whether he still lived his selfcommand was perfect and i had never thought i would witness such a thing as this a prisoner in the midst of his alien captors was impeccably performing the highest duty of ambassadorship which is to inspire respect for the country he represents i could no longer see him the bausch and lomb balvar was centered again on the figure of the mongolian and my finger was hooked at the trigger kuo was still speaking to the officer showing him his papers slapping them with his spread hand his squat body jerking as he insisted on his authority his feet did not move he stood within inches of the white line the officer moved about conferring with a civilian coming back to face kuo but kuo did not move one pace would take him across this miniature frontier and into the protection of armed men of his own race but he knew that the range was less than sixty yards and that the crosshairs were focused on the center of his back the stillness had come into the morning again the groups of the exchange party on each side of the line stood motionless watching behind them at each end of the bridge the military were drawn up their rifles at the alert i began to sweat the big husqvarna grew heavy at the butt the crosshairs moved by a centimeter across the target and i moved them back i was losing the sensation of time a hundred to one against loman had said the odds looked longer now kuo was still talking i could hear his shrill voice and some of the words they were to the effect that a soldier of the chinese republic was not expected to concern himself with the high and secret affairs of state but to obey orders any breach of this sacred duty would be signaled at once to his commanderinchief the officer replied briefly and then i saw kuos hand flash in the air and strike him across the face there was a shout and a rattle of riflebolts from the military escort the scene froze into stillness silence my pulse began hammering this was what loman had meant when he said there was a risk two hundred armed men faced each other across the bridge and between them stood the person my left eyelid began flickering and i cursed the weakness in the nerves the big gun was very heavy now and the crosshairs were shifting again across the spine of the man in the lens sweat was doming out onto my hand onto the trigger finger the officer had turned away and the civilian was talking to kuo his accent was clear but strange to me he was saying something about responsibility kuo nodded vehemently the civilian turned to the secondincommand of the military escort and spoke to him and got a punctilious salute a shouted order echoed among the girders of the bridge the escort presented arms the civilian spoke across the line to the british charge daffaires a word was addressed to the person then suddenly kuo swung around and looked straight into the lens the crosshairs dipped and wavered but i kept them inside the target area i could see nothing outside the frame of the lens but there was a lot of quiet movement going on now people walking the slam of a car door engines starting up i kept the aim on the mongolian it wasnt over yet and i didnt trust him my finger was growing cramped on the trigger and the left eyelid was worse and i couldnt stop the flickering i had never known a gun to be so heavy a car drove past toward our end of the bridge and another followed the tramp of a squad on the march the sharpness of exhaust gas in the air kuo stood motionless staring into the lens footsteps neared me and i heard loman call its all right quiller weve got him i lowered the gun on the way to the guardpost where everyone was gathered i took out the magazine and threw it over the bridge the end
