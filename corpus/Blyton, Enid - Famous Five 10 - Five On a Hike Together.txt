julian ive brought it for you anne stopped oh thanks she said what can julian want he only wrote a few days ago its most extraordinary for him to write again so soon it must be something important well open it and see said george hurry up ive got a maths class to go to anne ripped open the envelope she pulled out a sheet of notepaper and read it quickly she looked up at george her eyes shining george julian and dick have got a few days off at our halfterm weekend somebodys won a wonderful scholarship or something and the boys have got two days tacked on to a weekend to celebrate they want us to join them in a hike and all go off together what a glorious idea said george good old julian i bet he thought of that lets read the letter anne but before she could read it a mistress came along georgina you should be in class and you too anne george scowled she hated to be called by her full name she went off without a word anne tucked the letter into her pocket and rushed off joyfully halfterm with her brothers julian and dick and with george and timmy the dog could anything be better she and george talked about it again after morning school we get from friday morning till tuesday said george the boys are getting the same what luck they dont usually have a halfterm in the winter term they cant go home because the painters are in our house said anne thats why i was going home with you of course but im sure your mother wont mind if we go off with the boys your father never likes us in the middle of the term no he doesnt said george hes always deep in the middle of some wonderful idea and he hates to be disturbed it will suit everyone if we go off on a hike julian says he will telephone to us tonight and arrange everything said anne i hope it will be a nice fine weekend it will still be october so theres a chance of a bit of warm sunshine the woods will be beautiful said george and wont timmy enjoy himself lets go and tell him the news the boardingschool that the two girls were at was one that allowed the children to bring their own pets to school there were kennels down in the yard for various dogs and timmy lived there during termtime the two girls went to get him he heard their footsteps at once and began to bark excitedly he scraped at the gate of the kennel yard wishing for the thousandth time that he could find out how to open it he flung himself on the two girls licking and pawing and barking silly dog mad dog said george and thumped his back affectionately listen tim were going off for the weekend with julian and dick what do you think of that were going on a hike so youll love it all through the woods and up the hills and goodness knows where timmy seemed to understand every word he cocked up his ears put his head on one side and listened intently while george was speaking woof he said at the end as if he approved thoroughly then off he went with the girls for his walk his plumy tail wagging happily he didnt like termtime nearly as much as the holidays but he was quite prepared to put up with kennel life so long as he could be near his beloved george julian rang up that night as he had promised he had got everything planned already anne listened thrilled it sounds super she said yes we can meet where you say and well be there as near as we can on time anyway we can wait about if you others arent there yes well bring the things you say oh julian wont it be fun whats he say asked george impatiently when at last anne put the receiver down you might have let me have a word with julian i wanted to tell him all about timmy he doesnt want to waste an expensive telephone call listening to you raving about timmy said anne he asked how he was and i said fine and thats all he wanted to know about tim hes made all the arrangements ill tell you what they are the girls went off to a corner of their commonroom and sat down timmy was there too he was allowed in at certain times and so were three other dogs belonging to the girls each dog behaved well he knew that if he didnt he would be taken back to the kennels at once julian says that he and dick can get off immediately after breakfast said anne so can we so thats all right he says weve got to take very little with us just nightthings toothbrush hairbrush and flannel and a rolledup mac and any biscuits or chocolate we can buy have you any money left a bit said george not much enough to buy a few bars of chocolate i think anyway youve got all the biscuits your mother sent last week we can take some of those yes and the barley sugar one of my aunts sent said anne but julian says were not to take much because this is to be a proper hike and well get tired if we have to carry a heavy load oh he said put in two pairs of extra socks right said george and she patted timmy who was lying close beside her theres going to be a long walkywalk tim wont you love that timmy grunted comfortably he wondered if there would be any rabbits on the walk a walk wasnt really exciting unless there were rabbits all over the place timmy thought it was a pity that rabbits were allowed to live down holes they always disappeared most unfairly just when he had nearly caught one anne and george went to see their housemistress to tell her that they were not going to kirrin cottage after all but were going walking my brother says he has written to you said anne so youll know all about it tomorrow miss peters and georges mother will be writing too we can go cant we oh yes it will be a lovely halfterm for you said miss peters especially if this sunny weather lasts where are you going over the moors said anne in the very loneliest most deserted parts that julian can find we might see deer and wild ponies and perhaps even a few badgers we shall walk and walk but where will you sleep if the parts you are going to are so very lonely asked miss peters oh julian is arranging all that said george hes been looking up little inns and farmhouses on the map and we shall make for those at night it will be too cold to sleep out of doors it certainly will said miss peters well dont get into trouble thats all i know what you five are when you get together i imagine timmy is going with you too of course said george i wouldnt go if he didnt go i couldnt leave him here alone the two girls got their things ready as friday came near the biscuits were taken out of the tin and put into paper bags the barley sugar was put into a bag too and the bars of chocolate both girls had rucksacks with straps for their shoulders they packed and repacked them several times one by one more and more things were added anne felt she must take a book to read george said they must each take a torch with a new battery and what about biscuits for timmy she said i simply must take something for him hed like a bone too a big one that he can chew and chew and that i can put back into the bag for another time well let me carry all the biscuits and chocolate then if youre going to put a smelly old bone into your bag said anne i dont see why you want to take anything for timmy he can always have something to eat when we do wherever we have a meal george decided not to take the bone she had fetched one from his kennel and it certainly was big and heavy and equally certainly it was smelly she took it back to the kennel again timmy following her rather puzzled why keep carrying his bone here and there he didnt approve at all it seemed a long time till friday but at last it came both girls woke up very early indeed george was out in the kennels before breakfast brushing and combing timmy to make him look spruce and tidy for julian and dick he knew it was the day they were to set off and he was as excited as the two girls wed better eat a good breakfast said anne we might have to wait some time before our next meal lets slip off immediately after breakfast its lovely to feel free of school and bells and timetablesbut i shant feel really free till im outside the school grounds they ate an enormous breakfast though really they were too excited to want much then they got their rucksacks readypacked the night before said goodbye to miss peters and went to fetch timmy he was waiting impatiently for them and barked madly when they came near in a trice he was out of his kennelyard and capering round them almost tripping them up goodbye anne and george yelled one of their friends have a good time on your hike and its no good coming back on tuesday and telling us youve had one of your usual hairraising adventures because we just shant believe it woof said timmy woof woof which meant that he was going to have adventures with hundreds of rabbits anyway chapter two setting off julian and dick were also on their way very pleased to have such an unexpectedly long weekend i never liked willis or johnson much said dick as they walked out of the school grounds awful swotters they were never had any time for games or fun but i take my hat off to them today because of their swotting theyve won medals and scholarships and goodness knows what and weve got a weekend off in celebration good old willis and johnson hear hear said dick but i bet theyll sit in a corner with their books all the weekend they wont know if its a brilliant day like this or pouring with rain like yesterday poor mutts theyd hate to go off on a hike said julian it would be utter misery to them do you remember how awful johnson was at rugger he never knew which goal he was playing against always ran the wrong way yes but he must have got terrific brains said dick why are we talking about willis and johnson i can think of plenty of more interesting things anne and george for instance and old tim i hope theyll manage to get off in time all right julian had carefully looked up a largescale map of the moors that lay between the two schools that he and the girls went to they were vast stretches of lonely heathery land dotted with farms here and there with a few small cottages and some inns well keep right off the main roads and the secondand thirdgrades he said well take the little lanes and paths i wonder what timmy will say if we see deer hell wonder what in the world they are hell only be interested in rabbits said dick i hope hes not as fat as he was last hols i think we must have given him too many icecreams and too much chocolate well he wont get that in termtime said julian the girls dont get as much pocket money as we do buck up theres the bus they ran for the little country bus that rumbled along the country lanes taking people to market or to the tiny villages that lay here and there tucked away in the moor it stopped most obligingly for them and they leapt in ha running away from school said the conductor have to report you you know very funny said julian bored at this joke which the conductor produced regularly every time a boy got on board with a rucksack over his shoulders they had to get out at the next village and cut across country to get to another busroute they managed to catch a bus there easily and settled down comfortably in their seats it was half an hours run from there to where they had planned to meet the girls here you are young sirs called the conductor as the bus ran into a village it had a wide green on which geese cackled and a small pond for ducks you wanted pippin village didnt you we dont go any farther we just turn round and go back thanks said the boys and got out now are the girls here or not said julian they have to walk from a tiny railway station about two miles away they were not there julian and dick went to have a drink of orangeade at the village store they had hardly finished when they saw the two girls looking in at the door julian dick we guessed youd be eating or drinking said anne and she rushed at her brothers we came as quickly as we could the engine broke down it was such a funny little train all the passengers got out and advised the enginedriver what to do hallo said julian and gave anne a hug he was very fond of his young sister hallo george my youve grown fat havent you i have not said george indignantly and timmy isnt fat either so dont tell him he is julians pulling your leg as usual said dick giving george a friendly slap on the back all the same youve grown a bit youll soon be as tall as i am hallo timmy good dog fine dog tongue as wet as usual yes it is i never knew a dog with a wetter tongue than yours timmy went nearly mad with joy at being with all four of his friends he leapt round them barking wagging his long tail and sending a pile of tins crashing to the floor in his delight now now said the shopwoman emerging from a dark little room at the back take that dog out hes gone mad dont you girls want a drink of gingerbeer or something asked julian getting hold of timmys collar youd better because we dont want to have to carry heavy bottles of drinkables with us where are we going to set off to asked george yes id like gingerbeer please get down timmy anyone would think youd been away from julian and dick for at least ten years it probably does seem like ten years to him said anne i say are those sandwiches she pointed to a ledge at the back of the counter there was a little pile of sandwiches there looking most appetizing yes theyre sandwiches miss said the shopwoman opening two bottles of gingerbeer ive made them for my son who works over at blackbush farm hell be in for them soon i suppose you couldnt make us some could you asked julian we wouldnt need to bother about trying to get to some village at lunch time then they look jolly good yes i can make you all you want said the shopwoman putting two glasses down in front of the girls what do you want cheese egg ham or pork well wed like some of all of those said julian the bread looks so nice too i make it myself said the woman pleased all right ill go and make you some you tell me if anyone comes into the shop while im gone she disappeared thats good said julian if she makes plenty of those we can avoid villages all the day and have a really good day of exploration treading where no foot has trod before and all that how many can you manage each asked the woman suddenly reappearing my son he has six thats twelve rounds of bread well could you manage eight sandwiches for each of us said julian the woman looked astonished its to last us all day he explained and she nodded and disappeared again thats a nice little sum for her said anne eight sandwiches each making sixteen rounds of bread for four people well lets hope shes got a breadcutting machine said dick or well be here for keeps hallo whos this a tall man appeared at the entrance of the shop a bicycle in his hand ma he called the children guessed who he was at once the son who worked over at blackbush farm he had come for his sandwiches your mother is hard at work cutting sixtyfour rounds of bread said dick shall i get her for you no im in a hurry said the man and he set his bicycle by the door came in reached over the counter for his sandwiches and then went back to his bicycle tell my mother ive been in he said and you might tell her ill be late home today got to take some stuff to the prison he was off at once sailing away down the road on his bicycle the old woman suddenly came in a knife in one hand a loaf in the other did i hear jim she said oh yes hes got his sandwiches you should have told me he was in he said he was in a hurry explained julian and he said we were to tell you hed be late today because he had to take some stuff to the prison ive got another son there said the woman the four looked at her did she mean he was a prisoner and what prison she guessed their thoughts and smiled oh my tom isnt a prisoner she said hes a warder a fine fellow not a nice job there though im always afraid of those men in prison a fierce lot a bad lot yes ive heard there is a big prison on this moor said julian its marked on our map too were not going near it of course no dont you take the girls near there said the woman disappearing again if i dont get on with your sandwiches youll not have them before tomorrow morning only one customer came in while the children were waiting a solemn old man smoking a clay pipe he looked round the shop couldnt see the woman took a packet of blancmange powder which he slipped into his pocket and put the money down on the counter tell er when er comes he mumbled with his pipe still in his mouth and out he shuffled timmy growled the old man smelt very unwashed and timmy didnt like him at last the sandwiches were finished and the old woman appeared again she had packed them up neatly in four parcels of greaseproof paper and had pencilled on each what they were julian read what she had written and winked at the others my word were in for a grand time he said cheese pork ham and egg and whats this oh thats four slices of my homemade fruit cake said the old woman im not charging you for that its just so that you can taste it it looks like half the cake said julian touched but we shall pay for it with many thanks how much is all that she told him julian put down the money and added some extra for the cake there you are and many thanks he said and that money there was left by an old fellow with a clay pipe who took a packet of blanc mange powder that would be old man gupps said the woman well i hope youll enjoy your tour come back here if you want any more sandwiches cut if you eat all those today you wont do badly woof said timmy hoping that he too would share a few the woman produced a bone for him and he took it up in his mouth thanks julian said come on now well really start chapter three across the countryside they set off at last timmy running in front school already seemed far behind them the october sun shone down warmly and the trees in the village glowed yellow and red and golden dressed in their autumn colourings a few leaves floated down in the breeze but not until there was a real frost would many come whirling down its a heavenly day said george i wish i hadnt got my blazer on im cooked already well take it off and carry it over your shoulder said julian im going to do the same our jerseys are quite warm enough today they took off their thick blazers and carried them each of them had a rucksack a mac rolled up tightly and tied to it and now a blazer to carry but none of them noticed the weight at the outset of their day im glad you girls took my advice and wore your thickest shoes said julian looking with approval at their brogues some of our walking may be wet have you got changes of socks yes we brought everything you told us to said anne your rucksack looks a bit fuller than ours ju well ive got maps and things in it said julian its a queer place this moor miles and miles and miles of it queer names on it too blind valley rabbit hill lost lake coney copse rabbit hill timmy would love that said george and timmy pricked up his ears rabbits ah that was the kind of place he liked well actually were going towards rabbit hill now said julian and after that theres coney copse and as coney is a country word for rabbit timmy ought to enjoy himself woof said timmy joyfully and bounded ahead he felt very happy his four friends were with him their rucksacks were full of delicioussmelling sandwiches and a long long walk lay ahead teeming he hoped with rabbits it was lovely walking along in the sun they soon left the little village behind and took a winding lane the hedges on either side became so high that the four couldnt see over the tops at all what a sunken lane said dick i feel as if im walking in a tunnel and how narrow i wouldnt like to drive a car along this lane if i met another car i might have to back for miles we shant meet anyone much said julian its only in the summer that cars come along these lanes people on holiday touring round the countryside look we take that path now it leads to rabbit hill according to the map they climbed over a stile in the high hedge and walked over a field towards a curious little hill timmy suddenly went mad with excitement he could smell rabbits and he could see them too you dont often see so many rabbits out in the daytime said george surprised big ones and little ones too what a scampering they came to the hill and sat down quietly to watch the rabbits but it was quite impossible to make timmy do the same the sight and smell of so many made him quite wild he pulled away from georges hand and went bounding madly up the hill scattering rabbits by the dozen timmy yelled george but for once timmy paid no attention he rushed here and rushed there getting very angry as first one rabbit and then another neatly popped down a hole its no use calling him said dick he wont catch one anyway see how nippy they are its my belief theyre having a game with our timmy it did look rather like it as soon as timmy had chased two or three rabbits down one hole a few more would pop up from another behind him tht children laughed it was as good as a pantomime where do you mean to have lunch asked anne if we stay here much longer i shall really have to have something to eat and its not nearly time yet i wish i didnt always feel so hungry in the open air well come on then said julian weve got some way to go before we get to our lunchplace ive made a pretty good timetable of our tour were going to go all round the moors and finish at the place we started at ive really marked it all out pretty well do we sleep at farmhouses or something at night asked george i should like that will they mind having us do you think or do we go to inns farmhouses for two nights and inns for the other nights said julian ive marked them all they went up rabbit hill and down the other side there were just as many rabbits there timmy chased them till he panted like an engine going uphill his tongue hung out dripping wet youve had enough tim said george be sensible now but timmy couldnt be sensible with so many rabbits about so they left him to chase and dart and race at top speed and went on down the hill timmy came rushing after them when they got to the bottom now perhaps youll stop tearing about like a mad thing and walk with us scolded george but she spoke too soon for soon they were in a small wood which julian informed them was coney copse and as i told you coney means rabbit so you cant expect timmy to stop being mad just yet said julian they very nearly lost timmy in coney copse a rabbit disappeared down a very big hole and timmy was actually able to get down a little way then he got stuck he scrabbled violently with his feet but it was no good he was well and truly stuck the others soon discovered he wasnt with them and went back calling quite by chance they came on the hole he was in and heard the sound of panting and scraping a shower of sand flew out of the hole there he is the idiot hes down a hole said george in alarm timmy timmy come on out there was nothing that timmy would have liked better but he couldnt come out however much he tried a root of a tree had got wedged into his back and he couldnt seem to push himself out again past the annoying root it took the four children twenty minutes to get timmy out anne had to lie down and wriggle in a little way to reach him she was the only one small enough to get into the hole she caught hold of timmys back legs and pulled hard somehow the root slid off his back and he came backwards he whined loudly oh anne youre hurting him youre hurting him shouted george let him go i cant yelled back anne hell only go down deeper if i leave go his legs can you pull me out if so timmy will come too hell have to because ive got his legs poor anne was pulled out by her legs and poor timmy came too pulled by his he whined and went to george hes hurt himself somewhere said george anxiously i know he has he wouldnt whine like that if he wasnt hurt she ran her fingers over him pressing here and there she examined each leg and each paw she looked at his head still he whined where could he have hurt himself leave him said julian at last i cant see that hes hurt anywhere except in his feelings he probably didnt like anne hauling him out by his hind legs most undignified george wasnt satisfied although she could find nothing wrong she couldnt help being sure that timmy had hurt himself somewhere ought he to see a vet dont be silly george said julian vets dont grow on trees in a moorland country like this lets go on walking youll see timmy will follow quite all right and soon forget to whine i tell you hes hurt his doggy feelings thats all his vanity is wounded they left coney copse and went on george rather silent timmy trotted beside her also rather quiet still there really didnt seem anything the matter with him except that he gave sudden little whines now and again now heres where i thought we might have our lunch said julian at last fallaway hill its a good name for it too it falls away steeply and weve got a marvellous view so they had they had come to the top of a steep hill not guessing that it fell away on the other side they could sit on the tip and see the sun shining on miles and miles of lonely heathergrown moor they might see shy deer in the distance or little wild ponies this is heavenly said anne sitting down on a great tuft of heather its as warm as summer too i do hope its like this all over the weekend we shall all be burnt brown it will also be heavenly having some of those sandwiches said dick choosing a lump of heather too what comfortable seats are provided for us ive a good mind to take a tuft of this heather back to school with me to put on the very hard chair that goes with my desk julian put the four packets of sandwiches down in the heather anne undid them they looked wonderful super said anne what do you want first well speaking for myself im going to have one of each put them all on top of one another and have a huge bite of cheese ham pork and egg at once said dick anne laughed even your mouth isnt big enough for that she said but somehow dick managed though it was difficult disgusting behaviour he said when he had managed the first mouthful i think on the whole that one at a time is more economical hie timmy have a bit timmy obliged he was very quiet and george was still anxious about him still his appetite seemed remarkably good so nobody but george wondered any more if he had hurt himself he lay beside george occasionally putting a great paw on her knee if he wanted another bit of sandwich timmy does jolly well said dick with his mouth full he gets bits from us all i bet he eats more than any of us i say did anyone ever taste such smashing sandwiches have you tried the pork it must have come from a super pig it was lovely sitting there in the sun looking over miles of countryside eating hungrily they all felt very happy except george was there anything wrong with timmy it would spoil the whole weekend if so chapter four george is worried they lazed for some time in the sun after they had finished their meal there were three sandwiches each left and half a piece each of the fruit cake no one had been able to manage a whole piece much as they would have liked to timmy seemed to think he could finish all the cake that was left but julian said no its such a gorgeous cake it would be really wasted on timmy he said youve had enough tim greedy dog woof said timmy wagging his tail and eyeing the cake watchfully he sighed when he saw it being packed up he had only had a bit of georges halfslice what a cake ill pack three sandwiches and a halfslice of the cake into each of four bags said julian anyone can eat his or hers whenever they like i expect we shall have a good meal at the farmhouse ive chosen for tonight so you can eat when you like before then i dont feel as if i could eat anything till tomorrow morning said anne putting her bag of food into her rucksack but its odd how hungry you keep on getting even if you feel you cant possibly be for hours and hours well timmy can wolf anything you dont want said julian nothing wasted when tims about now are we all ready were going through a little village soon where well stop for a drink i could do with a gingerbeer and then on we go to our farmhouse we ought to try and arrive about five because it gets dark so soon whats the farmhouse called asked anne blue pond farm said julian nice name isnt it i hope its still got a blue pond suppose they havent room for us said anne oh they can always put a couple of girls somewhere said julian dick and i can sleep in a barn if necessary were not particular id like to sleep in a barn too said anne id love to lets not ask for a bedroom lets all sleep in a barn on straw or hay or something no said julian you girls will have to be in the house it gets cold at night and weve brought no rugs we boys will be all right with our macs over us im not letting you two girls do that its stupid being a girl said george for about the millionth time in her life always having to be careful when boys can do as they like im going to sleep in a barn anyway i dont care what you say ju oh yes you do said julian you know quite well that if ever you go against the orders of the chief thats me my girl in case you didnt know it you wont come out with us again you may look like a boy and behave like a boy but youre a girl all the same and like it or not girls have got to be taken care of i should have thought that boys hated having to take care of girls said george sulkily especially girls like me who dont like it well decent boys like looking after their girl cousins or their sisters said julian and oddly enough decent girls like it but i wont count you as a girl george decent or otherwise ill merely count you as a boy whos got to have an eye on him my eye see so take that look off your face and dont make yourself any more difficult than you already are george couldnt help laughing and the sulky look went at once she gave julian a punch all right you win youre so jolly domineering these days i feel quite afraid of you youre not afraid of anyone said dick youre the bravest girl i ever knew aha thats made old george blush like a girl let me warm my hands george and dick held his hands up in front of georges scarlet face pretending to warm them at her fiery blush she didnt know whether to be pleased or angry she pushed his hands away and got up looking more like a boy than ever with her short tousled hair and her wellfreckled face the others got up and stretched then they settled their rucksacks on their backs again with their macs fastened to them threw their blazers over their shoulders and set oft down fallaway hill timmy followed but he didnt bound about as usual he went slowly and carefully george looked round for him and frowned what is the matter with timmy she said look at him not a jump or a scamper in him they all stopped and watched him he came towards them and they saw that he was limping slightly with his left hind leg george dropped down beside him and felt the leg carefully i think he must have twisted it sprained it or something when he was down that rabbithole she said she patted him gently on the back and he winced whats the matter tim said george and she parted the hair on his back examining the white skin underneath to see why he had winced when she had patted him hes got an awful bruise here she said at last and the others bent to see something must have hurt his back down in that hole and anne must have hurt one of his legs when she held on to them and dragged him out i told you not to hold on to his legs anne well how were we to get him out if i didnt demanded anne feeling cross but rather guilty did you want him to stick there for days and days i dont think theres much damage done said julian feeling the hind leg i honestly think hes only just twisted it a bit george hell be all right after tonight im sure but i must be certain said george did you say we come to a village soon ju yes beacons village said julian we can ask if theres a vet anywhere in the district if you like hell look at timmys leg and tell you if theres anything much wrong but i dont think there is well go on to the village then said george oh dear the only time i ever wish timmy was a little dog is when hes hurt because hes so very very heavy to carry well dont think of carrying him yet said dick he can walk on three legs even if he cant on four hes not as bad as all that are you timmy woof said timmy mournfully he was rather enjoying all the fuss george patted his head come on she said well soon get that leg put right come on tim they all went on looking round to see how timmy was getting on he followed slowly and then began to limp more badly finally he lifted his left hind leg up from the ground and ran on three legs only poor boy said george poor timmy i do hope his leg will be all right tomorrow i cant possibly go on with the hike if it isnt it was rather a gloomy company that came to beacons village julian made his way to a little inn that stood in the middle called three shepherds a woman was shaking a duster out of a window julian called up to her i say is there a vet anywhere in this district i want someone to have a look at our dogs leg no no vet here answered the woman not one nearer than marlins over six miles away georges heart sank timmy would never be able to walk six miles is there a bus she called no not to marlins said the woman no bus goes there missy but if you want your dogs leg seen to you go up to spiggy house up along there mr gaston lives there with his horses and he knows about dogs too you take the dog there hell know what to do oh thank you said george gratefully is it very far about half a mile said the woman see that hill you go up there take the turning to the right and youll see a big house thats spiggy house you cant mistake it because of the stables built all round it ask for mr gaston hes nice he is maybe youll have to wait a little if hes out with his horses though he may not be in till its almost dark the four held a little council wed better go up to this mr gastons i think said julian but i think you and anne dick should go on to the farmhouse i planned to stay in for the night and make arrangements for us we dont want to leave it till the last minute ill go with george and timmy of course right said dick ill take anne now it will be dark pretty soon got your torch julian yes said julian and im pretty good at finding my way as you know i shall come back to this village after weve been to mr gastons and then make straight for the farmhouse its about a mile and a half away thanks awfully for saying youll come with me julian said george lets go now shall we well dick and anne see you later julian set off with george and timmy up the hill to spiggy house timmy went on three legs and still seemed very sorry for himself anne and dick watched him feeling sorry for him i hope hes all right tomorrow said dick it will spoil our weekend if hes not no doubt about that they turned away and walked through the little village of beacons now for blue pond farmhouse said dick julian didnt give me very clear directions i think ill ask someone exactly where it is but they met nobody except a man driving a little cart dick hailed him and he pulled up his horse are we on the right road for blue pond farmhouse shouted dick ar answered the man nodding his head is it straight on or do we take any paths or little lanes asked dick ar said the man nodding again what does he mean ar said dick he raised his voice again is it this way and he pointed ar said the man again he raised his whip and pointed up the road where the two were going and then across to the west oh i see we turn to the right up there called dick ar said the man nodding and drove on so suddenly that the horse almost stepped on dicks foot well if we find the farmhouse after all those ars well be clever said dick come on chapter five anne and dick it began to get dark very suddenly the sun had gone and a big black cloud slid smoothly over the sky its going to rain said dick blow i thought it was going to be a lovely evening wed better hurry said anne i hate sheltering under a hedge in the pouring rain with drips down my neck and puddles round my feet they hurried they went up the road that led out of the village and then came to a turning on the right this must be the one the man had meant they stopped and looked down it it seemed to be like one of the sunken lanes they had walked down in the morning and it looked rather dark and tunnellike now in the twilight i hope its right said dick well ask the very first person we meet if we do meet anyone said anne feeling that they never would in this curious deep lane they went up it it wound round and about and then went downhill into a very muddy bit indeed anne found herself sloshing about in thick mud a stream or something must run across the lane here she said ugh the waters got into my shoes im sure we dont go this way dick the waters quite deep farther on im certain i was up to my ankles just now dick looked about in the deepening twilight he made out something above him in the high hedge that grew on the steep bank each side look is that a stile he said wheres my torch at the bottom of my rucksack of course can you get it out anne to save me taking the thing off anne found the torch and gave it to dick he switched it on and immediately the shadows round them grew blacker and the lane seemed more tunnellike than ever dick flashed the torch upwards to what he had thought was a stile yes it is a stile he said i expect that leads up to the farmhouse a short cut probably ive no doubt this lane is the one used by the farmcarts and probably goes right round to the farm but if this is a short cut we might as well take it it must lead somewhere anyway they scrambled up the bank to the stile dick helped anne over and they found themselves in a wide field in front of them was a narrow path running between crops of some sort yes this is obviously a short cut said dick pleased i expect well see the lights of the farmhouse in a minute or fall into the blue pond first said anne rather dismally it was just beginning to rain and she was wondering if it was worth while to untie her mac from her shoulder and put it on or was the farmhouse really nearby julian had said it wasnt very far they walked across the field and came to another stile the rain was coming down fast now anne decided to put on her mac she stood under a thick bush and dick helped her on with it she had a small souwester in the pocket and put that on too dick put his on and they set off again the second stile led into another endless field and the path then came at last to a big fieldgate they climbed over it and found themselves on what looked like a heathery moor wild and uncultivated land no farmhouse was to be seen though indeed they could not have seen anything of one unless they had been very close to it because the night was on them dark and rainy if only we could see some lights somewhere shining out of a window said dick he shone his torch on to the moor in front of them i dont quite know what to do there doesnt seem a path here and i just hate the idea of going all the way back across those wet fields and into that dark little lane oh no dont lets said anne with a shiver i really didnt like that lane there must be a path somewhere its silly for a gate to open on to moorland and then as they stood there with the rain dripping on them and not much else to be heard another noise came to their ears it was so unexpected and so very startling that both of them clutched the other in a start of alarm it was certainly a strange noise to hear in that deserted bit of country bells wild clanging bells sounding without a stop jangling out over the dark countryside in peal after peal anne held on tightly to dick what is it where are those bells what are they ringing for whispered anne dick had no idea he was as startled as anne to hear this extraordinary noise it sounded some distance away but every now and again the wind blew hard and then the noise of the jangling swept round them close to them it seemed i wish theyd stop oh i wish theyd stop said anne her heart beating fast i dont like them they frighten me theyre not church bells no theyre certainly not church bells said dick theyre a warning of some kind im sure but what for fire wed see fire if there was one anywhere near us war no bells and beacons were used to warn people of war long long ago not now that village was called beacons said anne suddenly remembering do you suppose it has that name because long ago there was a nearby hill where people lighted a beacon to send a warning to other towns telling them that the enemy was coming did they ring bells too are we hearing longago bells dick they dont sound like bells ive ever heard in my life before good gracious theyre certainly not longago bells said dick speaking cheerfully though he was really just as puzzled and alarmed as anne those bells are being rung now at this very minute quite suddenly the bells stopped and an enormous silence took the place of the wild ringing the two children stood and listened for a minute or two and then heaved a sigh of relief theyve stopped at last said anne i hated them why did they ring out on this dark dark night oh do lets find blue pond farmhouse as soon as ever we can dick i dont like being lost in the dark like this with bells ringing madly for nothing at all come on said dick keep close to the hedge as long as we follow that we must come to somewhere we wont wander out on to the moorland he took annes arm and the two of them kept close to the hedge they came to another path at last and followed it that led to a lane but not a sunken one this time and then oh wonderful sight not far off they saw a light shining that must be blue pond farmhouse said dick thankfully come on anne not much farther now they came to a low stone wall and followed it till they came to a brokendown gate it opened with a squeak and anne stepped through right into an enormous puddle blow she said now im wetter than ever for a moment i thought i must have stepped into the blue pond but it was only a puddle they went round it and followed a muddy path to a little door set in a white stone wall dick thought it must be the back door nearby was a window and in it shone the light they had seen so thankfully an old woman sat near the light her head bent over some sewing the children could see her quite clearly as they stood by the door dick looked for a bell or knocker but there was none he knocked with his bare knuckles nobody answered the door remained shut they looked at the old woman by the lamp and saw that she was still sewing perhaps shes deaf said dick and he knocked again much more loudly still the old woman sewed on placidly she must indeed be deaf well never get in at this rate said dick impatiently he tried the handle of the door it opened at once well just have to walk in and announce ourselves said dick and he stepped on to the worn mat inside the door he was in a narrow little passage that led to a stone stairway steep and narrow at the farther end on his right was a door a little ajar it opened into the room where the old woman was sitting the two children could see a streak of light coming through the crack dick pushed the door open and walked boldly in followed by anne still the old woman didnt look up she pushed her needle in and out of her sewing and seemed to hear and see nothing else whatsoever dick had to walk right up to her before she knew he was in the room then she leapt up in such a fright that her chair fell over with a bang im sorry said dick upset at frightening the old lady we knocked but you didnt hear she stared at them her hand over her heart you give me such a fright she said where did you come from this dark night dick picked up her chair and she sat down in it panting a little weve been looking for this place said dick blue pond farmhouse isnt it we wondered if we could stay the night here and two others of us as well the old woman pointed to her ears and shook her head deaf as a post she said no good talking to me my dear youve lost your way i suppose dick nodded well you cant stay here said the old woman my son wont have no one here at all youd best be gone before he comes he have a nasty temper he have dick shook his head then he pointed out to the dark rainy night then pointed to annes wet shoes and clothes the old woman knew what he meant youve lost your way youre wet and tired and you dont want me to turn you out she said but theres my son you see he dont like strangers here dick pointed to anne and then to a sofa in a corner of the room then he pointed to himself and then outside again the old woman understood at once you want me to give your sister shelter but youll go out into the night she said dick nodded he thought he could easily find some shed or barn for himself but anne really must be indoors my son mustnt see either of you said the old woman and she pulled anne to what the girl thought was a cupboard but when the door opened she saw a very small steep wooden staircase leading upwards into the roof you go up there said the old woman to anne and dont you come down till i call you in the morning ill get into trouble if my son knows youre here go up anne said dick rather troubled i dont know what youll find there if its too bad come down see if theres a window or something you can call out from and then ill know if youre all right yes said anne in rather a trembling voice and she went up the steep dirty wooden stairs they led straight into a little loft there was a mattress there fairly clean and a chair a rug was folded up on the chair and a jug of water stood on a shelf otherwise the room was bare a tiny window opened out of one side anne went to it and called out dick are you there dick yes im here said dick whats it like anne is it all right listen ill find somewhere nearby to shelter in and you can always call me if you want me chapter six in the middle of the night its not bad said anne theres a fairly clean mattress and a rug ill be all right but what about if the others come dick will you look out for them i almost think george will have to sleep in a barn with you and julian if she comes that old woman wont let anyone else in im sure ill look out for them and arrange something said dick you eat the rest of your sandwiches and your cake and see if you can dry your wet feet and make yourself really comfortable theres a shed or something out here i shall be quite all right yell for me if you want me anne went back into the room she felt wet and tired hungry and thirsty she ate all her food and had a drink from the jug then she felt sleepy and lay down on the mattress throwing the rug over her she meant to listen for the others to come but she was too tired she fell fast asleep dick was prowling about down below he was careful because he didnt want to run into the old womans son he didnt like the sound of him somehow he came to a small barn with piles of straw in one corner he flashed his torch cautiously round this will do for me he thought i can be quite comfortable here in that straw poor anne i wish old george was with her id better wait about and watch for the other two or ill fall asleep and miss them once i bed down in that straw its only about six oclock too but weve had a long day i wonder how timmy is i wish he was here dick thought that probably george and julian would come in through the same gate as he and anne had used he found a brokendown shed near the gate and sat down on a box there waiting for them to come he ate his sandwiches while he waited they were very comforting he ate every one and then the cake he yawned he felt very sleepy indeed and his feet were wet and tired no one arrived at all not even the old womans son she could still be seen sewing under the lamp but after about two hours when it was almost eight oclock and dick was beginning to be very worried about george and julian the old woman got up and put away her workbasket she disappeared out of dicks sight and didnt come back but the light was still there shining out of the window left for her son probably thought dick he tiptoed to the window the rain had stopped now and the night was much clearer the stars were out and a moon was coming up dicks spirits rose he peered in at the lighted room then he saw the old woman lying on a brokendown sofa in a corner a blanket was pulled right up to her chin and she seemed to be asleep dick went back to his shed but now he felt there was no use in watching for george and julian they must have lost their way completely or else mr gaston or whatever his name was must have had to do something to timmys leg and julian had decided to stay at the inn in beacons village for the night he yawned again im too sleepy to watch any more he decided i shall fall off this box with sleep if i dont go and lie down in that straw anyway i think id hear if the others came using his torch cautiously again he made his way to the barn he shut the door behind him and bolted it roughly from the inside by running a stick through two hasps he didnt know why he did that perhaps because he was still thinking of the old womans badtempered son he flung himself down on the straw and immediately fell asleep outside the sky became clearer and clearer the moon came up not fully but large enough to give some light it shone down on the desolate little stone house and illkept outbuildings dick slept soundly he lay in the soft straw and dreamed of timmy and george and blue ponds and bells especially bells he awoke suddenly and lay for a moment wondering where he was what was this prickly stuff round him then he remembered of course it was straw and he was in a barn he was about to cuddle down again when he heard a noise lt was only a small noise a scratching on the wooden walls of the barn perhaps dick sat up were there rats there he hoped not he listened the scratching seemed to come from outside the barn not inside then it stopped after an interval it began again then there came a gentle tapping at the broken window just above dicks head he felt very startled rats scratched and scrabbled about but they didnt tap on windows who was tapping so very very cautiously on the little window he held his breath and listened straining his ears and then he heard a voice a hoarse whisper dick dick dick was amazed could it be julian if so how in the world did he know that he dick was in the barn he sat listening stiff with surprise the tapping came again and then the voice a little louder dick i know youre there i saw you go in come here to the window quiet now dick didnt know the voice it wasnt julians and it certainly wasnt either georges or annes then how did the owner know his name and that he was there it was astounding dick didnt know what to do buck up said the voice ive got to go in half a tick ive got that message for you dick decided to go nearer to the window he was quite certain that he didnt want whoever it was outside to come into the barn he cautiously knelt up in the straw and spoke just underneath the window im here he said trying to make his voice deep and grownup youve been long enough coming grumbled the one outside and then dick saw him through the window just a face dim and wildeyed with a round bulletlike head he crouched back thankful that the face couldnt see him in the darkness of the barn heres the message from nailer said the voice twotrees gloomy water saucy jane and he says maggie knows he sent you this maggies got one too a bit of paper fluttered in at the broken pane dick picked it up in a daze what was all this was he dreaming the voice came again insistent and urgent you heard all that dick twotrees gloomy water saucy jane and maggie knows too now im going there came the sound of someone cautiously creeping round the barn and then there was silence dick sat amazed and bewildered who was this wildeyed fellow who called him by his name in the middle of the night and gave him extraordinary messages that meant nothing at all to a sleepy boy but dick was wide awake now he stood up and looked out of the window there was nothing and no one to be seen except the lonely house and the sky dick sat down again and thought he put his torch on cautiously and looked at the piece of paper he had picked up it was a dirty half sheet with pencil marks on it that meant nothing to dick at all words were printed here and there but they were all nonsense to him he simply couldnt make head or tail of his visitor his message or the bit of paper im sure i must be dreaming thought dick and put the paper into his pocket he lay back in his straw cuddling in deep because he had got cold by the window he lay and thought for a while puzzling over the curious happenings and then he felt his eyes closing but before he was quite asleep he heard cautious footsteps again was that fellow back once more this time someone tried the door but the wooden stick was in the hasps whoever it was outside shook the door and the stick fell out at once the man shook the door again as if thinking it had stuck and then opened it he came inside and shut the door behind him dick caught a quick glimpse of him no this wasnt the same man as before this was a man with a head of thick hair dick hoped and prayed that he wouldnt come over to the straw he didnt he sat down on a sack and waited he talked to himself after a while but dick could only make out a word or two whats happened he heard how much longer do i wait then there was a mumble and dick could not catch a word wait wait thats all i do muttered the man and he stood up and stretched himself then he went to the door and looked out he came back and sat down on the sack again he sat still and quiet then and dick found his eyes closing once more was this part of a dream too he didnt have time to think it out because he was suddenly in a real dream walking along ringing bells and seeing trees in twos everywhere round him he slept heavily all night long when morning came he awoke suddenly and sat up he was alone in the barn where had the second visitor gone or could it all have been a dream chapter seven in the morning dick stood up and stretched himself he felt dirty and untidy also he was very hungry he wondered if the old woman would let him buy some bread and cheese and a glass of milk anne must be hungry too he thought i wonder if shes all right he went cautiously outside and looked up at the tiny window of the loft where anne had spent the night her anxious face was already there watching for dick are you all right anne called dick in a low tone she pushed open the tiny window and smiled at him yes but i darent go down because that son is downstairs i can hear him shouting at the deaf old woman every now and again he sounds very badtempered ill wait for him to go out to his work then before i go and see the old woman said dick i must pay her something for letting you sleep up in that loft and perhaps i can persuade her to let us have something to eat i wish you could said anne ive eaten all the chocolate i had in my bag shall i wait till i hear you call me dick nodded and disappeared into the barn in a hurry he had heard footsteps a man came into sight a broad short hunchedup man with a shock of untidy hair he was the man that dick had seen in the barn the night before he was muttering to himself and looked very badtempered indeed dick decided to keep out of his way he crouched down in the barn but the man did not go in there he walked past still muttering dick listened for his footsteps to die away he heard the opening of a gate somewhere then it crashed behind the man id better take my chance now thought dick and he went quickly out of the barn and up to the little white house it looked very tumbledown and neglected in the daylight and had a most forlorn air dick knew that it was no good knocking because the old woman wouldnt hear him so he walked right into the house and found the woman washing up a few dishes in a cracked old sink she stared at him in dismay id forgotten about you and the girl too is she still up there get her down quickly before my son comes back and then go both of you can you sell us some bread and cheese shouted dick but the old woman really was stone deaf and all she did was to push dick away towards the door jabbing at him with the wet cloth in her hand dick slipped aside and pointed to some bread on a table no no i tell you youre to go said the old woman obviously terrified in case her son should come back get the girl quickly but before dick could do anything there were footsteps outside and in came the hunchedup fellow with the shock of hair he was back already holding some eggs he had been to find he walked into the kitchen and stared at dick clear out he said angrily what do you want here dick thought he had better not say he had slept the night in the barn there were queer goingson here and the man might be very savage if he knew dick had slept the night nearby i wanted to know if your mother could sell us some bread he said and could have bitten his tongue out he had said us now the man would guess there was someone with him us whos us said the man looking round you fetch him and ill tell you both what i do to boys who come stealing my eggs ill go and fetch him said dick seizing the chance to get away he ran to the door the man made a clumsy dart at him and almost caught him but dick was out and away running down the path he hid behind a shed his heart thumping he had to wait for anne somehow he had to go back and get her the man stood at the door shouting angrily after dick but he didnt chase him he went back into the house and after a while came out again with a pail of steaming food dick guessed he was going to feed the chickens wherever they were he had to take this chance of fetching anne he waited till he heard the crash of the distant gate again and then he rushed to the house annes face was at the window scared she had heard all that the man had said to dick and then to his mother about allowing boys to come to the house anne come down at once hes gone shouted dick hurry annes face disappeared from the window she ran to the door tumbled quickly down the stairs and ran through the kitchen the old woman flapped a cloth at her screaming at her dick ran into the kitchen and put twenty pence on the table then he caught annes arm and both children tore out of the house and down the path they came to the hedge they had followed the night before anne was quite scared that awful man she said oh dick what a horrible place honestly i think julian must be mad to choose a place like that to sleep in for the night horrible little house and it didnt look a bit like a farm there were no cows or pigs that i could see and not even a farmdog you know anne i dont think it could possibly have been blue pond farmhouse said dick as they walked beside the hedge looking for the gate that they had come through the night before we made a mistake it was an ordinary cottage if we hadnt lost our way wed have come to the proper blue pond farmhouse im sure whatever will george and julian be thinking said anne theyll be dreadfully worried wont they wondering what has become of us do you suppose theyre at the real blue pond farmhouse well have to find out said dick do i look very messy and untidy anne i feel awful yes havent you a comb said anne your hairs all up on end and your face is very dirty look theres a little stream over there lets get our flannels out and wash our hands and faces with them they did a little washing in the cold water of the stream and dick combed back his hair you look a lot better said anne oh dear i wish we could have some breakfast im really starving i didnt sleep awfully well did you dick my mattress was so hard and i was rather scared up in that funny little room all alone before dick could answer a boy came whistling through the gate he looked astonished to see dick and anne hallo he said you hiking yes said dick can you tell me if that place up there is blue pond farmhouse he pointed back to the old womans house the boy laughed thats no farmhouse thats mrs taggarts place and a dirty old place it is dont you go there or her son will drive you off dirty dick we call him hes a terror blue pond farmhouse is down along there see past the three shepherds inn and away up to the left thanks said dick feeling very angry indeed with the man who had said ar and sent them all wrong the day before the boy waved and set off across a moorland path we certainly went the wrong way last night said dick as they walked over the fields they had crossed in the dark the night before poor anne dragging you all that way in the dark and the rain to a horrible place that wasnt blue pond farmhouse after all i cant think what julian is going to say to me well it was my fault too said anne dick lets go down to the three shepherds and telephone blue pond farmhouse from there shall we if its on the phone that is i dont somehow feel as if i want to walk for miles and perhaps not find blue pond farmhouse again good idea said dick the three shepherds was where that woman was shaking a duster out of the window wasnt it she told julian the way to spiggy house i wonder how old timmy is i hope hes better i say this hike isnt as good as we hoped it would be is it well theres still time for it to be all right said anne much more cheerfully than she felt she so badly wanted her breakfast that she felt quite badtempered well telephone to julian from the three shepherds to say what happened to us said dick as they came to the lane where they had floundered in the mud the night before he helped anne over the stile and they jumped down to the narrow road and whats more well have breakfast at the three shepherds and i bet we eat more than ever the three shepherds did whoever they were anne felt more cheerful at once she had thought they would have to walk all the way to find blue pond farmhouse before they had breakfast see a stream does flow right across the road here she said no wonder i got my feet wet yesterday come on the thought of breakfast makes my legs want to run they at last arrived in beacons village and made their way to the inn on the sign three shepherds were painted looking rather gloomy they look like i feel said anne but i shall soon feel different oh dick think of porridge and bacon and eggs and toast and marmalade we must telephone first said dick firmly and then he suddenly stopped just as he was going into the inn someone was calling him dick dick anne look there they are hey dick dick it was julians voice dick swung round in delight he saw julian george and timmy racing along the village street shouting and waving timmy was first to reach them of course and there was no sign of limping either he leapt on them barking madly and licked every bare part of them he could reach oh ju im so glad to see you said anne in rather a trembling voice we lost our way last night george is timmy all right quite absolutely said george you see have you had breakfast interrupted julian we havent we were so worried about you we were just going to see the police but now we can all have breakfast together and tell our news chapter eight all together again it was wonderful to be all together again julian took hold of annes arm and squeezed it all right anne he said rather worried at her pale face anne nodded she felt better at once now she had julian george and timmy as well as dick im only just terribly hungry she said ill ask for breakfast straight away said julian all news later the woman who had leaned out of the window shaking a duster the evening before came up to them i expect its a bit late for you said julian but we havent had any breakfast what have you got porridge and cream said the woman and our own cured bacon and our own eggs our own honey and the bread i bake myself will that do and coffee with cream i could hug you said julian beaming at her the others felt the same they went into a small cosy diningroom and sat down to wait soon a smell of frying bacon and hot strong coffee would come into the room what joy your news first said dick patting timmy did you get to spiggy house was mr gaston there no he wasnt said julian he was out somewhere he had a very nice wife who made us wait for him and said he wouldnt mind in the least looking at timmy when he came back so we waited and waited we waited till half past seven said george and we felt rather awkward because we thought it might be getting near their mealtime and then at last mr gaston came he was awfully kind said julian he looked at timmys leg and then he did something i dont know what put it back into place i suppose and timmy gave a yell and george flung herself on him and mr gaston roared with laughter at george well he was very rough with timmys leg said george but he knew what he was doing of course and now timmy is perfectly all right except for that bruise on his back and even that is getting better he can run as well as ever im glad said anne i kept thinking of poor old tim all last night she patted him and he licked her lavishly and wetly what did you do then asked dick well mrs gaston insisted on us staying to supper said julian she simply wouldnt take no for an answer and i must say that by that time we were jolly hungry so we stayed and we had a jolly good meal too so did timmy you should have seen his tummy afterwards as round as a barrel good thing its gone down today or i was thinking of changing his name to tummy they all laughed george especially idiot she said well we didnt leave till about nine oclock we didnt worry about you because we felt sure you would be safely at blue pond farmhouse and would guess wed had to wait about with timmy and when we got there and found you hadnt arrived well we were in a state and then we thought you must have found somewhere else for the night said julian but we thought if we heard nothing wed go down to the police first thing this morning and report your disappearance so down we came without any breakfast either said george that shows how worried we were blue pond farmhouse was nice they gave us a bed each in two tiny little rooms and timmy slept with me of course a wonderful smell came creeping into the little diningroom followed by the innwoman carrying a large tray on it was a steaming tureen of porridge a bowl of golden syrup a jug of very thick cream and a dish of bacon and eggs all piled high on crisp brown toast little mushrooms were on the same dish its like magic said anne staring just the very things i longed for toast marmalade and butter to come and the coffee and hot milk said the woman busily setting everything out and if you want any more bacon and eggs just ring the bell too good to be true said dick looking at the table for goodness sake help yourselves quickly girls or i shall forget my manners and grab it was a wonderful breakfast extra wonderful because they were all so ravenously hungry there wasnt a word said as they spooned up their porridge and cream sweetened with golden syrup timmy had a dishful too he loved porridge though he didnt like the syrup it made his whiskers sticky i feel better said anne looking at the porridge dish the thing is shall i have some more porridge and risk not enjoying my bacon and eggs so much or shall i go straight on with bacon and eggs a difficult question said dick and one that i am faced with too on the whole i think ill go on with bacon and eggs we can always have more of those if we want to and those little mushrooms really do make my mouth water arent we greedy but how can anyone help that when theyre so hungry you havent told us a single word of what happened to you last night said julian serving out the bacon and eggs with a generous hand now that youve got something inside you perhaps you feel able to tell us exactly why you ignored my instructions and didnt arrive where you were supposed to last night you sound like our headmaster at school said dick the plain fact is we got lost and when we did finally arrive somewhere we thought it was blue pond farmhouse and we stayed the night there i see said julian but didnt the people there tell you it wasnt the right place just so that you could have let us know you must have known that we would worry about you well the old woman there was stonedeaf explained anne attacking her bacon and eggs vigorously she didnt understand a word we said and as we thought it was blue pond farmhouse we stayed there though it was a horrible place and we were worried because you didnt arrive a chapter of accidents said julian alls well that ends well however dont sound so pompous said dick actually we had a pretty poor time ju poor anne had to sleep in a little loft and i slept in straw in a barn not that i minded that but well peculiar things happened in the night at least i think they did im not really sure it wasnt all a dream what peculiar things asked julian at once well i think perhaps ill tell you when were on our way again said dick now i think about it in full daylight i feel that either it was all a silly dream or well as i said something very peculiar you never told me dick said anne in surprise well to tell you the truth i forgot about it because other things happened said dick having to get away from that man for instance and wondering about julian and george and feeling so hungry you dont sound as if you had a good night at all said george it must have been awful too trying to find your way in the dark it poured with rain didnt it yes said anne but oh the thing that frightened me more than anything was the bells did you hear them julian they suddenly clanged out and they made me terribly scared i couldnt think what they were whatever were they ringing out for they were so loud didnt you know what they were ringing for said julian they were bells rung from the prison that nice old woman told us about they were rung to tell everyone on the countryside that a prisoner had escaped lock your doors guard your folk anne stared at julian in silence so that was why the bells had made such a clamour and clangour she shivered im glad i didnt know that she said i would have slept in the straw with dick if id known there was an escaped prisoner have they caught him i dont know said julian well ask the innwoman when she comes they asked her and she shook her head no hes not caught yet but he will be all the roads from the moor are guarded and everyone is on the watch he was a robber who broke into houses and attacked anyone who tried to prevent him a dangerous fellow julian is it all right to go hiking on the moors if theres an escaped prisoner about said anne i shant feel very comfortable weve got timmy said julian he would be strong enough to protect us from three prisoners if necessary you neednt worry woof agreed timmy at once and thumped his tail on the floor at last everyone had finished breakfast even starving anne couldnt manage the last bit of toast she sighed happily i feel myself again she announced i cant say i feel very much like walking but i know it would be good for me after that enormous meal good or not were going on our way said julian getting up ill buy some sandwiches first the innwoman was delighted with their hearty praises she gave them some packets of sandwiches and waved goodbye you come again whenever you can she said ill always have something nice for you the four went down the street and took a lane at the bottom it wound about for a short way and then came into a valley a stream ran down the middle of the valley the children could hear it gurgling from where they stood lovely said anne are we going along by the stream id like to julian looked at his map yes we could he said ive marked the path to follow and the stream joins it some way on so if you like we could go along by it though it will be very rough walking they made their way to the stream now dick said julian when they had left the path what about telling us all those peculiar things that happened in the night theres nobody about to hear not a soul in sight lets hear everything well soon tell you whether it was a dream or not right said dick well heres the tale it does sound pretty queer listen chapter nine dick surprises the others dick began his tale but it really was very difficult to hear it because they couldnt walk four abreast as there was no path to follow in the end julian stopped and pointed to a thick clump of heather lets go and sit there and hear dicks story properly i keep missing bits no one can hear us if we sit here they sat down and dick started again he told about the old woman who was afraid her son would be angry if she let them stay the night he told about his bed in the straw and now here comes the bit i think must have been a dream he said i woke up to hear a scratching noise on the wooden walls of the barn rats or mice said george and timmy leapt up at once of course he was sure she had said the words to him i thought that too said dick but then i heard a gentle taptaptapping on the window how horrid said anne i shouldnt have liked that at all neither did i said dick but the next thing i heard was my name being called dick dick just like that it must have been a dream then said anne there was no one there who knew your name dick went on well then the voice said dick i know youre there i saw you go in and it told me to go to the window go on said julian he was puzzled no one in the world but anne could have known that dick was in the barn and it certainly wasnt anne out there in the night well i went to the window said dick and i saw rather dimly of course a wildeyed looking fellow he couldnt see me in the darkness of the barn i just mumbled im here hoping he would think i was whoever he wanted what did he say next asked george he said something that sounded stuff and nonsense said dick he said it twice it was twotrees gloomy water saucy jane and he said maggie knows just like that there was a silence then george laughed twotrees gloomy water saucy jane and maggie knows about it well it must have been a dream dick you know it must what do you think julian well it does sound a bit nonsensical to have someone come in the middle of the night and call dick by name and give him a strange message that doesnt mean a thing to him said julian it sounds more dreamlike than real id say it was a dream too dick began to think they were right and then a sudden thought struck him he sat up straight wait a bit he said ive remembered something the man slipped a bit of paper through the broken pane of the window and i picked it up ah thats different said julian now if you cant find that paper its all a dream and you dreamt the paper too but if you can fmd it well the whole thing is true very peculiar indeed but true dick searched quickly in his pockets he felt paper in one of them and drew it out it was a dirty crumpled piece with a few words on it and a few lines he held it out to the others in silence his eyes shining is this the paper asked julian my word so you didnt dream it after all then he took the paper four heads bent over it to examine it no five because timmy wanted to see what they were all so interested in he thrust his hairy head between julians and dicks i cant make any sense of this paper said julian its a plan of some kind i think but what of or where its impossible to know the fellow said that maggie had one of these bits of paper too said dick remembering who in the wide world is maggie said george and why should maggie know any more to tell asked julian intensely interested now well the son of the deaf old woman came into the barn later on said dick and he sat and waited and waited and muttered and muttered and then when i woke up he wasnt there so i thought i must have dreamt him too he didnt see me of course julian pursed up his lips and frowned then anne spoke excitedly dick ju i think i know why the second man came into the barn it was the second man that the wildeyed man wanted to give the message to and the bit of paper not to dick he didnt want dick but he had seen him creep into the barn and i suppose he thought dick was the man he really wanted and that he was in the barn waiting for him thats all very well but how did he know my name asked dick he didnt know it he didnt know it was you at all said anne excitedly the other mans name must have been dick too dont you see they must have planned to meet there the wildeyed man and the old womans son and the first man saw dick go in so he waited a bit and then went and tapped on the window and when he called dick dick of course dick thought it was he that he wanted and he took the message and everything and then the other man the real dick came along and was too late to meet the first one our dick had met him and got the message anne was quite breathless after this long speech she sat and stared at the others eagerly didnt they think she was right they did of course julian clapped her on the back well worked out anne of course thats what happened dick suddenly remembered the boy they had met on the way down from the old womans cottage to beacons village the whistling boy what had he said about the old woman and her son anne what did that whistling boy say wait a bit he said that was mrs taggarts place and he said wed better not go there or her son would drive us off and he said yes i remember now he said dirty dick we call him hes a terror dirty dick his name must be dick then why didnt i think of it before that proves that anne is right said julian pleased anne looked pleased too it wasnt often that she thought of something clever before the others did they all sat thinking would this have anything to do with the escaped prisoner said george at last it might said julian he might have been the prisoner himself that fellow who came with the message did he say who the message was from yes said dick trying to remember he said it was from nailer i think that was the name but it was all given in whispers you know a message from nailer said julian well perhaps nailer is in prison a friend of the man who escaped and maybe when he knew this fellow was going to make a dash for it he gave him a message for someone the man at that old cottage son of the old woman they may have had a prearranged plan how do you mean asked dick looking puzzled well the old womans son dirty dick may have known that when the bells rang out this fellow was making a run for it and would come to bring him a message he was to wait in the barn at night if the bells rang just in case it was nailers friend who had escaped yes i see said dick i think youre right yes im sure you are my word im glad i didnt know that fellow at the window was an escaped convict and youve got the message from nailer said anne what a peculiar thing just because we lost our way and went to the wrong place you get a message from a prisoner given you by one whos escaped its a pity we dont know what the message means or the paper either had we better tell the police said george i mean it may be important it might help them to catch that man yes said julian i think we should tell the police lets have a look at our map wheres the next village he looked at the map for a minute i think really we might as well go on with what i had planned he said i planned we should reach this village here reebles look in time for lunch in case we hadnt got sandwiches wed have gone there for drinks anyway so i vote we just carry on with our ramble and call in at reebles police station if there is one and tell them our bit of news they all got up timmy was glad he didnt approve of this long sitdown so soon after breakfast he bounded ahead in delight his legs quite all right said anne pleased well i hope it teaches him not to go down rabbit holes again it didnt of course he had his head down half a dozen within the next halfhour but fortunately he could get no farther and he was able to pull himself out quite easily the four saw little wild ponies that day they came trotting over a hillock together small and brown with long manes and tails looking very busy indeed the children stopped in delight the ponies saw them tossed their pretty heads turned one way all together and galloped off like the wind timmy wanted to go after them but george held his collar tightly no one must chase those dear little wild ponies lovely said anne lovely to meet them as suddenly as that i hope we meet some more the morning was as warm and sunny as the day before once again the four of them had to take off their blazers and timmys tongue hung out wet and dripping the heather and wiry grass was soft underfoot they followed the stream closely liking its brown colour and its soft gurgling voice they bathed their hot feet in it as they ate one of their sandwiches at half past eleven this is bliss said george lying back on a tuft of heather with her feet lapped by the water the stream is tickling my feet and the sun is warming my face lovely oh get away timmy you idiot breathing down my neck like that and making my face so wet the stream at last joined the path that led to the village of reebles they walked along it beginning to think of dinner it would be fun to have it in a little inn or perhaps a farmhouse and keep their sandwiches for teatime but first we must find the policestation said julian well get our tale told and then well be ready for our meal chapter ten an angry policeman and a fine lunch there was a policestation at reebles a small one with a house for the policeman attached as the one policeman had four villages under his control he felt himself to be rather an important fellow he was in his house having his dinner when the children walked up to the policestation they found nobody there and walked out again the policeman had seen them from his window and he came out wiping his mouth he wasnt very pleased at having to come out in the middle of a nice meal of sausage and onions what do you want he said suspiciously he didnt like children of any sort nasty little things he thought them always full of mischief and cheek he didnt know which were worse the small ones or the big ones julian spoke to him politely weve come to report something rather strange which we thought perhaps the police ought to know it might help them to catch the prisoner who escaped last night ha said the policeman scornfully youve seen him too i suppose you wouldnt believe how many people have seen him cording to them hes been in every part of the moor at one and the same time clever fellow he must be to split himself up like that well one of us saw him last night said julian politely at least we think it must have been him he gave a message to my brother here ho he did did he said the policeman eyeing dick in a most disbelieving manner so he runs about giving messages to schoolboys does he and what message did he give you may i ask the message sounded extremely silly when dick repeated it to the police twotrees gloomy water saucy jane and maggie knows really said the policeman in a sarcastic voice maggie knows as well does she well you tell maggie to come along here and tell me too id like to meet maggie specially if shes a friend of yours shes not said dick feeling annoyed that was in the message i dont know who maggie is how should i we thought perhaps the police could unravel the meaning we couldnt the fellow gave me this bit of paper too he handed the piece of dirty paper to the policeman who looked at it with a crooked smile so he gave you this too did he he said now wasnt that kind of him and what do you suppose all this is scribbled on the paper we dont know said dick but we thought our report might help the police to catch the prisoner thats all the prisoners caught said the policeman with a smirk on his face you know so much but you didnt know that yes hes caught four hours ago and hes safe back in prison now and let me tell you youngsters this im not taken in by any silly schoolboy spoofing see its not spoofing said julian in a very grownup manner you should learn to see the difference between the truth and a joke that didnt please the policeman at all he turned on julian at once his face reddening now you run away he said im not having any cheek from you do you want me to take your names and addresses and report you if you like said julian in disgust have you got a notebook there ill give you all our names and i myself will make a report to the police in our district when i get back the policeman stared at him he couldnt help being impressed by julians manner and he calmed down a little you go away all of you he said his voice not nearly so fierce i shant report you this time but dont you go spreading silly stories like that or youll get into trouble serious trouble too i dont think so said julian anyway seeing that you are not going to do anything about our story may we have back our bit of paper please the policeman frowned he made as if he would tear the paper up but dick snatched at it he was too late the aggravating policeman had torn it into four pieces and thrown it into the road dont you have laws against scattering litter in your village asked dick severely and carefully picked up the four pieces of paper the policeman glared at dick as he put the bits into his pocket then he made a peculiar snorting noise turned on his heel and marched back to his sausages and onions and i hope his dinners gone cold said george horrid fellow why should he think were telling a lot of untruths it is rather a queer story of ours said julian after all we found it a bit dificult to believe when dick first told it i dont blame the policeman for disbelieving it i blame him for his manner its a good thing most of our police arent the same nobody would ever report anything he told us one bit of good news anyway said anne that escaped prisoner is back in prison again im so relieved to know that i am too said dick i didnt like the look of him at all well ju what do we do now forget the whole business do you think theres anything in that message to follow up and if so can we do anything i dont know said julian we must think a bit lets go and see if we can scrounge a meal in some farmhouse somewhere there seem to be plenty around they asked a little girl if there was a farmhouse anywhere near that would give them dinner she nodded and pointed see that farmhouse up on the hill there thats my grans place shell give you dinner i expect she used to give dinner in the summer to trippers and i expect she would give you some too if you ask her though its late in the season thanks said julian and they all went up the lane that curved round the hillside dogs barked loudly as they came near and timmys hackles went up at once he growled friends timmy friends said george dinner here timmy dinner perhaps a nice bone for you bone timmy understood the fur down his neck lay flat again and he stopped growling he wagged his tail at the two dogs near the farmgate who sniffed his doggysmell suspiciously even when he was some distance away a man hailed them what do you kids want mind those dogs we wondered if we could get a meal here called back julian a little girl down in the village said we might ill ask my mother said the man and he yelled in an enormous voice to the farmhouse nearby ma ma four kids out here want to know if you can give them a meal a very fat old lady appeared with twinkling eyes and red cheeks like an apple she took one glance at the four by the gate and nodded her head yes they look decent children tell them to come along in better hold their dogs collar though the four walked to the farmhouse george holding timmy firmly the other two dogs came up but as timmy was hoping for a bone he was determined to be friendly and not a single growl came from him even when the two dogs growled suspiciously he wagged his tail and let his tongue hang out the other dogs soon wagged theirs and then it was safe to let timmy go he bounded over to them and there was a mad game of chasemerollmeover as george called it come your ways in said the plump old lady now youll have to take what weve got im busy today and havent had time for cooking you can have a bit of homemade meatpie or a slice or two of ham and tongue or hardboiled eggs and salad bless you you look as pleased as punch ill put the lot on the table for you and you can help yourselves will that do theres no vegetables though youll have to make do with pickled cabbage and my own pickled onions and beetroot in vinegar it sounds too marvellous for words said julian we shant want any sweet after that theres no pudding today said the old lady but ill open a bottle or two of our own raspberries and you can have them with cream if you like and theres the cream cheese i made yesterday too dont tell us any more begged dick it makes me feel too hungry why is it that people on farms always have the most delicious food i mean surely people in towns can bottle raspberries and pickle onions and make cream cheese well either they cant or they dont said george my mother does all those things and even when she lived in a town she did anyway im going to when im grownup it must be so wonderful to offer homemade things by the score when people come to a meal it was extraordinary to think that any children could possibly eat the meal the four did after having had such a huge breakfast timmy ate an enormous dinner too and then lay down with a sigh how he wished he could live at that farmhouse how lucky those other two dogs were a small girl came in shyly as they ate im meg she said i live with my gran what are your names they told her then julian had an idea were walking over your moor he said weve been to lots of nice places but theres one we havent been to yet do you know it its called two trees the little girl shook her head gran would know she said gran wheres twotrees the old lady looked in at the door whats that twotrees oh that was a lovely place once but its all in ruins now it was built beside a queer dark lake in the middle of the moors lets see now what was it called gloomy water said dick yes thats right gloomy water said the old lady are you thinking of going by there you be careful then theres marshland around there just when you least expect it now would you like anything more no thank you said julian regretfully and paid the very modest bill its the nicest lunch weve ever had now we must be off off to twotrees and gloomy water i hope george whispered to dick that would be really exciting chapter eleven julians idea once outside the farmhouse julian looked round at the others well find out how far twotrees is and see if weve got time to pay it a visit he said if we have well go along there and snoop round if we havent well go tomorrow how can we find out how far it is said dick eagerly will it be on your map it may be marked there if the lake is big enough said julian they walked down the hill and took a path that led once more over the moors as soon as they were out of sight and hearing of anyone julian stopped and took out his big map he unfolded it and the four of them crouched over it as he spread it out on the heather that nice old lady said it was in the middle of the moors said julian also we know theres a lake or at any rate a big pool of some kind his finger traced its way here and there on the map then george gave a cry and dabbed her finger down there look its not really in the middle see gloomy water that must be it is twotrees marked as well no said julian but perhaps it wouldnt be if its in ruins ruins arent marked on maps unless they are important in some way this cant be important well thats certainly gloomy water marked there what do you say shall we have a shot at going there this afternoon i wonder exactly how far it is we could ask at the postoffice said george probably once upon a time the postman had to take letters there they might know they could tell us the way to go they went back to the village and found the postoffice it was part of the village store the old man who kept it looked over the top of his glasses at the children gloomy water now what be you wanting that for a real miserable place it is for all it was so fine years ago what happened to it asked dick it was burnt said the old man the owner was away and only a couple of servants were there it flared up one night no one knows how or why and was burnt almost to a shell couldnt get a fireengine out there you see there was only a carttrack to the place and wasnt it ever built up again asked julian the old man shook his head no it wasnt worth it the owner just let it fall to rack and ruin the jackdaws and the owls nest there now and the wild animals snuggle in the ruins its a queer place i once went out to see it hearing tales of lights being seen there but there was nothing to see but the shell of the place and the dark blue water ah gloomy waters a good name for that lake could you tell us the way and how long would it take us to get there asked julian what for do you want to go and gaze at a poor old ruin said the old man or do you want to bathe in the lake well dont you do so its freezing cold we just thought wed go and see gloomy water said julian such a strange name which is the way did you say i didnt say said the old fellow but i will if so be youre set on it wheres your map is that one in your hand julian spread it out the old fellow took a pen from his waistcoat pocket and began to trace a path over the moor he put crosses here and there see them crosses they mark marshland dont go treading there or youll be up to your knees in muddy water you follow these paths ive inked in for you and youll be all right keep your eyes open for deer theres plenty about those parts and pretty things they are too thank you very much said julian folding up the map how long would it take us to get there from here matter of two hours or more said the old man dont you try to go this afternoon youll find yourselves in darkness coming back and with them dangerous marshy bits youre in danger all the time right said julian thanks very much er were thinking of doing a bit of camping as the weather is so beautiful i suppose you couldnt hire us a groundsheet or two and a few rugs the other three stared at him in astonishment camping out where why what was julian thinking of all of a sudden julian winked at them the old man was ferreting about in a cupboard he pulled out two large rubber groundsheets and four old rugs thought i had them somewhere he said well better you camping out in october than me be careful you dont catch your deaths of cold oh thanks just what we want said julian pleased roll them up you others ill settle up for them dick anne and george folded up the groundsheets and the rugs in astonishment surely surely julian wasnt thinking of camping out by gloomy water he must think the message that dick had been given was very important julian said dick as soon as they got outside whats up whats all this for julian looked a little sheepish well something suddenly came over me in the store he said i suddenly felt we ought to go to gloomy water and snoop round i felt excited somehow and as weve got so little time this weekend i thought if we took things and camped out in the ruin we might make more of our few days what an idea said george not go on with our hiking do you mean well said julian if we find nothing we can go on with our hike of course but if theres anything interesting its up to us to unearth it im quite sure theres something up at twotrees we might meet maggie there said anne with a giggle we might said julian i feel quite free to go and investigate on our own seeing that weve made our report to the police and its been turned down with scorn somebody ought to follow up that message besides maggie dear maggie said dick i wonder who in the wide world she is somebody worth watching if shes the friend of convicts said julian more soberly look this is what i thought wed do buy some extra food and go along to gloomy water this afternoon arriving there before dark well find a good place to shelter in there must be some good spot in the old ruin and get heather or bracken for beds then tomorrow we can be up bright and early to have a look round it sounds smashing said dick pleased sort of thing we like what do you say tim woof said tim solemnly bumping his tail to and fro across dicks legs and if we find theres absolutely nothing of interest well we can come back here with the things weve borrowed and go on with our hike said julian but well have to sleep the night there because it will be dark by the time weve had a look round they bought some loaves of bread some butter and potted meat and a big fruit cake also some more chocolate and some biscuits julian bought a bottle of orangeade as well theres sure to be a well he said or a spring of some sort we can dilute the orangeade and drink it when were thirsty now i think were ready come on they couldnt go as fast as usual because they were carrying so many things timmy was the only one that ran as fast as ever but then timmy carried nothing but himself it was a really lovely walk over the moorlands they climbed fairly high and had wonderful views all over the autumn countryside they saw wild ponies again in the distance this time and a little herd of dappled deer that sped away immediately julian was very careful to take the right paths the ones traced so carefully on the map by the old man in the postoffice i expect he knew the way well because he was once a postman and had to take letters to twotrees said dick bending over the map were getting on ju halfway there the sun began to sink low the children hurried as much as they could because once the sun had gone darkness would soon come fortunately the sky was very clear so twilight would be later than it had been the night before it looks as if the moorland near here gives way soon to a little bit of wooded country according to the map said julian well look out for clumps of trees after another little stretch of moorland julian pointed to the right look he said trees quite a lot a proper little wood and isnt that water over there said anne they stood still and gazed hard was it gloomy water it might be it looked such a dark blue they hurried on eagerly it didnt look very far now timmy ran ahead his long tail waving in the air they went down a little winding path and joined a carttrack that was very much overgrown so overgrown that it hardly looked like a track this must lead to twotrees said julian i wish the sun wasnt going down so quickly well hardly have any time to look round they entered a wood the track wound through it the trees must have been cleared at some time to make a road through the wood and then quite suddenly they came on what had once been the lovely house of twotrees it was a desolate ruin blackened and scorched with fire the windows had no glass the roof had gone except for a few rafters here and there two birds flew up with a loud cry as the children went near two maggies said anne with a laugh they were black and white magpies their long tails stretched out behind them i wonder if they know the message too the house stood on the edge of the lake gloomy water was indeed a good name for it it lay there smooth and dark a curious deep blue no little waves lapped the edge it was as still as if it were frozen i dont like it said anne i dont like this place at all i wish we hadnt come chapter twelve a hiding place at twotrees nobody particularly liked the place they all stared round and julian pointed silently to something at each end of the house was the great burnt trunk of a big tree those must be the two trees that gave the place its name said julian how horrid they look now so stiff and black twotrees and gloomy water all so lonely and desolate now the sun disappeared and a little chill came on the air julian suddenly became very busy come on we must see if theres anywhere to shelter at all in this old ruin they went to the silent house the upper floors were all burnt out the ground floor was pretty bad too but julian thought it might be possible to find a sheltered corner this might do he said coming out of a blackened room and beckoning the others to him there is even a mouldy carpet still on the floor and theres a big table we could sleep under it if it rained which i dont think it will do what a horrid room said anne looking round i dont like its smell either i dont want to sleep here well find somewhere else then but be quick about it said julian it will soon be dark im going to collect heather and bracken straight away before its too dark coming dick and george the three of them went off and came back with vast armfuls of heather and brown bracken anne met them looking excited ive found somewhere somewhere much better than this horrid room come and look she took them to what once had been the kitchen a door lay flat on the floor at the end of the room and a stone staivvay led downwards that leads down to the cellars said anne i came in here and saw that door it was locked and i couldnt open it well i tugged and tugged and the whole door came off its rusty old hinges and tumbled down almost on top of me and i saw there were cellars down there she stared at julian beseechingly theyll be dry they wont be burnt and black like everywhere else well be wellsheltered cant we sleep down there i dont like the feel of these horrid burnt rooms its an idea said julian he switched on his torch and let the beam light up the cellar below it seemed spacious and smelt all right he went down the steps timmy just in front he called up in surprise theres a proper room down here as well as cellars all round maybe it was a kind of sittingroom for the staff its wired for electricity too they must have had their own electricity generator yes well certainly come down here it was a queer little room motheaten carpets were on the floor and the furnishings were motheaten too and covered with dust spiders had been at work and george slashed fiercely at the long cobwebs that hung down and startled her by touching her face there are still candles in the candlesticks on this shelf said dick surprised we can light them and have a bit of brightness when its dark this isnt bad at all i must say i agree with anne theres something hateful about those burntout rooms they piled heather and bracken into the cellar room on the floor the furniture was so old and motheaten that it gave beneath their weight and was useless for sitting on the table was all right though they soon set out their food on it after george had wiped it free of dust she caused them all to have fits of choking because she was so vigorous in her dusting they were driven up into the kitchen till the dust had settled it was dark outside now the moon was not yet up the wind rustled the dry leaves left on the trees around but there was no laplap of water the lake was as still as glass there was a cupboard in the cellar room julian opened it to see what was there more candles good he said bringing out a bundle and plates and cups did anyone see a well outside if so we could dilute some orangeade and have a drink with our supper no one had noticed a well but anne suddenly remembered something queer she had seen in a corner of the kitchen near the sink i believe i saw a pump up there she said go and see ju if so it might still work he went up the cellarsteps with a candle yes anne was right that was an old pump over there in the corner it probably pumped water into a tank and came out of the kitchen taps he turned on a big tap which was over the large sink then he took the handle of the pump and worked it vigorously up and down splash splash water came flooding through the big tap and splashed into the sink that was good julian pumped and pumped feeling that he had better get rid of any water running into the tank for the first time for years the tank might be dirty or rusty he must wash it round with a good deal of pumped water first the water seemed to be clean and clear and was certainly as cold as ice julian held a cup from the cellar cupboard under the tap and then tasted the water it was delicious good for you anne he called going down the cellarsteps with a cupful of water dick you find some more cups or a jug or something in that cupboard and well wash them out and fill them with water for our orangeade the cellar room looked very cheerful as julian came down the steps george and anne had lighted six more candles and stuck them about here and there the light they gave was very pleasant and they also warmed the room a little well i suppose as usual everyone wants a meal said julian good thing we bought that bread and potted meat and stuff i cant say im as hungry as i was at breakfast but im getting that way the four squatted round on their beds of heather and bracken they had put down their groundsheets first in case the floor was damp though it didnt seem to be over bread and butter and potted meat they discussed their plans they would sleep there for the night and then have all the next day to examine twotrees and the lake what exactly are we looking for asked anne do you suppose theres some secret here julian yes said julian and i think i know what it is what asked george and anne surprised dick thought he knew julian explained well we know that a prisoner called nailer sent an important message by his escaped friend to two people one he wanted to send to dirty dick but he didnt get it and the other to maggie whoever she is now what secret does he want to tell them i think i can guess said dick but go on now suppose that nailer has done some big robberies said julian i dont know what jewellery robberies probably because they are the commonest with big criminals all right he does a big robbery he hides the stuff till he hopes the hue and cry will be over but hes caught and put into prison for a number of years but he doesnt tell where the stuff is hidden he darent even write a letter to tell his friends outside the prison where it is all his letters are read before they leave the prison so what is he to do wait till someone escapes and then give him a message said dick and thats just what happened isnt it julian that roundheaded man i saw was the escaped prisoner and he was sent to tell dirty dick and maggie where the stolen goods were hidden so that they could get them before anyone else did yes im sure thats it said julian his friend the escaped prisoner probably wouldnt understand the message at all but dirty dick and maggie would because they knew all about the robbery and now maggie will certainly try to find out where the stuff is well we must find it first said george her eyes gleaming with excitement were here first anyway and tomorrow as early as possible well begin to snoop round what was the next clue in the message dick after twotrees and gloomy water saucy jane said dick sounds a silly sort of clue said anne do you suppose maggie and jane are both in the secret saucy jane sounds more like a boat to me said dick of course said george a boat why not theres a lake here and i imagine that people dont build a house beside a lake unless they want to go boating and bathing and fishing i bet we shall find a boat called saucy jane tomorrow and the stolen goods will be inside it too easy said dick and not a very clever place either anyone could come across goods hidden in a boat no saucy jane is a clue but we shant find the stolen goods in her and remember theres that bit of paper as well it must have something to do with the hidingplace too i should think where is it asked julian that wretched policeman he tore it up have you still got the pieces dick of course said dick he fished in his pocket and brought them out four little pieces anyone got some gummed paper nobody had but george produced a small roll of elastoplast strips were cut and stuck behind the four portions of paper now it was whole again they all examined it carefully look four lines drawn meeting in the centre said julian at the outer end of each line theres a word so faintly written i can hardly read one of them whats this one tock hill and this next one is steeple whatever are the others they made them out at last chimney said anne thats the third and tall stone is the fourth said george whatever do they all mean we shall never never find out well sleep on it said julian cheerfully its wonderful what good ideas come in the night it will be a very interesting little problem to solve tomorrow chapter thirteen a night in the cellar the piece of paper was carefully folded and this time julian took it for safe keeping i cant imagine what it means but its clearly important he said we may quite suddenly come on something or think of something that will give us a clue to what the words and the lines mean on the paper we mustnt forget that dear maggie has a copy of the paper too said dick she probably knows better than we do what it all means if she does she will pay a visit to twotrees too said anne we ought to keep a lookout for her should we have to hide if we saw her julian considered this no he said i certainly dont think we should hide maggie cant possibly guess that we have had the message from nailer and the paper too we had better just say we are on a hike and found this place and thought we would shelter here all perfectly true and we can keep an eye on her and see what she does if she comes said dick with a grin wont she be annoyed she wouldnt come alone said julian thoughtfully i should think it quite likely that she would come with dirty dick he didnt get the message but she did and probably part of her message was the statement that dirty dick would know everything too so she would get in touch with him yes and be surprised that he hadnt got the message or the paper said george still theyd think that the escaped fellow hadnt been able to get to dirty dick all very complicated said anne yawning i cant follow any more arguments and explanations im half asleep how long are you going to be before you settle down dick yawned too im coming now he said my bed of bracken and heather looks inviting its not at all cold in here is it the only thing i dont like is the thought of those cellars beyond this little underground room said anne i keep thinking that maggie and her friends might be there waiting to pounce on us when we are asleep youre silly said george scornfully really silly do you honestly suppose that timmy would lie here quietly if there was anyone in those cellars you know jolly well he would be barking his head off yes i know all that said anne snuggling down in her heathery bed its just my imagination you havent got any george so you dont bother about imaginary fears im not really scared while timmy is here but i do think its funny the way we always plunge into something peculiar when were together adventures always do come to some people said dick youve only got to read the lives of explorers and see how they simply walk into adventures all the time yes but im not an explorer said anne im an ordinary person and id be just as pleased if things didnt keep happening to me the others laughed i dont expect anything much will happen this time said julian comfortingly we go back to school on tuesday and thats not far off not much time for anything to happen he was wrong of course things can happen one after the other in a few minutes still anne cuddled down feeling happier this was better than last night when she was all alone in that horrid little loft now she had all the others with her timmy too anne and george had one big bed between them they drew their two rugs over themselves and put their blazers on top too nobody had undressed because julian had said that they might be too cold in just their night things timmy as usual put himself on georges feet she moved them because he was heavy he wormed his way up the bed and found a very comfortable place between the knees of the two girls he gave a heavy sigh that means hes planning to go to sleep said george are you quite comfortable anne yes said anne sleepily i like timmy there i feel safe julian was blowing out the candles he left just one burning then he got into his bed of bracken and heather beside dick he felt tired too the four slept like logs nobody moved except timmy who got up once or twice in the night and sniffed round inquiringly he had heard a noise in the cellars he stood at the closed door that led to the cellars and listened his head on one side he sniffed at the crack then he went back to bed satisfied it was only a toad timmy knew the smell of toads if toads liked to crawl about in the night they were welcome to the second time he awoke he thought he heard something up in the kitchen above he padded up the steps his paws making a clickclickclick as he went he stood in the kitchen silently his eyes gleaming like green lamps as the moon shone on him an animal with a long bushy tail began to slink away outside the house it was a fine fox it had smelt unusual smells near the old ruin the scent of people and of a dog and it had come to find out what was happening it had slunk into the kitchen and then smelt the strong scent of timmy in the room below as quietly as a cat it had slunk out again but timmy had awakened now the dog stood watching and waiting but the fox had gone timmy sniffed its scent and padded to the door he debated whether to bark and go after the fox the scent grew very faint and timmy decided not to make a fuss he padded back to the steps that led down to the cellar room and curled up on georges feet again he was very heavy but george was too tired to wake up and push him off timmy lay with one ear cocked for a while and then went to sleep again with his ear still cocked he was a good sentinel it was dark in the cellar when the one candle went out there was no daylight or sunshine to wake the children down in that dim little room and they slept late julian woke up first he found his bed suddenly very hard and he turned over to find a comfortable place the heather and bracken had been flattened with his weight and the floor below was very hard indeed the movement woke him up and he lay blinking in the darkness where was he he remembered at once and sat up dick woke too and yawned dick its halfpast eight said julian looking at the luminous hands of his wristwatch weve slept for hours and hours they rolled out of their heathery bed timmy leapt off georges feet and came over to them his tail wagging gladly he had been halfawake for a long time and was very glad to see julian and dick awake too because he was thirsty the girls awoke and soon there was a great deal of noise and activity going on anne and george washed at the big stone sink the cold water making them squeal timmy lapped up a big bowlful of water gladly the boys debated whether or not to have a splash in the lake they felt very dirty dick shivered at the thought still i think we ought to he said come on ju the two boys went down to the lakeside and leapt in it was icycold they struck out strongly and came back glowing and shouting by the time they were back the girls had got breakfast in the cellar room it was darker than the kitchen but all of them disliked the look of the burnt scorched rooms above the bread and butter potted meat cake and chocolate went down well in the middle of the meal a sound came echoing into the old house bells anne stopped eating and her heart beat fast but they were not the clanging warning bells she had heard before church bells said julian at once seeing annes sudden look of fright lovely sound i always think oh yes said anne thankfully so it is its sunday and people are going to church id like to go too on this lovely sunny october day we might walk across the moor to the nearest village if you like said dick looking at his watch but we should be very late it was decided that it was much too late they pushed their plates aside and planned what to do that day the first thing of course is to see if theres a boathouse and find out if theres a boat called saucy jane said julian then wed better try and puzzle out what that plan means we could wander here and there and see if we can find tall stone and ill look at the map to see if tock hill is marked that was on the plan too wasnt it you boys go and get some more heather and bracken while we clear away and wash up said anne that is if you mean us to camp here another night yes i think we will said julian i think we may find things rather interesting here this weekend julian went out with dick and they brought in a great deal more bedding everyone had complained that the hard floor came through the amount of heather and bracken they had used the night before and poor george was quite stiff the girls took the dirty things up to the big sink to wash them there was nothing to dry them with but that didnt matter they laid them on the old worn draining board to dry they wiped their hands on their hankies and then felt ready for exploring round outside the boys were ready too with timmy bounding here and there they went down to the lake a path had once led down to it with a low wall on each side but now the wall was broken moss had crept everywhere and the path was choked with tufts of heather and even with small bushes of gorse the lake was as still and dark as ever some moorhens chugged across it quickly disappearing under the water when they saw the children now what about that boathouse said dick at last is there one or not chapter fourteen where is the saucy jane they walked beside the lakeside as best they could it was difficult because bushes and trees grew right down to the edge it seemed as if there was no boathouse at all and then george came to a little backwater leading off the lake look she called heres a sort of river running from the lake its not a river its only a little backwater said dick now we may find a boathouse somewhere here they followed the backwater a little way and then julian gave an exclamation there it is but its so covered up with ivy and brambles that you can hardly see it they all looked where he pointed they saw a long low building built right across the backwater where it narrowed and came to an end it was almost impossible to tell that it was a building it was so overgrown thats it said dick pleased now for the saucy jane they scrambled through bushes and brambles to get to the entrance of the building it had to be entered by the front which was over the water and completely open a broad ledge ran right round the boathouse inside and the steps that went up to it from the bank outside were all broken away completely rotted have to tread warily here said julian let me go first he tried the old wooden steps but they gave way beneath him at once hopeless he said lets see if theres any other way into the boathouse there wasnt but at one side some of the wooden boards that made the wall of the boathouse were so rotten that they could be pulled away to make an opening the boys pulled them down and then julian squeezed through the opening into the dark musty boathouse he found himself on the broad ledge that went round the great shed below him was the dark quiet water with not even a ripple on it he called to the others come along in theres a wooden ledge to stand on here and its hardly rotted at all it must be made of better wood they all went through the opening and stood on the ledge peering down their eyes had to get used to the darkness at first because the only light came through the big entrance at the farther end and that was obscured by big trails of ivy and other creepers hanging down from roof to water there are boats here said dick excited tied up to posts look theres one just below us lets hope one of them is the saucy jane there were three boats two of them were half full of water and their bows were sunk right down must have got holes in them said julian peering about he had got out his torch and was shining it all round the old boathouse oars were strung along the walls dirty pulpy masses of something lay on the shelves too rotted cushions probably a boathook stood in one corner ropes were in coils on a shelf it was a dreary desolate sight and anne didnt like the queer echoes of their voices in the dampsmelling lonely boathouse lets see if any of the boats are called saucy jane said dick he flashed his torch on to the nearest one the name was almost gone what is it said dick trying to decipher the faded letters merry something meg said anne merry meg well she may be a sister of saucy jane whats the next boats name the torch shone steadily on to it the name there was easier to read they all read it at once cheeky charlie brother to merry meg said dick well all i can say is that these poor old boats look anything but merry or cheeky im sure the last one must be saucy jane said anne excited i do hope it is they went along the broad ledge and tried to read the name on the halfsunk boat there it begins with c said george disappointed im sure its c julian took out his handkerchief and dipped it in the water he rubbed at the name to try and clean it and make it clearer it could be read then but it wasnt saucy jane careful carrie read the four mournfully blow merry meg cheerful charlie careful carrie said julian well its quite obvious that saucy jane belongs to the family of boats here but where oh where is she sunk out of sight suggested dick dont think so said julian the water is pretty shallow in this boathouse its right at the very end of the little backwater you see i think we should be able to spot a boat sunk to the bottom we can see the sandy bottom of the backwater quite clearly by the light of our torches just to make quite sure they walked carefully all rouncl the broad wooden ledge and flashed their torches on the water that filled the boathouse there was no completely sunken boat there at all well thats that said dick the saucy jane is gone where why and when they flashed their torches round the walls of the boathouse once more georges eye was caught by a large flat wooden thing standing upright on the ledge at one side of the house whats that she said oh a raft isnt it thats what those paddles are for then that i saw on the shelf above they went and examined the raft yes and in quite good condition too said julian it would be rather fun to see if it would carry us on the water ooooh yes said anne thrilled that would be super i always like rafts id rather try that raft than any of those boats well theres only one boat that is possible to use said julian the others are obviously no good they must have big holes in to sink down like that hadnt we better look into them carefully just to make sure theres no loot hidden there said dick if you like said julian but i think its saucy jane thats got the loot otherwise why mention it by name in that message dick felt that julian was right all the same he went to examine the three boats most methodically but except for rotted and burst cushions and coils of rope there was nothing to be seen in the boats at all well wheres the saucy jane said dick puzzled all the family are here but her can she be hidden anywhere on the banks of the lake thats an idea said julian who was trying to shift the big raft thats a really good idea i think we ought to explore all round the lake and see if we can find the saucy jane hidden anywhere lets leave the raft for a bit then said george feeling thrilled at the thought of possibly finding the saucy jane tucked away somewhere all the loot hidden in her lets go now they made their way round the wooden ledge to the opening they had made in the side of the boathouse and jumped down timmy leapt down gladly he hadnt liked the dark boathouse at all he ran into the warm sunshine wagging his tail now which side of the lake shall we go first said anne the left or the right they went down to the edge of the silent water and looked to left and right they both seemed to be equally thick with bushes its going to be difficult to keep close to the edge of the water said julian anyway well try the left side looks a bit easier come on it was fairly easy at first to keep close to the water and examine any tiny creek or look under overhanging bushes but after about a quarter of a mile the undergrowth became so very thick and grew so close to the waters edge that it was quite impossible to force their way through it without completely ruining their clothes i give up said julian at last i shall have no jersey left in a minute these spiteful brambles my hands are ripped to bits yes they are spiteful said anne i felt that too timmy was the only one really enjoying himself he couldnt imagine why the four were scrambling through such thick undergrowth but as it was just what he liked he was very pleased he was disappointed when they decided to give up and go back shall we try the right hand side of the lake do you think said julian as they went back rather disheartened no dont lets said anne it looks even worse than this side its only waste of time id rather go out on the raft well that would surely be a better way of exploring the banks of the lake than scrambling through prickly bushes wouldnt it said george wed only need to paddle along slowly and squint into all the little creeks and under overhanging trees it would be easy of course said dick we were silly not to think of it before it would be a lovely way of spending the afternoon anyway they came through the trees and saw the ruined house in the distance timmy suddenly stopped he gave a low growl and all the others stopped too whats up timmy said george in a low voice what is it timmy growled again the others cautiously retreated behind bushes and looked intently towards the house they could see nothing out of the way nobody seemed to be about then what was timmy growling at and then a woman came in sight and with her was a man they were talking earnestly together maggie i bet its maggie said julian and the other is dirty dick said dick i recognize him yes its dirty dick chapter fifteen maggie and dirty dick they watched the couple in the distance and thought quickly julian had been expecting them so he was not surprised dick was looking at dirty dick recognizing the broad short man with his hunchedup shoulders and shock of hair he didnt like the look of him any more than when he had seen him up at the old cottage anne and george didnt like the look of the woman either she was wearing trousers and had a jacket draped round her shoulders she was also wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette she walked quickly and they could hear her voice it was sharp and determined so thats maggie thought julian well i dont like her she looks as hard as nails a good companion for nailer he moved cautiously towards the other three george had her hand on timmys collar afraid that he might show himself listen said julian youre none of you to turn a hair well just walk out into the open talking cheerfully together and let them see us if they ask us what were doing you all know what to say chatter nonsense as much as you like put them off and make them think were a bunch of harmless kids if there are any leading questions asked us leave me to answer them ready they nodded then julian swung out from the bushes and walked into the open calling to dick here we are again theres the old house my word it looks worse than ever this morning george and timmy came bounding out together and anne followed her heart beating fast she wasnt as good as the others at this sort of thing the man and the woman stopped abruptly when they saw the children they said a few words to one another very rapidly the man scowled the children went towards them chattering all the time as julian had ordered the woman called sharply to them who are you what are you doing here just hiking said julian stopping its our halfterm what do you want to come here for then asked the woman this is private property oh no said julian its only a burnout ruin anyone can come we want to explore this queer lake it looks exciting the man and the woman looked at one another it was clear that the idea of the children exploring the lake was surprising and annoying to them the woman spoke again you cant explore this lake its dangerous people are forbidden to bathe in it or use a boat we werent told that said julian looking astonished we were told how to get here and no one said the lake was forbidden youve been told wrongly we want to watch the moorhens you see put in anne suddenly seeing a moorhen on the water were fond of nature and weve been told there are deer near here said george and wild ponies said dick we saw some yesterday they were really lovely have you seen any this sudden burst of chatter seemed to annoy the man and the woman more than julians answers the man spoke roughly stop this nonsense people arent allowed here clear out before we make you why are you here then if people arent allowed asked julian and a hard tone came into his voice dont talk to us like that you clear off i say cried the man suddenly shouting loudly as he lost his temper he took two or three steps towards them looking very threatening indeed george loosed her hold on timmys collar timmy also took two or three steps forward his hackles went up and he emitted a most fearsome growl the man stopped suddenly and then retreated take hold of that dogs collar he ordered he looks savage then he looks what he is said george im not taking hold of his collar while youre about dont think it timmy took two or three more steps forward growling loudly walking stiffly and menacingly the woman called out at once its all right children my friend here just lost his temper for a moment call your dog back not while you are about said george how long are you staying whats that to do with you growled the man but he didnt say any more because timmy at once growled back lets come and have something to eat said julian loudly to the others after all we have as much right to be here as these people have we dont need to take any notice of them and we shant be in their way the four children marched forward timmy was still loose he barked savagely once or twice as he came close to the unpleasant couple and they shrank back at once timmy was such a big dog and he looked so very powerful they eyed the children angrily as they went by and watched them go into the ruined house on guard timmy said george as soon as they were in pointing to the ruined doorway timmy understood at once and stood in the doorway a menacing figure with hackles up and snarling mouth the children went down to the cellar room they looked round to see if anyone had been there while they were away but nothing seemed to have been moved they probably havent even noticed the cellars said julian i hope theres plenty of bread left im hungry i wish to goodness we were going to have a dinner like the one we had yesterday i say what an unpleasant pair maggie and dick are yes very said dick i cant bear maggie horrid common voice and hard face ugh i think dirty dick is worse said anne he looks like a gorilla or something with his broad hunchedup body and why doesnt he cut his hair fancies himself like that i expect said george cutting a loaf of bread his surname ought to be golliwog or tarzan im jolly glad weve got timmy so am i said anne good old timmy he hated them didnt he i bet they wont come near the doorway with timmy there i wonder where they are said dick picking up a great hunk of bread and butter and potted meat im going to look he came back in half a minute theyve gone to the boathouse i think he said i just caught a sight of one of them moving in that direction looking for saucy jane i expect lets sit down and eat and talk over what well do next said julian and what we think they will do next thats quite important they may be able to read the clues on that paper better than we can if we watch what they do it may give us a guide as to what we must do thats true said dick i imagine that the plan nailer sent must mean something to dirty dick and maggie just as the message did he chewed at his bread thinking hard trying once more to fathom the meaning of that mysterious piece of paper i think on the whole we will follow out our original plan for this afternoon said julian after a little silence well get out that raft and go on the lake with it its a harmless looking thing to do we can examine the banks as we go and if maggie and dick are out in a boat too we can keep an eye on them as well yes good idea said george its a heavenly afternoon anyway id love to paddle about on the lake with that raft i hope its good and sound sure to be said dick the wood its made of is meant to last pass the cake george and dont save timmy any its wasted on him it isnt said george you know he loves it yes but i still say its wasted on him said dick good thing we got such an enormous cake are there any biscuits left plenty said anne and chocolate too good said dick i only hope our food will last us out it wont if george has her usual colossal appetite what about yours said george indignantly rising every time to dicks lazy teasing shut up you two said julian im going to fill the water jug and have some orangeade give me something to take to old tim they spent about half an hour over their lunch then they decided to go and tackle the raft in the boathouse and see if they could possibly launch it on the lake it would be heavy they knew they left the old house and went off to the boathouse julian suddenly caught sight of something out on the lake look he said theyve got one of the boats out of the boathouse the one that wasnt halfsunk i suppose dirty dick is rowing hard i bet theyre looking for the saucy jane they all stood still and watched dicks heart sank would maggie and dirty dick get there first and find what he and the other three were looking for did they know where the saucy jane was come on said julian wed better get going if we want to keep an eye on them they may be rowing to where the saucy jane is hidden they climbed in through the wooden side of the boathouse and went to the raft julian saw at once that one of the boats had gone merry meg it was the only boat that was fit to take the four began to manhandle the big raft they took it to the edge of the ledge it had ropehandles on each side which the children held on to now ease her gently said julian gently does it down she goes and down she went landing with a big splash in the water she bobbed there gently a strong sound raft eager to go out on the lake get the paddles said julian then well be off chapter sixteen out on the raft there were four little paddles dick got them and gave everyone one each timmy looked down solemnly at the raft what was it surely he was not expected to ride on that bobbing floating thing julian was on the raft already holding it steady for the others he helped anne on and then george stepped down dick came last well not quite last because timmy was not yet on come on tim said george its all right its not the kind of boat youre used to but it acts in the same way come on timmy timmy jumped down and the raft bobbed violently anne sat down suddenly with a giggle oh dear timmy is so sudden keep still tim there isnt enough room on this raft for you to walk all over it julian pushed the raft out of the boathouse it knocked against the wooden ledge as it went and then swung out on to the backwater outside it floated very smoothly here we go said julian paddling deftly ill steer dick none of you need to paddle till i say so i can paddle and steer at the moment till we get on to the lake itself they were all sitting on the raft except timmy who was standing up he was very interested in seeing the water flow past so quickly was this a boat then he was used to boats but in boats the water was never quite so near timmy put out a paw into the water it was pleasantly cool and tickled him he lay down with his nose almost in the water youre a funny dog timmy said anne you wont get up too suddenly will you or youll knock me overboard julian paddled down the little backwater and the raft swung out on to the lake itself the children looked to see if there was any sign of maggie and dirty dick there they are said julian out in the middle rowing hard shall we follow them if they know where the saucy jane is theyll lead us to it yes follow them said dick shall we paddle now well have to be quick or we may lose them they all paddled hard and the raft suddenly swung to and fro in a most alarming manner hey stop shouted julian youre all paddling against one another were going round in circles dick and anne go one side and george the other thats better watch how were going all of you and stop paddling for a moment if the raft swings round too much they soon got into the way of paddling so that the raft went straight ahead it was fun they got very hot and wished they could take off their jerseys the sun was quite warm and there was no wind at all it was really a perfect october afternoon theyve stopped rowing said george suddenly theyre looking at something do you suppose they have got a bit of paper like the one we have with the same marks and are examining it i wish i could see they all stopped paddling and looked towards the boat in which maggie and dirty dick sat they were certainly examining something very carefully their heads were close together but they were too far away for the children to see if they were holding a piece of paper come on well get as close to them as we can said julian beginning to paddle again i expect it will make them absolutely mad to see us so close but we cant help that they paddled hard again and at last came up to the boat timmy barked maggie and dirty dick at once looked round and saw the raft and the four children they stared at them savagely hallo cried dick waving a paddle we took the raft out it goes well does your boat go all right maggie went red with rage youll get into trouble for taking that raft without permission she shouted whose permission did you ask when you took that boat shouted back julian tell us and well ask their permission to use this raft george laughed maggie scowled and dirty dick looked as if he would like to throw his oars at them keep away from us he shouted we dont want you kids spoiling our afternoon we like to be friendly called dick and made george laugh again maggie and dirty dick had a hurried and angry conversation they glared at the raft and then maggie gave an order to dirty dick he took up the oars again and began to row looking rather mutinous come on follow said julian so the four began to paddle again following after the boat maybe well learn something now but they didnt dirty dick rowed the boat towards the west bank and the raft followed then he swung out into the middle again and again the raft followed the children panting in their efforts to keep up dirty dick rowed right across to the east bank and stayed there till the children came up then he rowed off again having some nice exercise arent you called the woman in her harsh voice so good for you all the boat swung out to the middle of the lake again dick groaned blow my arms are so tired i can hardly paddle what are they doing im afraid theyre just leading us on a wild goose chase said julian ruefully they have evidently made up their minds that they wont look for the saucy jane while were about theyre just tiring us out well if thats what theyre doing im not playing said dick and he put down his paddle and lay flat on his back his knees drawn up panting hard the others did the same they were all tired timmy licked each one sympathetically and then sat down on george she pushed him off so violently that he nearly fell into the water timmy right on my middle cried george surprised and indignant you great clumsy dog you timmy licked her all over shocked at being scolded by george she was too exhausted to push him away whats happened to the boat asked anne at last im too tired to sit up and see julian sat up groaning oh my back now where is that wretched boat oh there it is right away down the lake making for the landingplace by the house or for the boathouse probably theyve given up the search for the saucy jane for the time being anyway thank goodness said anne perhaps we can give it up too till tomorrow anyhow stop snuffling down my neck timmy what do you want us to do julian i think wed better get back said julian its too late now to start searching the banks of the lake and anyway somehow i think it wouldnt be much use the two in the boat didnt appear to be going anywhere near the banks except when they began to play that trick on us to make us tired out well lets get back then said george but i simply must have a rest first timmy i shall push you into the water if you keep sitting on my legs there was a sudden splash george sat up in alarm timmy was not on the raft he was swimming in the water looking very pleased with himself there he thought hed rather jump in than be pushed said dick grinning at george you pushed him in said george looking fierce i didnt said dick he just took a header hes having a jolly good time i say what about putting a rope round him and getting him to pull us to shore it would save an awful lot of paddling george was just about to say what she thought of that idea when she caught dicks sly grin she kicked out at him dont keep baiting me dick ill push you in in a minute like to try asked dick at once come on id like a wrestle to see whod go into the water first george of course always rose to a challenge she never could resist one she was up in a moment and fell on dick who very nearly went overboard at once shut up you two said julian crossly we havent got a change of clothing you know that and i dont want to take you back with bronchitis or pneumonia stop it george george recognized the tone in his voice and she stopped she ran her hand through her short curls and gave a sudden grin all right teacher she said and sat down meekly she picked up her paddle julian picked up his well get back he said the suns sinking low it seems to slide down the sky at a most remarkable speed in october they took a very wet timmy on board and began to paddle back anne thought it was a truly lovely evening she gazed dreamily round as she paddled the lake was a wonderful dark blue and the ripples they made turned to silver as they ran away from the raft two moorhens said crekcrek and swam round the raft in curiosity their heads bobbing like clockwork anne gazed over the tops of the trees that grew at the lakeside the sky was turning pink away in the distance on a high slope about a mile away she saw something that interested her it looked like a high stone she pointed at it look julian she said whats that stone is it a boundary mark or something it must be very big julian looked where she was pointing where he said oh that i cant imagine what it is it looks like a very tall stone said dick suddenly catching sight of it too a tall stone repeated anne wondering where she had heard that before a tall oh of course it was printed on that plan wasnt it on the piece of paper dick was given tall stone dont you remember yes so it was said dick and he stared at the faraway stone monument with interest then as the raft swung onwards high trees hid the stone it was gone tall stone said julian it may be only a coincidence of course it wants a bit of thinking about though funny we should suddenly spot it would the loot be buried there asked george doubtfully julian shook his head oh no he said it is probably hidden in some position explained by that mysterious map paddle up everyone we really must get back chapter seventeen tit for tat when they arrived at the boathouse there was no sign of maggie or dick but their boat was in the shed tied up in front of the other two where it had been before theyre back all right said julian i wonder where they are dont lets drag this clumsy heavy raft into the boathouse i dont feel as if ive any strength left in my arms lets drag it under a bush and tie it there they thought this a good idea they pulled the raft up to some thick bushes and tied it firmly to a root that was sticking out of the ground then they made their way to the ruined house keeping a sharp lookout for maggie and dick there was still no sign of them they went in timmy first he didnt growl so they knew it was safe he led the way to the cellar steps then he growled whats up said julian are they down there tim timmy ran straight down the steps into the cellar room he growled again but it was not the fierce growl he always gave when he wanted to warn that enemies or strangers were near it was an angry annoyed growl as if something was wrong i expect dear maggie and dirty dick have been down here and found out where our headquarters are said julian following timmy down the steps he switched on his torch the beds of heather and bracken were there as they had left them and their macs and rugs and rucksacks nothing seemed to have been disturbed julian lighted the candles on the mantelpiece and the dark little underground room came to life at once whats the matter with timmy asked george coming down into the room hes still growling timmy whats up i expect he can smell that the others have been down here said dick look at him sniffing all round its quite clear that someone has been here anyone hungry asked anne i could do with some cake and biscuits right said julian and opened the cupboard where they had put the food they had bought there was none there except for the crockery and one or two odds and ends that had been in the cupboard before there was nothing the bread had gone the biscuits the chocolate everything blow said julian angrily look at that the beasts theyve taken all our food every bit not even a biscuit left we were mad not to think they might do that clever of them said dick they know we cant stay here long without food its a good way of chasing us out its too late to go and get any tonight anyway and if we go tomorrow for some theyll do what they have come to do in their own good time when were not here everyone felt distinctly down in the dumps they were hungry and tired and a good meal would have made all the difference anne sank down on her bed of heather and sighed i wish id left some chocolate in my rucksack she said but i didnt leave any there at all and poor tim hes hungry too look at him sniffing in the cupboard and looking round at george tim theres nothing for you the cupboard is bare where are those two wretches gone suddenly said julian fiercely ill tick them off ill tell them what i think of people who come and rifle cupboards and take away all the food woof said timmy in full agreement julian went angrily up the stairs he wondered again where maggie and dirty dick were he went to the empty doorway and looked out then he saw where they were two small tents had been put up under some thickly growing trees so thats where the two were going to sleep he debated whether or not to go and tell them what he thought of people who stole food he decided that he would but when he got over to the tents with timmy there was no one there rugs were laid inside and there was a primus stove and a kettle and other odds and ends at the back of one tent was a pile of something covered by a cloth julian had a good look into each tent and then went to see if he could find out where maggie and dirty dick had gone he saw them at last walking through the trees they must have gone for an evening stroll he thought they didnt come back to the tents but sat down by the lake julian gave up the thought of tackling them and went back to the others timmy was left behind snufiling about happily theyve got tents julian informed the others when he was back in the cellar room again theyre obviously staying put till theyve got what they came for they arent in the tents theyre out by the lake wheres timmy asked george you shouldnt have left him behind ju they might do something to him here he is said julian as a familiar noise of claws clattering on the ground came to their ears timmy came down the stone steps and ran to george hes got something in his mouth said george in surprise timmy dropped it into her lap she gave a yell its a tin of shortbread where did he get it from julian began to laugh he must have taken it from one of the tents he said i saw something covered up with a cloth in one tent their food i imagine well well tit for tat they took our food and now timmy is taking theirs fair exchange is no robbery grinned dick serves them right i say tims gone again he was back in a minute with something large and papercovered it was a big cake the four roared with laughter timmy youre a wonder you really are timmy was pleased at this praise off he went again and brought back a cardboard box in which was a fine porkpie the children could hardly believe their eyes its a miracle said anne just as i had made up my mind to starve for hours a porkpie of all things lets have some well i have no second thoughts about it said julian firmly they took our food and we deserve some of theirs good gracious dont say tims gone again he had he was enjoying himself thoroughly he arrived this time with a packet of ham and the children couldnt imagine how he had stopped himself from eating some on the way fancy carrying it in his mouth and not even tasting a bit said dick tims a better person than i am id just have to have had a lick i say we ought to stop him now said julian as timmy ran up the steps again his tail wagging nineteen to the dozen were getting a bit too much in exchange oh do see what he brings back this time begged anne then stop him he came back carrying an old flour bag in which something had been packed timmy carried it cleverly by the neck so that nothing had fallen out george undid the bag homemade scones and buns she said timmy you are very very clever and you shall have a wonderful supper but you are not to go and take any more things because weve got enough see no more lie down and be a good dog and eat your supper timmy was quite willing he wolfed ham and scones and a slice of cake and then he went up into the kitchen jumped into the sink and lapped the water lying there he then jumped down and went to the doorway to look out he barked then he growled loudly the children rushed up the stone steps at once outside at a safe distance was dirty dick have you been taking anything of ours he shouted no more than you have been taking of ours shouted back julian fair exchange you know and all that how dare you go into our tents raged the man his shock of hair making him look very peculiar in the twilight we didnt the dog fetched and carried for us said julian and dont you come any nearer hes just longing to fly at you and i warn you hell be on guard tonight so dont try any funny tricks hes as strong and savage as a lion grrrr said timmy so fiercely that the man started back in fright he went off without another word shaking with anger julian and the others went back to finish a very delicious supper timmy went with them but he planted himself at the top of the cellar steps not a bad place for him to be in tonight said julian i dont trust that couple an inch we can give him one of our blazers to lie on i say this has boiled up into quite an adventure hasnt it it seems frightful to think well be back at school on tuesday we must find the loot first said anne we really must lets get out that plan again ju lets make sure that tall stone is marked on it they got it out and put it on the table they bent over it once more yes tall stone is marked at the end of one of the lines said julian tock hill is at the end of the opposite line lets get the map and see if there is a tock hill they got the map and studied it anne suddenly put her finger down on it there it is on the opposite side of the lake from where we saw the tall stone tock hill on one side tall stone on the other surely that means something it does of course said julian it is bearings given to show the whereabouts of the hidden goods there are four bearings given tall stone tock hill chimney and steeple listen said dick suddenly listen i know how to read that map its easy the others looked at him in surprise and doubt read it then said julian tell us what it all means i dont believe you can chapter eighteen a very exciting time lets take all the clues we know said dick looking excited two trees thats here gloomy water thats where the hidden stuff must be saucy jane its a boat that contains the stuff hidden somewhere on gloomy water go on said julian as dick paused to think maggie is the next clue well shes here probably an old friend of nailers said dick she knows all the clues too he jabbed his finger at the piece of paper now for these clues listen we saw tall stone when we were out on the lake didnt we very well there must be some spot on the lake from where we can see not only tall stone but also tock hill chimney and steeple whatever they are there must be only one spot from which we can see all those four things at the same time and thats the spot to hunt in for the treasure there was an astonished silence after this julian drew a long breath and clapped dick on the back of course what idiots we were not to see it before the saucy jane must be somewhere on or in the lake at the spot where all four clues are seen at the same time weve only got to explore and find out yes but dont forget that maggie and dirty dick know what these clues mean too theyll be there first if they possibly can said dick and whats more if they get the goods we cant do anything about it were not the police theyll be off and away with their find and disappear completely everyone began to feel intensely excited i think wed better set off early tomorrow morning said julian as soon as its light otherwise maggie and dick will get in first i wish to goodness we had an alarm clock well go on the raft and well paddle about till we see tall stone again then well keep that in sight till we see tock hill whatever that is said dick and once weve spotted that well keep both tall stone and tock hill in sight and paddle round to fmd out where we can see a steeple and then a chimney i should think that would be the one chimney left on two treeshouse did you notice there is just one left sticking up high yes i noticed said anne what a clever way to hide anything dick nobody could possibly know what the clues meant unless they knew something of the secret this is awfully exciting they talked about it for some time and then julian said they really must try and go to sleep or they would never wake up early enough in the morning they settled down in their beds of heather and bracken timmy lay on julians blazer on the top step of the stairs leading down to the cellar room he seemed to think it was quite a good idea to sleep there that night they were all tired and they fell asleep very quickly nothing disturbed them in the night the fox came again and looked into the old house but timmy didnt stir he merely gave a small growl and the fox fled his bushy tail spread behind him the morning came and daylight crept in at the burntout doorway and windows timmy stirred and went to the door he looked towards the two tents no one was about there he went to the cellar steps and clattered down waking dick and julian at once whats the time said julian remembering immediately that he was to wake early halfpast seven wake up everyone its daylight weve heaps to do they washed hurriedly combed out their hair cleaned their teeth and tried to brush down their clothes anne got ready some snacks for them ham scones and a piece of shortbread each they all had a drink of water and then they were ready to go there was no sign of anyone near the two tents good said julian well be there first they dragged the raft out and got on to it taking up the paddles then off they went timmy too all feeling tremendously excited well paddle out to where we think we were last night when anne caught sight of tall stone said julian so they paddled valiantly though their arms were stiff with yesterdays paddling and it was really very painful to use the tired muscles all over again they paddled out to the middle of the lake and looked for tall stone it didnt seem anywhere to be seen they strained their eyes for it but for a long time it was not to be spotted at all then dick gave a cry its just come into sight look when we passed those tall trees on the bank yonder tall stone came into view it was behind them before that good said julian now im going to stop paddling and keep tall stone in sight if it goes out of sight ill tell you and you must backpaddle dick can you possibly paddle and look out for something that could be tock hill on the opposite side i darent take my eyes off tall stone in case it disappears right said dick and paddled while he looked earnestly for tock hill got it he said suddenly it must be it look over there a funny little hill with a pointed top julian can you still see tall stone yes said julian keep your eyes on tock hill now its up to the girls george paddle away and see if you can spot steeple i can see it now already said george and for one moment the boys took their eyes off tall stone and tock hill and looked where george pointed they saw the steeple of a faraway church glinting in the morning sun good good good said julian now anne look for chimney look down towards the end of the lake where the house is can you see its one chimney not quite said anne paddle just a bit to the left the left i said george yes yes i can see the one chimney stop paddling everyone were here they stopped paddling but the raft drifted on and anne lost the chimney again they had to paddle back a bit until it came into sight by that time george had lost her steeple at last all four things were in view at once and the raft seemed to be still and unmoving on the quiet waters of the lake im going to drop something to mark the place said julian still keeping his eyes desperately on tall stone george can you manage to watch tall stone and steeple at the same time i simply must look what im doing for the moment ill try said george and fixed her eyes first on tall stone then on steeple then on tall stone again hoping and praying that neither would slip out of sight if the raft moved on the water julian was busy he had taken his torch and his pocketknife out of his pocket and had tied them together with string i havent enough string dick he said youve got some havent you dick had of course he put his hand into his pocket still keeping his eyes on tock hill and passed his string over to julian julian tied it to the end of the string that joined together the knife and torch then he dropped them into the water letting out the string as they went down with their weight the string slid through his hands it stopped in a short while and julian knew that the knife and torch had reached the bed of the lake he felt in his pockets again he knew he had a cork somewhere that he had carved into a horses head he found it and tied the end of the string firmly round it then he dropped the cork thankfully into the water it bobbed there held by the string which led right down to the knife and torch on the lakebed below its done he said with a sigh of relief take your eyes off everything ive marked the place now so we dont need to glue our eyes on the four bearings he told them how he had tied together his knife and torch and dropped them on string to the bottom of the lake and then had tied a cork to the other end so that it would bob and show them the place they all looked at it jolly clever ju said dick but once we slide away from this spot and it would be an easy thing to do wed find it jolly difficult to find that cork again hadnt we better tie something else to it i havent got anything else that will float said julian have you i have said george and she handed him a little wooden box i keep the threepenny bits i collect in that she said putting the money into her pocket you can have the box it will be much easier to see than the cork julian tied the box to the cork it was certainly a good deal easier to see fine he said now were quite all right we must be right over the loot they all bent over the edge of the raft and looked down and they saw a most surprising sight below them resting on the bottom of the lake was a boat it lay there in the shadows of the water its outline blurred by the ripples the raft made but quite plainly it was a boat the saucy jane said julian peering down feeling amazed and awed to think that they had read the bearings so correctly that they were actually over the saucy jane herself the nailer must have come here with the stolen goods got out the saucy jane and rowed her to this spot he must have taken his bearings very carefully indeed and then holed the boat so that she sank down with the loot in her then i suppose he swam back to shore most ingenious said dick really he must be a jolly clever fellow but i say julian how on earth are we going to get the boat up i cant imagine said julian i simply cant imagine i hadnt even thought of that timmy suddenly began to growl the four looked up quickly to see why they saw a boat coming over the water towards them the merry meg with maggie and dirty dick in it and the children felt quite certain that both were reading the bearings on their piece of paper in exactly the same way as they themselves had they were so engrossed in watching for tall stone tock hill chimney and steeple that they took no notice of the children at all i dont think they guess for one moment that weve read the bearings and marked the place said julian how wild theyll be when they find we are right over the place theyre looking for watch out for trouble chapter nineteen maggie and dick are annoyed the boat in which maggie and dirty dick were rowing went this way and that as the two searched for the same objects that the children had already spotted the four watched them and george put her hand on timmy to stop him barking the boat came nearer and nearer maggie was trying to keep in view two or three of the bearings at once and her head twisted from side to side continually the children grinned at one another it had been hard enough for the four of them to keep all the bearings in view it must be very dificult for maggie especially as dirty dick didnt seem to be helping very much they heard maggie give sharp orders as the boat swung this way and that then it headed for them dirty dick growled something to maggie who had her back to them and she turned round sharply losing the view of the things she was looking for her face was full of anger when she saw the raft so near and in the place where she wanted her boat to go afraid of completely losing the view of the things she was keeping her eyes on she turned back again and hastily looked to see if tock hill tall stone and steeple were still all to be seen together she said something in a furious voice to dirty dick and he nodded with a sour face the boat came nearer and they heard maggie say i think i can see it now yes a bit farther to the right please shes spotted one chimney now whispered anne i expect theyve got all the bearings oh dear the boat will bump right into us it did dirty dick rowed viciously at them and the bows of the boat gave them a terrific jolt anne would have fallen into the water if julian hadnt grabbed at her he yelled at dirty dick look out you ass you nearly had us over what on earth do you think youre doing get out of the way then growled dirty dick timmy began to bark savagely and the boat at once drew away from the raft theres plenty of room on this lake shouted julian what do you want to come and disturb us for we arent doing any harm were going to report you to the police called the woman her face red with anger taking a raft that doesnt belong to you sleeping in a house where youve no right to be and stealing our food dont talk nonsense cried julian and dont you dare to ram us again if you do ill send our dog after you hes longing to come grrrr said timmy and showed his magnificent set of gleaming white teeth dirty dick muttered something quickly to maggie she turned round again and called to them now look here you kids be sensible my friend and i have come down here for a quiet weekend and it isnt nice to find you four everywhere we go go back and keep out of our way and we wont report you at all thats a fair bargain we wont even say anything about your stealing our food were going back when we think we will answered julian and no threats or bargains will make any difference to us there was a silence then maggie spoke hurriedly to dirty dick again he nodded is this your halfterm she called when do you have to go back tomorrow said julian youll be rid of us then but were going to enjoy ourselves on this raft while we can there was another hurried conference between the two then dirty dick rowed round a little and maggie began to peer down into the water she suddenly looked up nodded at dirty dick and he rowed away again towards the end of the lake not another word did the couple say i can see what theyve decided to do said julian in a pleased voice they think well be gone by tomorrow so theyll wait till the coast is clear and then theyll come and collect the loot in peace did you see maggie looking down into the water to spot the boat i was afraid she would also spot our mark the cork and the box but she didnt i dont know why you sound so pleased said george we cant get the boat up you know that and i dont feel pleased that well have to leave tomorrow and let that horrid pair collect the loot i imagine theyll have some clever grownup way of pulling up the boat from the bed of the lake which they will do when weve gone tomorrow youre not very bright today george said julian watching the boat being rowed farther and farther away i told them wed be gone tomorrow hoping they would clear off and wait and leave us time to get the loot ourselves i think we can how said three voices at once and timmy looked inquiringly at julian too well we dont need to pull up the boat said julian we only want the loot whats to prevent us from going down and getting it im quite prepared to strip and dive down to the bottom there and feel about for any sack or bag or box if i find one ill come up for air borrow a bit of rope from the raft and go down again tie the rope to the sack and you can haul it up to the surface oh julian it sounds so easy but is it really said anne george and dick considered the proposal carefully they were most impressed by julians idea well it may turn out to be much more difficult than it sounds but im jolly well going to try it said julian and began to strip off his jersey anne felt the water it was very very cold to her warm hand ugh id hate to dive down to the bottom of this horrid cold dark lake she said i think youre brave ju dont talk rubbish said julian he was ready to go in now he dived neatly into the water with hardly a splash the other three craned over the edge of the raft to watch they could see him down deep down in the water a ghostly figure he stayed down such a long time that anne got worried he cant hold his breath all that time she said he cant but julian could he was one of the star swimmers and divers at his school and this was easy to him he came up again at last and panted hard trying to make up for holding his breath so long the others waited patiently at last his breathing grew more even and he grinned at them ah thats better well its there he said triumphantly is it said everyone thrilled oh julian yes i dived right down to the boat almost got there with the force of my dive had to swim just a couple of strokes perhaps and there was the poor old boat rotting to bits and in one end is a waterproof bag almost a sack its so big i ran my hands over it and its waterproof all right so the loot must be packed in there did it feel heavy asked dick i gave it a tug and couldnt move it said julian either its wedged in somehow or is really heavy anyway we cant fetch it out by diving down for it ill have to dive down again fix a rope to it then come up and well give a heaveho and up shell come julian was shivering anne picked up the blazer she had brought and gave it to him to dry himself with dick looked hurriedly over the raft there were certainly bits and pieces of rope sticking out here and there some of it halfrotten and a short length was tucked into a space between two planks of the raft it was much too short though and surely the other bits and pieces would never join to make a long enough rope the bits of rope weve got wont do julian said dick julian was drying himself and looking towards the end of the lake where twotrees stood he was frowning the others looked too the boat had reached the bank there and had been pulled up one of the couple the children couldnt see which was standing up on the bank and something was glinting in the sun something he or she was holding see that glint said julian well thats either maggie or dirty dick using fieldglasses theyre going to keep an eye on us while were here just to make sure we dont suddenly spot the boat i suppose they dont guess weve already found it i bet they were worried when they saw id taken a header into the water just over the sunken boat oh so thats what the flash is said george the glint of fieldglasses yes theyre watching us blow that will put an end to us trying to haul up the loot ju theyd see it and wait for us yes no good trying for that now said julian anyway as dick says weve not got enough rope well have to get some from the boathouse but when do you propose to get the bag out of the sunk boat asked dick theyll keep those fieldglasses on us even if we go out again this afternoon theres only one time to go when they wont have their glasses watching us said julian beginning to dress himself very rapidly and thats tonight well go tonight my word what an adventure dont lets said anne in a small voice therell be a moon said george excited smashing idea said dick thumping julian on the back lets go back now so that they wont have any suspicions of us and make our plans for tonight and wed better keep an eye on them too in case they row out to this spot themselves this afternoon they wont said julian they darent run any risk of us spotting what theyre doing they will be sure to wait till weve gone and till the loot is gone said george with a laugh i say i do hope those two wretches havent gone and taken our food again i hid it down in the cellars beyond our room and locked the door leading there and heres the key grinned julian holding up a large key you never told us said george julian youre a genius how do you manage to think of things like that oh just brains said julian pretending to look modest and then laughing come on if i dont get warm quickly ill have a most almighty chill chapter twenty in the moonlight they paddled rapidly away dick took a last glance back to make sure that the cork and the box were still bobbing on the water to mark the place where the sunken boat lay yes they were still there itll be maddening if its cloudy tonight and the moon doesnt come out said george as they paddled we shouldnt be able to see tock hill tall stone and the rest and we might paddle for ages in the dark without spotting our corkandbox mark dont cross your bridges before you come to them said dick im not said george i was only just hoping that wouldnt happen it wont said julian looking at the sky the weathers set fine again as soon as maggie saw the children coming back again she and dirty dick disappeared into their tents julian grinned theyve heaved a sigh of relief and gone to have a snack he said i could do with one myself everyone felt the same paddling was hard work and the air on the lake was keen quite enough to give anyone a large appetite they pushed the raft into its hidingplace again then they made their way to the old house they went down into the cellar room timmy growled and sniffed about again i bet maggie and dirty dick have been here snooping round again said george looking for their porkpie and ham good thing you locked it up ju julian unlocked the door into the cellars beyond and brought out the food a large toad was looking at it with great interest he said as he brought it back timmy also looked at the toad with interest but hes wary of toads by now they taste much too nasty when pounced on they took the meal up into the sunshine and enjoyed it the orangeade was finished so they drank the cold clear water pumping some vigorously do you know its a quarter to three said julian amazed where has the time gone in a couple of hours or so it will be dark let me see the moon will be well up about eleven oclock thats the time to go i think please dont lets said anne julian put his arm round her now you know you dont mean that anne he said you know youll enjoy it all when the time comes you couldnt bear to be left out of it could you no i suppose i couldnt said anne but i dont like maggie and dirty dick nor do we said julian cheerfully thats why were going to beat them at their own game were on the side of the right and its worth while running into a bit of danger for that now lets see perhaps wed better just keep an eye on that couple till its dark just in case they try any funny tricks and then well have a snooze if we can so as to be sure to be lively tonight there they are said anne as she spoke maggie and her companion came out of their tents they had a few words together and then walked off to the moorland taking their usual stroll i suppose said dick lets have a game of cricket theres a bit of wood over there for a bat and ive got a ball in my rucksack good idea said julian i still feel a bit chilled from my bathe brrrrrr that water was cold i dont feel very thrilled at the thought of diving in tonight ill do that said dick at once my turn this time no i know exactly where to spot the loot said julian ill have to go down but you can come down too if you like and help to tie the rope on to it right said dick now look out im going to bowl they enjoyed their game the sun sank lower and lower then it disappeared a cloud came over the sky and darkness came quickly george looked up at the sky anxiously its all right said julian itll clear dont you worry before they went back into the house julian and dick slipped down to the boathouse for the coil of rope they would want that night they found it easily enough and came back pleased it was quite good strong rope frayed only in one place julian was right about the weather the sky cleared again in about an hour and the stars shone crisply good julian put timmy on guard at the doorway then he and the others went into the dark cellarroom and lighted a couple of candles they all snuggled down into their beds of heather i shant be able to snooze complained anne i feel much too excited dont snooze then said dick just have a rest and wake us up at the right time anne was the only one who didnt fall into a comfortable doze she lay awake thinking of this new adventure of theirs some children always had adventures and some didnt anne thought it would be much nicer to read about adventures than to have them but then probably the ones who only read about them simply longed to have the adventures themselves it was all very difficult anne woke the others at ten to eleven she shook george first and then the boys they were all in such a comfortable sleep that it was hard to wake them but soon they were up and about whispering wheres the rope good here it is better put on blazers and macs itll be freezing on the lake everyone ready now not a sound timmy had come to the cellar room as soon as he had heard them stirring he knew he had to be quiet so he didnt give even one small bark he was thrilled to find they were going out into the night the moon was well up now and although it was not full it was very bright small clouds swam across the sky and every now and again the moon went behind one of them and the world became dark but that was only for a minute or two then out it came again as brilliant as ever any sign of the others whispered dick julian stood at the doorway and looked towards the tents no all was quiet there still it would be better if he and the others crept round the side of the house and kept in the shadows we dont want to run any risk of them spotting us now whispered julian giving his orders keep out of the moonlight whatever you do and see that tim walks to heel george keeping well in the shadows the five crept down to the lakeside the water gleamed in the moonlight and a bright moonpath ran all down it lovely to see the lake looked very dark and brooding anne wished it had a voice of some kind even the little laplaplap of waves at the edge but there was none they pulled out the raft and threw the coil of rope on to it then they clambered on enjoying its smooth bobbobbobbing as they paddled out on the water they were off timmy was thrilled he kept licking first one of the four then another he loved going out in the night the moon shone down on the little company and turned every little ripple to silver as the raft bobbed over the water its a heavenly night said anne looking round at the silent trees that lined the banks the whole place is so quiet and peaceful an owl immediately hooted very loudly indeed from the trees and anne jumped violently now dont start all the owls hooting by talking about how quiet everything is teased julian i agree though that it really is a heavenly evening how calm and mirrorlike this lake is i wonder if it ever produces a wave of any sort do you suppose it stays like this even in a storm its a queer sort of lake said dick look out timmy thats my ear dont lick it all away i say anyone looking out for our four bearings well we know more or less where weve got to paddle the raft to said julian well go in that direction and then see if were spotting the bearings im sure were going right at the moment they were george soon saw tall stone and then tock hill came into sight it wasnt long before steeple was seen too shining in the moonlight i bet the nailer came and hid his loot out here on a moonlit night said julian all the bearings can be seen so very clearly even tall stone we really must find out sometime what it is it looks like a great stone pointer of some sort put up in memory of something or somebody theres one chimney now said anne we have got them all in view we should be near our mark we are said dick pointing to a little dark bobbing thing nearby the cork and the box how extremely clever we are i really have a great admiration for the five idiot said julian go on strip now dick well do our job straight away brrrrrrr its cold both boys stripped quickly putting their clothes into a neat pile in the middle of the raft look after them anne said julian got the rope dick come on then in we go we cant see the boat now the waters are so dark but we know its just below the cork and the box the boys dived in one after the other splash splash they were both beautiful divers the raft rocked as they plunged in and timmy nearly went in too julian had dived in first he opened his eyes under the water and found that he could see the sunken boat just below him with two strong strokes he reached it and tugged at the waterproof bag there dick was beside him almost at once the rope in his hands the boys twisted it tightly round the top part of the bag before they could finish the job they had to rise up to the surface to breathe dick couldnt hold his breath under water as long as julian and he was up first gasping painfully then julian shot up and the night was full of great painful breaths as the boys gasped in the air they longed for the girls knew better than to ask anything just then they waited anxiously till the boys breathing grew easier julian turned and grinned at them everythings all right he said now down we go again chapter twentyone the sack at last down went the boys again and once more the raft jerked violently the girls peered anxiously over the edge waiting for them to return julian and dick were down at the sunken boat in a matter of a second or two they finished the task of tying the rope to the waterproof bag julian gave it a hard jerk hoping to free it if it were wedged tightly into the boat he took the rest of the rope length in his hands in order to take it up to the surface then bursting for breath again the two boys shot up to the raft popping out of the water with loud gasps they climbed on board they took a minute to get their breath and then dick and julian took the rope together the girls watched their hearts beating fast now was the test would that waterproof sack come up or not the boys pulled strongly but without jerking the raft slanted and anne made a grab at the pile of clothes in the middle dick fell off into the water again he climbed back spluttering have to pull more smoothly he said i felt the sack give a bit didnt you julian nodded he was shivering with cold but his eyes were shining with excitement anne put a macintosh round his shoulders and one round dicks too they never even noticed now pull again said julian steady does it steady steady its coming gosh its really coming pull dick pull as the heavy bag came up on the end of the rope the raft slanted again and the boys pushed themselves back to the other side of the raft afraid of upsetting everyone into the water timmy began to bark excitedly be quiet timmy said george at once she knew how easily sound travels over water and she was afraid the couple in the tents might hear him its coming its there look just below the surface said anne one more pull boys but it was impossible to pull the heavy bag on board without upsetting the raft as it was the girls got very wet when the water splashed over the raft as it jerked and slanted look lets paddle back to the shore and let the sack drag behind us said julian at last we shall only upset the raft dress again dick and well get back to the old house and open the sack in comfort im so cold now that i can hardly feel my fingers the boys dressed as quickly as they could they were shivering and were very glad to take up their paddles and work hard to get the raft back to shore they soon felt a welcome warmth stealing through their bodies and in ten minutes had stopped shivering they felt very pleased with themselves indeed they looked back at the bulky object following them dragging along just under the surface what was in that bag excitement crept over all of them again and the paddles struck through the water at top speed as all the four strained to get back as quickly as possible timmy felt the excitement too and wagged his long tail without ceasing as he stood in the middle of the raft watching the thing that bobbed along behind them they came at last to the end of the lake making as little noise as possible they dragged the raft under its usual bush they did not want to leave it out on the bank in case maggie and dirty dick saw that it had been used again and started wondering dick and julian dragged the waterproof sack out of the water they carried it between them as they went cautiously back to the house it looked a most miserable grotesque place with its burntout roof doorways and windows but the children didnt notice its forlorn appearance in the moonlight they were far too excited they walked slowly up the overgrown path between the two brokendown walls their feet making no sound on the soft mossy ground they came to the doorway and dragged the bundle into the kitchen go and light the candles in the cellar room said julian to george i just want to make sure that that couple are not snooping anywhere about george and anne went to light the candles flashing their torches before them down the stone steps julian and dick stood at the open doorway facing the moonlight listening intently not a sound was to be heard not a shadow moved they set timmy on guard and left him there dragging the dripping heavy bundle across the stone floor of the kitchen they bumped it down the cellar steps and at last had it before them ready to be opened julians fingers fumbled at the knots of the rope george couldnt bear waiting she took a pocketknife and handed it to julian for goodness sake cut the rope she said i simply cant wait another moment julian grinned he cut the rope and then he looked to see how to undo the waterproof wrapping i see he said its been folded over and over the goods and then sewn up to make a kind of bag it must have kept the loot absolutely waterproof buck up said george i shall tear it open myself in a minute julian cut the strong stitches that closed the covering they began to unwrap the bundle there seemed to be yards and yards of waterproof covering but at last it was off and there in the middle of the mass of waterproof were scores of little boxes leathercovered boxes that everyone knew at once were jewelboxes it is jewellery then said anne and she opened a box they all exclaimed in wonder a magnificent necklace glittered on black velvet it shone and glinted and sparkled in the candlelight as if it were on fire even the two boys gazed without a word why it was fit for a queen it must be that wonderful necklace stolen from the queen of fallonia said george at last i saw a picture of it in the papers what diamonds oooh are they diamonds said anne in awe oh julian what a lot of money they must be worth a hundred pounds do you think a hundred thousand pounds more likely anne said julian soberly my word no wonder the nailer hid these stolen goods carefully in such an ingenious place no wonder maggie and dirty dick were longing to find them lets see what else there is every box contained precious stones of some kind sapphire bracelets ruby and diamond rings a strange and wonderful opal necklace earrings of such enormous diamonds that anne was quite sure no one would be able to bear the weight of them i would never never dare to own jewellery like this said anne i should always be afraid of its being stolen did it all belong to the queen of fallonia no some to a princess who was visiting her said julian these jewels are worth a kings ransom i just hate the thought of being in charge of them even for a little while well its better that we should have them rather than maggie or dirty dick said george she held a string of diamonds in her hands and let them run through her fingers how they sparkled no one could have imagined that they had been at the bottom of a lake for a year or two now lets see said julian sitting down on the edge of the table were due back at school tomorrow afternoon tuesday or is it tuesday already it must be past midnight gosh yes its almost half past two would you believe it i feel as if id believe anything said anne blinking at the glittering treasure on the table wed better start off fairly early tomorrow went on julian weve got to get these things to the police not to that awful policeman we saw the other day said george in horror of course not i think our best course would be to ring up that nice mr gaston and tell him that weve got important news for the police and see which police station he recommends us to go to said julian he might even arrange a car for us so that we dont need to take this stuff about in buses im not particularly keen on carrying it about with me have we got to carry all these boxes said george in dismay no that would be asking for trouble if anyone spotted them said julian i fear well just have to wrap up the jewels in our hankies and stuff them down into the bottom of our rucksacks well leave the boxes here the police can collect them afterwards if they want to it was all decided the four divided up the glittering jewellery and wrapped it carefully into four handkerchiefs one for each of them they stuffed the hankies into their rucksacks wed better use them for pillows said dick then theyll be quite safe what these horrid rough bags said anne why timmys on guard isnt he ill put mine beside me under the rug but i just wont put my head on it dick laughed all right anne timmy wont let any robber through im quite sure now we start off first thing in the morning do we julian yes as soon as we wake said julian we cant have much to eat theres only a few biscuits and a bit of chocolate left i shant mind said anne im so excited that at the moment i dont feel ill ever eat anything again youll change your mind tomorrow said julian with a laugh now to bed everyone they lay down on their heather and bracken excited and pleased what a weekend and all because dick and anne had lost their way and dick slept in the wrong barn goodnight said julian yawning i feel very very rich richer than ill ever be in my life again well ill enjoy the feeling while i can chapter twentytwo an exciting finish they awoke to hear timmy barking it was daylight already julian leapt up the steps to see what was the matter he saw maggie not very far away why do you keep such a fierce dog she called i just came to see if you wanted to take any food with you well give you some if you like its too kind of you all of a sudden said julian how anxious maggie was to get rid of them she would even give them food to get rid of them quickly but julian didnt want any food from maggie or dirty dick do you want some then asked the woman she couldnt make julian out he looked a youngster and yet his manner was anything but childish she was rather afraid of him no thanks said julian were just about to go got to get back to school today you know well youd better hurry then said the woman its going to rain julian turned on his heel grinning it wasnt going to rain maggie would say anything to hurry them away still that was just what julian wanted to get away as quickly as possible in ten minutes time the four children were ready to go each had rucksack and mac on their back and each had jewels worth thousands of pounds in their charge what a very extraordinary thing it will be a lovely walk across the moors said anne as they went along i feel like singing now everythings turned out all right the only thing is nobody at school will believe george or me when we tell them whats happened we shall probably be set a composition to do what did you do on your halfterm said george and miss peters will read ours and say quite well written but rather farfetched dont you think everyone laughed timmy looked round with his tongue out and what george called his smiling face then his smile vanished and he began to bark facing to the rear of the children they looked round startled gosh its maggie and dirty dick rushing along like fury said dick whats up are they sorry weve gone and want us back again theyre trying to cut us off said julian look theyve left the path and theyre going to take a short cut to come across us there is marshland all round so we cant leave our own path what idiots they are unless they know this bit of marshmoor country theyll get bogged maggie and dirty dick were yelling and shouting in a fury dirty dick shook his fists and leapt from tuft to tuft like a goat they look as if they have gone quite mad said anne suddenly afraid whats the matter with them i know said george theyve been into our cellar room and theyve found that waterproof covering and all those empty boxes theyve found out that weve got the goods of course said julian we should have thrown all the boxes into the cellars beyond no wonder theyre in a fury theyve lost a fortune to us four what do they think they can do now though said dick weve got timmy hell certainly fly at them if they come too near but dirty dick looks mad enough to fight even timmy honestly i think hes gone off his head i think he has said julian startled by the mans mad shouts and behaviour he looked at anne who had gone white julian felt sure that timmy would go for dirty dick and bring him to the ground and he didnt want anne to see dog and man fighting savagely there was no doubt that dirty dick was quite out of his mind with rage and disappointment timmy began to bark fiercely he snarled and looked very savage he could see that the man was spoiling for a fight with someone all right timmy didnt mind lets hurry on said julian but no short cuts for us mind well keep strictly to the path maggie is in difficulties already so she was she was floundering ankle deep in marshy ground yelling to dirty dick to help her but he was too intent on cutting right across the childrens path and then he got into difficulties too he suddenly sank up to his knees he tried to clamber out and reach a tuft of some sort he missed his footing and went down again he gave an anguished yell my ankle ive broken it maggie come over here but maggie was having her own difficulties and paid no attention the children stopped and looked at dirty dick he was sitting on a tuft nursing his foot and even from where the children stood they could see that his face was deathly white he certainly had done something to his ankle ought we to help him said anne trembling good gracious no said julian he may be pretending for all we know though i dont think so the chase is over anyway and if as i think dirty dick really has injured his ankle he wont be able to get far out of that marsh and nor will maggie by the look of her down she goes again look it may be that the police will find it very easy to pick up that unpleasant couple when they come along to look for them nicely embedded in the marsh said dick well personally i dont feel sorry for either of them theyre bad lots they went on their way again timmy gloomy because he hadnt had a fight with dirty dick after all they walked all the way to reebles it took them two hours well go to the postoffice and telephone from there said julian the old man was pleased to see them again had a nice time he said did you find twotrees julian left him talking to the others while he went to look up mr gastons telephone number he found it and hoping devoutly that mr gaston wouldnt mind giving his help he rang him up mr gaston answered the telephone himself hallo who oh yes of course i remember you you want a bit of help well what can i do for you julian told him mr gaston listened in amazement what youve found the fallonia jewels i cant believe it in your rucksacks now you say bless us all youre not spoofing me are you julian assured him that he wasnt mr gaston could hardly believe his ears right right of course ill put you in touch with the police wed better go to gathercombe i know the inspector there a fine fellow where are you oh yes i know it wait there and ill fetch you in my car in about half an hour say he rang off and julian went to find the others delighted that he had thought of getting into touch with mr gaston some grownups were so jolly decent and they knew exactly what to do the other three were delighted too when he told them well i must say that although its nice to have things happening to us its a sort of safe comfortable feeling when we hand over to the grownups said george now i only want one thing breakfast wed better have a mixture of breakfast and lunch said julian its so late oh yes lets have brunch said anne delighted i love brunch so they had some brunch sandwiches buns biscuits and gingerbeer which they bought at a little shop down the road and just as they were finishing up swept mr gaston in an enormous car the four children grinned at him with pleasure julian introduced anne and dick timmy was thrilled to see him again and offered him a polite paw which mr gaston shook heartily nice manners your dogs got he said and pressed down the accelerator whoooosh away they went at top speed with timmy sticking his head out of the window as he always did in a car they told their extraordinary story as they went mr gaston was full of admiration for all they had done youre a bunch of plucky kids he kept saying my word i wish you were mine they came to the police station mr gaston had already warned the inspector they were coming and he was waiting for them come along into my private room he said now first of all where are these jewels have you really got them with you lets have a look at them before you tell your story the children undid their rucksacks and out of the hankies inside they poured the shining glittering jewellery on to the oak table the inspector whistled and exchanged a look with mr gaston he picked up the diamond necklace youve got them he said the very jewels and to think the police everywhere have been hunting for them for months and months and months where did you find them youngsters its rather a long story said julian he began to tell it and he told it well prompted by the others when he forgot anything mr gaston and the inspector listened with amazement on their faces when julian came to the bit where dirty dick and maggie had been left floundering in the marshes the inspector interrupted him wait would they still be there they would right half a minute he pressed a bell and a peliceman appeared tell johns to take his three men and the car and go to the green marshes near gloomy water ordered the inspector hes to pick up two people floundering there man and woman our old friends dirty dick and maggie martin look sharp the policeman disappeared anne hugged herself now that awful couple would be put into safe custody for some time thank goodness till she had forgotten about them anne hadnt liked them a bit julians tale came to an end the inspector looked across at the tousleheaded dirty untidy group and smiled he held out his hand shake he said all of you youre the kind of kids we want in this country plucky sensible responsible youngsters who use your brains and never give up im proud to meet you they all shook hands with him solemnly timmy held up his paw too and the inspector grinned and shook that too and now whats your programme asked mr gaston getting up well were all supposed to be back at school by three oclock said julian but i dont think we can arrive looking like this wed get into awful rows is there a hotel where we can have a bath and clean ourselves up a bit you can do that here said the inspector and if you like ill run you back to your schools in the police car we cant do too much for people who produce the fallonia jewels out of rucksacks you know bless us all i cant believe it mr gaston said goodbye and went saying that he was very proud to have made friends with them and dont you get stuck down any more rabbitholes he said to timmy who wuffed happily at him they bathed and washed every inch of themselves they found their clothes neatly folded and brushed and felt grateful they brushed their hairs and arrived looking very clean and tidy in the inspectors private room he had a man there inspecting the jewels and labelling them before he put them away into boxes youll be interested to know that we have picked up your couple he told them the man had a broken ankle and couldnt stir a step the woman was thigh deep in the marsh when we found her they quite welcomed the police they were so fed up with everything oh good said the four and anne beamed with relief that settled maggie and dirty dick then and these are the fallonia jewels said the inspector not that i had any doubt of it they are now being checked and labelled ive no doubt the queen of fallonia and her titled friend will be extremely pleased to hear of your little exploit a clock struck half past two julian looked at it half an hour only to get back in time would they do it its all right said the inspector with his wide grin cars at the door ill come and see you off youll all be back at your schools in good time and if anyone believes your tale ill be surprised come along he saw them into the car timmy too goodbye he said and
