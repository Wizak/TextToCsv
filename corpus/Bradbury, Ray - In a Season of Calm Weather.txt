 in a season of calm weather by ray bradbury george and alice smith detrained at biarritz one summer noon and in an hour had run through their hotel onto the beach into the ocean and back out to bake upon the sand to see george smith sprawled burning there youd think him only a tourist flown fresh as iced lettuce to europe and soon to be transshipped home but there was a man who loved art more than life itself there george smith sighed another ounce of perspiration trickled down his chest boil out the ohio tap water he thought then drink down the best bordeaux silt your blood with rich french sediment so youll see with native eyes why why eat breathe drink everything french so that given time he might really begin to understand the genius of one man his mouth moved forming a name george his wife loomed over him i know what youve been thinking i can read your lips he lay perfectly still waiting and picasso she said he winced someday she would learn to pronounce that name please she said relax i know you heard the rumor this morning but you should see your eyes your tic is back all right picassos here down the coast a few miles away visiting friends in some small fishing town but you must forget it or our vacations ruined i wish id never heard the rumor he said honestly if only she said you liked other painters others yes there were others he could breakfast most congenially on caravaggio still lifes of autumn pears and midnight plums for lunch those firesquirting thickwormed van gogh sunflowers those blooms a blind man might read with one rush of scorched fingers down fiery canvas but the great feast the paintings he saved his palate for there filling the horizon like neptune risen crowned with limeweed alabaster coral paintbrushes clenched like tridents in hornnailed fist and with fishtail vast enough to fluke summer showers out over all gibraltar who else but the creator of girl before a mirror and guernica alice he said patiently how can i explain coming down on the train i thought good lord its all picasso country but was it really he wondered the sky the land the people the flushed pink bricks here scrolled electricblue ironwork balconies there a mandolin ripe as a fruit in some mans thousand fingerprinting hands billboard tatters blowing like confetti in night winds how much was picasso how much george smith staring round the world with wild picasso eyes he despaired of answering that old man has distilled turpentines and linseed oil so thoroughly through george smith that they shaped his being all blue period at twilight all rose period at dawn i keep thinking he said aloud if we saved our money well never have five thousand dollars i know he said quietly but its nice thinking we might bring it off someday wouldnt it be great to just step up to him say pablo heres five thousand give us the sea the sand that sky or any old thing you want well be happy after a moment his wife touched his arm i think youd better go in the water now she said yes he said id better do just that white fire showered up when he cut the water during the afternoon george smith came out and went into the ocean with the vast spilling motions of now warm now cool people who at last with the suns decline theirs bodies all lobster colors and colors of broiled squab and guinea hen trudged for their weddingcake hotels the beach lay deserted for endless mile on mile save for two people one was george smith towel over shoulder out for a last devotional far along the shore another shorter squarecut man walked alone in the tranquil weather he was deepertanned his closeshaven head dyed almost mahogany by the sun and his eyes were clear and bright as water in his face so the shoreline stage was set and in a few minutes the two men would meet and once again fate fixed the scales for shocks and surprises arrivals and departures and all the while these two solitary strollers did not for a moment think on coincidence that unswum stream which lingers at mans elbow with every crowd in every town nor did they ponder the fact that if man dares dip into that stream he grabs a wonder in each hand like most they shrugged at such folly and stayed well up the bank lest fate should shove them in the stranger stood alone glancing about he saw his aloneness saw the waters of the lovely bay saw the sun sliding down the late colors of the day and then half turning spied a small wooden object on the sand it was no more than the slender stick from a lime ice cream delicacy long since melted away smiling he picked the stick up with another glance around to reinsure his solitude the man stooped again and holding the stick gently with light sweeps of his hand began to do the one thing in all the world he know best how to do he began to draw incredible figures along the sand he sketched one figure and then moved over and still looking down completely focused on his work now drew a second and a third figure and after that a fourth and a fifth and a sixth george smith printing the shore line with his feet gazed here gazed there and then saw the man ahead george smith drawing nearer saw that the man deeply tanned was bending down nearer yet and it was obvious what the man was up to george smith chuckled of course of course alone on the beach this man how old sixtyfive seventy was scribbling and doodling away how the sand flew how the wild portraits flung themselves out there on the shore how george smith took one more step and stopped very still the stranger was drawing and drawing and did not seem to sense that anyone stood immediately behind him and the world of his drawings in the sand by now he was so deeply enchanted with his solitudinous creation that depth bombs set off in the bay might not have stopped his flying hand nor turned him round george smith looked down at the sand and after a long while looking he began to tremble for there on the flat shore were pictures of grecian lions and medite rranean goats and maidens with flesh of sand like powdered gold and satyrs piping on handcarved horns and children dancing strewing flowers along and along the beach with lambs gamboling after and musicians skipping to their harps and lyres and unicorns racing youths toward distant meadows woodlands ruined temples and volcanoes along the shore in a neverbroken line the hand the wooden stylus of this man bent down in fever and raining perspira tion scribbled ribboned looped around over and up across in out stitched whispered stayed then hurried on as if this traveling bacchanal must flourish to its end before the sun was put out by the sea twenty thirty yards or morethe nymphs and dryads and summer founts sprang up in unraveled hieroglyphs and the sand in the dying light was the color of molten copper on which was now slashed a message that any man in any time might read and savor down the years everything whirled and poised in its own wind and gravity now wine was being crushed from under the grapeblooded feet of dancing vintners daughters now steaming seas gave birth to coinsheated monsters while flowe red kites strewed scent on blowing cloudsnownownow the artist stopped george smith drew back and stood away the artist glanced up surprised to find someone so near then he simply stood there looking from george smith to his own creations flung like idle footprints down the way he smiled at last and shrugged as if to say look what ive done see what a child you will forgive me wont you one day or another we are all fools you too perhaps so allow an old fool this eh good good but george smith could only look at the little man with the sundark skin and the clear sharp eyes and say the mans name once in a whisper to himself they stood thus for perhaps another five seconds george smith staring at the sandfrieze and the artist watching george smith with amused curiosi ty george smith opened his mouth closed it put out his hand took it back he stepped toward the pictures stepped away then he moved along the line of figures like a man viewing a precious series of marbles cast up from some ancient ruin on the shore his eyes did not blink his hand wanted to touch but did not dare to touch he wanted to run but did not run he looked suddenly at the hotel run yes run what grab a shovel dig excavate save a chunk of this alltocrubbling sand find a repairman race him back here with plaster of paris to cast a mold of some small fragile part of these no no silly silly or his eyes flicked to his hotel window the camera run get it get back and hurry along the shore click ing changing film clicking until george smith whirled to face the sun it burned faintly on his face his eyes were two small fires from it the sun was half underwater and as he watched it sank the rest of the way in a matter of seconds the artist had drawn nearer and now was gazing into george smiths face with great friendliness as if he were guessing every thought now he was nodding his head in a little bow now the ice cream stick had fallen casuallyfrom his fingers now he was saying good night good night now he was gone walking back down the beach toward the south george smith stood looking after him after a full minute he did the only thing he could possibly do he started at the beginning of the fantastic frieze of satyrs and fauns and winedipped maidens and prancing unicorns and piping youths and he walked slowly along the shore he walked a long way looking down at the freerunning bacchanal and when he came to the end of the animals and men he turned around and started back in the other direction just staring down as if he had lost something and did not quite know where to find it he kept on doing this until there was no more light in the sky or on the sand to see by he sat down at the supper table youre late said his wife i just had to come down alone im ravenous thats all right he said anything interesting happen on your walk she asked no he said you look funny george you didnt swim out too far did you and almost drown i can tell by your face you did swim out too far didnt you yes he said well she said watching him closely dont ever do that again now whatll you have he picked up the menu and started to read it and stopped suddenly whats wrong asked his wife he turned his head and shut his eyes for a moment listen she listened i dont hear anything she said dont you no what is it just the tide he said after a while sitting there his eyes still shut just the tide coming in
