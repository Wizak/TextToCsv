john mortimer rumpole and the old familiar faces in the varied ups and downs the thrills and spills in the life of an old bailey hack one thing stands as stone your excustomers will never want to see you again even if youve steered them through the rocks of the prosecution case and brought them out to the calm waters of a not guilty verdict they wont plan further meetings host reunion dinners or even send you a card on your birthday if they catch a glimpse of you on the underground or across a crowded wine bar they will bury their faces in their newspapers or look studiously in the opposite direction this is understandable days in court probably represent a period of time theyd rather forget and as a rule im not especially keen to renew an old acquaintance when a face i once saw in the old bailey dock reappears at a scales of justice dinner or at the inns of court garden party reminiscences of the past are best avoided and what is required is a quick look and a quiet turn away there have been times however when recognizing a face seen in trouble has greatly assisted me in the solution of some legal problem and carried me to triumph in a difficult case such occasions have been rare but like number thirteen buses two of them turned up in short order round a christmas which i remember as being one of the oddest but certainly the most rewarding i ever spent a traditional british pantomime theres nothing to beat it you go to the pantomime rumpole claude asked with unexpected interest i did when i was a boy it made a lasting impression on me pantomime the american judge who was our fellow guest round the erskinebrown dinner table was dearly a stranger to such delights is that some kind of mime show lots of feeling imaginary walls and no one saying anything not at all you take some good old story likerobin hood robin hoods the star well yes hes played by some strapping girl who slaps her thighs and says lines like cheer up babes in the wood robins not far away you mean theres crossdressing the american visitor was puzzled well if you want to call it that and robins mother is played by a rednosed comic a female comic no a male one that sounds interesting he said in a tone that suggested he had the wrong idea we have clubs for that sort of thing in pittsburgh its not what youre thinking i assured him the dames a comic character who gets the audience singing singing the words come down on a sort of giant song sheet i explained and she who is really a he gets the audience to sing along emboldened by erskinebrowns claret i broke into a stanza of the song i was introduced to by robin hoods masculine mother i may be just a nipper but ive always loved a kipper and so does my loving wife if youve got a girl just slip her a loving golden kipper and shell be yours for life is that all the transatlantic judge still seemed puzzled all i can remember i think youre wrong mr rumpole what i think youre wrong and those lines do indeed have some significance along the lines i suggested and the judge fell silent contemplating the unusual acts suggested i see theyre doingaladdin at the tufnell park empire do you think the twins might enjoyit rumpole the speaker was mrs justice erskinebrown still possessed of a beauty that would break the hearts of the toughest prosecutors and make old lags swoon with lust even as she passed a stiff custodial sentence the twins she spoke of were tristan and isolde so named by her operaloving husband claude who was now bending hildas ear on the subject of covent gardens latest ring cycle i think the twins would adoreit just the thing to cure the wagnerian deathwish and bring them into a world of sanity sanity the visiting judge sounded doubtful with old guys dressed up as mothers i promise you theyll love every minute ofit and then i made another promise that sounded rash even as i spoke the words i know i would ill take them myself thank you rumpole phillida spoke in her gentlest judicial voice but i knew my fate was sealed well keep you to that itll have to be after christmas hilda said weve been invited up to norfolk for the holiday as she said the word norfolk a cold sweeping wind seemed to cut through the central heating of the ersknebrowns islington dining room and i felt a warning shiver i have no rooted objection to christmas day but i must say its an occasion when time tends to hang particularly heavily on the hands from the early morning alarm call of carols piping on radio four to the closing headlines and a restless liverish sleep the day can seem as long as a fraud on the post office tried before mr injustice graves it takes less than no time for me to unwrap the tie which i will seldom wear and for hilda to receive the annual bottle of lavender water which she lays down rather than puts to immediate use the highlights after that are the queens speech when i lay bets with myself as to whether hilda will stand to attention when the television plays the national anthem and the thawedout safeway bird followed by port and pudding i suppose what i have against christmas day is that the courts are all shut and no one is being tried for anything that christmas hilda had decided on a complete change of routine she announcedit in a circuitous fashion by saying one late november evening i was at school with poppy longstaff whats that got to do withit i knew the answer to this question of course hildas old school has this in common with polar expeditions natural disasters and the last war those who have lived throughit are bound together for life and can always call on each other for mutual assistance poppys eric is rector of coldsands and for some reason or other he seems to want to meet you rumpole meet me thats what she said so does that mean i have to spend christmas in the arctic circle and miss our festivities its not the arctic circle its norfolk rumpole and our festivities arent all that festive so yes you have to go it was a judgement fr which there was no possible appeal my first impression of coldsands was a gaunt church tower presumably of great age pointing an accusing finger to heaven from a cluster of houses on the edge of a sullen gunmetal sea my second was one of intense cold as soon as we got out of the taxi we were slapped around the face by a wind which must have started in freezing siberia and gained nothing in the way of warmth on its journey across the plains of europe in the bleak midwinteri frosty winds made moan wrote that sad old darling christina rossetti frosty winds made considerable moan round the rectory at coldsands owing to the doors that stopped about an inch short of the stone floors and the windows which never shut properly causing the curtains to billow like the sails of a ship at sea we were greeted cheerfully by poppy hildas friend had one of those round childishly pretty faces often seen on seriously fat women she seemed to keep going on incessant cups of hot sweet tea and a number of cardigans if she moved like an enormous tent her husband eric was a slender wraith of a man with a high aquiline nose two flapping wings of grey hair on each side of his face and a vague air of perpetual anxiety broken now and then by high and unexpected laughter he made cruciform gestures as though remembering the rubric spectacles testicles wallet and watch and forgetting where these important articles were kept eric his wife explained is having terrible trouble with the church tower oh dear hilda shot me a look of stern disapproval which i knew meant thatit would be more polite if i abandoned my overcoat while tea was being served how worrying for you eric the rev eric went into along excited and highpitched speech the gist ofit was that the tower although of rare beauty had not been much restored since the saxons builtit and the normans added the finishing touches fifty thousand pounds was needed for essential repairs and the thermometer erected outside the church for the appeal was stuck at one hundred and twenty poundsthe proceeds from an emergency jumble sale you particularly wanted horace to come this christmas hilda asked the man of god with the air of someone anxious to solve a baffling mystery i wonder why that was yes i wonder eric looked startled i wonder why on earth i wanted to ask horace i dont believe hes got fifty thousand smackers in his back pocket at this he shook with laughter there i told him your lack of faith is entirely justified i wasnt exactly enjoying coldsands rectory so i was a little miffed that the reverend couldnt remember why hed asked me there in the first place we had hoped that donald compton would help us our poppy told us i mean he wouldnt notice fifty thousand but he took exception to what eric said at the remembrance day service armistice day in the village erics grey wings of hair trembled as he nodded in delighted affirmation and i prayed for dead german soldiers it seemed only fair fair perhaps darling but hardly tactful his wife told him donald compton thoughtit was distinctly unpatriotic hes bought the old manor house she explained to hilda from then on the conversation turned exclusively to this compton and was carried on in the tones of awe and muted wonder with which people always talk about the very rich comptonit seemed after a difficult start in england had gone to canada where during a tenyear stay he had laid the foundations of his fortune his much younger wife was quite charming probably canadian and not in the least standoffish he had built the village hall the cricket pavilion and a tennis court for the school only erics unfortunate sympathy for the german dead had caused comptons bounty to stop short at the church tower ive done hours of hard kneework the rector told us begging the lord to soften mr comptons heart towards our rower no result so far i fear apart from this one lapse the charming donald compton seemed to be the perfect english squire and country gent i would see him in church on christmas morning and we had also been invited for drinks before lunch at the manor the reverend eric and the smiling poppy madeit sound as though the pope and the archbishop of canterbury would be our with the carol singers and wed been invited to drop in for high tea at windsor castle i prayed for a yule log blazing at the manor so that i could in the true spirit of christmas thaw our gradually now as a sign of christmas fellowship will you all stand and shake hands with those in front of and behind you eric in full canonicals standing on the steps in front of the altar made this suggestion as though he had just thought of the idea i stood reluctantly i had found myself a place in the church near a huge friendly gently humming occasionally belching radiator and i was clinging toit and strokingit as thoughit were a newfound mistress the man who turned to me from the front row seemed to be equally reluctant he was as hilda had pointed our excitedly the great donald compton in persona man of middle height with silver hair dressed in a tweed suit and with a tan whichit must have been expensive to preserve during winter he had soft brown eyes which looked almost at once away from me as with a touch of dry fingers he was gone and i was left for the rest of the service with no more than a well tailored back and the sound of an uncertain tenor voice joining in the hymns i turned to the row behind to shake hands with an elderly woman who had madness in her eyes and whispered conspiratorially to me you cold dear like to borrow my gloves were used to a bit of chill weather round these parts i declined politely and went back to hugging the radiator and as i did so a sort of happiness stole over me to start with the church was beautiful with a high timbered roof and walls of weathered stone peppered with marble tributes to dead inhabitants of the manor it was decorated with holly and mistletoe a tree glowed and there were candles over a crib i thought how many generations of coldsands villagers their eyes bright and faces flushed with the wind had belted our these hymns i also thought how depressed the great donald comptonwho had put on little gold halfglasses to read the prophecy from isaiah for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonder fulwould feel if jesus instruction to sell all and giveit to the poor should ever be taken literally and then i wondered whyit was that as he had touched my fingers and turned away i had felt that i had lived through that precise moment before there was asit turned our a huge log fire cracking at the manor throwing a dancing light on the marble floor of the circular entrance hall with its great staircase leading up into private shadows the cream of coldsands was being entertained with champagne andcanaps by the new lord of the manor the decibels rose as the champagne went down and the little group began to sound like an army of tourists in the sistine chapel noisy excited and wonderstruck they must all be his ancestors hilda was looking at the pictures on the walls and in particular at a general in a scarlet coat on a horse prancing at the front of some distant battle my mouth was full of cream cheese enveloped in smoked salmon i swallowedit and said oh i shouldnt think so after all he only bought the house recently but i expect he brought his family portraits here from somewhere else you mean he had them under the bed in his old bachelor flat in wimbledon and now hes hung them round an acre or two of walls do try and be serious rumpole youre nor nearly as funny as you think you are just look at the family resemblance im absolutely certain that all of these are old comprons andit was when she said this that i remembered everything perfectly clearly he was with his wife she was wearing a black velvet dress and had long golden hair that sparked in the firelight they were talking to a bald pinkfaced man and his short and dumpy wife and they were all laughing comptons laughter stopped as he saw me coming towards him he said i dont think weve met yes i replied we shook hands briefly in church this morning my names rumpole and im staying with the longstaffs but didnt we meet somewhere else good old eric we have our differences of course but hes a saintly man this is my wife lorelei and colonel and maudy jacobs i expect youd like to see the library wouldnt you rumpole im sure youre interested in ancient history will you all excuse us it was two words from hilda that had done it old and compton i knew then what i should have remembered when we had touched hands in the pews that old compton is a street in soho and that this was perhaps why riccardo perducci had adopted the name i had received that very same handshakea slight touch and a quick turn awaywhen i had said goodbye to him in the cells under the old bailey and left him to start seven years for blackmail the trial had ended i now remembered just before a longdistant christmas the perducci territory had been in those days not rolling norfolk acres but a number of soho strip clubs and clip joints girls would stand in front of these lastnamed resorts and lure the lonely the desperate and the unwary in sometimes they would escape after paying twenty pounds for a watery cocktail unlucky affluent and important customers might get even more carefully recorded by microphones and cameras to produce material which was used for systematic and highly profitable blackmail the victim in dickos case was an obscure and not much loved circuit judge soit was regarded as particularly serious by the prosecuting authority when i mitigated for dicko i stressed the lack of direct evidence against him he was a shadowy figure who kept himself well in the background and was known as a legend rather than a familiar face round soho that only shows what a big wheel he is judge bullingham who was unfortunately trying the case bellowed unsympatherically in desperation i tried the christmas approach on him crimes forgiven sins remitted mercy triumphant such was the message of the story that began in bethlehem i told the court at which the mad bull snorted that as far as he could remember that story had ended in a criminal trial and a stiff sentence for at least one thief i suppose something like this was going to happen sooner or later we were standing in the library in front of a comforting fire among leatherbound books which i strongly suspected had been bought by the yard the new like the old dicko was softeyed quietly spoken almost unnaturally calmthe perfect man behind the scenes of a blackmailing operation or a country estate nor necessarily i told him its just that my wife has many old school friends and poppy longstaff is one of them well now you seem to have done pretty well for yourself solid citizens still misconducting themselves round old compton street are they i wouldnt know i gave all that up and went into the property business really where did you do that canada i never saw canada he shook his head garwick prison upandcoming area in the home counties the screws there were ready and willing to do the deals on the outside i paid them embarrassingly small commissions how long were you there four years by the time i came our id got my first million well then i did you a good turn losing your case a bit of luck his honour judge bullingham didnt believe in the remission of sins you think i got what i deserved i stretched my hands to the fire i could hear the cocktail chatter from the marble hall of the eighteenthcentury manor use every man after his desert and who shall scape whipping i quotedhamlet at him then i can trust you rumpole the lord chancellors going to put me on the local bench the lord chancellor lives in a world of his own you dont think id do well as a magistrate i suppose youd speak from personal experience of crime and have some respect for the quality of mercy ive got no time for that rumpole his voice became quieter but harder the brown eyes lost their softness that i thought was how he must have looked when one of his clip joint girls was caught with the punrers cash stuffed in her tights its about time we cracked down on crime well now i can trust you not to go out there and spread the word about the last time we met that depends on what how well you have understood the christmas message which is perhaps generosity i see so you want your bung oh not me dicko ive been paid inadequately by legal aid but theres an impoverished church tower in urgent need of resuscitation that eric longstaff our rector hes nor a patriot and are you i do a good deal of work locally for the british legion and im sure next poppy day theyll appreciate what youve done for the church tower he looked at me for a long minute in silence and i thought that if this scene had been raking place in a back room in soho there might quite soon have been the flash of a knife instead his hand went to an inside pocket and produced nothing more lethal than a chequebook while youre in a giving mood i said the rectorys in desperate need of central heating this is bloody blackmail dicko perducci now known as donald compton said well i told him you should know christmas was over the year turned stirred itself and opened its eyes on a bleak january crimes were committed arrests were made and the courtrooms were filled once again with the sounds of argument i went down to the old bailey on a trifling matter of fixing the date of a trial before mrs justice ersknebrown as i was leaving the usher came and told me that the judge wanted to see me in her private room on a matter of urgency such summonses always fill me with apprehension and a vague feeling of guilt what had i done got the date of the trial hopelessly muddled addressed the court with my trousers carelessly unzipped i was relieved when the learned phillida greeted me warmly and even offered me a glass of sherry poured from her own personal decanter it was so knd of you to offer rumpole she said unexpectedly offer what i was puzzled you told us how much you adored the traditional british pantomime so i did for a happy moment i imagined her ladyship as principal boy her shapely legs encased in black tights her neat little wig slightly askew slapping her thigh and calling out in belllike tones cheer up rumpole portias not far away the twins are looking forward toit enormously looking forward to what aladdinat the tufinell park empire ive got tickets for the nineteenth of january you do remember promising to take them dont you well of course what else might i have said after the fifth glass of erskinebrown st emillion id love to be of the party and will old claude be buying us a dinner afterwards i really dont think you should go round calling people old rumpole phillida now looked miffed and i downed the sherry before she tookit into her head to deprive me ofit claudes got us tickets for pavarotti lelisirdamore you might buy the children a burger after the show oh and its not far from us on the tube it really was sweet of you to invite them at which she smiled at me and refilled my glass in a way which madeit clear she was not prepared to hear further argument it all turned out better than i could have hoped tristan and isolde unlike their wagnerian namesakes were cheerful reasonably polite and only seemed anxious to disassociate themselves as far as possible from the old fart who was escorting them at every available opportunity they would touch me for cash and then scamper off to buy ice cream chocolates sandwiches or sprite i was left in reasonable peace to enjoy the performance and enjoyit i did aladdin was a personable young woman with an upturned nose a voice which could have been used to wake up patients coming round from their anaesthesia and memorable thighs uncle abanazer was played isolde told me by an actor who portrayed a social worker with domestic problems in a longrunning television series wishy and washy did sing to electric guitars but widow twankey played by a certain jim diamond was all a dame should bea nimble little cockney fitted up with a sizeable false bosom a flaming red wig sweeping eyelashes and scarlet lips never have i heard the immortal line wheres that naughty boy aladdin got to better delivered i joined in loudly when the widow and aladdin conducted us in the singing of please dont pinch my tomatoes it was in fact and in fairness all a traditional pantomime should be and yet i had a vague feeling that something was wrong that an element was missing but as the cast came down a white staircase in glittering costumes to enthusiastic applauseit seemed the sort of pantomime id grown up with and which tristan and isolde should be content to inherit after so much excitement i felt in need of a stiff brandy and soda but the eatery the children had selected for their evenings entertainment had apparently gone teetotal and alcohol was not on the menu once they were confronted by their mammoth burgers and fries i made my excuses said id be back in a moment and slipped into a nearby pub which was i noticed opposite the stage door of the empire as the lifegiving draught was being poured i found myself standing next to washy and uncle abanazer now out of costume who were discussing jim the dame very unfriendly tonight washy said locked himself in his dressing room before the show and wouldnt join us for a drink perhaps hes had a bustup with molly unlikely molly and jim never have a cross word lucky shes never found out hes been polishing aladdins wonderful lamp abanazer said and they both laughed as i asked the girl behind the bar to refill my glass in which the tide had sunk to a dangerous low i heard them laugh again about the widow twankeys voluminous bosom strappedon polystyrene abanazer was saying almost bruises me when i dance with her funny thing tonightit was quitesoft perhaps she borrowed one from a blowup woman washy was laughing as i gulped my brandy and leggedit back to the hamburgers in the dark passage outside the stage door i saw a small nimble figure in hurried retreatjim diamond who for some reason hadnt wanted to join the boys at the bar after i had restored the children to the erskinebrowns au pair i sat in the tube on my way back to gloucester road and read the programme jim diamondit seemed had started his life in industry before taking up show business he had a busy career in clubs and turned down appearances on television i only enjoy the living show jim says i want to have the audience where i can see them his photograph without the exaggerated female makeup showed a pale thinnosed in some way disagreeable little man with a lip curled either in scorn or triumph i wondered how such an unfriendlylooking character could become a ebullient and warmhearted widow stripped of his makeup there was something about this comics unsmiling face which brought back memories of another meeting in totally different circumstances it was the second time within a few weeks that i had found an old familiar face cast in a new and unexpected part the memory i couldnt quite grasp preyed on my mind until i was tucked up in bed then as hildas latest historical romance dropped from her weary fingers and she turned her back on me and switched out the light i saw the face again quite clearly but in a different setting not diamond sparker no sparksman a logical progression widow twankey had been played by harry sparkman a man who had trained as a professional entertainer if my memory was correct not in clubs but in her majestys prisons it wasit seemed an interesting career change but i thought no more ofit at the time and once satisfied with my identification i fell asleep the boy couldnt have doneit mr rumpole not a complicated bloody great job to that extent his only way of getting at a safe was to digit out of the wall and removeit bodily he did that in a barkngside boutique and what he found init hardly covered the petrol young denis couldnt have got into the croydon supermarket peter no one in our family could have uncle fred the experienced and cautious head of the timson clan had no regard for the safebreaking talents of denis his nephew and on the whole an unsklled recruit in the timson enterprise the croydon supermarket job had been highly complicated and expertly carried out and had yielded for its perpetrators thousands of pounds peanuts molloy was arrested as one of the lookouts after falling and twisting an anke when chased by a night watchman during the getaway he said he didnt know any of the skilled operators who had engaged him except denis timson who he alleged was in general charge of the operation denis alone he said had silenced the burglar alarm and deftly penetrated the lock on the safe with an oxyacetylene blowtorch it has to be remembered though that the clan molloy had been sworn enemies of the timson family from time immemorial peanuts story sounded implausible when i met denis timson in the brixton prison interview room a puzzled twentyfiveyearold with a shaven head and a poor attempt at a moustache he seemed more upset by his uncle freds low opinion of him than the danger of a conviction and subsequent prolonged absence from the family denis case was to come up for committal at the south london magistrates court before skmpy simpson whose lack of success at the bar had driven him to a job as a stipendiary beak his nickname had been earned by the fact that he had not within living memory been known to splash out on a round of drink at pommeroys wine bar in the usual course of events there is no future in fighting proceedings which are only there to commit the customer to trial i had resolved to attend solely to pour a little welldeserved contempt on the testimony of peanuts molloy as i started to prepare the case i made a note of the date of the croydon supermarket breakin as soon as i had done so i consulted my diary i turned the virgin pages as yet unstained by notes of trials ideas for crossexaminations splodges of tea or spilled glasses of pommeroys very ordinary it was as i had thought while some virtuoso had been at work on the croydon safe i had been enjoyingaladdin in the company of tristan and isolde detective inspector grimble would you agree that who ever blew the safe in the croydon supermarket did an extraordinarily skillful job mr rumpole are we meant to congratulate your client on his professional skil god moves in mysterious ways andit wasnt skimpy simpsons fault that he was born with thin lips and a voice which sounded like the rusty hinge of a rusty gate swinging in the wind i decided to ignore him and concentrate on a friendly chat with di grimble a large comfortable gingerhaired officer we had lived together over the years with the clan timson and their misdoings he was known to them as a decent and fairminded cop as disapproving of the younger pandaracing evidencemassaging intake to the force as they were of the lack of discretion and criminal skils which marked the younger timsons ъ i mean the thieves were well informed they knew that there would be a weeks money in the safe they knew that yes and was there a complex burglar alarm system you couldnt putit out of action simply by cutting wires could you cutting the wires would have setit off so putting the burglar alarm out of action would have required special skills it would have done puttingit out of action also stopped a clock in the office so we know that occurred at we know that yes and at young molloy was caught as he fell while running to a getaway car that is so so this heavy safe was burnt open in a little over half an hour i fail to see the relevance of this mr rumpole skmpy was getting restless im sure the officer does that shows a very high degree of technical skill doesntit detective inspector id agree with that exercised by a highly experienced peterman who is this mr peterman skimpy was puzzled we havent heard of him before notmr peterman i marvelled at the ignorance of the basic facts of life displayed by the magistrate a man expert at blowing safes known to the trade as a peter i told him and turned back to di grimble so were agreed that this was a highly expert piece of work it must have been done by someone who knew his job pretty well yes denis timsons record shows convictions for shoplifting bagsnatching and stealing a radio from an unlocked car in all of these simple enterprises he managed to get caught your clients criminal record skmpy looked happy for the first time youre allowing that to go into evidence are you mr rumpole certainly sir i explained the obvious point because theres absolutely no indication that he was capable of blowing a safe in record time or silencing a complicated burglar alarm is there detective inspector no theres nothing to show anything like that in his record mr rumpole skimpy was looking at the clock was he in danger of missing his usual train back home to haywards heath wheres all this heading back a good many years i told him to the sweethome building society job at carshalton when harty sparkman blew a safe so quietly that even the dogs slept throughit you were in on that case werent you mr rumpole inspector grimble was pleased to remember sparksman got five years not one of your great successes skmpy was also delighted perhaps you wasted the courts time with unnecessary questions have you anything else to ask this officer not till the old bailey sir i may have thought of a few more by then with great satisfaction skmpy committed denis timson a minor villain who would have had difficulty changing a fuse let alone blowing a safe for trial at the central criminal court funny you mentioned harry sparkman do you know the same thought occurred to me an expert like him couldve done that job in the time great minds think alike i assured di grimble we were washing away the memoty of an hour or two before skmpy with two pints of nourishing stout in the pub opposite the beaks court you know harry took up a new career i neednt have asked the question di grimble had a groupies encyclopaedic knowledge of the criminal stars oh yes now a comic called jim diamond got up a concert party in the nick apparently gave him a taste for show business i did hear i took grimble into my confidence that he made a comeback for the croydon job it had been a throwaway line from uncle fred timson i heard talk they got harry back out of retirementbutit was a thought worth examining i heard the same so we did a bit of checkng but sparkman known as diamond has got a castiron alibi are you sure at the time when the croydon job was done he was performing in a pantomime on stage nearly all the eveningit seems playing the dame aladdin i said at the tufinell park empire it might be just worth your while to go into that alibi a little more thoroughly id suggest you have a private word with mrs molly diamond its just possible she may have noticed his attraction to aladdins lamp now then mr rumpole grimble was wiping the froth from his lips with a neatly folded handkerchief you mustnt tell me how to do my job im only trying to serve i managed to look pained the interests of justice you mean the interests of your client sometimes theyre the same thing i told him but i had to admitit wasnt often asit happened the truth emerged without detective inspector grimble having to do much of a job harry had in fact fallen victim to a tiptilted nose and memorable thighs hed left home and moved into aladdins kensal rise flat molly taking a terrible revenge blew his alibi wide open she had watched many rehearsals and knew every word every gag every nudge wink and shrill complaint of the dames part she had playedit to perfection to give her husband an alibi while he went back to his old job in croydon it all went perfectly even though uncle abanazer dancing with her had felt an unexpected softness i had known instinctively that something was very wrong it had however taken some time for me to realize what i had really seen that night at the tufinell park empire it was nothing less than an outrage to a great british tradition the widow twankey was a woman di grimble made his arrest and the case against denis timson was dropped by the crown prosecution service as spring came to the temple gardens hilda opened a letter in the other case which had turned on the recognition of old familiar faces and readit out to me the repointings going well on the tower and we hope to haveit finished by easter poppy longstaff had written and i have to tell you hilda the oilfired heating has changed our lives eric says its like living in the tropics cooking supper last night i had to peel off one of my cardigans she who must be obeyed put down the letter from her old school friend and said thoughtfully noblesse oblige what was that hilda i could tell at once that donald compton was a true gentleman the sort that does good by stealth of course poor old eric thought hed never get the tower mended but i somehow felt that donald wouldnt fail him it was noblesse perhapsit was i conceded but in this case the noblesse was rumpoles rumpole what on earth do you mean you hardly paid to have the church tower repointed did you in one sense yes i cant believe that after all the yearsit took you to have the bathroom decorated what on earth do you mean about your noblesse itd take too long to explain old darling besides ive got a conference in chambers tricky case of receiving stolen surgical appliances i suppose i added doubtfully it may lead at some time in the distant future to an act of charity easter came the work on the tower was successfully completed and i was walkng back to chambers after a gruelling day down at the bailey when i saw wafting through the temple cloisters the unlikely apparition of the rev eric longstaff he chirruped a greeting and said hed come up to consult some legal brains on the proper investment of what remained of the church restoration fund im so profoundly grateful he told me that i decided to invite you down to the rectory last christmas youdecided of course i did i thought your wife extended the invitation to she oh yes but i thought of the idea it was the result of a good deal of hard kneework and guidance from above i knew you were the right man for the job what job the compton job what was this the rector was speaking like an old con the coldsands caper whatcan you mean i just mean that i knew youd defended donald compton in a previous existence how on earth did you know that eric drew himself up to his full willowy height im not a prison visitor for nothing he said proudly i thought you were just the chap to put the fear of god into him you were the very person to put the squeeze on the lord of the manor put the squeeze on him words were beginning to fail me that was the idea it came to me as a result of kneework so you brought us down to that freezing rectory just so i could blackmail the local benefactor didntit turn out well may the lord forgive you hes very forgiving next time i spoke to the man of god severely the church can do its blackmailing for itself oh were quite used to that the rector smiled at me in what i thought was a lofty manner particularly around christmas the end
