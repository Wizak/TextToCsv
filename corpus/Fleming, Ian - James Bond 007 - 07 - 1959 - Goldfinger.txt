living persons is entirely accidental printed in great britain by richard clay ltd bungay suffolk to my gentle reader william plomer part one happenstance chapter one reflections in a double bourbon james bond with two double bourbons inside him sat in the final departure lounge of miami airport and thought about life and death it was part of his profession to kill people he had never liked doing it and when he had to kill he did it as well as he knew how and forgot about it as a secret agent who held the rare doubleo prefix the licence to kill in the secret service it was his duty to be as cool about death as a surgeon if it happened it happened regret was unprofessional worse it was deathwatch beetle in the soul and yet there had been something curiously impressive about the death of the mexican it wasnt that he hadnt deserved to die he was an evil man a man they call in mexico a capungo a capungo is a bandit who will kill for as little as forty pesos which is about twentyfive shillings though probably he had been paid more to attempt the killing of bond and from the look of him he had been an instrument of pain and misery all his life yes it had certainly been time for him to die but when bond had killed him less than twentyfour hours before life had gone out of the body so quickly so utterly that bond had almost seen it come out of his mouth as it does in the shape of a bird in haitian primitives what an extraordinary difference there was between a body full of person and a body that was empty now there is someone now there is no one this had been a mexican with a name and an address an employment card and perhaps a driving licence then something had gone out of him out of the envelope of flesh and cheap clothes and had left him an empty paper bag waiting for the dustcart and the difference the thing that had gone out of the stinking mexican bandit was greater than all mexico bond looked down at the weapon that had done it the cutting edge of his right hand was red and swollen it would soon show a bruise bond flexed the hand kneading it with his left he had been doing the same thing at intervals through the quick plane trip that had got him away it was a painful process but if he kept the circulation moving the hand would heal more quickly one couldnt tell how soon the weapon would be needed again cynicism gathered at the corners of bonds mouth national airlines airline of the stars announces the departure of their flight na to la guardia field new york will all passengers please proceed to gate number seven all aboard please the tannoy switched off with an echoing click bond glanced at his watch at least another ten minutes before transamerica would be called he signalled to a waitress and ordered another double bourbon on the rocks when the wide chunky glass came he swirled the liquor round for the ice to blunt it down and swallowed half of it he stubbed out the butt of his cigarette and sat his chin resting on his left hand and gazed moodily across the twinkling tarmac to where the last half of the sun was slipping gloriously into the gulf the death of the mexican had been the finishing touch to a bad assignment one of the worst squalid dangerous and without any redeeming feature except that it had got him away from headquarters a big man in mexico had some poppy fields the flowers were not for decoration they were broken down for opium which was sold quickly and comparatively cheaply by the waiters at a small cafe in mexico city called the madre de cacao the madre de cacao had plenty of protection if you needed opium you walked in and ordered what you wanted with your drink you paid for your drink at the caisse and the man at the caisse told you how many noughts to add to your bill it was an orderly commerce of no concern to anyone outside mexico then far away in england the government urged on by the united nations drive against drug smuggling announced that heroin would be banned in britain there was alarm in soho and also among respectable doctors who wanted to save their patients agony prohibition is the trigger of crime very soon the routine smuggling channels from china turkey and italy were ran almost dry by the illicit stockpiling in england in mexico city a pleasantspoken import and export merchant called blackwell had a sister in england who was a heroin addict he loved her and was sorry for her and when she wrote that she would die if someone didnt help he believed that she wrote the truth and set about investigating the illicit dope traffic in mexico in due course through friends and friends of friends he got to the madre de cacao and on from there to the big mexican grower in the process he came to know about the economics of the trade and he decided that if he could make a fortune and at the same time help suffering humanity he had found the secret of life blackwells business was in fertilizers he had a warehouse and a small plant and a staff of three for soil testing and plant research it was easy to persuade the big mexican that behind this respectable front blackwells team could busy itself extracting heroin from opium carriage to england was swiftly arranged by the mexican for the equivalent of a thousand pounds a trip every month one of the diplomatic couriers of the ministry of foreign affairs carried an extra suitcase to london the price was reasonable the contents of the suitcase after the mexican had deposited it at the victoria station leftluggage office and had mailed the ticket to a man called schwab co booxanpix ltd wc were worth twenty thousand pounds unfortunately schwab was a bad man unconcerned with suffering humanity he had the idea that if american juvenile delinquents could consume millions of dollars worth of heroin every year so could their teddy boy and girl cousins in two rooms in pimlico his staff watered the heroin with stomach powder and sent it on its way to the dance halls and amusement arcades schwab had already made a fortune when the cid ghost squad got on to him scotland yard decided to let him make a little more money while they investigated the source of his supply they put a close tail on schwab and in due course were led to victoria station and thence to the mexican courier at that stage since a foreign country was concerned the secret service had had to be called in and bond was ordered to find out where the courier got his supplies and to destroy the channel at source bond did as he was told he flew to mexico city and quickly got to the madre de cacao thence posing as a buyer for the london traffic he got back to the big mexican the mexican received him amiably and referred him to blackwell bond had rather taken to blackwell he knew nothing about blackwells sister but the man was obviously an amateur and his bitterness about the heroin ban in england rang true bond broke into his warehouse one night and left a thermite bomb he then went and sat in a cafe a mile away and watched the flames leap above the horizon of rooftops and listened to the silver cascade of the firebrigade bells the next morning he telephoned blackwell he stretched a handkerchief across the mouthpiece and spoke through it sorry you lost your business last night im afraid your insurance wont cover those stocks of soil you were researching whos that whos speaking im from england that stuff of yours has killed quite a lot of young people over there damaged a lot of others santos wont be coming to england any more with his diplomatic bag schwab will be in jail by tonight that fellow bond youve been seeing he wont get out of the net either the police are after him now frightened words came back down the line all right but just dont do it again stick to fertilizers bond hung up blackwell wouldnt have had the wits it was obviously the big mexican who had seen through the false trail bond had taken the precaution to move his hotel but that night as he walked home after a last drink at the copacabana a man suddenly stood in his way the man wore a dirty white linen suit and a chauffeurs white cap that was too big for his head there were deep blue shadows under aztec cheekbones in one corner of the slash of a mouth there was a toothpick and in the other a cigarette the eyes were bright pinpricks of marihuana you like woman make jigajig no coloured girl fine jungle tail no mebbe pictures the gesture of the hand slipping into the coat was so well known to bond so full of old dangers that when the hand flashed out and the long silver finger went for his throat bond was on balance and ready for it almost automatically bond went into the parry defence against underhand thrust out of the book his right arm cut across his body swivelling with it the two forearms met midway between the two bodies banging the mexicans knife arm off target and opening his guard for a crashing shortarm chin jab with bonds left bonds stiff locked wrist had not travelled far perhaps two feet but the heel of his palm with ringers spread for rigidity had come up and under the mans chin with terrific force the blow almost lifted the man off the sidewalk perhaps it had been that blow that had killed the mexican broken his neck but as he staggered back on his way to the ground bond had drawn back his right hand and slashed sideways at the taut offered throat it was the deadly handedge blow to the adams apple delivered with the fingers locked into a blade that had been the standby of the commandos if the mexican was still alive he was certainly dead before he hit the ground bond stood for a moment his chest heaving and looked at the crumpled pile of cheap clothes flung down in the dust he glanced up and down the street there was no one some cars passed others had perhaps passed during the fight but it had been in the shadows bond knelt down beside the body there was no pulse already the eyes that had been so bright with marihuana were glazing the house in which the mexican had lived was empty the tenant had left bond picked up the body and laid it against a wall in deeper shadow he brushed his hands down his clothes felt to see if his tie was straight and went on to his hotel at dawn bond had got up and shaved and driven to the airport where he took the first plane out of mexico it happened to be going to caracas bond flew to caracas and hung about in the transit lounge until there was a plane for miami a transamerica constellation that would take him on that same evening to new york again the tannoy buzzed and echoed transamerica regrets to announce a delay on their flight tr to new york due to a mechanical defect the new departure time will be at eight am will all passengers please report to the transamerica ticket counter where arrangements for their overnight accommodation will be made thank you so that too should he transfer to another flight or spend the night in miami bond had forgotten his drink he picked it up and tilting his head back swallowed the bourbon to the last drop the ice tinkled cheerfully against his teeth that was it that was an idea he would spend the night in miami and get drunk stinking drunk so that he would have to be carried to bed by whatever tart he had picked up he hadnt been drunk for years it was high time this extra night thrown at him out of the blue was a spare night a gone night he would put it to good purpose it was time he let himself go he was too tense too introspective what the hell was he doing glooming about this mexican this capungo who had been sent to kill him it had been kill or get killed anyway people were killing other people all the time all over the world people were using their motor cars to kill with they were carrying infectious diseases around blowing microbes in other peoples faces leaving gasjets turned on in kitchens pumping out carbon monoxide in closed garages how many people for instance were involved in manufacturing hbombs from the miners who mined the uranium to the shareholders who owned the mining shares was there any person in the world who wasnt somehow perhaps only statistically involved in killing his neighbour the last light of the day had gone below the indigo sky the flare paths twinkled green and yellow and threw tiny reflections off the oily skin of the tarmac with a shattering roar a dc hurtled down the main green lane the windows in the transit lounge rattled softly people got up to watch bond tried to read their expressions did they hope the plane would crash give them something to watch something to talk about something to fill their empty lives or did they wish it well which way were they willing the sixty passengers to live or to die bonds lips turned down cut it out stop being so damned morbid all this is just reaction from a dirty assignment youre stale tired of having to be tough you want a change youve seen too much death you want a slice of life easy soft high bond was conscious of steps approaching they stopped at his side bond looked up it was a clean richlooking middleaged man his expression was embarrassed deprecating pardon me but surely its mr bond mr er james bond chapter two living it up bond liked anonymity his yes it is was discouraging well thats a mighty rare coincidence the man held out his hand bond rose slowly took the hand and released it the hand was pulpy and unarticulated like a handshaped mud pack or an inflated rubber glove my name is du pont junius du pont i guess you wont remember me but weve met before mind if i sit down the face the name yes there was something familiar long ago not in america bond searched the files while he summed the man up mr du pont was about fifty pink cleanshaven and dressed in the conventional disguise with which brooks brothers cover the shame of american millionaires he wore a singlebreasted dark tan tropical suit and a white silk shirt with a shallow collar the rolled ends of the collar were joined by a gold safety pin beneath the knot of a narrow dark red and blue striped tie that fractionally wasnt the brigade of guards the cuffs of the shirt protruded half an inch below the cuffs of the coat and showed cabochon crystal links containing miniature trout flies the socks were charcoalgrey silk and the shoes were old and polished mahogany and hinted peal the man carried a dark narrowbrimmed straw homburg with a wide claret ribbon mr du pont sat down opposite bond and produced cigarettes and a plain gold zippo lighter bond noticed that he was sweating slightly he decided that mr du pont was what he appeared to be a very rich american mildly embarrassed he knew he had seen him before but he had no idea where or when smoke thank you it was a parliament bond affected not to notice the offered lighter he disliked heldout lighters he picked up his own and lit the cigarette trance royale les eaux mr du pont looked eagerly at bond that casino ethel thats mrs du pont and me were next to you at the table the night you had the big game with the frenchman bonds memory raced back yes of course the du ponts had been nos and at the baccarat table bond had been they had seemed harmless people he had been glad to have such a solid bulwark on his lefton that fantastic night when he had broken le chiffre now bond saw it all again the bright pool of light on the green baize the pink crab hands across the table scuttling out for the cards he smelled the smoke and the harsh tang of his own sweat that had been a night bond looked across at mr du pont and smiled at the memory yes of course i remember sorry i was slow but that was quite a night i wasnt thinking of much except my cards mr du pont grinned back happy and relieved why gosh mr bond of course i understand and i do hope youll pardon me for butting in you see he snapped his ringers for a waitress but we must have a drink to celebrate whatll you have thanks bourbon on the rocks and dimple haig and water the waitress went away mr du pont leant forward beaming a whiff of soap or aftershave lotion came across the table lentheric i knew it was you as soon as i saw you sitting there but i thought to myself junius you dont often make an error over a face but lets just go make sure well i was flying transamerican tonight and when they announced the delay i watched your expression and if youll pardon me mr bond it was pretty clear from the look on your face that you had been flying transamerican too he waited for bond to nod he hurried on so i ran down to the ticket counter and had me a look at the passenger list sure enough there it was j bond mr du pont sat back pleased with his cleverness the drinks came he raised his glass your very good health sir this sure is my lucky day bond smiled noncommittally and drank mr du pont leant forward again he looked round there was nobody at the nearby tables nevertheless he lowered his voice i guess youll be saying to yourself well its nice to see junius du pont again but whats the score whys he so particularly happy at seeing me on just this night mr du pont raised his eyebrows as if acting bonds part for him bond put on a face of polite inquiry mr du pont leant still farther across the table now i hope youll forgive me mr bond its not like me to pry into other peoples secre er affairs but after that game at royale i did hear that you were not only a grand card player but also that you were er how shall i put it that you were a sort of er investigator you know kind of intelligence operative mr du fonts indiscretion had made him go very red in the face he sat back and took out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead he looked anxiously at bond bond shrugged his shoulders the greyblue eyes that looked into mr du fonts eyes which had turned hard and watchful despite his embarrassment held a mixture of candour irony and selfdeprecation i used to dabble in that kind of thing hangover from thewar one still thought it was fun playing red indians but theres no future in it in peacetime quite quite mr du pont made a throwaway gesture with the hand that held the cigarette his eyes evaded bonds as he put the next question waited for the next lie and now youve settled down mr du pont smiled paternally what did you choose if youll pardon the question import and export im with universal perhaps youve come across them mr du pont continued to play the game hm universal let me see why yes sure ive heard of them cant say ive ever done business with them but i guess its never too late he chuckled fatly ive got quite a heap of interests all over the place only stuff i can honestly say im not interested in is chemicals maybe its my misfortune mr bond but im not one of the chemical du fonts bond decided that the man was quite satisfied with the particular brand of du pont he happened to be he made no comment he glanced at his watch to hurry mr du fonts play of the hand he made a note to handle his own cards carefully mr du pont had a nice pink kindly babyface with a puckered rather feminine turndown mouth he looked as harmless as any of the middleaged americans with cameras who stand outside buckingham palace but bond sensed many tough sharp qualities behind the fuddyduddy facade mr du fonts sensitive eye caught bonds glance at his watch he consulted his own my oh my seven oclock and here ive been talking away without coming to the point now see here mr bond ive got me a problem on which id greatly appreciate your guidance if you can spare me the time and if you were counting on stopping over in miami tonight id reckon it a real favour if youd allow me to be your host mr du pont held up his hand now i think i can promise to make you comfortable so happens i own a piece of the floridiana maybe you heard we opened around christmas time doing a great business im happy to say really pushing that little old fountain blue mr du pont laughed indulgently thats what we call the fontainebleau down here now what do you say mr bond you shall have the best suite even if it means putting some good paying customers out on the sidewalk and youd be doing me a real favour mr du pont looked imploring bond had already decided to accept blind whatever mr du fonts problem blackmail gangsters women it would be some typical form of rich mans worry here was a slice of the easy life he had been asking for take it bond started to say something politely deprecating mr du pont interrupted please please mr bond and believe me im grateful very grateful indeed he snapped his fingers for the waitress when she came he turned away from bond and settled the bill out of bonds sight like many very rich men he considered that showing his money letting someone see how much he tipped amounted to indecent exposure he thrust his roll back into his trousers pocket and took bond by the arm he sensed bonds resistance to the contact and removed his hand they went down the stairs to the main hall now lets just straighten out your reservation mr du pont headed for the transamerica ticket counter in a few curt phrases mr du pont showed his power and efficiency in his own his american realm yes mr du pont surely mr du pont ill take care of that mr du pont outside a gleaming chrysler imperial sighed up to the kerb a toughlooking chauffeur in a biscuitcoloured uniform hurried to open the door bond stepped in and settled down in the soft upholstery the interior of the car was deliciously cool almost cold the transamerican representative bustled out with bonds suitcase handed it to the chauffeur and with a halfbow went back into the terminal bills on the beach said mr du pont to the chauffeur and the big car slid away through the crowded parking lots and out on to the parkway mr du pont settled back hope you like stone crabs mr bond ever tried them bond said he had that he liked them very much mr du pont talked about bills on the beach and about the relative merits of stone and alaska crab meat while the chrysler imperial sped through downtown miami along biscayne boulevard and across biscayne bay by the douglas macarthur causeway bond made appropriate comments letting himself be carried along on the gracious stream of speed and comfort and rich smalltalk they drew up at a whitepainted mockregency frontage in clapboard and stucco a scrawl of pink neon said bills on the beach while bond got out mr du pont gave his instructions to the chauffeur bond heard the words the aloha suite and if theres any trouble tell mr fairlie to call me here right they went up the steps inside the big room was decorated in white with pink muslin swags over the windows there were pink lights on the tables the restaurant was crowded with sunburned people in expensive tropical getups brilliant garish shirts jangling gold bangles dark glasses with jewelled rims cute native straw hats there was a confusion of scents the wry smell of bodies that had been all day in the sun came through bill a pansified italian hurried towards them why mr du pont is a pleasure sir little crowded tonight soon fix you up please this way please holding a large leatherbound menu above his head the man weaved his way between the diners to the best table in the room a corner table for six he pulled out two chairs snapped his ringers for the maitre dhotel and the wine waiter spread two menus in front of them exchanged compliments with mr du pont and left them mr du pont slapped his menu shut he said to bond now why dont you just leave this to me if theres anything you dont like send it back and to the head waiter stone crabs not frozen fresh melted butter thick toast right very good mr du pont the wine waiter washing his hands took the waiters place two pints of pink champagne the pommery silver tankards right vairry good mr du pont a cocktail to start mr du pont turned to bond he smiled and raised his eyebrows bond said vodka martini please with a slice of lemon peel make it two said mr du pont doubles the wine waiter hurried off mr du pont sat back and produced his cigarettes and lighter he looked round the room answered one or two waves with a smile and a lift of the hand and glanced at the neighbouring tables he edged his chair nearer to bonds cant help the noise im afraid he said apologetically only come here for the crabs theyre out of thisworld hope youre not allergic to them once brought a girl here and fed her crabs and her lips swelled up like cycle tyres bond was amused at the change in mr du pont this racy talk the authority of manner once mr du pont thought he had got bond on the hook on his payroll he was a different man from the shy embarrassed suitor who had solicited bond at the airport what did mr du pont want from bond it would be coming any minute now the proposition bond said i havent got any allergies good good there was a pause mr du pont snapped the lid of his lighter up and down several times he realized he was making an irritating noise and pushed it away from him he made up his mind he said speaking at his hands on the table in front of him you ever play canasta mr bond yes its a good game i like it twohanded canasta i have done its not so much fun if you dont make a fool of yourself if neither of you do it tends to even out law of averages in the cards no chance of making much difference in the play mr du pont nodded emphatically just so thats what ive said to myself over a hundred games or so two equal players will end up equal not such a good game as gin or oklahoma but in a way thats just what i like about it you pass the time you handle plenty of cards you have your ups and downs no one gets hurt right bond nodded the martinis came mr du pont said to the wine waiter bring two more in ten minutes they drank mr du pont turned and faced bond his face was petulant crumpled he said what would you say mr bond if i told you id lost twentyfive thousand dollars in a week playing twohanded canasta bond was about to reply mr du pont held up his hand and mark you im a good card player member of the regency club play a lot with people like charlie goren johnny crawford at bridge that is but what i mean i know my way around at the card table mr du pont probed bonds eyes if youve been playing with the same man all the time youve been cheated exactly mr du pont slapped the tablecloth he sat back exactly thats what i said to myself after id lost lost for four whole days so i said to myself this bastard is cheating me and by golly ill find out how he does it and have him hounded out of miami so i doubled the stakes and then doubled them again he was quite happy about it and i watched every card he played every movement nothing not a hint or a sign cards not marked new pack whenever i wanted one my own cards never looked at my hand couldnt as i always sat dead opposite him no kibitzer to tip him off and he just went on winning and winning won again this morning and again this afternoon finally i got so mad at the game i didnt show it mind you bond might think he had not been a sport i paid up politely but without telling this guy i just packed my bag and got me to the airport and booked on the first plane to new york think of that mr du pont threw up his hands running away but twentyfive grand is twentyfive grand i could see it getting to fifty a hundred and i just couldnt stand another of these damned games and i couldnt stand not being able to catch this guy out so i took off what do you think of that me junius du pont throwing in the towel because i couldnt take the licking any more bond grunted sympathetically the second round of drinks came bond was mildly interested he was always interested in anything to do with cards he could see the scene the two men playing and playing and the one man quietly shuffling and dealing away and marking up his score while the other was always throwing his cards into the middle of the table with a gesture of controlled disgust mr du pont was obviously being cheated how bond said twentyfive thousands a lot of money what stakes were you playing mr du pont looked sheepish quarter a point then fifty cents then a dollar pretty high i guess with the games averaging around two thousand points even at a quarter that makes five hundred dollars a game at a dollar a point if you go on losing its murder you must have won sometimes oh sure but somehow just as id got the sob all set for a killing hed put down as many of his cards as he could meld got out of the bag sure i won some small change but only when he needed a hundred and twenty to go down and id got all the wild cards but you know how it is with canasta you have to discard right you lay traps to make the other guy hand you the pack well darn it he seemed to be psychic whenever i laid a trap hed dodge it and almost every time he laid one for me id fall into it as for giving me the pack why hed choose the damnedest cards when he was pushed discard singletons aces god knows what and always get away with it it was just as if he knew every card in my hand any mirrors in the room heck no we always played outdoors he said he wanted to get himself a sunburn certainly did that red as lobster hed only play in the mornings and afternoons said if he played in the evening he couldnt get to sleep who is this man anyway whats his name goldfinger first name auric that means golden doesnt it he certainly is that got flaming red hair nationality you wont believe it but hes a britisher domiciled in nassau youd think hed be a jew from the name but he doesnt look it were restricted at the floridiana wouldnt have got in if he had been nassavian passport age fortytwo unmarried profession broker got all this from his passport had me a peek via the house detective when i started to play with him what sort of broker du pont smiled grimly i asked him he said oh anything that comes along evasive sort of fellow clams up if you ask him a direct question talks away quite pleasantly about nothing at all whats he worth ha said mr du pont explosively thats the damnedest thing hes loaded but loaded i got my bank to check with nassau hes lousy with it millionaires are a dime a dozen in nassau but hes rated either first or second among them seems he keeps his money in gold bars shifts them around the world a lot to get the benefit of changes in the gold price acts like a damn federal bank doesnt trust currencies cant say hes wrong in that and seeing how hes one of the richest men in the world there must be something to his system but the point is if hes as rich as that what the hell does he want to take a lousy twentyfive grand off me for a bustle of waiters round their table saved bond having to think up a reply with ceremony a wide silver dish of crabs big ones their shells and claws broken was placed in the middle of the table a silver sauceboat brimming with melted butter and a long rack of toast was put beside each of their plates the tankards of champagne frothed pink finally with an oily smirk the head waiter came behind their chairs and in turn tied round their necks long white silken bibs that reached down to the lap bond was reminded of charles laughton playing henry viii but neither mr du pont nor the neighbouring diners seemed surprised at the hoggish display mr du pont with a gleeful every man for himself raked several hunks of crab on to his plate doused them liberally in melted butter and dug in bond followed suit and proceeded to eat or rather devour the most delicious meal he had had in his life the meat of the stone crabs was the tenderest sweetest shellfish he had ever tasted it was perfectly set off by the dry toast and slightly burned taste of the melted butter the champagne seemed to have the faintest scent of strawberries it was ice cold after each helping of crab the champagne cleaned the palate for the next they ate steadily and with absorption and hardly exchanged a word until the dish was cleared with a slight belch mr du pont for the last time wiped butter off his chin with his silken bib and sat back his face was flushed he looked proudly at bond he said reverently mr bond i doubt if anywhere in the world a man has eaten as good a dinner as that tonight what do you say bond thought i asked for the easy life the rich life how do i like it how do i like eating like a pig and hearing remarks like that suddenly the idea of ever having another meal like this or indeed any other meal with mr du pont revolted him he felt momentarily ashamed of his disgust he had asked and it had been given it was the puritan in him that couldnt take it he had made his wish and the wish had not only been granted it had been stuffed down his throat bond said i dont know about that but it was certainly very good mr du pont was satisfied he called for coffee bond refused the offer of cigars or liqueurs he lit a cigarette and waited with interest for the catch to be presented he knew there would be one it was obvious that all this was part of the comeon well let it come mr du pont cleared his throat and now mr bond i have a proposition to put to you he stared at bond trying to gauge his reaction in advance yes it surely was providential to meet you like that at the airport mr du fonts voice was grave sincere ive never forgotten our first meeting at royale i recall every detail of it your coolness your daring your handling of the cards bond looked down at the tablecloth but mr du pont had got tired of his peroration he said hurriedly mr bond i will pay you ten thousand dollars to stay here as my guest until you have discovered how this man goldfinger beats me at cards bond looked mr du pont in the eye he said thats a handsome offer mr du pont but i have to get back to london i must be in new york to catch my plane within fortyeight hours if you will play your usual sessions tomorrow morning and afternoon i should have plenty of time to find out the answer but i must leave tomorrow night whether i can help you or not done done said mr du pont chapter three the man with agoraphobia the flapping of the curtains wakened bond he threw off the single sheet and walked across the thick pile carpet to the picture window that filled the whole of one wall he drew back the curtains and went out on to the sunfilled balcony the black and white chequerboard tiles were warm almost hot to the feet although it could not yet be eight oclock a brisk inshore breeze was blowing off the sea straining the flags of all nations that flew along the pier of the private yacht basin the breeze was humid and smelt strongly of the sea bond guessed it was the breeze that the visitors like but the residents hate it would rust the metal fittings in their homes fox the pages of their books rot their wallpaper and pictures breed damprot in their clothes twelve storeys down the formal gardens dotted with palm trees and beds of bright croton and traced with neat gravel walks between avenues of bougainvillaea were rich and dull gardeners were working raking the paths and picking up leaves with the lethargic slow motion of coloured help two mowers were at work on the lawns and where they had already been sprinklers were gracefully flinging handfuls of spray directly below bond the elegant curve of the cabana club swept down to the beach two storeys of changingrooms below a flat roof dotted with chairs and tables and an occasional red and white striped umbrella within the curve was the brilliant green oblong of the olympiclength swimmingpool fringed on all sides by row upon row of mattressed steamer chairs on which the customers would soon be getting their fiftydollaraday sunburn whitejacketed men were working among them straightening the lines of chairs turning the mattresses and sweeping up yesterdays cigarette butts beyond was the long golden beach and the sea and more men raking the tideline putting up the umbrellas laying out mattresses no wonder the neat card inside bonds wardrobe had said that the cost of the aloha suite was two hundred dollars a day bond made a rough calculation if he was paying the bill it would take him just three weeks to spend his whole salary for the year bond smiled cheerfully to himself he went back into the bedroom picked up the telephone and ordered himself a delicious wasteful breakfast a carton of kingsize chesterfields and the newspapers by the time he had shaved and had an icecold shower and dressed it was eight oclock he walked through into the elegant sittingroom and found a waiter in a uniform of plum and gold laying out his breakfast beside the window bond glanced at the miami herald the front page was devoted to yesterdays failure of an american icbm at the nearby cape canaveral and a bad upset in a big race at hialeah bond dropped the paper on the floor and sat down and slowly ate his breakfast and thought about mr du pont and mr goldfinger his thoughts were inconclusive mr du pont was either a much worse player than he thought which seemed unlikely on bonds reading of his tough shrewd character or else goldfinger was a cheat if goldfinger cheated at cards although he didnt need the money it was certain that he had also made himself rich by cheating or sharp practice on a much bigger scale bond was interested in big crooks he looked forward to his first sight of goldfinger he also looked forward to penetrating goldfingers highly successful and on the face of it highly mysterious method of fleecing mr du pont it was going to be a most entertaining day idly bond waited for it to get under way the plan was that he would meet mr du pont in the garden at ten oclock the story would be that bond had flown down from new york to try and sell mr du pont a block of shares from an english holding in a canadian natural gas property the matter was clearly confidential and goldfinger would not think of questioning bond about details shares natural gas canada that was all bond needed to remember they would go along together to the roof of the cabana club where the game was played and bond would read his paper and watch after luncheon during which bond and mr du pont would discuss their business there would be the same routine mr du pont had inquired if there was anything else he could arrange bond had asked for the number of mr goldfingers suite and a passkey he had explained that if goldfinger was any kind of a professional cardsharp or even an expert amateur he would travel with the usual tools of the trade marked and shaved cards the apparatus for the short arm delivery and so forth mr du pont had said he would give bond the key when they met in the garden he would have no difficulty getting one from the manager after breakfast bond relaxed and gazed into the middle distance of the sea he was not keyed up by the job on hand only interested and amused it was just the kind of job he had needed to clear his palate after mexico at half past nine bond left his suite and wandered along the corridors of his floor getting lost on his way to the elevator in order to reconnoitre the layout of the hotel then having met the same maid twice he asked his way and went down in the elevator and moved among the scattering of early risers through the pineapple shopping arcade he glanced into the bamboo coffee shoppe the rendezvous bar the la tropicala diningroom the kittekat klub for children and the boomboom nighterie he then went purposefully out into the garden mr du pont now dressed for the beach by abercrombie fitch gave him the passkey to goldfingers suite they sauntered over to the cabana club and climbed the two short flights of stairs to the top deck bonds first view of mr goldfinger was startling at the far corner of the roof just below the cliff of the hotel a man was lying back with his legs up on a steamer chair he was wearing nothing but a yellow satin bikini slip dark glasses and a pair of wide tin wings under his chin the wings which appeared to fit round his neck stretched out across his shoulders and beyond them and then curved up slightly to rounded tips bond said what the hells he wearing round his neck you never seen one of those mr du pont was surprised thats a gadget to help your tan polished tin reflects the sun up under your chin and behind the ears the bits that wouldnt normally catch the sun well well said bond when they were a few yards from the reclining figure mr du pont called out cheerfully in what seemed to bond an overloud voice hi there mr goldfinger did not stir mr du pont said in his normal voice hes very deaf they were now at mr goldfingers feet mr du pont repeated his hail mr goldfinger sat up sharply he removed his dark glasses why hullo there he unhitched the wings from round his neck put them carefully on the ground beside him and got heavily to his feet he looked at bond with slow inquiring eyes like you to meet mr bond james bond friend of mine from new york countryman of yours come down to try and talk me into a bit of business mr goldfinger held out a hand pleased to meet you mr bomb bond took the hand it was hard and dry there was the briefest pressure and it was withdrawn for an instant mr goldfingers pale chinablue eyes opened wide and stared hard at bond they stared right through his face to the back of his skull then the lids drooped the shutter closed over the xray and mr goldfinger took the exposed plate and slipped it away in his filing system so no game today the voice was flat colourless the words were more of a statement than a question whaddya mean no game shouted mr du pont boisterously you werent thinking id let you hang on to my money got to get it back or i shant be able to leave this darned hotel mr du pont chuckled richly ill tell sam to fix the table james here says he doesnt know much about cards and hed like to learn the game that right james he turned to bond sure youll be all right with your paper and the sunshine id be glad of the rest said bond been travelling too much again the eyes bored into bond and then drooped til get some clothes on i had intended to have a golf lesson this afternoon from mr armour at the boca raton but cards have priority among my hobbies my tendency to uncock the wrists too early with the midirons will have to wait the eyes rested incuriously on bond you play golf mr bomb bond raised his voice occasionally when im in england and where do you play huntercombe ah a pleasant little course i have recently joined the royal st marks sandwich is close to one of my business interests you know it i have played there what is your handicap nine that is a coincidence so is mine we must have a game one day mr goldfinger bent down and picked up his tin wings he said to mr du pont i will be with you in five minutes he walked slowly off towards the stairs bond was amused this social sniffing at him had been done with just the right casual touch of the tycoon who didnt really care if bond was alive or dead but since he was there and alive might as well place him in an approximate category mr du pont gave instructions to a steward in a white coat two others were already setting up a card table bond walked to the rail that surrounded the roof and looked down into the garden reflecting on mr goldfinger he was impressed mr goldfinger was one of the most relaxed men bond had ever met it showed in the economy of his movement of his speech of his expressions mr goldfinger wasted no effort yet there was something coiled compressed in the immobility of the man when goldfinger had stood up the first thing that had struck bond was that everything was out of proportion goldfinger was short not more than five feet tall and on top of the thick body and blunt peasant legs was set almost directly into the shoulders a huge and it seemed exactly round head it was as if goldfinger had been put together with bits of other peoples bodies nothing seemed to belong perhaps bond thought it was to conceal his ugliness that goldfinger made such a fetish of sunburn without the redbrown camouflage the pale body would be grotesque the face under the cliff of crewcut carroty hair was as startling without being as ugly as the body it was moonshaped without being moonlike the forehead was fine and high and the thin sandy brows were level above the large light blue eyes fringed with pale lashes the nose was fleshily aquiline between high cheekbones and cheeks that were more muscular than fat the mouth was thin and dead straight but beautifully drawn the chin and jaws were firm and glinted with health to sum up thought bond it was the face of a thinker perhaps a scientist who was ruthless sensual stoical and tough an odd combination what else could he guess bond always mistrusted short men they grew up from childhood with an inferiority complex all their lives they would strive to be big bigger than the others who had teased them as a child napoleon had been short and hitler it was the short men that caused all the trouble in the world and what about a misshapen short man with red hair and a bizarre face that might add up to a really formidable misfit one could certainly feel the repressions there was a powerhouse of vitality humming in the man that suggested that if one stuck an electric bulb into goldfingers mouth it would light up bond smiled at the thought into what channels did goldfinger release his vital force into getting rich into sex into power probably into all three what could his history be today he might be an englishman what had he been born not a jew though there might be jewish blood in him not a latin or anything farther south not a slav perhaps a german no a bait thats where he would have come from one of the old baltic provinces probably got away to escape the russians goldfinger would have been warned or his parents had smelled trouble and they had got him out in time and what had happened then how had he worked his way up to being one of the richest men in the world one day it might be interesting to find out for the time being it would be enough to find out how he won at cards all set mr du pont called to goldfinger who was coming across the roof towards the card table with his clothes on a comfortably fitting dark blue suit a white shirt open at the neck goldfinger cut an almost passable figure but there was no disguise for the great brown and red football of a head and the fleshcoloured hearing aid plugged into the left ear was net an improvement mr du pont sat with his back to the hotel goldfinger took the seat opposite and cut the cards du pont won the cut pushed the other pack over to goldfinger tapped them to show they were already shuffled and he couldnt bother to cut and goldfinger began the deal bond sauntered over and took a chair at mr du fonts elbow he sat back relaxed he made a show of folding his paper to the sports page and watched the deal somehow bond had expected it but this was no cardsharp goldfinger dealt quickly and efficiently but with no hint of the mechanics grip those vital three fingers curled round the long edge of the cards and the index finger at the outside short upper edge the grip that means you are armed for dealing bottoms or seconds and he wore no signet ring for pricking the cards no surgical tape round a finger for marking them mr du pont turned to bond deal of fifteen cards he commented you draw two and discard one otherwise straight regency rules no monkey business with the red treys counting one three five eight or any of that european stuff mr du pont picked up his cards bond noticed that he sorted them expertly not grading them according to value from left to right or holding his wild cards of which he had two at the left a pattern that might help a watchful opponent mr du pont concentrated his good cards in the centre of his hand with the singletons and broken melds on either side the game began mr du pont drew first a miraculous pair of wild cards his face betrayed nothing he discarded casually he only needed two more good draws to go out unseen but he would have to be lucky drawing two cards doubles the chance of picking up what you want but it also doubles the chance of picking up useless cards that will only clutter up your hand goldfinger played a more deliberate game almost irritatingly slow after drawing he shuffled through his cards again and again before deciding on his discard on the third draw du pont had improved his hand to the extent that he now needed only one of five cards to go down and out and catch his opponent with a handful of cards which would all count against him as if goldfinger knew the danger he was in he went down for fifty and proceeded to make a canasta with three wild cards and four fives he also got rid of some more melds and ended with only four cards in his hand in any other circumstances it would have been ridiculously bad play as it was he had made some four hundred points instead of losing over a hundred for on the next draw mr du pont filled his hand and with most of the edge taken off his triumph by goldfingers escape went down unseen with the necessary two canastas by golly i nearly screwed you that time mr du fonts voice had an edge of exasperation what in hell told you to cut an run goldfinger said indifferently i smelled trouble he added up his points announced them and jotted them down waiting for mr du pont to do the same then he cut the cards and sat back and regarded bond with polite interest will you be staying long mr bomb bond smiled its bond bond no i have to go back to new york tonight how sad goldfingers mouth pursed in polite regret he turned back to the cards and the game went on bond picked up his paper and gazed unseeing at the baseball scores while he listened to the quiet routine of the game goldfinger won that hand and the next and the next he won the game there was a difference of one thousand five hundred points one thousand five hundred dollars to goldfinger there it goes again it was the plaintive voice of mr du pont bond put down his paper does he usually win usually the word was a snort he always wins they cut again and goldfinger began to deal bond said dont you cut for seats i often find a change of seat helps the luck hostage to fortune and so on goldfinger paused in his deal he bent his gaze gravely on bond unfortunately mr bond that is not possible or i could not play as i explained to mr du pont at our first game i suffer from an obscure complaint agoraphobia the fear of open spaces i cannot bear the openhorizon i must sit and face the hotel the deal continued oh im so sorry bonds voice was grave interested thats a very rare disability ive always been able to understand claustrophobia but not the other way round how did it come about goldfinger picked up his cards and began to arrange his hand i have no idea he said equably bond got up well i think ill stretch my legs for a bit see whats going on in the pool you do just that said mr du pont jovially just take it easy james plenty of time to discuss business over lunch ill see if i cant dish it out to my friend goldfinger this time instead of taking it be seeing you goldfinger didnt look up from his cards bond strolled down the roof past the occasional splayedout body to the rail at the far end that overlooked the pool for a time he stood and contemplated the ranks of pink and brown and white flesh laid out below him on the steamer chairs the heavy scent of suntan oil came up to him there were a few children and young people in the pool a man obviously a professional diver perhaps the swimming instructor stood on the highdive he balanced on the balls of his feet a muscled greek god with golden hair he bounced once casually and flew off and down his arms held out like wings lazily they arrowed out to cleave the water for the body to pass through the impact left only a brief turbulence the diver jackknifed up again shaking his head boyishly there was a smattering of applause the man trudged slowly down the pool his head submerged his shoulders moving with casual power bond thought good luck to you you wont be able to keep this up for more than another five or six years highdivers couldnt take it for long the repeated shock to the skull with skijumping which had the same shattering effect on the frame highdiving was the shortestlived sport bond radioed to the diver cash in quick get into films while the hairs still gold bond turned and looked back down the roof towards the two canasta players beneath the cliff of the hotel so goldfinger liked to face the hotel or was it that he liked mr du pont to have his back to it and why now what was the number of goldfingers suite no the hawaii suite bonds on the top floor was so all things being equal goldfingers would be directly below bonds on the second floor twenty yards or so above the roof of the cabana club twenty yards from the card table bond counted down he closely examined the frontage that should be goldfingers nothing an empty sun balcony an open door into the dark interior of the suite bond measured distances angles yes thats how it might be thats how it must be clever mr goldfinger chapter four over the barrel after luncheon the traditional shrimp cocktail native snapper with a minute paper cup of tartare sauce roast prime ribs of beef au jus and pineapple surprise it was time for the siesta before meeting goldfinger at three oclock for the afternoon session mr du pont who had lost a further ten thousand dollars or more confirmed that goldfinger had a secretary never seen her sticks to the suite probably just some chorine hes brought down for the ride he smiled wetly i mean the daily ride why you on to something bond was noncommittal cant tell yet i probably wont be coming down this afternoon say i got bored watching gone into the town he paused but if my ideas right dont be surprised at what may happen if goldfinger starts to behave oddly just sit quiet and watch im not promising anything i think ive got him but i may be wrong mr du pont was enthusiastic good for you boyo he said effusively i just cant wait to see that bastard over the barrel damn his eyes bond took the elevator up to his suite he went to his suitcase and extracted an m leica an mc exposure meter a k filter and a flashholder he put a bulb in the holder and checked the camera he went to his balcony glanced at the sun to estimate where it would be at about threethirty and went back into the sittingroom leaving the door to the balcony open he stood at the balcony door and aimed the exposure meter the exposure was onehundredth of a second he set this on the leica put the shutter at f and the distance at twelve feet he clipped on a lens hood and took one picture to see that all was working then he wound on the film slipped in the flashholder and put the camera aside bond went to his suitcase and took out a thick book the bible designed to be read as literature opened it and extracted his walther ppk in the berns martin holster he slipped the holster inside his trouser band to the left he tried one or two quick draws they were satisfactory he closely examined the geography of his suite on the assumption that it would be exactly similar to the hawaii he visualized the scene that would almost certainly greet him when he came through the door of the suite downstairs he tried his passkey in the various locks and practised opening the doors noiselessly then he pulled a comfortable chair in front of the open balcony door and sat and smoked a cigarette while he gazed out across the sea and thought of how he would put things to goldfinger when the time came at threefifteen bond got up and went out on to the balcony and cautiously looked down at the two tiny figures across the square of green baize he went back into the room and checked the exposure meter on the leica the light was the same he slipped on the coat of his dark blue tropical worsted suit straightened his tie and slung the strap of the leica round his neck so that the camera hung at his chest then with a last look round he went out and along to the elevator he rode down to the ground floor and examined the shop windows in the foyer when the elevator had gone up again he walked to the staircase and slowly climbed up two floors the geography of the second floor was identical with the twelfth room was where he had expected it to be there was no one in sight he took out his passkey and silently opened the door and closed it behind him in the small lobby a raincoat a light camelhair coat and a pale grey homburg hung on hooks bond took his leica firmly in his right hand held it up close to his face and gently tried the door to the sittingroom it was not locked bond eased it open even before he could see what he expected to see he could hear the voice it was a low attractive girls voice an english voice it was saying drew five and four completed canasta in fives with two twos discarding four has singletons in kings knaves nines sevens bond slid into the room the girl was sitting on two cushions on top of a table which had been pulled up a yard inside the open balcony door she had needed the cushions to give her height it was at the top of the afternoon heat and she was naked except for a black brassiere and black silk briefs she was swinging her legs in a bored fashion she had just finished painting the nails on her left hand now she stretched the hand out in front of her to examine the effect she brought the hand back close to her lips and blew on the nails her right hand reached sideways and put the brush back in the revlon bottle on the table beside her a few inches from her eyes were the eyepieces of a powerfullooking pair of binoculars supported on a tripod whose feet reached down between her sunburned legs to the floor jutting out from below the binoculars was a microphone from which wires led to a box about the size of a portable record player under the table other wires ran from the box to a gleaming indoor aerial on the sideboard against the wall the briefs tightened as she leant forward again and put her eyes to the binoculars drew a queen and a king meld of queens can meld kings with a joker discarding seven she switched off the microphone while she was concentrating bond stepped swiftly across the floor until he was almost behind her there was a chair he stood on it praying it wouldnt squeak now he had the height to get the whole scene in focus he put his eye to the viewfinder yes there it was all in line the girls head the edge of the binoculars the microphone and twenty yards below the two men at the table with mr du fonts hand of cards held in front of him bond could distinguish the reds and the blacks he pressed the button the sharp explosion of the bulb and the blinding flash of light forced a quick scream out of the girl she swivelled round bond stepped down off the chair good afternoon whoryou whatyouwant the girls hand was up to her mouth her eyes screamed at him ive got what i want dont worry its all over now and my jmmes bond james bond bond put his camera carefully down on the chair and came and stood in the radius of her scent she was very beautiful she had the palest blonde hair it fell heavily to her shoulders unfashionably long her eyes were deep blue against a lightly sunburned skin and her mouth was bold and generous and would have a lovely smile she stood up and took her hand away from her mouth she was tall perhaps five feet ten and her arms and legs looked firm as if she might be a swimmer her breasts thrust against the black silk of the brassiere some of the fear had gone out of her eyes she said in a low voice what are you going to do nothing to you i may tease goldfinger a bit move over like a good girl and let me have a look bond took the girls place and looked through the glasses the game was going on normally goldfinger showed no sign that his communications had broken down doesnt he mind not getting the signals will he stop playing she said hesitatingly its happened before when a plug pulled or something he just waits for me to come through again bond smiled at her well lets let him stew for a bit have a cigarette and relax he held out a packet of chesterfields she took one anyway its time you did the nails on your right hand a smile flickered across her mouth how long were you there you gave me a frightful shock not long and im sorry about the shock goldfingers been giving poor old mr du pont shocks for a whole week yes she said doubtfully i suppose its really rather mean but hes very rich isnt he oh yes i shouldnt lose any sleep over mr du pont but goldfinger might choose someone who cant afford it anyway hes a millionaire himself why does he do it hes crawling with money animation flooded back into her face i know i simply cant understand him its a sort of mania with him making money he cant leave it alone ive asked him why and all he says is that ones a fool not to make money when the odds are right hes always going on about the same thing getting the odds right when he talked me into doing this she waved her cigarette dt the binoculars and i asked him why on earth he bothered took these stupid risks all he said was thats the second lesson when the odds arent right make them right bond said well its lucky for him im not pinkertons or the miami police department the girl shrugged her shoulders oh that wouldnt worry him hed just buy you off he can buy anyone off no one can resist gold what do you mean she said indifferently he always carries a million dollars worth of gold about with him except when hes going through the customs then he just carries a belt full of gold coins round his stomach otherwise its in thin sheets in the bottom and sides of his suitcases theyre really gold suitcases covered with leather they must weigh a ton he always travels by car one with special springs and his chauffeur is a huge man he carries them no one else touches them why does he carry around all that gold just in case he needs it he knows that gold will buy him anything he wants its all twentyfour carat and anyway he loves gold really loves it like people love jewels or stamps or well she smiled women bond smiled back does he love you she blushed and said indignantly certainly not then more reasonably of course you can think anything you like but really he doesnt i mean i think he likes people to think that we that im that its a question of love and all that you know hes not very prepossessing and i suppose its a question of well of vanity or something yes i see so youre just a kind of secretary companion she corrected him i dont have to type or anything she suddenly put her hand up to her mouth oh but i shouldnt be telling you all this you wont tell him will you hed fire me fright came into her eyes or something i dont know what hed do hes the sort of man who might do anything of course i wont tell but this cant be much of a life for you why do you do it she said tartly a hundred pounds a week and all this she waved at the roomdoesnt grow on trees i save up when ive saved enough i shall go bond wondered if goldfinger would let her wouldnt she know too much he looked at the beautiful face the splendid unselfconscious body she might not suspect it but for his money she was in very bad trouble with this man the girl was fidgeting now she said with an embarrassed laugh i dont think im very properly dressed cant i go and put something on over these bond wasnt sure he could trust her it wasnt he who was paying the hundred pounds a week he said airily you look fine just as respectable as those hundreds of people round the pool anyway he stretched its about time to fight a fire under mr goldfinger bond had been glancing down at the game from time to time it seemed to be proceeding normally bond bent again to the binoculars already mr du pont seemed to be a new man his gestures were expansive the halfprofile of his pink face was full of animation while bond watched he took a fistful of cards out of his hand and spread them down a pure canasta in kings bond tilted the binoculars up an inch the big redbrown moon face was impassive uninterested mr goldfinger was waiting patiently for the odds to adjust themselves back in his favour while bond watched he put up a hand to the hearing aid pushing the amplifier more firmly into his ear ready for the signals to come through again bond stepped back neat little machine he commented what are you transmitting on he told me but i cant remember she screwed up her eyes a hundred and seventy somethings would it be megasomethings megacycles might be but id be surprised if he doesnt get a lot of taxicabs and police messages mixed up with your talk must have fiendish concentration bond grinned now then all set its time to pull the rug away suddenly she reached out and put a hand on his sleeve there was a claddagh ring on the middle finger two gold hands clasped round a gold heart there were tears in her voice must you cant you leave him alone i dont know what hell do to me please she hesitated she was blushing furiously and i like you its a long time since ive seen someone like you couldnt you just stay here for a little more she looked down at the ground if only youd leave him alone id do the words came out in a rush id do anything bond smiled he took the girls hand off his arm and squeezed it sorry im being paid to do this job and i must do it anyway his voice went flat i want to do it its time someone cut mr goldfinger down to size ready without waiting for an answer he bent to the binoculars they were still focused on goldfinger bond cleared his throat he watched the big face carefully his hand felt for the microphone switch and pressed it down there must have been a whisper of static in the deaf aid goldfingers expression didnt alter but he slowly raised his face to heaven and then down again as if in benediction bond spoke softly menacingly into the microphone now hear me goldfinger he paused not a flicker of expression but goldfinger bent his head a fraction as if listening he studied his cards intently his hands quite still this is james bond speaking remember me the games finished and its time to pay i have a photograph of the whole setup blonde binoculars microphone and you and your hearing aid this photograph will not go to the fbi and scotland yard so long as you obey me exactly nod your head if you understand the face was still expressionless slowly the big round head bent forward and then straightened itself put your cards down face upwards on the table the hands went down they opened and the cards slid off the fingers on to the table take out your cheque book and write a cheque to cash for fifty thousand dollars that is made up as follows thirtyfive you have taken from mr du pont ten for my fee the extra five for wasting so much of mr du fonts valuable time bond watched to see that his order was being obeyed he took a glance at mr du pont mr du pont was leaning forward gaping mr goldfinger slowly detached the cheque and countersigned it on the back right now jot this down on the back of your cheque book and see you get it right book me a compartment on the silver meteor to new york tonight have a bottle of vintage champagne on ice in the compartment and plenty of caviar sandwiches the best caviar and keep away from me and no monkey business the photograph will be in the mails with a full report to be opened and acted upon if i dont show up in good health in new york tomorrow nod if you understand again the big head came slowly down and up again now there were traces of sweat on the high unlined forehead right now hand the cheque across to mr du pont and say i apologize humbly i have been cheating you then you can go bond watched the hand go across and drop the cheque in front of mr du pont the mouth opened and spoke the eyes were placid slow goldfinger had relaxed it was only money he had paid his way out just a moment goldfinger youre not through yet bond glanced up at the girl she was looking at him strangely there was misery and fear but also a look of submissiveness of longing whats your name jill masterton goldfinger had stood up was turning away bond said sharply stop goldfinger stopped in midstride now his eyes looked up at the balcony they had opened wide as when bond had first met him their hard level xray gaze seemed to find the lenses of the binoculars travel down them and through bonds eyes to the back of his skull they seemed to say i shall remember this mr bond bond said softly id forgotten one last thing i shall be taking a hostage for the ride to new york miss masterton see that shes at the train oh and make that compartment a drawingroom thats all chapter five night duty it was a week later bond stood at the open window of the seventhfloor office of the tall building in regents park that is the headquarters of the secret service london lay asleep under a full moon that rode swiftly over the town through a shoal of herringbone clouds big ben sounded three one of the telephones rang in the dark room bond turned and moved quickly to the central desk and the pool of light cast by the green shaded readinglamp he picked up the black telephone from the rank of four he said duty officer station h sir put them on there was the echoing buzz and twang of the usual bad radio connection with hongkong why were there always sunspots over china a singsong voice asked universal export yes a deep close voice london said youre through to hongkong speak up please bond said impatiently clear the line please the singsong voice said youre through now speak up please hullo hullo universal export yes dickson speaking can you hear me yes that cable i sent you about the shipment of mangoes fruit you know yes got it here bond pulled the file towards him he knew what it was about station h wanted some limpet mines to put paid to three communist spy junks that were using macao to intercept british freighters and search them for refugees from china must have payment by the tenth that would mean that the junks were leaving or else that the guards on the junks would be doubled after that date or some other emergency bond said briefly wilco thanks bye bye bond put down the receiver he picked up the green receiver and dialled q branch and talked to the section duty officer it would be all right there was a boac britannia leaving in the morning q branch would see that the crate caught the plane bond sat back he reached for a cigarette and lit it he thought of the badly airconditioned little office on the waterfront in hongkong saw the sweat marks on the white shirt of whom he knew well and who had just called himself dickson now would probably be talking to his number two its okay london says can do lets just go over this ops schedule again bond smiled wryly better they than he hed never liked being up against the chinese there were too many of them station h might be stirring up a hornets nest but m had decided it was time to show the opposition that the service in hongkong hadnt quite gone out of business when three days before m had first told him his name was down for night duty bond hadnt taken to the idea he had argued that he didnt know enough about the routine work of the stations that it was too responsible a job to give a man who had been in the doubleo section for six years and who had forgotten all he had ever known about station work youll soon pick it up m had said unsympathetically if you get in trouble there are the duty section officers or the chief of staff or me for the matter of that anyway ive decided i want all senior officers to do their spell of routine m had looked frostily across at bond matter of fact i had the treasury on to me the other day their liaison man thinks the doubleo section is redundant says that kind of thing is out of date i couldnt bother to argue ms voice was mild just told him he was mistaken however wont do any harm for you to have some extra duties now youre back in london keep you from getting stale and bond wasnt minding it he was half way through his first week and so far it had just been a question of common sense or passing routine problems on down to the sections he rather liked the peaceful room and knowing everybodys secrets and being occasionally fed coffee and sandwiches by one of the pretty girls from the canteen on the first night the girl had brought him tea bond had looked at her severely i dont drink tea i hate it its mud moreover its one of the main reasons for the downfall of the british empire be a good girl and make me some coffee the girl had giggled and scurried off to spread bonds dictum in the canteen from then on he had got his coffee the expression a cup of mud was seeping through the building a second reason why bond enjoyed the long vacuum of night duty was that it gave him time to get on with a project he had been toying with for more than a year a handbook of all secret methods of unarmed combat it was to be called stay alive it would contain the best of all that had been written on the subject by the secret services of the world bond had told no one of the project but he hoped that if he could finish it m would allow it to be added to the short list of service manuals which contained the tricks and techniques of secret intelligence bond had borrowed the original textbooks or where necessary translations from records most of the books had been captured from enemy agents or organizations somehad been presented to m by sister services such as oss cia and the deuxieme now bond drew towards him a particular prize a translation of the manual entitled simply defence issued to operatives of smersh the soviet organization of vengeance and death that night he was half way through chapter two whose title freely translated was comealong and restraint holds now he went back to the book and read for half an hour through the sections dealing with the conventional wrist comealong arm lock comealong forearm lock head hold and use of neck pressure points after half an hour bond thrust the typescript away from him he got up and went across to the window and stood looking out there was a nauseating toughness in the blunt prose the russians used it had brought on another of the attacks of revulsion to which bond had succumbed ten days before at miami airport what was wrong with him couldnt he take it any more was he going soft or was he only stale bond stood for a while watching the moon riding careering through the clouds then he shrugged his shoulders and went back to his desk he decided that he was as fed up with the variations of violent physical behaviour as a psychoanalyst must become with the mental aberrations of his patients bond read again the passage that had revolted him a drunken woman can also usually be handled by using the thumb and forefinger to grab the lower lip by pinching hard and twisting as the pull is made the woman will come along bond grunted the obscene delicacy of thatthumb and forefinger bond lit a cigarette and stared into the filament of the desk light switching his mind to other things wishing that a signal would come in or the telephone ring another five hours to go before the nine oclock report to the chief of staff or to m if m happened to come in early there was something nagging at his mind something he had wanted to check on when he had the time what was it what had triggered off the reminder yes that was it forefinger goldfinger he would see if records had anything on the man bond picked up the green telephone and dialled records doesnt ring a bell sir ill check and call you back bond put down the receiver it had been a wonderful trip up in the train they had eaten the sandwiches and drunk the champagne and then to the rhythm of the giant diesels pounding out the miles they had made long slow love in the narrow berth it had been as if the girl was starved of physical love she had woken him twice more in the night with soft demanding caresses saying nothing just reaching for his hard lean body the next day she had twice pulled down the roller blinds to shut out the hard light and had taken him by the hand and said love me james as if she was a child asking for a sweet even now bond could hear the quick silver poem of the levelcrossing bells the wail of the big windhorn out front and the quiet outside clamour at the stations when they lay and waited for the sensual gallop of the wheels to begin again jill masterton had said that goldfinger had been relaxed indifferent over his defeat he had told the girl to tell bond that he would be over in england in a weeks time and would like to have that game of golf at sandwich nothing else no threats no curses he had said he would expect the girl back by the next train jill had told bond she would go bond had argued with her but she was not frightened of goldfinger what could he do to her and it was a good job bond had decided to give her the ten thousand dollars mr du pont had shuffled into his hand with a stammer of thanks and congratulations bond made her take the money i dont want it bond had said wouldnt know what to do with it anyway keep it as mad money in case you want to get away in a hurry it ought to be a million i shall never forget last night and today bond had taken her to the station and had kissed her once hard on the lips and had gone away it hadnt been love but a quotation had come into bonds mind as his cab moved out of pennsylvania station some love is fire some love is rust but the finest cleanest love is lust neither had had regrets had they committed a sin if so which one a sin against chastity bond smiled to himself there was a quotation for that too and from a saint saint augustine oh lord give me chastity but dont give it yet the green telephone rang three goldfingers sir but two of them are dead the thirds a russian post office in geneva got a hairdressing business slips the messages into the righthand coat pocket when he brushes the customers down he lost a leg at stalingrad any good sir theres plenty more on him no thanks that couldnt be my man we could put a trace through cid records in the morning got a picture sir bond remembered the leica film he hadnt even bothered to have it developed it would be quicker to mock up the mans face on the identicast he said is the identicast room free yes sir and i can operate it for you if you like thanks ill come down bond told the switchboard to let heads of sections know where he would be and went out and took the lift down to records on the first floor the big building was extraordinarily quiet at night be neath the silence there was a soft whisper of machinery and hidden life the muffled clack of a typewriter as bond passed a door a quickly suppressed stammer of radio static as he passed another the soft background whine of the ventilation system it gave you the impression of being in a battleship in harbour the records duty officer was already at the controls of the identicast in the projection room he said to bond could you give me the main lines of the face sir thatll help me leave out the slides that are obviously no good bond did so and sat back and watched the lighted screen the identicast is a machine for building up an approximate picture of a suspect or of someone who has perhaps only been glimpsed in a street or a train or in a passing car it works on the magic lantern principle the operator flashes on the screen various headshapes and sizes when one is recognized it stays on the screen then various haircuts are shown and then all the other features follow and are chosen one by one different shapes of eyes noses chins mouths eyebrows cheeks ears in the end there is the whole picture of a face as near as the scanner can remember it and it is photographed and put on record it took some time to put together goldfingers extraordinary face but the final result was an approximate likeness in monochrome bond dictated one or two notes about the sunburn the colour of the hair and the expression of the eyes and the job was done wouldnt like to meet that on a dark night commented the man from records ill put it through to cid when they come on duty you should get the answer by lunch time bond went back to the seventh floor on the other side of the world it was around midnight eastern stations were closing down there was a flurry of signals that had to be dealt with the nights log to be written up and then it was eight oclock bond telephoned the canteen for his breakfast he had just finished it when there came the harsh purr of the red telephone m why the hell had he got in half an hour early yes sir come up to my office i want to have a word before you go off duty sir bond put the telephone back he slipped on his coat and ran a hand through his hair told the switchboard where he would be took the night log and went up in the lift to the eighth and top floor neither the desirable miss moneypenny nor the chief of staff was on duty bond knocked on ms door and went in sit down m was going through the pipelighting routine he looked pink and well scrubbed the lined sailors face above the stiff white collar and loosely tied spotted bow tie was damnably brisk and cheerful bond was conscious of the black stubble on his own chin and of the allnight look of his skin and clothes he sharpened his mind quiet night m had got his pipe going his hard healthy eyes regarded bond attentively pretty quiet sir station h m raised his left hand an inch or two never mind ill read all about it in the log here ill take it bond handed over the top secret folder m put it to one side he smiled one of his rare rather sardonic bittenoff smiles things change im taking you off night duty for the present bonds answering smile was taut he felt the quickening of the pulse he had so often experienced in this room m had got something for him he said i was just getting into it sir quite have plenty of opportunity later on somethings come up odd business not really your line of country except for one particular angle which m jerked his pipe sideways in a throwaway gesture may not be an angle at all bond sat back he said nothing waiting had dinner with the governor of the bank last night ones always hearing something new at least all this was new to me gold the seamy side of the stuff smuggling counterfeiting all that hadnt occurred to me that the bank of england knew so much about crooks suppose its part of the banks job to protect our currency m jerked his eyebrows up know anything about gold no sir well you will by this afternoon youve got an appointment with a man called colonel smithers at the bank at four oclock that give you enough time to get some sleep yes sir good seems that this man smithers is head of the banks research department from what the governor told me thats nothing more or less than a spy system first time i knew they had one just shows what watertight compartments we all work in anyway smithers and his chaps keep an eye out for anything fishy in the banking world particularly any monkeying about with our currency and bullion reserves and what not there was that business the other day of the italians who were counterfeiting sovereigns making them out of real gold right carats and all that but apparently a sovereign or a french napoleon is worth much more than its melteddown value in gold dont ask me why smithers can tell you that if youre interested anyway the bank went after these people with a whole battery of lawyersit wasnt technically a criminal offence and after losing in the italian courts they finally nailed them in switzerland you probably read about it then there was that business of dollar balances in beirut made quite a stir in the papers couldnt understand it myself some crack in the fence we put round our currency the wide city boys had found it well its smitherss job to smell out that kind of racket the reason the governor told me all this is because for years almost since the war apparently smithers has had a bee in his bonnet about some big gold leak out of england mostly deduction plus some kind of instinct smithers admits hes got damned little to go on but hes impressed the governor enough for him to get permission from the pm to call us in m broke off he looked quizzically at bond ever wondered who are the richest men in england no sir well have a guess or rather put it like this who are the richest englishmen bond searched his mind there were a lot of men who sounded rich or who were made to sound rich by the newspapers but who really had it liquid in the bank he had to say something he said hesitatingly well sir theres sassoon then that shipping man who keeps to himself er ellerman they say lord cowdray is very rich there are the bankers rothschilds barings hambros there was williamson the diamond man oppenheimer in south africa some of the dukes may still have a lot of money bonds voice trailed away not bad not bad at all but youve missed out the joker in the pack man id never thought of until the governor brought up his name hes the richest of the lot man called goldfinger auric goldfinger bond couldnt help himself he laughed sharply whats the matter ms voice was testy what the hell is there to laugh about im sorry sir bond got hold of himself the truth is only last night i was building his face up on the identicast he glanced at his watch in a strangled voice he said be on its way to cid records asked for a trace on him m was getting angry what the hells all this about stop behaving like a bloody schoolboy bond said soberly well sir its like this bond told the story leaving nothing out ms face cleared he listened with all his attention leaning forward across the desk when bond had finished m sat back in his chair he said well well well on a diminishing scale he put his hands behind his head and gazed for minutes at the ceiling bond could feel the laughter coming on again how would the cid word the resounding snub he would get in the course of the day he was brought sharply back to earth by ms next words by the way what happened to that ten thousand dollars gave it to the girl sir really why not to the white cross the white cross fund was for the families of secret service men and women who were killed on duty sorry sir bond was not prepared to argue that one humpf m had never approved of bonds womanizing it was anathema to his victorian soul he decided to let it pass he said well thats all for now youll be hearing all about it this afternoon funny about goldfinger odd chap seen him once or twice at blades he plays bridge there when hes in england hes the chap the bank of englands after m paused he looked mildly across the table at bond as from this moment so are you chapter six talk of gold bond walked up the steps and through the fine bronze portals and into the spacious softly echoing entrance hall of the bank of england and looked around him under his feet glittered the brilliant golden patterns of the boris anrep mosaics beyond through twentyfeethigh arched windows green grass and geraniums blazed in the central courtyard to right and left were spacious vistas of polished hopton wood stone over all hung the neutral smell of airconditioned air and the heavy grave atmosphere of immense riches one of the athleticlooking pink frockcoated commissionaires came up to him yes sir colonel smithers commander bond sir this way please the commissionaire moved off to the right between the pillars the bronze doors of a discreetly hidden lift stood open the lift rose a few feet to the first floor now there was a long panelled corridor ending in a tall adam window the floor was closecarpeted in beige wilton the commissionaire knocked at the last of several finely carved oak doors that were just so much taller and more elegant than ordinary doors a greyhaired woman was sitting at a desk she looked as if she had once taken a double first the walls of the room were lined with grey metal filing cabinets the woman had been writing on a quarto pad of yellow memorandum paper she smiled with a hint of conspiracy picked up a telephone and dialled a number commander bond is here she put the telephone back and stood up will you come this way she crossed the room to a door covered with green baize and held it open for bond to go through colonel smithers had risen from his desk he said gravely nice of you to have come wont you sit down bond took the chair smoke colonel smithers pushed forward a silver box of senior service and himself sat down and began to fill a pipe bond took a cigarette and lit it colonel smithers looked exactly like someone who would be called colonel smithers he had obviously been a colonel probably on the staff and he had the smooth polished basically serious mien that fitted his name but for his hornrimmed glasses he might have been an efficient not very wellfed courtier in a royal household bond felt boredom gathering in the corners of the room he said encouragingly it seems that you are to tell me all about gold so i understand i had a note from the governor i gather i need keep nothing from you of course you understand colonel smithers looked over bonds right shoulder that most of what i shall have to say will be confidential the eyes swept quickly across bonds face bonds face was stony colonel smithers felt the silence that bond had intended he should feel he looked up saw that he had put his foot in it and tried to make amends obviously i neednt have mentioned the point a man with your training bond said we all think our own secrets are the only ones that matter youre probably right to remind me other peoples secrets are never quite as important as ones own but you neednt worry i shall discuss things with my chief but with no one else quite quite nice of you to take it that way in the bank one gets into the habit of being overdiscreet now then colonel smithers scurried for cover into his subject this business of gold i take it its not a matter youve thought about a great deal i know it when i see it aha yes well now the great thing to remember about gold is that its the most valuable and most easily marketable commodity in the world you can go to any town in the world almost to any village and hand over a piece of gold and get goods or services in exchange right colonel smitherss voice had taken on a new briskness his eyes were alight he had his lecture pat bond sat back he was prepared to listen to anyone who was master of his subject any subject and the next thing to remember colonel smithers held up his pipe in warning is that gold is virtually untraceable sovereigns have no serial numbers if gold bars have mint marks stamped on them the marks can be shaved off or the bar can be melted down and made into a new bar that makes it almost impossible to check on the whereabouts of gold or its origins or its movements round the world in england for instance we at the bank can only count the gold in our own vaultsin the vaults of other banks and at the mint and make a rough guess at the amounts held by the jewellery trade and the pawnbroking fraternity why are you so anxious to know how much gold there is in england because gold and currencies backed by gold are the foundation of our international credit we can only tell what the true strength of the pound is and other countries can only tell it by knowing the amount of valuta we have behind our currency and my main job mr bond colonel smitherss bland eyes had become unexpectedly sharp is to watch for any leakage of gold out of england out of anywhere in the sterling area and when i spot a leakage an escape of gold towards some country where it can be exchanged more profitably than at our official buying price it is my job to put the cid gold squad on to the fugitive gold and try to get it back into our vaults plug the leak and arrest the people responsible and the trouble is mr bond colonel smithers gave a forlorn shrug of the shoulders that gold attracts the biggest the most ingenious criminals they are very hard very hard indeed to catch isnt all this only a temporary phase why should this shortage of gold go on they seem to be digging it out of africa fast enough isnt there enough to go round isnt it just like any other black market that disappears when the supplies are stepped up like the penicillin traffic after the war im afraid not mr bond it isnt quite as easy as that the population of the world is increasing at the rate of five thousand four hundred every hour of the day a small percentage of those people become gold hoarders people who are frightened of currencies who like to bury some sovereigns in the garden or under the bed another percentage needs gold fillings for their teeth others need goldrimmed spectacles jewellery engagement rings all these new people will be taking tons of gold off the market every year new industries need gold wire gold plating amalgams of gold gold has extraordinary properties which are being put to new uses every day it is brilliant malleable ductile almost unalterable and more dense than any of the common metals except platinum theres no end to its uses but it has two defects it isnt hard enough it wears out quickly leaves itself on the linings of our pockets and in the sweat of our skins every year the worlds stock is invisibly reduced by friction i said that gold has two defects colonel smithers looked sad the other and by far the major defect is that it is the talisman of fear fear mr bond takes gold out of circulation and hoards it against the evil day in a period of history when every tomorrow may be the evil day it is fair enough to say that a fat proportion of the gold that is dug out of one corner of the earth is at once buried again in another corner bond smiled at colonel smitherss eloquence this man lived gold thought gold dreamed gold well it was an interesting subject he might just as well wallow in the stuff in the days when bond had been after the diamond smugglers he had had first to educate himself in the fascination the myth of the stones he said what else ought i to know before we get down to your immediate problem youre not bored well you were suggesting that gold production was so vast nowadays that it ought to take care of all these various consumers unfortunately that is not so in fact the gold content of the world is being worked out you may think that large areas of the world have still to be explored for gold you would be mistaken broadly speaking there only remains the land under the sea and the sea itself which has a notable gold content people have been scratching the surface of the world for gold for thousands of years there were the great gold treasures of egypt and mycenae montezuma and the incas croesus and midas emptied the middle eastern territories of gold europe was worked for it the valleys of the rhine and the po malaga and the plains of granada cyprus was emptied and the balkans india got the fever ants coming up from under the earth carrying grains of gold led the indians to their alluvial fields the romans worked wales and devon and cornwall in the middle ages there were the finds in mexico and peru these were followed by the opening up of the gold coast then called negroland and after that came the americas the famous gold rushes of the yukon and eldorado and the rich strikes at eureka sounded off the first modern gold age meanwhile in australia bendigo and ballarat had come into production and the russian deposits at lena and in the urals were making russia the largest gold producer in the world in the middle of die nineteenth century then came the second modern gold age the discoveries on the witwatersrand these were helped by the new method of cyaniding instead of separation of the gold from the rock by mercury today we are in the third gold age with the opening up of the orange free state deposits colonel smithers threw up his hands now gold is pouring out of the earth why the whole production of the klondike and the homestake and eldorado which were once the wonder of the world would only add up to two or three years of todays production from africa just to show you from to when approximate figures were kept the whole world produced about eighteen thousand tons of gold from to today we have dug up fortyone thousand tons at this rate mr bond colonel smithers leaned forward earnestly and please dont quote me but i wouldnt be surprised if in fifty years time we have not totally exhausted the gold content of the earth bond smothered by this cataract of gold history found no difficulty in looking as grave as colonel smithers he said you certainly make a fascinating story of it perhaps the position isnt as bad as you think theyre already mining oil under the sea perhaps theyll find a way of mining gold now about this smuggling the telephone rang colonel smithers impatiently snatched up the receiver smithers speaking he listened irritation growing on his face im sure i sent you a note about the summer fixtures miss philby the next match is on saturday against the discount houses he listened again well if mrs flake wont play goals im afraid shell have to stand down its the only position on the field weve got for her everybody cant play centre forward yes please do say ill be greatly obliged if just this once im sure shell be very good right figure and all that thank you miss philby colonel smithers took out a handkerchief and mopped his forehead sorry about that sports and welfare are becoming almost too much of a fetish at the bank ive just had the womens hockey team thrown into my lap as if i hadnt got enough to do with the annual gymkhana coming on how ever colonel smithers waved these minor irritations aside as you say time to get on to the smuggling well to begin with and taking only england and the sterling area its a very big business indeed we employ three thousand staff at the bank mr bond and of those no less than one thousand work in the exchange control department of those at least five hundred including my little outfit are engaged in controlling the illicit movements of valuta the attempts to smuggle or to evade the exchange control regulations thats a lot bond measured it against the secret service which had a total force of two thousand can you give me an example of smuggling in gold i cant understand these dollar swindles all right colonel smithers now talked in the soft tired voice of an overworked man in the service of his government it was the voice of the specialist in a particular line of law enforcement it said that he knew most things connected with that line and that he could make a good guess at all the rest bond knew the voice well the voice of the firstclass civil servant despite his prosiness bond was beginning to take to colonel smithers all right supposing you have a bar of gold in your pocket about the size of a couple of packets of players weight about five and a quarter pounds never mind for the moment where you got it from stole it or inherited it or something thatll be twentyfour carat what we call a thousand fine now the law says you have to sell that to the bank of england at the controlled price of twelve pounds ten per ounce that would make it worth around the thousand pounds but youre greedy youve got a friend going to india or perhaps youre on good terms with an airline pilot or a steward on the far east run all you have to do is cut your bar into thin sheets or platesyoud soon find someone to do this for you and sew the plates theyd be smaller than playing cards into a cotton belt and pay your friend a commission to wear it you could easily afford a hundred pounds for the job your friend flies off to bombay and goes to the first bullion dealer in the bazaar he will be given one thousand seven hundred pounds for your fivepound bar and youre a richer man than you might have been mark you colonel smithers waved his pipe airilythats only seventy per cent profit just after the war you could have got three hundred per cent if youd done only half a dozen little operations like that every year youd be able to retire by now why the high price in india bond didnt really want to know he thought m might ask him its a long story briefly india is shorter of gold particularly for her jewellery trade than any other country whats the size of this traffic huge to give an idea the indian intelligence bureau and their customs captured fortythree thousand ounces in doubt if thats one per cent of the traffic golds been coming into india from all points of the compass latest dodge is to fly it in from macao and drop it by parachute to a reception committee a ton at a time like we used to drop supplies to the resistance during the war i see is there anywhere else i can get a good premium for my gold bar you could get a small premium in most countries switzerland for instancebut it wouldnt be worth your while indias still the place all right said bond think ive got the picture now whats your particular problem he sat back and lit a cigarette he was greatly looking forward to hearing about mr auric goldfinger colonel smitherss eyes took on their hard foxy look he said theres a man who came over to england in he was a refugee from riga name of auric goldfinger he was only twenty when he arrived but he must have been a bright lad because he smelled that the russians would be swallowing his country pretty soon he was a jeweller and goldsmith by trade like his father and grandfather who had refined gold for faberge he had a little money and probably one of those belts of gold i was telling you about stole it from his father i daresay well soon after hed been naturalized he was a harmless sort of chap and in a useful trade and he had no difficulty in getting his papers he started buying up small pawnbrokers all over the country he put in his own men paid them well and changed the name of the shops to goldfinger then he turned the shops over to selling cheap jewellery and buying old gold you know the sort of place best prices for old gold nothing too large nothing too small and he had his own particular slogan buy her engagement ring with grannies locket goldfinger did very well always chose good sites just on the dividing line between the welltodo streets and the lowermiddle never touched stolen goods and got a good name everywhere with the police he lived in london and toured his shops once a month and collected all the old gold he wasnt interested in the jewellery side he let his managers run that as they liked colonel smithers looked quizzically at bond you may think these lockets and gold crosses and things are pretty small beer so they are but they mount up if youve got twenty little shops each one buying perhaps half a dozen bits and pieces every week well the war came and goldfinger like all other jewellers had to declare his stock of gold i looked up his figure in our old records it was fifty ounces for the whole chain just enough of a working stock to keep his shops supplied with ring setting and so forth what they call jewellers findings in the trade of course he was allowed to keep it he tucked himself away in a machinetool firm in wales during the war well out of the firing line but kept as many of his shops operating as he could must have done well out of the gis who generally travel with a gold eagle or a mexican fiftydollar piece as a last reserve then when peace broke out goldfinger got moving he bought himself a house pretentious sort of place at reculver at the mouth of the thames he also invested in a wellfound brixham trawler and an old silver ghost rolls royce armoured car built for some south american president who was killed before he could take delivery he set up a little factory called thanet alloy research in the grounds of his house and staffed it with a german metallurgist a prisoner of war who didnt want to go back to germany and half a dozen korean stevedores he picked up in liverpool they didnt know a word of any civilized language so they werent any security risk then for ten years all we know is that he made one trip a year to india in his trawler and a few trips in his car every year to switzerland set up a subsidiary of his alloy company near geneva he kept his shops going gave up collecting the old gold himself used one of his koreans whom he had taught to drive a car all right perhaps mr goldfinger is not a very honest man but he behaves himself and keeps in well with the police and with much more blatant fiddling going on all over the country nobody paid him any attention colonel smithers broke off he looked apologetically at bond im not boring you i do want you to get the picture of the sort of man this is quiet careful lawabiding and with the sort of drive and singlemindedness we all admire we didnt even hear of him until he suffered a slight misfortune in the summer of his trawler homeward bound from india went ashore on the goodwins and he sold the wreck for a song to the dover salvage company when this company started breaking the ship up and got as far as the hold they found the timbers ingregnated with a sort of brown powder which they couldnt put a name to they sent a specimen to a local chemist they were surprised when he said the stuff was gold i wont bother you with the formula but you see gold can be made to dissolve in a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids and reducing agents sulphur dioxide or oxalic acid precipitate the metal as a brown powder this powder can be reconstituted into gold ingots by melting at around a thousand degrees centigrade have to watch the chlorine gas but otherwise its a simple process the usual nosey parker in the salvage firm gossiped to one of the dover customs men and in due course a report filtered up through the police and the cid to me together with a copy of the cargo clearance papers for each of goldfingers trips to india these gave all the cargoes as mineral dust base for crop fertilizers all perfectly credible because these modern fertilizers do use traces of various minerals in their makeup the whole picture was clear as crystal goldfinger had been refining down his old gold precipitating it into this brown powder and shipping it to india as fertilizer but could we pin it on him we could not had a quiet look at his bank balance and tax returns twenty thousand pounds at barclays in ramsgate income tax and super tax paid promptly each year figures showed the natural progress of a wellrun jewellery business we dressed a couple of the gold squad up and sent them down to knock on the door of mr goldfingers factory at reculver sorry sir routine inspection for the small engineering section of the ministry of labour we have to make sure the factory acts are being observed for safety and health come in come in mr goldfinger positively welcomed them mark you he may have been tipped off by his bank manager or someone but that factory was entirely devoted to designing a cheap alloy for jewellers findings trying out unusual metals like aluminium and tin instead of the usual copper and nickel and palladium that are used in gold alloys there were traces of gold about of course and furnaces to heat up to two thousand degrees and so forth but after all goldfinger was a jeweller and a smelter in a small way and all this was perfectly aboveboard the gold squad retired discomfited our legal department decided the brown dust in the trawlers timbers was not enough to prosecute on without supporting evidence and that was more or less that except colonel smithers slowly wagged the stem of his pipe that i kept the file open and started sniffing around the banks of the world colonel smithers paused the rumble of the city came through the halfopen window high up in the wall behind his chair bond glanced surreptitiously at his watch five oclock colonel smithers got up from his chair he placed both hands palm downwards on the desk and leant forward it took me five years mr bond to find out that mr goldfinger in ready money is the richest man in england in zurich in nassau in panama in new york he has twenty million pounds worth of gold bars on safe deposit and those bars mr bond are not mint bars they dont carry any official marks of origin whatsoever theyre bars that mr goldfinger has melted himself i flew to nassau and had a look at the five million pounds worth or so he holds there in the vaults of the royal bank of canada oddly enough like all artists he couldnt refrain from signing his handiwork it needs a microscope to see it but somewhere on each goldfinger bar a minute letter z has been scratched in the metal and that gold or most of it belongs to england the bank can do nothing about it so we are asking you to bring mr goldfinger to book mr bond and get that gold back you know about the currency crisis and the high bank rate of course well england needs that gold badly and the quicker the better chapter seven thoughts in a db iii bond followed colonel smithers to the lift while they waited for it bond glanced out of the tall window at the end of the passage he was looking down into the deep well of the back courtyard of the bank a trim chocolatebrown lorry with no owners name had come into the courtyard through the triple steel gates square cardboard boxes were being unloaded from it and put on to a short conveyor belt that disappeared into the bowels of the bank colonel smithers came over fivers he commented just come up from our printing works at loughton the lift came and they got in bond said im not very impressed by the new ones they look like any other countrys money the old ones were the most beautiful money in the world they walked across the entrance hall now dimly lit and deserted colonel smithers said as a matter of fact i agree with you trouble was that those reichsbank forgeries during the war were a darn sight too good when the russians captured berlin among the loot they got hold of the plates we asked the narodni bank for them but they refused to give them up we and the treasury decided it was just too dangerous at any moment if moscow had been inclined they could have started a major raid on our currency we had to withdraw the old fivers the new ones arent much to look at but at least theyd be hell to forge the night guard let them out on to the steps threadneedle street was almost deserted the long city night was beginning bond said goodbye to colonel smithers and walked along to the tube he had never thought very much about the bank of england but now that he had been inside the place he decided that the old lady of threadneedle street might be old but she still had some teeth left in her head bond had been told to report back to m at six he did so ms face was no longer pink and shining the long day had knocked it about stressed it shrunken it when bond went in and took the chair across the desk he noticed the conscious effort m made to clear his mind cope with the new problem the day was to fling at him m straightened himself in his chair and reached for his pipe well bond knew the false belligerence of that particular bark he told the gist of the story in less than five minutes when he had finished m said thoughtfully suppose weve got to take it on dont understand a thing about the pound and bank rate and all that but everyone seems to be taking it damned seriously personally i should have thought the strength of the pound depended on how hard we all worked rather than how much gold wed got germans didnt have much gold after the war look where theyve got in ten years however thats probably too easy an answer for the politicians or more likely too difficult got any ideas how to tackle this chap goldfinger any way of getting closer to him offering to do some dirty work for him or something like that bond said thoughtfully i wouldnt get anywhere sucking up to him asking him for a job or something of that sort sir i should say hes the sort of man who only respects people who are tougher or smarter than he is ive given him one beating and the only message i got from him was that hed like me to play golf with him perhaps id better do just that fine way for one of my top men to spend his time the sarcasm in ads voice was weary resigned all right go ahead but if what you say is right youd better see that you beat him whats your cover story bond shrugged i hadnt thought sir perhaps id better be thinking of leaving universal export no future in it having a holiday while i look round thinking of emigrating to canada fed up here something like that but perhaps id better play it the way the cards fall i wouldnt think hes an easy man to fool all right report progress and dont think im not interested in this case ms voice had changed so had his expression his eyes had become urgent commanding now ill give you one piece of information the bank didnt give you it just happens that i also know what mr goldfingers gold bars look like as a matter of fact i was handling one today scratched z and all it had come in with that haul we made last week when the redland resident directors office caught fire in tangier youll have seen the signals well thats the twentieth of these particular gold bars that have come our way since die war bond interrupted but that tangier bar was out of the smersh safe exactly ive checked all the other nineteen bars with the scratched z have been taken from smersh operatives m paused he said mildly dyou know i wouldnt be at all surprised if goldfinger doesnt turn out to be the foreign banker the treasurer so to speak of smersh james bond flung the dbiii through the last mile of straight and did a racing change down into third and then into second for the short hill before the inevitable traffic crawl through rochester leashed in by the velvet claw of the front discs the engine muttered its protest with a mild backpopple from the twin exhausts bond went up into third again beat the lights at the bottom of the hill and slid resignedly up to the back of the queue that would crawl on for a quarter of an hour if he was lucky through the sprawl of rochester and chatham bond settled back into second and let the car idle he reached for the wide gunmetal case of morland cigarettes on the neighbouring bucket seat fumbled for one and lit it from the dashboard he had chosen the a in preference to the a to sandwich because he wanted to take a quick look at goldfingerland reculver and those melancholy forsaken reaches of the thames which goldfinger had chosen for his parish he would then cross the isle of thanet to ramsgate and leave his bag at the channel packet have an early lunch and be off to sandwich the car was from the pool bond had been offered the aston martin or a jaguar he had taken the dbiii either of the cars would have suited his cover a welltodo rather adventurous young man with a taste for the good the fast things of life but the db iii had the advantage of an uptodate triptyque an inconspicuous colour battleship grey and certain extras which might or might not come in handy these included switches to alter the type and colour of bonds front and rear lights if he was following or being followed at night reinforced steel bumpers fore and aft in case he needed to ram a longbarrelled colt in a trick compartment under the drivers seat a radio pickup tuned to receive an apparatus called the homer and plenty of concealed space that would fox most customs men bond saw a chance and picked up fifty yards sliding into a tenyard gap left by a family saloon of slow reactions the man at the wheel who wore that infallible badge of the bad driver a hat clamped firmly on the exact centre of his head hooted angrily bond reached out of the window and raised an enigmatically clenched fist the hooting stopped and now what about this theory of ms it made sense the russians were notoriously incompetent payers of their men their centres were always running out of funds their men complaining to moscow that they couldnt afford a square meal perhaps smersh couldnt get the valuta out of the ministry of home security or perhaps the ministry of home security couldnt get the money out of the ministry of finance but it had always been the same endless money troubles that resulted in missed chances broken promises and waste of dangerous radio time it would make sense to have a clever financial brain somewhere outside russia who could not only transmit funds to the centres but also in this case make profits large enough to run the smersh centres abroad without any financial assistance from moscow not only that on the side goldfinger was appreciably damaging the currency base of an enemy country if all this was correct it was typical of smersh a brilliant scheme faultlessly operated by an outstanding man and that reflected bond as he roared up the hill into chatham putting half a dozen cars behind him would partly explain goldfingers greed for more and still more money devotion to the cause to smersh and perhaps the dangled prize of an order of lenin would be the spur to pick up even ten or twenty thousand dollars when the odds were right or could be favourably adjusted the funds for red revolution for the discipline by fear that was the particular speciality of smersh could never be big enough goldfinger was not making the money for himself he was making it for the conquest of the world the minor risk of being found out as he had been by bond was nothing why what could the bank of england get him if every single one of his past operations could be exposed two years three the traffic was thinning through the outskirts of gillingham bond started motoring again but easily now not hurrying following his thoughts as the hands and feet went through their automatic responses so inthirtyseven smersh must have sent goldfinger out with the belt of gold round his young waist he had shown his special aptitudes his acquisitive bent during his training in the spy school in leningrad he would have been told there would be a war that he must dig himself in and start quietly accumulating goldfinger must never dirty his hands never meet an agent never receive or pass a message some routine would have been arranged secondhand vauxhall first offer of ј secures immaculate rover ј bentley ј always an advertisement that would not attract attention or correspondence the prices would be just too high the description inadequate in the agony column of the times perhaps and obediently goldfinger would leave the two thousand pounds or the five thousand pounds gold bar at one of a long a very long series of postboxes that had been arranged in moscow before he left a particular bridge a hollow tree under a rock in a stream somewhere anywhere in england and he would never on any account visit that postbox again it was up to moscow to see that the agent got to the hidden treasure later after the war when goldfinger was blossoming out when he had become a big man the postboxes would no longer be bridges and trees now he would be given dates and safety deposit box numbers leftluggage lockers at stations but still there would be the rule that goldfinger must never revisit the scene never endanger himself perhaps he would only get his instructions once a year at a casual meeting in some park in a letter slipped into his pocket on a train journey but always it would be bars of gold anonymous untraceable if captured except for the tiny z that his vanity had scratched on his handiwork and that a dull dog at the bank of england called colonel smithers had happened upon in the course of his duties now bond was running through the endless orchards of the faversham growers the sun had come out from behind the smog of london there was the distant gleam of the thames on his left there was traffic on the river long glistening tankers stubby merchantmen antediluvian dutch schuyts bond left the canterbury road and switched on to the incongruously rich highway that runs through the cheap bungaloid world of the holiday lands whitstable herne bay birchington margate he still idled along at fifty holding the racing wheel on a light rein listening to the relaxed purr of the exhausts fitting the bits of his thoughts info the jigsaw as he had done two nights before with goldfingers face on the identicast and bond reflected while goldfinger was pumping a million two million pounds a year into the bloody maw of smersh he was pyramiding his reserves working on them making them work for him whenever the odds were right piling up the surplus for the day when the trumpets would sound in the kremlin and every golden sinew would be mobilized and no one outside moscow had been watching the process no one suspected that goldfinger the jeweller the metallurgist the resident of reculver and nassau the respected member of blades of the royal st marks at sandwich was one of the greatest conspirators of all time that he had financed the murder of hundreds perhaps thousands of victims of smersh all over the world smersh smiert spionam death to spies the murder apparat of the high praesidium and only m suspected it only bond knew it and here was bond launched against this man by a series of flukes a train of coincidence that had been started by a plane breaking down on the other side of the world bond smiled grimly to himself how often in his profession had it been the same the tiny acorn of coincidence that soared into the mighty oak whose branches darkened the sky and now once again he was setting out to bring the dreadful growth down with what a bag of golf clubs a repainted skyblue ford popular with large yellow ears was scurrying along the crown of the road ahead mechanically bond gave the horn ring a couple of short polite jabs there was no reaction the ford popular was doing its forty why should anyone want to go more than that respectable speed the ford obstinately hunched its shoulders and kept on its course bond gave it a sharp blast expecting it to swerve he had to touch his brakes when it didnt damn the man of course the usual tense figure hands held too high up on the wheel and the inevitable hat this time a particularly hideous black bowler square on a large bullet head oh well thought bond they werent his stomach ulcers he changed down and contemptuously slammed the db iii past on the inside silly bastard another five miles and bond was through the dainty teleworld of herne bay the howl of mansion sounded away on his right a flight of three super sabres came in to land they skimmed below his righthand horizon as if they were diving into the earth with half his mind bond heard the roar of their jets catch up with them as they landed and taxied in to the hangars he came up with a crossroads to the left the signpost said reculver underneath was the ancient monument sign for reculver church bond slowed but didnt stop no hanging about he motored slowly on keeping his eyes open the shoreline was too exposed for a trawler to do anything but beach or anchor probably goldfinger had used ramsgate quiet little port customs and police who were probably only on the lookout for brandy coming over from france there was a thick clump of trees between the road and the shore a glimpse of roofs and of a mediumsized factory chimney with a thin plume of light smoke or steam that would be it soon there was the gate of a long drive a discreetly authoritative sign said thanet alloys and underneath no admittance except on business all very respectable bond drove slowly on there was nothing more to be seen he took the next righthand turn across the manston plateau to ramsgate it was twelve oclock bond inspected his room a double with bathroom on the top floor of the channel packet unpacked his few belongings and went down to the snack bar where he had one vodka and tonic and two rounds of excellent ham sandwiches with plenty of mustard then he got back into his car and drove slowly over to the royal st marks at sandwich bond carried his clubs to the professionals shop and through to the workroom alfred blacking was winding a new grip on to a driver hullo alfred the professional looked up sharply his sunburned leathery face broke into a wide smile why if it isnt mr james they shook hands must be fifteen twenty years what brings you down here sir someone was telling me only the other day that youre in the diplomatic or something always abroad well i never still the same flat swing sir alfred blacking joined his hands and gave a low flat sweep afraid so alfred never had time to get myself out of it hows mrs blacking and cecil cant complain sir cecil was runnerup in the kent championship last year should win it this year if he can only get out of the shop and on to the course a bit more bond propped his clubs up against the wall it was good to be back everything was just the same there had been a time in his teens when he had played two rounds a day every day of the week at st marks blacking had always wanted to take him in hand a bit of practice mr james and youd be scratch no fooling you really would what do you want to hang around at six for its all there except for that flat swing and wanting to hit the ball out of sight when theres no point in it and youve got the temperament a couple of years perhaps only one and id have you in the amateur but something had told bond that there wasnt going to be a great deal of golf in his life and if he liked the game hed better forget about lessons and just play as much of it as he could yes it would be about twenty years since he had played his last round on st marks hed never been back even when there had been that bloody affair of the moonraker at kingsdown ten miles down the coast perhaps it had been sentimentality since st marks bond had got in a good deal of weekend golf when he was at headquarters but always on the courses round london huntercombe swinley sunningdale the berkshire bonds handicap had gone up to nine but he was a real nine had to be with the games he chose to play the tenpound nassaus with the tough cheery men who were always so anxious to stand you a couple of double kьmmels after lunch any chance of a game alfred the professional glanced through his back window at the parking space round the tall flagpole he shook his head doesnt look too good sir dont get many players in the middle of the week at this time of year what about you sorry sir im booked playing with a member its a regular thing every day at two oclock and the trouble is that cecils gone over to princes to get in some practice for the championship what a dashed nuisance it would happen like that how long are you staying sir not long never mind ill knock a ball round with a caddie whos this chap youre playing with a mr goldfinger sir alfred looked discouraging oh goldfinger i know the chap met him the other day in america you did sir alfred obviously found it difficult to believe that anyone knew mr goldfinger he watched bonds face carefully for any further reaction any good soso sir pretty useful off nine must take his game damned seriously if he plays with you every day well yes sir the professionals face had the expression bond remembered so well it meant that blacking had an unfavourable view of a particular member but that he was too good a servant of the club to pass it on bond smiled he said you havent changed alfred what you mean is that no one else will play widi him remember farquharson slowest player in england i remember you going round and round with him twenty years ago come on whats the matter with goldfinger the professional laughed he said its you that hasnt changed mr james you always were dashed inquisitive he came a step closer and lowered his voice the truth is sir some members think mr goldfinger is just a little bit hot you know sir improves his lie and so forth the professional took the driver he was holding took up a stance gazed towards an imaginary hole and banged the head of the club up and down on the floor as if addressing an imaginary ball let me see now is this a brassie lie what dyou think caddie alfred blacking chuckled well of course by the time hes finished hammering the ground behind the ball the balls been raised an inch and it is a brassie lie alfred blackings face closed up again he said noncommittally but thats only gossip sir ive never seen anything quietspoken gentleman hes got a place at reculver used to come here a lot but for the last few years hes only been coming to england for a few weeks at a time rings up and asks if anyones wanting a game and when there isnt anyone he books cecil or me rang up this morning and asked if there was anyone about theres sometimes a stranger drops in alfred blacking looked quizzically at bond i suppose you wouldnt care to take him on this afternoon itll look odd you being here and short of a game and you knowing him and all he might think id been trying to keep him to myself or something that wouldnt do nonsense alfred and youve got your living to make why dont we play a threeball he wont play them sir says theyre too slow and i agree with him and dont you worry about my fee theres a lot of work to do in the shop and u be glad of an afternoon to get down to it alfred blacking glanced at his watch hell be along any minute now ive got a caddie for you remember hawker alfred blacking laughed indulgently still the same old hawker hell be another thatll be glad to see you down here again bond said well thanks alfred id be interested to see how this chap plays but why not leave it like this say ive dropped in to get a dub made up old member used to play here before the war and i need a new number four wood anyway your old one has started to give at the seams a bit just be casual dont say youve told me hes about ill stay in the shop so itll give him a chance to take his choice without offending me perhaps he wont like my face or something right very good mr james leave it to me thats his car coming now sir blacking pointed through the window half a mile away a bright yellow car was turning off the road and coming up the private drive funny looking contraption sort of motor car we used to see here when i was a boy bond watched the old silver ghost sweep majestically up the drive towards the club she was a beauty the sun glittered off the silver radiator and off the engineturned aluminium shield below the high perpendicular glass cliff of the windscreen the luggage rail on the roof of the heavy coachbuilt limousine body so ugly twenty years ago so strangely beautiful today was polished brass as were the two lucas king of the road headlamps that stared so haughtily down the road ahead and the wide mouth of the old boaconstrictor bulb horn the whole car except for a black roof and black carrosserie lines and curved panels below the windows was primrose yellow it crossed bonds mind that the south american president might have had it copied from the famous yellow fleet in which lord lonsdale had driven to the derby and ascot and now in the drivers seat sat a figure in a cafeaulait dust coat and cap his big round face obscured by blackrimmed driving goggles beside him was a squat figure in black with a bowler hat placed firmly on the middle of his head the two figures stared straight in front of them with a curious immobility it was almost as if they were driving a hearse the car was coming closer the six pairs of eyes the eyes of the two men and the great twin orbs of the car seemed to be looking straight through the little window and into bonds eyes instinctively bond took a few paces back into the dark recesses of the workroom he noticed the movement and smiled to himself he picked up somebodys putter and bent down and thoughtfully addressed a knot in the wooden floor part two coincidence chapter eight all to play for good afternoon blacking all set the voice was casual authoritative i see theres a car outside not somebody looking for a game i suppose im not sure sir its an old member come back to have a club made up would you like me to ask him sir who is it whats his name bond smiled grimly he pricked his ears he wanted to catch every inflection a mr bond sir there was a pause bond the voice had not changed it was politely interested met a fellow called bond the other day whats his first name james sir oh yes now the pause was longer does he know im here bond could sense goldfingers antennae probing the situation hes in the workshop sir may have seen your car drive up bond thought alfreds never told a lie in his life hes not going to start now might be an idea now goldfingers voice unbent he wanted something from alfred blacking some information what sort of a game does this chap play whats his handicap used to be quite useful when he was a boy sir havent seen his game since then hm bond could feel the man weighing it all up bond smelled that the bait was going to be taken he reached into his bag and pulled out his driver and started rubbing down the grip with a block of shellac might as well look busy a board in the shop creaked bond honed away industriously his back to the open door i think weve met before the voice from the doorway was low neutral bond looked quickly over his shoulder my god you made me jump why recognition dawned its gold goldman er goldfinger he hoped he wasnt overplaying it he said with a hint of dislike or mistrust where have you sprung from i told you i played down here remember goldfinger was looking at him shrewdly now the eyes opened wide the xray gaze pierced through to the back of bonds skull no did not miss masterton give you my message no what was it i said i would be over here and that i would like a game of golf with you oh well bonds voice was coldly polite we must do that some day i was playing with the professional i will play with you instead goldfinger was stating a fact there was no doubt that goldfinger was hooked now bond must play hard to get why not some other time ive come to order a club anyway im not in practice there probably isnt a caddie bond was being as rude as he could obviously the last thing he wanted to do was play with goldfinger i also havent played for some time ordering a club will not take a moment goldfinger turned back into the shop blacking have you got a caddie for mr bond yes sir then that is arranged bond wearily thrust his driver back into his bag well all right then he thought of a final way of putting goldfinger off he said roughly but i warn you i like playing for money i cant be bothered to knock a ball round just for the fun of it bond felt pleased with the character he was building up for himself was there a glint of triumph quickly concealed in goldfingers pale eyes he said indifferently that suits me anything you like off handicap of course i think you said youre nine yes goldfinger said carefully where may i ask huntercombe bond was also nine at sunningdale huntercombe was an easier course nine at huntercombe wouldnt frighten goldfinger and i also am nine here up on the board so its a level game right bond shrugged youll be too good for me i doubt it however goldfinger was offhandtell you what ill do that bit of money you removed from me in miami remember the big figure was ten i like a gamble it will be good for me to have to try i will play you double or quits for that bond said indifferently thats too much then as if he thought better of it thought he might win he said with just the right amount of craft mixed with reluctance of course you can say that was found money i wont miss it if it goes again oh well all right easy come easy go level match ten thousand dollars it is goldfinger turned away he said and there was a sudden sweetness in the flat voice thats all arranged then mr blacking many thanks put your fee down on my account very sorry we shall be missing our game now let me pay the caddie fees alfred blacking came into the workroom and picked up bonds clubs he looked very directly at bond he said remember what i told you sir one eye closed and opened again i mean about that flat swing of yours it needs watching all the time bond smiled at him alfred had long ears he might not have caught the figure but he knew that somehow this was to be a key game thanks alfred i wont forget four penfolds with hearts on them and a dozen tees i wont be a minute bond walked through the shop and out to his car the bowlerhatted man was polishing the metal work of the rolls with a cloth bond felt rather than saw him stop and watch bond take out his zip bag and go into the club house the man had a square flat yellow face one of the koreans bond paid his greenfee to hampton the steward and went into the changingroom it was just the same the same tacky smell of old shoes and socks and last summers sweat why was it a tradition of the most famous golf clubs that their standard of hygiene should be that of a victorian private school bond changed his socks and put on the battered old pair of nailed saxones he took off the coat of his yellowing black and white hounds tooth suit and pulled on a faded black windcheater cigarettes lighter he was ready to go bond walked slowly out preparing his mind for the game on purpose he had needled this man into a high tough match so that goldfingers respect for him should be increased and goldfingers view of bond that he was the type of ruthless hardadventurer who might be very useful to goldfinger would be confirmed bond had thought that perhaps a hundredpound nassau would be the form but ten thousand dollars there had probably never been such a high singles game in historyexcept in the finals of american championships or in the big amateur calcutta sweeps where it was the backers rather than the players who had the money on goldfingers private accounting must have taken a nasty dent he wouldnt have liked that he would be aching to get some of his money back when bond had talked about playing high goldfinger had seen his chance so be it but one thing was certain for a hundred reasons bond could not afford to lose he turned into the shop and picked up the balls and tees from alfred blacking hawkers got the clubs sir bond strolled out across the five hundred yards of shaven seaside turf that led to the first tee goldfinger was practising on the putting green his caddie stood near by rolling balk to him goldfinger putted in the new fashion between his legs with a mallet putter bond felt encouraged he didnt believe in the system he knew it was no good practising himself his old hickory calamity jane had its good days and its bad there was nothing to do about it he knew also that the st marks practice green bore no resemblance in speed or texture to the greens on the course bond caught up with the limping insouciant figure of his caddie who was sauntering along chipping at an imaginary ball with bonds blaster afternoon hawker afternoon sir hawker handed bond the blaster and threw down three used balls his keen sardonic poachers face split in a wry grin of welcome howve you been keep in sir played any golf in the last twenty years can you still put them on the roof of the starters hut this referred to the day when bond trying to do just that before a match had put two balls through the starters window lets see bond took the blaster and hefted it in his hand gauging the distance the tap of the balls on the practice green had ceased bond addressed the ball swung quickly lifted his head and shanked the ball almost at right angles he tried again this time it was a dunch a foot of turf flew up the ball went ten yards bond turned to hawker who was looking his most sardonic its all right hawker those were for show now then one for you he stepped up to the third ball took his club back slowly and whipped the club head through the ball soared a hundred feet paused elegantly dropped eighty feet on to the thatched roof of the starters hut and bounced down bond handed back the club hawkers eyes were thoughtful amused he said nothing he pulled out the driver and handed it to bond they walked together to the first tee talking about hawkers family goldfinger joined them relaxed impassive bond greeted goldfingers caddie an obsequious talkative man called foulks whom bond had never liked bond glanced at goldfingers clubs they were a brand new set of american ben hogans with smart st marks leather covers for the woods the bag was one of the stitched black leather holdalls favoured by american pros the clubs were in individual cardboard tubes for easy extraction it was a pretentious outfit but the best toss for honour goldfinger flicked a coin tails it was heads goldfinger took out his driver and unpeeled a new ball he said dunlop number one always use the same ball whats yours tenfold hearts goldfinger looked keenly at bond strict rules of golf naturally right goldfinger walked on to the tee and teed up he took one or two careful concentrated practice swings it was a type of swing bond knew well the grooved mechanical repeating swing of someone whohad studied the game with great care read all the books and spent five thousand pounds on the finest pro teachers it would be a good scoring swing which might not collapse under pressure bond envied it goldfinger took up his stance wagged gracefully took his club head back in a wide slow arc and with his eyes glued to the ball broke his wrists correctly he brought the club head mechanically effortlessly down and through the ball and into a rather artificial copybook finish the ball went straight and true about two hundred yards down the fairway it was an excellent uninspiring shot bond knew that goldfinger would be capable of repeating the same swing with different clubs again and again round the eighteen holes bond took his place gave himself a lowish tee addressed the ball with careful enmity and with a flat racketplayers swing in which there was just too much wrist for safety lashed the ball away it was a fine attacking drive that landed past goldfingers ball and rolled on fifty yards but it had had a shade of draw and ended on the edge of the lefthand rough they were two good drives as bond handed his club to hawker and strolled off in the wake of the more impatient goldfinger he smelled the sweet smell of the beginning of a knockdownanddragout game of golf on a beautiful day in may with the larks singingover the greatest seaside course in the world the first hole of the royal st marks is four hundred and fifty yards long four hundred and fifty yards of undulating fairway with one central bunker to trap a mishit second shot and a chain of bunkers guarding threequarters of the green to trap a wellhit one you can slip through the unguarded quarter but the fairway slopes to the right there and you are more likely to end up with a nasty firstchipoftheday out of the rough goldfinger was well placed to try for this opening bond watched him take what was probably a spoon make his two practice swings and address the ball many unlikely people play golf including people who are blind who have only one arm or even no legs and people often wear bizarre clothes to the game other golfers dont think them odd for there are no rules of appearance or dress at golf that is one of its minor pleasures but goldfinger had made an attempt to look smart at golf and that is the only way of dressing that is incongruous on a links everything matched in a blaze of rustcoloured tweed from the buttoned golfers cap centred on the huge flaming red hair to the brilliantly polished almost orange shoes the plusfour suit was too well cut and the plusfours themselves had been pressed down the sides the stockings were of a matching heather mixture and had green garter tabs it was as if goldfinger had gone to his tailor and said dress me for golf you know like they wear in scotland social errors made no impression on bond and for the matter of that he rarely noticed them with goldfinger it was different everything about the man had grated on bonds teeth from the first moment he had seen him the assertive blatancy of his clothes was just part of the malevolent animal magnetism that had affected bond from the beginning goldfinger executed his mechanical faultless swing the ball flew true but just failed to make the slope and curled off to the right to finish pinhigh off the green in the short rough easy five a good chip could turn it into a four but it would have to be a good one bond walked over to his ball it was lying cocked up just off the fairway bond took his number four wood now for the all air route a soaring shot that would carry the crossbunkers and give him two putts for a four bond remembered the dictum of the pros it s never too early to start winning he took it easy determined not to press for the long but comfortable carry as soon as bond had hit the shot he knew it wouldnt do the difference between a good golf shot and a bad one is the same as the difference between a beautiful and a plain woman a matter of millimetres in this case the club face had gone through just that one millimetre too low under the ball the arc of flight was high and soft no legs why the hell hadnt he taken a spoon or a two iron off that lie the ball hit the lip of the far bunker and fell back now it was the blaster and fighting for a half bond never worried too long about his bad or stupid shots he put them behind him and thought of the next he came up with the bunker took his blaster and measured the distance to the pin twenty yards the ball was lying well back should he splash it out with a wide stance and an outsidein swing or should he blast it and take plenty of sand for safetys sake he would blast it out bond went down into the bunker head down and follow well through the easiest shot in golf try and put it dead the wish half way down his bade swing hurried the hands in front of the club head the loft was killed and there was the ball rolling back off the face get it out you bloody fool and hole a long putt now bond took too much sand he was out but barely on the green goldfinger bent to his chip and kept his head down until the ball was half way to the hole the ball stopped three inches from the pin without waiting to be given the putt goldfinger turned his back on bond and walked off towards the second tee bond picked up his ball and took his driver from hawker what does he say his handicap is sir nine its a level match have to do better than that though ought to have taken my spoon for the second hawker said encouragingly its early days yet sir bond knew it wasnt it was always too early to start losing chapter nine the cup and the lip goldfinger had already teed up bond walked slowly behind him followed by hawker bond stood and leant on his driver he said i thought you said we would be playing the strict rules of golf but ill give you that putt that makes you one up goldfinger nodded curtly he went through his practice routine and hit his usual excellent safe drive the second hole is a three hundred and seventy yard dogleg to the left with deep crossbunkers daring you to take the tigers line but there was a light helping breeze for goldfinger it would now be a five iron for his second bond decided to try and make it easier for himself and only have a wedge for the green he laid his ears back and hit the ball hard and straight for the bunkers the breeze got under the slight draw and winged the ball on and over the ball pitched and disappeared down into the gully just short of the green a four chance of a three goldfinger strode off without comment bond lengthened his stride and caught up hows the agoraphobia doesnt all this wide open space bother it no goldfinger deviated to the right he glanced at the distant halfhidden flag planning his second shot he took his five iron and hit a good careful shot which took a bad kick short of the green and ran down into the thick grass to the left bond knew that territory goldfinger would be lucky to get down in two bond walked up to his ball took the wedge and flicked the ball on to the green with plenty of stop the ball pulled up and lay a yard past the hole goldfinger executed a creditable pitch but missed the twelvefoot putt bond had two for the hole from a yard he didnt wait to be given the hole but walked up and putted the ball stopped an inch short goldfinger walked off the green bond knocked the ball in all square the third is a blind two hundred and forty yards all carry a difficult three bond chose his brassie and hit a good one it would be on or near the green goldfingers routine drive was well hit but would probably not have enough steam to carry the last of the rough and trickle down into the saucer of the green sure enough goldfingers ball was on top of the protecting mound of rough he had a nasty cuppy lie with a tuft just behind the ball goldfinger stood and looked at the lie he seemed to make up his mind he stepped past his ball to take a club from the caddie his left foot came down just behind the ball flattening the tuft goldfinger could now take his putter he did so and trickled the ball down the bank towards the hole it stopped three feet short bond frowned the only remedy against a cheat at golf is not to play with him again but that was no good in this match bond had no intention of playing with the man again and it was no good starting a youdidididnt argument unless he caught goldfinger doing something even more outrageous bond would just have to try and beat him cheating and all now bonds twentyfoot putt was no joke there was no question of going for the hole he would have to concentrate on laying it dead as usual when one plays to go dead the ball stopped short a good yard short bond took a lot of trouble about the putt and holed it sweating he knocked goldfingers ball away he would go on giving goldfinger missable putts until suddenly bond would ask him to hole one then that one might look just a bit more difficult still all square the fourth is four hundred and sixty yards you drive over one of the tallest and deepest bunkers in the united kingdom and then have a long second shot across an undulating hilly fairway to a plateau green guarded by a final slope which makes it easier to take three putts than two bond picked up his usual fifty yards on the drive and goldfinger hit two of his respectable shots to the gully below the green bond determined to get up took a brassie instead of a spoon and went over the green and almost up against the boundary fence from there he was glad to get down in three for a half the fifth was again a long carry followed by bonds favourite second shot on the course over bunkers and through a valley between high sanddunes to a distant taunting flag it is a testing hole for which the first essential is a wellplaced drive bond stood on the tee perched high up in the sandhills and paused before the shot while he gazed at the glittering distant sea and at the faraway crescent of white cliffs beyond pegwell bay then he took up his stance and visualized the tennis court of turf that was his target he took the club back as slowly as he knew how and started down for the last terrific acceleration before the club head met the ball there was a dull clang on his right it was too late to stop desperately bond focused the ball and tried to keep his swing all in one piece there came the ugly clonk of a mishit ball bonds head shot up it was a lofted hook would it have the legs get on get on the ball hit the top of a mountain of rough and bounced over would it reach the beginning of the fairway bond turned towards goldfinger and the caddies his eyes fierce goldfinger was straightening up he met bonds eyes indifferently sorry dropped my driver dont do it again said bond curtly he stood down off the tee and handed his driver to hawker hawker shook his head sympathetically bond took out a cigarette and lit it goldfinger hit his drive the dead straight regulation two hundred yards they walked down the hill in a silence which goldfinger unexpectedly broke what is the firm you work for universal export and where do they hang out london regents park what do they export bond woke up from his angry ruminations here pay attention this is work not a game all right he put you off your drive but youve got your cover to think about dont let him needle you into making mistakes about it build up your story bond said casually oh everything from sewingmachines to tanks whats your speciality bond could feel goldfingers eyes on him he said i look after the small arms side spend most of my time selling miscellaneous ironmongery to sheiks and rajahs anyone the foreign office decides doesnt want the stuff to shoot at us with interesting work goldfingers voice was flat bored not very im thinking of quitting came down here for a weeks holiday to think it out not much future in england rather like the idea of canada indeed they were past the rough and bond was relieved to find that his ball had got a forward kick off the hill on to the fairway the fairway curved slightly to the left and bond had even managed to pick up a few feet on goldfinger it was goldfinger to play goldfinger took out his spoon he wasnt going for the green but only to get over the bunkers and through the valley bond waited for the usual safe shot he looked at his own lie yes he could take his brassie there came the wooden thud of a mishit goldfingers ball hit off the heel sped along the ground and into the stony wastes of hell bunker the widest bunker and the only unkempt one because of the pebbles on the course for once homer had nodded or rather lifted his head perhaps his mind had been half on what bond had told him good show but goldfinger might still get down in three more bond took out his brassie he couldnt afford to play safe he addressed the ball seeing in his minds eye its eightyeightmillimetre trajectory through the valley and then the two or three bounces that would take it on to the green he laid off a bit to the right to allow for his draw now there came a soft clinking away to his right bond stood away from his ball goldfinger had his back to bond he was gazing out to sea rapt in its contemplation while his right hand played unconsciously with the money in his pocket bond smiled grimly he said could you stop shifting bullion till after my shot goldfinger didnt turn round or answer the noise stopped bond turned back to his shot desperately trying to clear his mind again now the brassie was too much of a risk it needed too good a shot he handed it to hawker and took his spoon and banged the ball safely through the valley it ran on well and stopped on the apron a five perhaps a four goldfinger got well out of the bunker and put his chip dead bond putted too hard and missed the one back still all square the sixth appropriately called the virgin is a famous short hole in the world of golf a narrow green almost ringed with bunkers it can need anything from an eight to a two iron according to the wind today for bond it was a seven he played a soaring shot laid off to the right for the wind to bring it in it ended twenty feet beyond the pin with a difficult putt over and down a shoulder should be a three goldfinger took his five and played it straight the breeze took it and it rolled into the deep bunker on the left good news that would be the hell of a difficult three they walked in silence to the green bond glanced into the bunker goldfingers ball was in a deep heelmark bond walked over to his ball and listened to the larks this was going to put him one up he looked for hawker to take his putter but hawker was the other side of the green watching with intent concentration goldfinger play his shot goldfinger got down into the bunker with his blaster he jumped up to get a view of the hole and then settled himself for the shot as his club went up bonds heart lifted he was going to try and flick it out a hopeless technique from that buried lie the only hope would have been to explode it down came the club smoothly without hurry with hardly a handful of sand the ball curved up out of the deep bunker bounced once and lay dead bond swallowed blast his eyes how the hell had goldfinger managed that now out of sour grapes bond must try for his two he went for it missed the hole by an inch and rolled a good yard past hell and damnation bond walked slowly up to the putt knocking goldfingers ball away come on you bloody fool but the spectre of the big swing from an almost certain one up to a possible one down made bond wish the ball into the hole instead of tapping it in the coaxed ball lacking decision slid past the lip one down now bond was angry with himself he and he alone had lost that hole he had taken three putts from twenty feet he really must pull himself together and get going at the seventh five hundred yards they both hit good drives and goldfingers immaculate second lay fifty yards short of the green bond took his brassie now for the equalizer but he hit from the top his club head came down too far ahead of the hands and the smothered ball shot into one of the righthand bunkers not a good lie but he must put it on the green bond took a dangerous seven and failed to get it out goldfinger got his five two down they halved the short eighth in three at the ninth bond determined to turn only one down again tried to do too much off a poor lie goldfinger got his four to bonds five three down at the turn not too good bond asked hawker for a new ball hawker unwrapped it slowly waiting for goldfinger to walk over the hillock to the next tee hawker said softly you saw what he did at the virgin sir yes damn him it was an amazing shot hawker was surprised oh you didnt see what he did in the bunker sir no what i was too far away the other two were out of sight over the rise hawker silently walked down into one of the bunkers guarding the ninth green kicked a hole with his toe and dropped the ball in the hole he then stood just behind the halfburied ball with his feet close together he looked up at bond remember he jumped up to look at the line to the hole sir yes just watch this sir hawker looked towards the ninth pin and jumped just as goldfinger had done as if to get the line then he looked up at bond again and pointed to the ball at his feet the heavy impact of the two feet just behind the ball had levelled the hole in which it had lain and had squeezed the ball out so that it was now perfectly teed for an easy shot for just the easy cutup shot which had seemed utterly impossible from goldfingers lie at the virgin bond looked at his caddie for a moment in silence then he said thanks hawker give me the bat and the ball somebodys going to be second in this match and im damned if its going to be me yes sir said hawker stolidly he limped off on the short cut that would take him half way down the tenth fairway bond sauntered slowly over the rise and down to the tenth tee he hardly looked at goldfinger who was standing on the tee swishing his driver impatiently bond was clearing his mind of everything but cold offensive resolve for the first time since the first tee he felt supremely confident all he needed was a sign from heaven and his game would catch fire the tenth at the royal st marks is the most dangerous hole on the course the second shot to the skiddy plateau green with cavernous bunkers to right and left and a steep hill beyond has broken many hearts bond remembered that philip scrutton out in four under fours in the gold bowl had taken a fourteen at this hole seven of them pingpong shots from one bunker to another to and fro across the green bond knew that goldfinger would play his second to the apron or short of it and be glad to get a five bond must go for it and get his four two good drives and sure enough goldfinger well up on the apron with his second a possible four bond took his seven laid off plenty for the breeze and fired the ball off into the sky at first he thought he had laid off too much but then the ball began to float to the left it pitched and stopped dead in the soft sand blown on to the green from the righthand bunker a nasty fifteenfoot putt bond would now be glad to get a half sure enough goldfinger putted up to within a yard that thought bond as he squared up to his putt he will have to hole he hit his own putt fairly smartly to get it through the powdering of sand and was horrified to see it going like lightning across the skiddy green god he was going to have not a yard but a twoyard putt back but suddenly as if drawn by a magnet the ball swerved straight for the hole hit the back of the tin bounced up and fell into the cup with an audible rattle the sign from heaven bond went up to hawker winked at him and took his driver they left the caddies and walked down the slope and back to the next tee goldfinger said coldly that putt ought to have run off the green bond said offhandedly always give the hole a chance he teed up his ball and hit his best drive of the day down the breeze wedge and one putt goldfinger hit his regulation shot and they walked off again bond said by the way what happened to that nice miss masterton goldfinger looked straight in front of him she left my employ bond thought good for her he said oh i must get in touch with her again where did she go to i couldnt say goldfinger walked away from bond towards his ball bonds drive was out of sight over the ridge that bisected the fairway it wouldnt be more than fifty yards from the pin bond thought he knew what would be in goldfingers mind what is in most golfers minds when they smell the first scent of a good lead melting away bond wouldnt be surprised to see that grooved swing quicken a trifle it did goldfinger hooked into a bunker on the left of the green now was the moment when it would be the end of the game if bond made a mistake let his man off the hook he had a slightly downhill lie otherwise an easy chip but to the trickiest green on the course bond played it like a man the ball ended six feet from the pin goldfinger played well out of his bunker but missed the longish putt now bond was only one down they halved the dogleg twelfth in inglorious fives and the longish thirteenth also in fives goldfinger having to hole a good putt to do so now a tiny cleft of concentration had appeared on goldfingers massive unlined forehead he took a drink of water from the tap beside the fourteenth tee bond waited for him he didnt want a sharp clang from that tin cup when it was outofbounds over the fence to the right and the drive into the breeze favouring a slice bond brought his left hand over to increase his draw and slowed down his swing the drive well to the left was only just adequate but at least it had stayed in bounds goldfinger apparently unmoved by the outofbounds hazard hit his standard shot they both negotiated the transverse canal without damage and it was another half in five still one down and now only four to play the four hundred and sixty yards fifteenth is perhaps the only hole where the long hitter may hope to gain one clear shot two smashing woods will just get you over the line of bunkers that lie right up against the green goldfinger had to play short of them with his second he could hardly improve on a five and it was up to bond to hit a really godlike second shot from a barely adequate drive the sun was on its way down and the shadows of the four men were beginning to lengthen bond had taken up his stance it was a good lie he had kept his driver there was dead silence as he gave his two incisive waggles this was going to be a vital stroke remember to pause at the top of the swing come down slow and whip the club head through at the last second bond began to take the club back something moved at the corner of hisright eye from nowhere the shadow of goldfingers huge head approached the ball on the ground engulfed it and moved on bond let his swing take itself to pieces in sections then he stood away from his ball and looked up goldfingers feet were still moving he was looking carefully up at the sky shades please goldfinger bonds voice was furiously controlled goldfinger stopped and looked slowly at bond the eyebrows were raised a fraction in inquiry he moved back and stood still saying nothing bond went back to his ball now then relax to hell with goldfinger slam that ball on to the green just stand still and hit it there was a moment when the world stood still then then somehow bond did hit it on a low trajectory that mounted gracefully to carry the distant surf of the bunkers the ball hit the bank below the green bounced high with the impact and rolled out of sight into the saucer round the pin hawker came up and took the driver out of bonds hand they walked on together hawker said seriously thats one of the finest shots ive seen in thirty years he lowered his voice i thought hed fixed you then sir he damned nearly did hawker it was alfred blacking that hit that ball not me bond took out his cigarettes gave one to hawker and lit his own he said quietly all square and three to play weve got to watch those next three holes know what i mean dont you worry sir ill keep my eye on him they came up with the green goldfinger had pitched on and had a long putt for a four but bonds ball was only two inches away from the hole goldfinger picked up his ball and walked off the green they halved the short sixteenth in good threes now there were the two long holes home fours would win them bond hit a fine drive down the centre goldfinger pushed his far out to the right into deep rough bond walked along trying not to be too jubilant trying not to count his chickens a win for him at this hole and he would only need a half at the eighteenth for the match he prayed that goldfingers ball would be unplayable or better still lost hawker had gone on ahead he had already laid down his bag and was busily far tod busily to bonds way of thinking searching for goldfingers ball when they came up it was bad stuff jungle country deep thick luxuriant grass whose roots still held last nights dew unless they were very lucky they couldnt hope to find the ball after a few minutes search goldfinger and his caddie drifted away still wider to where the rough thinned out into isolated tufts thats good thought bond that wasnt anything like the line suddenly he trod on something hell and damnation should he stamp it in he shrugged his shoulders bent down and gently uncovered the ball so as not to improve the lie yes it was a dunlop here you are he called grudgingly oh no sorry you play with a number one dont you yes came back goldfingers voice impatiently well this is a number seven bond picked h up and walked over to goldfinger goldfinger gave the ball a cursory glance he said not mine and went on poking among the tufts with the head of his driver it was a good ball unmarked and almost new bond put it in his pocket and went back to his search he glanced at his watch the statutory five minutes was almost up another halfminute and by god he was going to claim the hole strict rules of golf goldfinger had stipulated all right my friend you shall have them goldfinger was casting back towards bond diligently prodding and shuffling through the grass bond said nearly time im afraid goldfinger grunted he started to say something when there came a cry from his caddie here you are sir number one dunlop bond followed goldfinger over to where the caddie stood on a small plateau of higher ground he was pointing down bond bent and inspected the ball yes an almost new dunlop one and in an astonishingly good lie it was miraculous more than miraculous bond stared hard from goldfinger to his caddie must have had the hell of a lucky kick he said mildly the caddie shrugged his shoulders goldfingers eyes were calm untroubled so it would seem he turned to his caddie i think we can get a spoon to that one foulks bond walked thoughtfully away and then turned to watch the shot it was one of goldfingers best it soared over a far shoulder of rough towards the green might just have caught the bunker on the right bond walked on to where hawker a long blade of grass dangling from his wry lips was standing on the fairway watching the shot finish bond smiled bitterly at him he said in a controlled voice is my good friend in the bunker or is the bastard on the green green sir said hawker unemotionally bond went up to his ball now things had got tough again once more he was fighting for a half after having a certain win in his pocket he glanced towards the pin gauging the distance this was a tricky one he said five or six the six should do it sir nice firm shot hawker handed him the club now then clear your mind keep it slow and deliberate its an easy shot just punch it so that its got plenty of zip to get up the bank and on to the green stand still and head down click the ball hit with a slightly closed face went off on just the medium trajectory bond had wanted it pitched below the bank it was perfect no damn it it had hit the bank with its second bounce stopped dead hesitated and then rolled back and down again hells bells was it hagen who had said you drive for show but you putt for dough getting dead from below that bank was one of the most difficult putts on the course bond reached for his cigarettes and lit one already preparing his mind for the next crucial shot to save the hole so long as that bastard goldfinger didnt hole his from thirty feet hawker walked along by his side bond said miracle finding that ball it wasnt his ball sir hawker was stating a fact what do you mean bonds voice was tense money passed sir white probably a fiver foulks must have dropped that ball down his trouser leg hawker bond stopped in his tracks he looked round goldfinger and his caddie were fifty yards away walking slowly towards the green bond said fiercely do you swear to that how can you be sure hawker gave a halfashamed lopsided grin but there was a crafty belligerence in his eye because his ball was lying under my bag of clubs sir when he saw bonds openmouthed expression he added apologetically sorry sir had to do it after what hes been doing to you wouldnt have mentioned it but i had to let you know hes fixed you again bond had to laugh he said admiringly well you are a card hawker so you were going to win the match for me all on your own he added bitterly but by god that mans the flaming limit ive got to get him ive simply got to now lets think they walked slowly on bonds left hand was in his trousers pocket absentmindedly fingering the ball he had picked up in the rough suddenly the message went to his brain got it he came close to hawker he glanced across at the others goldfinger had stopped his back was to bond and he was taking the putter out of his bag bond nudged hawker here take this he slipped the ball into the gnarled hand bond said softly urgently be certain you take the flag when you pick up the balls from the green whichever way the hole has gone give goldfinger this one right hawker walked stolidly forward his face was expressionless got it sir he said in his normal voice will you take the putter for this one yes bond walked up to his ball give me a line would you hawker walked up on to the green he stood sideways to the line of the putt and then stalked round to behind the flag and crouched he got up inch outside the right lip sir firm putt flag sir no leave it in would you hawker stood away goldfinger was standing by his ball on the right of the green his caddie had stopped at the bottom of the slope bond bent to the putt come on calamity jane this one has got to go dead or ill put you across my knee stand still club head straight back on the line and follow through towards the hole give it a chance now the ball hit firmly in the middle of the club had run up the bank and was on its way to the hole but too hard damn it hit the stick obediently the ball curved in rapped the stick hard and bounced back three inches dead as a doornail bond let out a deep sigh and picked up his discarded cigarette he looked over at goldfinger now then you bastard sweat that one out and by god if you hole it but goldfinger couldnt afford to try he stopped two feet short all right all right said bond generously all square and one to go it was vital that hawker should pick up the balls if he had made goldfinger hole the short putt it would have been goldfinger who would have picked the ball out of the hole anyway bond didnt want goldfinger to miss that putt that wasnt part of the plan hawker bent down and picked up the balls he rolled one towards bond and handed the other to goldfinger they walked off the green goldfinger leading as usual bond noticed hawkers hand go to his pocket now so long as goldfinger didnt notice anything on the tee but with all square and one to go you dont scrutinize your ball your motions are more or less automatic you are thinking of how to place your drive of whether to go for the green with the second or play to the apron of the strength of the wind of the vital figure four that must somehow be achieved to win or at least to halve considering that bond could hardly wait for goldfinger to follow him and hit just once that treacherous dunlop number seven that looked so very like a number one bonds own drive down the four hundred and fifty yard eighteenth was praiseworthy if he wanted to he could now reach the green if he wanted to now goldfinger was on the tee now he had bent down the ball was on the peg its lying face turned up at him but goldfinger had straightened had stood back was taking his two deliberate practice swings he stepped up to the ball cautiously deliberately stood over it waggled focusing the ball minutely surely he would see surely he would stop and bend down at the last minute to inspect the ball would the waggle never end but now the club head was going back coming down the left knee bent correctly in towards the ball the left arm straight as a ramrod crack the ball sailed off a beautiful drive as good as goldfinger had hit straight down the fairway bonds heart sang got you you bastard got you blithely bond stepped down from the tee and strolled off down the fairway planning the next steps which could now be as eccentric as fiendish as he wished goldfinger was beaten already hoist with his own petard now to roast him slowly exquisitely bond had no compunction goldfinger had cheated him twice and got away with it but for his cheats at the virgin and the seventeenth not to mention his improved lie at the third and the various times he had tried to put bond off goldfinger would have been beaten by now if it needed one cheat by bond to rectify the scoresheet that was only poetic justice and besides there was more to this than a game of golf it was bonds duty to win by his reading of goldfinger he had to win if he was beaten the score between the two men would have been equalized if he won the match as he now had he would be two up on goldfinger an intolerable state of affairs bond guessed to a man who saw himself as all powerful this man bond goldfinger would say to himself has something he has qualities i can use he is a tough adventurer with plenty of tricks up his sleeve this is the sort of man i need for for what bond didnt know perhaps there would be nothing for him perhaps his reading of goldfinger was wrong but there was certainly no other way of creeping up on the man goldfinger cautiously took out his spoon for the longish second over crossbunkers to the narrow entrance to the green he made one more practice swing than usual and then hit exactly the right controlled shot up to the apron a certain five probably a four much good would it do him bond after a great show of taking pains brought his hands down well ahead of the club and smothered his number three iron so that the topped ball barely scrambled over the crossbunkers he then wedged the ball on to the green twenty feet past the pin he was where he wanted to be enough of a threat to make goldfinger savour the sweet smell of victory enough to make goldfinger really sweat to get his four and now goldfinger really was sweating there was a savage grin of concentration and greed as he bent to the long putt up the bank and down to the hole not too hard not too soft bond could read every anxious thought that would be running through the mans mind goldfinger straightened up again walked deliberately across the green to behind the flag to verify his line he walked slowly back beside his line brushing away carefully with the back of his hand a wisp or two of grass a speck of topdressing he bent again and made one or two practice swings and then stood to the putt the veins standing out on his temples the cleft of concentration deep between his eyes goldfinger hit the putt and followed through on the line it was a beautiful putt that stopped six inches past the pin now goldfinger would be sure that unless bond sank his difficult twentyfooter the match was his bond went through a long rigmarole of sizing up his putt he took his time letting the suspense gather like a thunder cloud round the long shadows on the livid fateful green flag out please im going to sink this one bond charged the words with a deadly certitude while debating whether to miss the hole to the right or the left or leave it short he bent to the putt and missed the hole well on the right missed it by god bond put bitterness and rage into his voice he walked over to the hole and picked up the two balls keeping them in full view goldfinger came up his face was glistening with triumph well thanks for the game seems i was just too good for you after all youre a good nine handicap said bond with just sufficient sourness he glanced at the balls in his hand to pick out goldfingers and hand it to him he gave a start of surprise hullo he looked sharply at goldfinger you play a number one dunlop dont you yes of course a sixth sense of disaster wiped the triumph off goldfingers face what is it whats the matter well said bond apologetically fraid youve been playing with the wrong ball heres my penfold hearts and this is a number seven dunlop he handed both balls to goldfinger goldfinger tore them off his palm and examined them feverishly slowly the colour flooded over goldfingers face he stood his mouth working looking from the balls to bond and back to the balls bond said softly too bad we were playing to the rules afraid that means you lose the hole and of course the match bonds eyes observed goldfinger impassively but but this was what bond had been looking forward to the cup dashed from the lips he stood and waited saying nothing rage suddenly burst goldfingers usually relaxed face like a bomb it was a dunlop seven you found in the rough it was your caddie that gave me this ball on the seventeenth green he gave me the wrong ball on purpose the damned che here steady on said bond mildly youll get a slander action on your hands if you arent careful hawker did you give mr goldfinger the wrong ball by mistake or anything no sir hawkers face was stolid he said indifferently if you want my opinion sir the mistake may have been made at the seventeenth when the gentleman found his ball pretty far off the line wed all marked it on a seven looks very much like a one id say thats what happened sir it would have been a miracle for the gentlemans ball to have ended up as wide as where it was found tommy rot goldfinger gave a snort of disgust he turned angrily on bond you saw that was a number one my caddie found bond shook his head doubtfully i didnt really look closely im afraid however bonds voice became brisk businesslike its really the job of the player to make certain hes using the right ball isnt it i cant see that anyone else can be blamed if you tee the wrong ball up and play three shots with it anyway he started walking off the green many thanks for the match we must have it again one day goldfinger lit with glory by the setting sun but with a long black shadow tied to his heels followed bond slowly his eyes fixed thoughtfully on bonds back chapter ten up at the grange there are some rich men who use their riches like a club bond luxuriating in his bath thought that goldfinger was one of them he was the kind of man who thought he could flatten the world with his money bludgeoning aside annoyances and opposition with his heavy wad he had thought to break bonds nerve by playing him for ten thousand dollars a fleabite to him but obviously a small fortune to bond in most circumstances he might have succeeded it needs an iron nerve to wait for it on your swing to keep your head down on the short putts when big money hangs on every shot over eighteen long holes the pros playing for their own bread and butter and for their families know the cold breath of the poorhouse on the back of their necks as they come to the eighteenth tee all square that is why they lead careful lives not smoking or drinking and why the one that wins is usually the one with the least imagination but in bonds case goldfinger could not have known that high tension was bonds natural way of life and that pressure and danger relaxed him and he could not have known that bond wanted to play goldfinger for the highest possible stakes and that he would have the funds of the secret service behind him if he lost goldfinger so used to manipulating others had been blind to the manipulation for once being practised upon himself or had he been thoughtfully bond got out of the bath and dried himself that powerful dynamo inside the big round head would be humming at this very moment wondering about bond knowing he had been outcheated asking itself how it came about that twice bond had appeared out of the blue and twice queered his pitch had bond played his cards right had he made himself appear an interesting challenge or would goldfingers sensitive nose smell a threat in the latter case there would be no followup by goldfinger and bond would have to bow out of the case and leave it to m to devise a new approach how soon would he know if the big fish was hooked this one would take plenty of time sniffing the bait it would be good to have just one small bite to tell him he had chosen the right lure there was a knock on the door of his bedroom bond wrapped the towel round him and walked through he opened the door it was the hall porter yes telephone message from a mr goldfinger sir his compliments and would you care to come to his house for dinner tonight its the grange over at reculver sir sixthirty for drinks beforehand and not to bother to dress please thank mr goldfinger and say i shall be delighted bond shut the door and walked across to the open window and stood looking out across the quiet evening sea well well talk of the devil bond smiled to himself and then go and sup with him what was that about a long spoon at six oclock bond went down to the bar and had a large vodka and tonic with a slice of lemon peel the bar was empty save for a group of american air force officers from mansion they were drinking whisky and water and talking baseball bond wondered if they had spent the day toting a hydrogen bomb round the skies over kent over the four little dots in the dunes that had been his match with goldfinger he thought wryly not too much of that whisky cousins paid for his drink and left he motored slowly over to reculver savouring the evening and the drink inside him and the quiet bubble of the twin exhausts this was going to be an interesting dinnerparty now was the moment to sell himself to goldfinger if he put a foot wrong he was out and the pitch would have been badly queered for his successor he was unarmed it would be fatal for goldfinger to smell that kind of rat he felt a moments qualm but that was going too fast no state of war had been declared the opposite if anything when they had parted at the golf club goldfinger had been cordial in a rather forced oily fashion he had inquired where he should send bonds winnings and bond had given him the address of universal export he had asked where bond was staying and bond had told him and added that he would only be at ramsgate a few days while he made up his mind about his future goldfinger hoped that they would one day have a return match but alas he was leaving for france tomorrow and wasnt certain when he would be back flying yes taking the air ferry from lydd well thanks for the match and thank you mr bond the eyes had given bond one last xray treatment as if fixing him for a last time in goldfingers filing system and then the big yellow car had sighed away bond had had a good look at the chauffeur he was a chunky flatfaced japanese or more probably korean with a wild almost mad glare in dramatically slanting eyes that belonged in a japanese film rather than in a rolls royce on a sunny afternoon in kent he had the snoutlike upper lip that sometimes goes with a cleft palate but he said nothing and bond had no opportunity of knowing whether his guess was right in his tight almost bursting black suit and farcical bowler hat he looked rather like a japanese wrestler on his day off but he was not a figure to make one smile if one had been inclined to smile a touch of the sinister the unexplained in the tight shining patentleather black shoes that were almost dancing pumps and in the heavy black leather driving gloves would have changed ones mind there was something vaguely familiar to bond in the mans silhouette it was when the car drove away and bond had a glimpse of the head from the rear that he remembered those were the head and shoulders and bowler hat of the driver of the skyblue ford popular that had so obstinately hugged the crown of the herne bay road at about twelve oclock that morning where had he been coming from what errand had he been on bond remembered something colonel smithers had said could this have been the korean who now travelled the country collecting the old gold from the chain of goldfinger jewellery shops had the boot of the innocent scurrying little saloon been stuffed with the weeks takings of presentation watches signet rings lockets gold crosses as he watched the high primroseyellow silhouette of the silver ghost disappearing towards sandwich bond thought the answer was yes bond turned off the main road into the drive and followed it down between high victorian evergreens to the gravel sweep in front of just the sort of house that would be called the grange a heavy ugly turnofthecentury mansion with a glassenclosed portico and sun parlour whose smell of trapped sunshine rubber plants and dead flies came to bond in his imagination before he had switched off the engine bond got slowly out of the car and stood looking at the house its blank wellwashed eyes stared back at him the house had a background noise a heavy rhythmic pant like a huge animal with a rather quick pulse bond assumed it came from the factory whose plumed chimney reared up like a giant cautionary finger from the high conifers to the right where the stabling and garages would normally be the quiet watchful facade of the house seemed to be waiting for bond to do something make some offensive move to which there would be a quick reply bond shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts and went up the steps to the opaque glasspanelled door and pressed the bell there was no noise of it ringing but the door slowly opened the korean chauffeur still had his bowler hat on he looked without interest at bond he stood motionless his left hand on the inside doorknob and his outstretched right pointing like a signpost into the dark hall of the house bond walked past him vanquishing a desire either to stamp on his neat black feet or hit him very hard indeed in the centre of his tightly buttoned black stomach this korean matched up with what he had always heard about koreans and anyway bond wanted to do something violent to the heavy electric atmosphere of the house the gloomy hall was also the main livingroom a meagre fire flickered behind the fireirons in the wide hearth and two club chairs and a knole sofa stood impassively watching the flames between them on a low settee was a wellstocked drink tray the wide spaces surrounding this spark of life were crowded with massive rothschildian pieces of furniture of the second empire and ormolu tortoiseshell brass and motherofpearl winked back richly at the small fire behind this orderly museum dark panelling ran up to a firstfloor gallery which was reached by a heavy curved stairway to the left of the hall the ceiling was laced with the sombre woodcarving of the period bond was standing taking all this in when the korean came silently up he flung out his signpost of an arm towards the drink tray and the chairs bond nodded and stayed where he was the korean walked past him and disappeared through a door into what bond assumed were the servants quarters the silence helped by the slow iron tick of a massively decorated grandfather clock gathered and crept nearer bond walked over and stood with his back to the poor fire he stared offensively back at the room what a dump what a bloody awful deathly place to live in how did one could one live in this rich heavy morgue among the conifers and evergreens when a hundred yards away there was light and air and wide horizons bond took out a cigarette and lit it what did goldfinger do for enjoyment for fun for sex perhaps he didnt need these things perhaps the pursuit of gold slaked all his thirsts somewhere in the distance a telephone rang the bell shrilled twice and stopped there was the murmur of a voice then steps echoed down a passage and a door under the stairway opened goldfinger came through and quietly closed the door behind him he was wearing a plumcoloured velvet dinner jacket he came slowly across the polished wood floor he didnt hold out his hand he said smiling with his mouth it was kind of you to come at such short notice mr bond you were alone and so was i and it occurred to me that we might discuss the price of corn it was the sort of remark that rich men make to each other bond was amused at being made a temporary member of the club he said i was delighted to get the invitation i was already bored with worrying over my problems ramsgate hasnt much to offer no and now i have an apology to make i have had a telephone call one of my staff i employ koreans by the way has had some minor trouble with the margate police and i must go over and straighten it out some incident at the fun fair i understand these people get easily overexcited my chauffeur will drive me and we should not be more than half an hour meanwhile i fear i must leave you to your own devices please help yourself to drinks there are magazines to read will you forgive me not more than half an hour i assure you thats quite all right bond felt there was something fishy in this he couldnt put his finger on what it was well then au revoir goldfinger went to the front door but i must give you some light its really very dark in here goldfinger brushed his hand down a wallplate of switches and suddenly lights blazed all over the hall from standard lamps wall brackets and four clusters in the ceiling now the room was as bright as a film studio it was an extraordinary transformation bond half dazzled watched goldfinger open the front door and stride out in a minute he heard the sound of a car but not the rolls rev up noisily change gear and go off fast down the drive on an instinct bond walked over to the front door and opened it the drive was empty in the distance he saw the lights of the car turn lefthanded on the main road and make off in the direction of margate he turned back into the house and closed the door he stood still listening the silence except for the heavy clocktick was complete he walked across to the service door and opened it a long dark passage disappeared towards the back of the house bond bent forward all his senses alert silence dead silence bond shut the door and looked thoughtfully round the brilliantly lit hall he had been left alone in goldfingers house alone with its secrets why bond walked over to the drink tray and poured himself a strong gin and tonic there certainly had been a telephone call but it could easily have been an arranged call from the factory the story of the servant was plausible and it was reasonable that goldfinger should go himself to bail the man out and take his chauffeur with him goldfinger had twice mentioned that bond would be alone for half an hour during which he would be left to his own devices this could be innocent or it could be an invitation for bond to show his hand commit some indiscretion was somebody watching him how many of these koreans were there and what were they doing bond glanced at his watch five minutes had gone he made up his mind trap or no trap this was too good a chance to miss he would have a quick look roundbut an innocent one with some sort of a cover story to explain why he had left the hall where should he begin a look at the factory his story that his car had given trouble on the way over choked petrol feed probably and that he had gone to see if there was a mechanic who could give him a hand flimsy but it would do bond downed his drink and went purposefully to the service door and walked through there was a light switch he turned on the light and walked swiftly down a long passage it ended with a blank wall and two doors to right and left he listened for an instant at the lefthand one and heard muffled kitchen noises he opened the righthand door and found himself in the paved garage yard he might have expected the only odd thing about it was that it was brilliantly lit by arc lights the long wall of the factory occupied the far side and now the rhythmic engine thump was very loud there was a plain wooden door low down in the wall opposite bond walked across the yard to it looking around him with casual interest the door was unlocked he opened it with discretion and walked through leaving the door ajar he found himself in a small empty office lit by one naked bulb hanging from the ceiling there was a desk with papers on it a timeclock a couple of filing cabinets and a telephone another door led from the office into the main factory space and there was a window beside the door for keeping an eye on the workmen it would be the foremans office bond walked to the window and looked through bond didnt know what he had expected but there seemed to be the usual accoutrements of a small metalworking business facing him were the open mouths of two blast furnaces their fires now drawn beside these stood a row of kilns for the molten metal of which sheets of different sizes and colours stood against the wall near by there was the polished steel table of a circular saw a diamond saw presumably for cutting the sheets and to the left in the shadows a big oil engine connected to a generator pounding away making power to the right under arc lights a group of five men in overalls four of them koreans were at work on of all things goldfingers rolls royce it stood there gleaming under the lights immaculate save for the righthand door which had been taken off its hinges and now lay across two nearby benches minus its door panel as bond watched two men picked up the new door panel a heavy discoloured sheet of aluminiumcoloured metal and placed it on the door frame there were two hand riveters on the floor and soon bond thought the men would rivet the panel into place and paint it to match the rest of the car all perfectly innocent and aboveboard goldfinger had dented the panel that afternoon and had had a quick repair job done in preparation for his trip tomorrow bond gave a quick sour look round withdrew from the window and went out by the factory door and closed it softly behind him nothing there damn it and now what was his story that he had not wanted to disturb the men at their work perhaps after dinner if one of them had a moment bond walked unhurriedly back the way he had come and regained the hall without misadventure bond looked at his watch ten minutes to go now for the first floor the secrets of a house are in the bedrooms and bathrooms those are the private places where the medicine cabinets the dressingtable the bedside drawers reveal the intimate things the frailties bond had a bad headache he had gone to look for an aspirin he acted the part for an invisible audience massaged his temples glanced up at the gallery walked decisively across the floor and climbed the stairs the gallery gave on to a brightly lit passage bond walked down it opening the doors and glancing in but they were spare bedrooms the beds not made up they held a smell of must and shut windows a large ginger cat appeared from nowhere and followed him mewing and rubbing itself against his trouser legs the end room was the one bond went in and closed the door to a crack all the lights were on perhaps one of the servants was in the bathroom bond walked boldly across to the communicating door and opened it more lights but no one it was a big bathroom probably a spare room converted into a bathroom and in addition to the bath and lavatory it held various fitness machinesa rowing machine a fixed bicycle wheel indian clubs and a ralli health belt the medicine cabinet contained nothing except a great variety of purges senna pods cascara calsalettes enos and various apparatus for the same purpose there were no other drugs and no aspirin bond went back into the bedroom and again drew a blank it was a typical mans room comfortable lived in with plenty of fitted cupboards it even smelled neutral there was a small bookcase beside the bed in which all the books were history or biography all in english the drawer of the bedside table yielded a solitary indiscretion a yellowbacked copy of the hidden sight of love palladium publications paris bond glanced at his watch five more minutes it was time to go he took a last look round the room and moved to the door suddenly he stopped what was it he had noticed almost subconsciously ever since he had come into the room he sharpened his senses there was an incongruity somewhere what was it a colour an object a smell a sound that was it from where he stood he could hear the faintest mosquitoshrill whine it was almost extrasensory in its pitch where did it come from what was making it now there was something else in the room something that bond knew all too well the smell of danger tensely bond stepped closer to the fitted cupboard beside the door softly opened it yes it came from inside the cupboard from behind a range of sports coats that reached down to the top of three banks of drawers sharply bond swept the coats aside his jaws clenched at whatwas behind them from three slots near the top of the cupboard sixteenmillimetre film was inching down in three separate strips into a deep bin behind the false front of the drawers the bin was almost half full of the slimy snakes of the stuff bonds eyes narrowed tensely as he watched the damning evidence coil slowly down on to the pile so that was it cinecameras three of them their lenses concealed god knows where in the hall in the garage courtyard in this room had been watching his every move from the moment goldfinger had left the house switching on the cameras and of course the dazzling lights as he went out of the door why hadnt bond seen the significance of those lights why hadnt he had the elementary imagination to see the trap as well as smell it cover stories indeed what use were they now when he had spent half an hour snooping round and finding nothing for his pains that too he had discovered nothing unearthed no secret it had all been an idiotic waste of time and now goldfinger had him now he was finished hopelessly blown was there any way of saving something from the wreckage bond stood riveted staring at the slow cataracts of film lets see now bonds mind raced thinking of ways out excuses discarding them all well at least by opening the cupboard door he had exposed some of the film then why not expose it all why not but how how could the open cupboard door be explained except by his doing there came a miaow from the open slit of the bedroom door the cat why shouldnt the cat have done it pretty thin but at least it was the shadow of an alibi bond opened the door he picked the cat up in his arms he went back with it to the cupboard stroking it brusquely it purred bond leant over the bin of film picking it up in handfuls so that it would all get the light then when he was satisfied that it must be ruined he tossed it back and dropped the cat in on top of it the cat would not be able to get out easily with any luck it would settle down and go to sleep bond left the cupboard door three inches ajar to spoil the continuing film and the bedroom door the same amount and ran down the passage at the top of the stairs he slowed and sauntered down the empty hall yawned at his playacting he walked across to the fireplace dashed more drink into his glass and picked up the field he turned to the golf commentary by bernard darwin ran his eye down it to see what it was about and then settled into one of the club chairs and lit a cigarette what had he found out what was there on the plus side precious little except that goldfinger suffered from constipation and a dirty mind and that he had wanted to put bond through an elementary test he had certainly done it expertly this was no amateur the technique was fully up to smersh standards and it was surely the technique of somebody with a very great deal to hide and now what would happen for the cat alibi to stand up goldfinger would have to have left two doors one of them vital ajar and the cat had got into the room and been intrigued by the whine of the cameras most unlikely almost incredible goldfinger would be ninety per cent certain it was bond but only ninety there would still be that ten per cent of uncertainty would goldfinger have learnt much more than he knew before that bond was a tricky resourceful customer and that bond had been inquisitive might be a thief he would guess bond had been to the bedroom but bonds other movements for whatever they were worth would remain a secret on the exposed film bond got up and took a handful of other magazines and threw them down beside his chair the only thing for him to do was brazen it out and make a note for the future if there was to be a future that he had better wake his ideas up and not make any more mistakes there wouldnt be enough ginger cats in the world to help him out of one more tight spot like the one he was in there had been no noise of a car coming down the drive not a sound from the door but bond felt the evening breeze on his neck and he knew that goldfinger had come back into the room chapter eleven the oddjob man bond threw down the field and stood up the front door closed noisily bond turned hullo his face registered polite surprise didnt hear you arrive how did it go goldfingers expression was equally bland they might have been old friends neighbours in the country who were accustomed to drop in on each other for a drink oh it sorted itself out my chap had had a row in a pub with some american air force men who had called him a bloody jap i explained to the police that koreans dont like being called japs they let him off with a caution terribly sorry to have been so long hope you werent bored do have another drink thanks but its hardly seemed five minutes since you left been reading what darwin has to say about the fourteen club rule interesting point of view bond launched into a detailed review of the article adding his own comments on the rule goldfinger stood patiently until it was over he said yes its a complicated business of course you play rather a different game from me more workmanlike with my kind of swing i find i need all the clubs im allowed well ill just go up and wash and then well have dinner shant be a moment bond busied himself noisily with pouring another drink sat down and picked up country life he watched gold finger climb the stairs and disappear down the corridor he could visualize every step he found he was reading the periodical upside down he turned it round and stared blindly at a fine photograph of blenheim palace there was dead silence upstairs then a distant lavatory chain was pulled and a door clicked shut bond reached for his drink took a deep swallow and put the glass down beside his chair goldfinger was coming down the stairs bond turned the pages of country life and flicked ash off his cigarette into the grate now goldfinger was crossing the floor towards him bond lowered his paper and looked up goldfinger was carrying the ginger cat tucked carelessly under one arm he reached the fireplace bent forward and pressed the bell he turned towards bond do you like cats his gaze was flat incurious sufficiently the service door opened the chauffeur stood in the frame he still wore his bowler hat and his shiny black gloves he gazed impassively at goldfinger goldfinger crooked a finger the chauffeur approached and stood within the circle by the fire goldfinger turned to bond he said conversationally this is my handy man he smiled thinly that is something of a joke oddjob show mr bond your hands he smiled again at bond i call him oddjob because that describes his functions on my staff the korean slowly pulled off his gloves and came and stood at arms length from bond and held out his hands palm upwards bond got up and looked at them they were big and fat with muscle the fingers all seemed to be the same length they were very blunt at the tips and the tips glinted as if they were made of yellow bone turn them over and show mr bond the sides there were no fingernails instead there was this same yellowish carapace the man turned the hands sideways down each edge of the hands was a hard ridge of the same bony substance bond raised his eyebrows at goldfinger goldfinger said we will have a demonstration he pointed at the thick oak banisters that ran up the stairs the rail was a massive six inches by four thick the korean obediently walked over to the stairs and climbed a few steps he stood with his hands at his sides gazing across at goldfinger like a good retriever goldfinger gave a quick nod impassively the korean lifted his right hand high and straight above his head and brought the side of it down like an axe across the heavy polished rail there was a splintering crash and the rail sagged broken through the centre again the hand went up and flashed down this time it swept right through the rail leaving a jagged gap splinters clattered down on to the floor of the hall the korean straightened himself and stood to attention waiting for further orders there was no flush of effort in his face and no hint of pride in his achievement goldfinger beckoned the man came back across the floor goldfinger said his feet are the same the outside edges of them oddjob the mantelpiece goldfinger pointed at the heavy shelf of carved wood above the fireplace it was about seven feet off the groundsix inches higher than the top of the koreans bowler hat garch a har yes take off your coat and hat goldfinger turned to bond poor chaps got a cleft palate i shouldnt think there are many people who understand him beside me bond reflected how useful that would be a slave who could only communicate with the world through his interpreter better even than the deaf mutes of the harems more tightly bound to his master more secure oddjob had taken off his coat and hat and placed them neatly on the floor now he rolled his trouser legs up to the knee and stood back in the wide wellplanted stance of the judo expert he looked as if a charging elephant wouldnt put him off balance better stand back mr bond the teeth glittered in the wide mouth this blow snaps a mans neck like a daffodil goldfinger drew aside the low settee with the drink tray now the korean had a clear run but he was only three long steps away how could he possibly reach the high mantelpiece bond watched fascinated now the slanting eyes in the flat yellow mask were glinting with a fierce intentness faced by such a man thought bond one could only go down on ones knees and wait for death goldfinger lifted his hand the bunched toes in the polished soft leather shoes seemed to grip the ground the korean took one long crouching stride with knees well bent and then whirled off the ground in midair his feet slapped together like a ballet dancers but higher than a ballet dancers have ever reached and then the body bent sideways and downwards and the right foot shot out like a piston there came a crashing thud gracefully the body settled back down on the hands now splayed on the floor the elbows bent to take the weight and then straightened sharply to throw the man up and back on his feet oddjob stood to attention this time there was a gleam of triumph in his flat eyes as he looked at the threeinch jagged bite the edge of his foot had taken out of the mantelpiece bond looked at the man in deep awe and only two nights ago he bond had been working on his manual of unarmed combat there was nothing absolutely nothing in all his reading all his experience to approach what he had just witnessed this was not a man of flesh and blood this was a living club perhaps the most dangerous animal on the face of the earth bond had to do it had to give homage to this uniquely dreadful person he held out his hand softly oddjob goldfingers voice was the crack of a whip the korean bowed his head and took bonds hand in his he kept his fingers straight and merely bent his thumb in a light clasp it was like holding a piece of board he released bonds hand and went to his neat pile of clothes forgive me mr bond and i appreciate your gesture goldfingers face showed his approval but oddjob doesnt know his own strength particularly when he is keyed up and those hands are like machinetools he could have crushed your hand to pulp without meaning to now then oddjob had dressed and was standing respectfully at attention you did well oddjob im glad to see you are in training here goldfinger took the cat from under his arm and tossed it to the korean who caught it eagerlyi am tired of seeing this animal around you may have it for dinner the koreans eyes gleamed and tell them in the kitchen that we will have our own dinner at once the korean inclined his head sharply and turned away bond hid his disgust he realized that all this exhibition was simply a message to him a warning a light rap on the knuckles it said you see my power mr bond i could easily have killed you or maimed you oddjob was giving an exhibition and you got in the way i would certainly be innocent and oddjob would get off with a light sentence instead the cat will be punished in your place bad luck on the cat of course bond said casually why does the man always wear that bowler hat oddjob the korean had reached the service door the hat goldfinger pointed at a panel in the woodwork near the fireplace still holding the cat under his left arm oddjob turned and walked stolidly back towards them when he was half way across the floor and without pausing or taking aim he reached up to his hat took it by the rim and flung it sideways with all his force there was a loud clang for an instant the rim of the bowler hat stuck an inch deep in the panel goldfinger had indicated then it fell and clattered on the floor goldfinger smiled politely at bond a light but very strong alloy mr bond i fear that will have damaged the felt covering but oddjob will put on another hes surprisingly quick with a needle and thread as you can imagine that blow would have smashed a mans skull or half severed his neck a homely and a most ingeniously concealed weapon im sure youll agree yes indeed bond smiled with equal politeness useful chap to have around oddjob had picked up his hat and disappeared there came the boom of a gong ah dinner shall we go in goldfinger led the way to a door concealed in the panelling to the right of the fireplace he pressed a hidden latch and they walked through the small diningroom matched the heavy wealth of the hall it was brilliantly lit from a central chandelier and by candles on a round table that glittered with silver and glass they sat down opposite each other two yellowfaced servants in white messjackets brought dishes from a loaded servingtable the first course was some curried mess with rice goldfinger noticed bonds hesitation he gave a dry chuckle its all right mr bond shrimp not the cat ah bonds expression was noncommittal please try the moselle i hope it will be to your taste it is a piesporter goldtropfchen help yourself these people are as likely to pour it into your plate as your glass there was a slim bottle in an ice bucket in front of bond he poured some of the wine and tasted it it was nectar and ice cold bond congratulated his host goldfinger gave a curt nod i dont myself drink or smoke mr bond smoking i find the most ridiculous of all the varieties of human behaviour and practically the only one that is entirely against nature can you imagine a cow or any animal taking a mouthful of smouldering straw then breathing in the smoke and blowing it out through its nostrils pah goldfinger showed a rare trace of emotion it is avile practice as for drinking i am something of a chemist and i have yet to find a liquor that is free from traces of a number of poisons some of them deadly such as fusel oil acetic acid ethylacetate acetaldehyde and furfurol a quantity of some of these poisons taken neat would kill you in the small amounts you find in a bottle of liquor they produce various ill effects most of which are lightly written off as a hangover goldfinger paused with a forkful of curried shrimp half way to his mouth since you are a drinker mr bond i will give you one word of good advice never drink socalled napoleon brandy particularly when it is described as aged in the wood that particular potion contains more of the poisons i have mentioned than any other liquor i have analysed old bourbon comes next goldfinger closed his animadversions with a mouthful of shrimp thank you ill remember perhaps for those reasons i have recently taken to vodka they tell me its filtration through activated charcoal is a help bond dredging this piece of expertise out of dim recollections of something he had read was rather proud of having been able to return goldfingers powerful serve goldfinger glanced at him sharply you seem to understand something of these matters have you studied chemistry only dabbled in it it was time to move on i was very impressed by that chauffeur of yours where did he learn that fantastic combat stuff where did it come from is that what the koreans use goldfinger patted his mouth with his napkin he snapped his fingers the two men cleared away the plates and brought roast duckling and a bottle of mouton rothschild for bond when they had withdrawn into immobility at each end of the servingtable goldfinger said have you ever heard of karate no well that man is one of the three in the world who have achieved the black belt in karate karate is a branch of judo but it is to judo what a spandau is to a catapult i could see that the demonstration was an elementary one mr bond goldfinger held up the drumstick he had been gnawing i can tell you that if oddjob had used the appropriate single blow on any one of seven spots on your body you wouldnow be dead goldfinger bit at the side of the drumstick with relish bond said seriously thats interesting i only know five ways of killing oddjob with one blow goldfinger seemed not to hear the comment he put down his drumstick and took a deep draught of water he sat back and spoke while bond went on eating the excellent food karate mr bond is based on the theory that the human body possesses five striking surfaces and thirtyseven vulnerable spots vulnerable that is to an expert in karate whose fingertips the side of the hands and the feet are hardened into layers of corn which is far stronger and more flexible than bone every day of his life mr bond oddjob spends one hour hitting either sacks of unpolished rice or a strong post whose top is wound many times round with thick rope he then spends another hour at physical training which is more that of a ballet school than of a gymnasium when does he practise tossing the bowler hat bond had no intention of succumbing to this psychological warfare goldfinger frowned at the interruption i have never inquired he said without humour but i think you can take it that oddjob keep his eye in at all his skills however you were asking where karate originated it originated in china where wandering buddhist priests became an easy prey for footpads and bandits their religion did not allow them to carry weapons so they developed their own form of unarmed combat the inhabitants of okinawa refined the art to its present form when the japanese forbade them to carry weapons they developed the five striking surfaces of the human body the fist the edge of the hand the fingertips the ball of the foot and the elbows and toughened them until they were enveloped in layers of corn there is no followthrough in a karate blow the entire body is stiffened at the moment of impact with the emphasis on the hips and then instantly relaxed so that balance is never lost it is astonishing what oddjob can do i have seen him hit a brick wall with his entire force and not hurt his hand he can split three halfinch thick boards piled one upon the other with one blow of the hand you have seen what he can do with his foot bond took a deep draught of the delicious claret all this must be rather hard on your furniture goldfinger shrugged i have no more use for this house i thought a demonstration would amuse you i hope you agree that oddjob earned his cat the xray eyes blazed briefly across the table does he train on cats he regards them as a great delicacy he acquired the taste during a famine in his country when he was young bond thought it was time to delve rather more deeply why do you need such a man he cant be very good company mr bond goldfinger snapped his fingers for the two servants it happens that i am a rich man a very rich man and the richer the man the more he needs protection the ordinary bodyguard or detective is usually a retired policeman such men are valueless their reactions are slow their methods oldfashioned and they are open to bribery moreover they have a respect for human life that is no good if i wish to stay alive the koreans have no such feelings that is why the japanese employed them as guards for their prison camps during the war they are the cruellest most ruthless people in the world my own staff are hand picked for these qualities they have served me well i have no complaints nor have they they are well paid and well fed and housed when they want women street women are brought down from london well remunerated for their services and sent back the women are not much to look at but they are white and that is all the koreans ask to submit the white race to the grossest indignities there are sometimes accidents but the pale eyes gazed blankly down the table money is an effective windingsheet bond smiled you like the aphorism it is my own an excellent cheese souffle came and was followed by coffee they ate in silence both apparently comfortable and relaxed by these confidences bond certainly was goldfinger obviously by design was letting his hair down not far not farther than his shoulders but he was showing bond one of his private faces presumably the one to which he thought bond would respond the ruthlessly efficient coldblooded tycoon perhaps after all bonds spying in the house which goldfinger must at least presume had revealed something about bond that goldfinger was pleased to know that bond had a crooked side to him that he wasnt a gentleman in more than appearance now there should be more probing and then with luck the proposition would follow bond sat back and lit a cigarette he said thats a beautiful car youve got must be about the last of the series about wasnt it two blocks of three cylinders with two plugs for each cylinder one set fired from the mag and the other from the coil you are correct but in other respects i have had to introduce some modifications i have added five leaves to the springs and fitted disc brakes to the rear wheels to increase the braking power the servooperated frontwheel brakes were not sufficient oh why not the top speed wouldnt be more than fifty the body cant be all that heavy goldfinger raised his eyebrows you think not one ton of armour plating and armourplated glass make a big difference bond smiled ah i see you certainly do take good care of yourself but how does that work flying the channel doesnt the car go through the floor of the plane t take a plane to myself the silver city company knows the car it is a regular routine twice a year just touring round europe a golfing holiday great fun always wanted to do it myself goldfinger didnt take the bait you can afford to now bond smiled oh that extra ten thousand dollars but i may need that if i decide to move to canada you think you could make money there do you want to make a lot of money bonds voice was eager very much theres no other point in working unfortunately most ways of making big money take a long time by the time one has made the money one is too old to enjoy it thats the trouble im always on the lookout for shortcuts you wont find them here taxations too heavy quite and the laws are strict yes i found that out indeed got on the fringe of the heroin racket only just got out without burning my fingers of course thisll go no further goldfinger shrugged his shoulders mr bond someone said that law is the crystallized prejudices of the community i agree with that definition it happens to apply most strongly to the traffic in drugs even if it didnt i am not concerned with assisting the police well it was like this bond launched into the story of the mexican traffic swapping roles with blackwell he ended up i was lucky to get away with it but it didnt make me particularly popular with universal export i daresay not an interesting story you seem to have shown resource you are not tempted to continue in the same line of business bond shrugged his shoulders a bit too tricky to judge by this mexican the big men in the business arent quite big enough when it comes to the pinch when things got tough he didnt fight back except with his mouth well mr bond goldfinger got up from the table and bond followed suit its been an interesting evening i dont know that i would go back into heroin there are safer ways of making big money you want to be certain that the odds are right and then you should hazard everything doubling ones money isnt easy and the chances dont occur frequently you would like to hear another of my aphorisms yes well mr bond goldfinger gave the rich mans thin smile the safest way to double your money is fold it twice and put it in your pocket bond the bank clerk barkening to the bank manager smiled dutifully but made no comment this just wasnt good enough he was getting nowhere but instinct told him not to put his foot down on the accelerator they went back into the hall bond held out his hand well many thanks for the excellent dinner time i went and got some sleep perhaps we shall run into each other again some day goldfinger pressed bonds hand briefly and pushed it away from him it was another mannerism of the millionaire subconsciously afraid ofthe touch he looked hard at bond he said enigmatically i shouldnt be at all surprised mr bond on his way across the isle of thanet in the moonlight bond turned the phrase over and over in his mind he undressed and got into bed thinking of it unable to guess its significance it could mean that goldfinger intended to get in touch with bond or it could mean that bond must try and keep in touch with goldfinger heads the former tails the latter bond got out of bed and took a coin from the dressingtable and tossed it it came down tails so it was up to him to keep close to goldfinger so be it but his cover would have to be pretty darn good the next time they ran into each other bond got back into bed and was instantly asleep chapter twelve long tail on a ghost punctually at nine the next morning bond got on to the chief of staff james here ive had a look at the property been all over it had dinner last night with the owner i can say pretty well for certain that the managing directors view is right something definitely wrong about the property not enough facts to send you a surveyors report owners going abroad tomorrow flying from ferryfield wish i knew his departure time like to have another sight of his rolls thought id make him a present of a portable wireless set ill be going over a bit later in the day could you get miss ponsonby to book me destination unknown for the present ill be keeping in touch anything your end how did the game of golf go i won there was a chuckle at the other end thought you had pretty big stakes werent they how did you know had mr scotland on last night said hed had a tip on the telephone that someone of your name was in possession of a large amount of undeclared dollars had we got such a person and was it true chap wasnt very senior and didnt know about universal told him to have a word with the commissioner and we got an apology this morning about the same time as your secretary found an envelope containing ten thousand dollars in your mail pretty sly of your man wasnt it bond smiled typical of goldfinger to have thought of a way of getting him into trouble over the dollars probably made the call to scotland yard directly after the game he had wanted to show bond that if you gave goldfinger a knock youd get at least a thorn in your hand but the universal export cover seemed to have stuck bond said thats pretty hot the twister you might tell the managing director that this time it goes to the white cross can you fix the other things of course call you back in a few minutes but watch your step abroad and call us at once if you get bored and need company so long bye bond put down the receiver he got up and set about packing his bag he could see the scene in the chief of staffs office as the conversation was played back off the tape while the chief of staff translated the call to miss moneypenny says he agrees that goldfinger is up to something big but he cant make out what g is flying this morning with his rolls from ferryfield wants to follow he wants us to have a word with customs so that he can take a good look at the rolls and plant a homer in the boot hell keep in touch through stations in case he needs help and so forth it was an efficient machine bond finished packing and when the london call came giving him his various clearances he went downstairs paid his bill and got quickly out of ramsgate on to the canterbury road london had said that goldfinger was booked on a special flight leaving at twelve bond got to ferryfield by eleven made himself known to the chief passport control and the customs officers who were expecting him had his car taken out of sight into an empty hangar and sat and smoked and talked minor shop with the passport men they thought he was from scotland yard he let them go on thinking it no he said goldfinger was all right it was possible that one of his servants was trying to smuggle something out of the country rather confidential if bond could just be left alone with the car for ten minutes he wanted to have a look at the tool kit would the customs give the rest of the rolls their grade a going over for hidden compartments theyd be glad to do so at elevenfortyfive one of the customs men put his head round the door he winked at bond coming in now chauffeur on board going to ask both to board the plane before the car tell them its something to do with the weight distribution not so phoney as it sounds we know this old crate shes armourplated weighs about three tons call you when were ready thanks the room emptied bond took the fragile little parcel out of his pocket it contained a drycell battery wired to a small vacuum tube he ran his eye over the wiring and put the apparatus back in his coat pocket and waited at elevenfiftyfive the door opened the officer beckoned no trouble theyre on the plane the huge gleaming silver ghost stood in the customs bay out of sight of the plane the only other car was a dovegrey triumph tr convertible with its hood down bond went to the back of the rolls the customs men had unscrewed the plate of the spare tool compartment bond pulled out the tray of tools and made a show of minutely examining them and the tray he knelt down under cover of rummaging at the sides of the compartment he slipped the battery and tube into the back of it he replaced the tool tray it fitted all right he stood up and brushed his hands together negative he said to the customs officer the officer fitted the plate on and screwed it down with the square key he stood up nothing funny about the chassis or the bodywork plenty of room in the frame and upholstery but we couldnt get at them without doing a major job all right to go yes and thanks bond walked back into the office he heard the quick solid whine of the old selfstarter a minute later the car came out of the bay and idled superbly over to the loading ramp bond stood at the back of the office and watched it being eased up the ramp the big jaws of the bristol freighter clanged shut the chocks were jerked away and the dispatcher raised a thumb the two engines coughed heavily and fired and the great silver dragonfly trundled off towards the runway when the plane was on the runway bond walked round to his car and climbed into the drivers seat he pressed a switch under the dash there was a moments silence then a loud harsh howl came from the hidden loudspeaker bond turned a knob the howl diminished to a deep drone bond waited until he heard the bristol take off as the plane rose and made for the coast the drone diminished in five minutes it had gone bond tuned the set and picked it up again he followed it for five minutes as the plane made off across the channel and then switched the set off he motored round to the customs bay told the aa that he would be back at onethirty for the two oclock flight and drove slowly off towards a pub he knew in rye from now on so long as he kept within about a hundred miles of the rolls the homer the rough radio transmitter he had slipped into its tool compartment would keep contact with bonds receiver all he had to do was watch the decibels and not allow the noise to fade it was a simple form of direction finding which allowed one car to put a long tail on another and keep in touch without any danger of being spotted on the other side of the channel bond would have to discover the road goldfinger had taken out of le touquet get well within range and close up near big towns or wherever there was a major fork or crossroads sometimes bond would make a wrong decision and have to do some fast motoring to catch up again the db iii would look after that it was going to be fun playing hare and hounds across europe the sun was shining out of a clear sky bond felt a moments sharp thrill down his spine he smiled to himself a hard cold cruel smile goldfinger he thought for the first time in your life youre in trouble bad trouble there is always an agent cycliste at the dangerous crossroads where le touquets quiet n meets the oily turbulence of the major nl yes certainly he had seen the rolls one could not fail to remark it a real aristocrat of a car to the right monsieur towards abbeville he will be an hour ahead but with that bolide of yours as soon as bond had cleared his papers at the airport the homer had picked up the drone of the rolls but it was impossible to tell if goldfinger was heading north for the low countries or austria or germany or if he was off to the south for that sort of fix you needed two radio cars to get a bearing bond raised a hand to the agent and gave his engine the gun he would have to close up fast goldfinger would be through abbeville and would already have taken the major fork on to nl for paris or n for rouen a lot of time and distance would be wasted if bond made the wrong guess bond swept along the badly cambered road he took no chances but covered the fortythree kilometres to abbeville in a quarter of an hour the drone of the homer was loud goldfinger couldnt be more than twenty miles ahead but which way at the fork on a guess bond took the paris road he beat the car along for a time there was little change in the voice of the homer bond could be right or wrong then imperceptibly the drone began to fade blast turn back or press on fast and take one of the secondary roads across to rouen and catch up with him there bond hated turning back ten kilometres short of beauvais he turned right for a time it was bad going but then he was on to the fast n and could afford to drift into rouen led on by the beckoning voice of his pickup he stopped on the outskirts of the town and listened with one ear while consulting his michelin by the waxing drone he could tell that he had got ahead of goldfinger but now there was another vital fork not quite so easy to retrieve if bond guessed wrong again either goldfinger would take the alengonle manstours route to the south or he meant to move southeast missing paris by way of evreux chartres and orleans bond couldnt afford to get closer to the centre of rouen and perhaps catch a glimpse of the rolls and of the way it would take he would have to wait until the homer went on the wane and then make his own guess it was a quarter of an hour later before bond could be sure that the rolls was well past this time he again took the left leg of the fork he thrust the pedal into the floor and hurried yes this time the drone was merging into a howl bond was on the track he slowed to forty tuned down his receiver to a whisper and idled along wondering where goldfinger was heading for five oclock six seven the sun set in bonds driving mirror and still the rolls sped on they were through dreux and chartres and on to the long straight fiftymile stretch into orleans if that was to be the night stop the rolls wouldnt have done badly at all over two hundred and fifty miles in something over six hours goldfinger was certainly no slouch when it came to motoring he must be keeping the old silver ghost at maximum outside the towns bond began to close up there were rearlights ahead dim ones bond had his fog lights on he switched on the marchals it was some little sports car bond closed up mg triumph austin healey it was a pale grey triumph twoseater with the hood up bond blinked his lights and swept past now there was the glare of another car ahead bond dowsed his headlamps and drove on the fogs the other car was a mile down the road bond crept up on it at a quarter of a mile he flashed the marchals on and off for a quick look yes it was the rolls bond dropped back to a mile and stayed there vaguely noticing the dim lights of the tr in his mirror on the outskirts of orleans bond pulled into the side of the road the triumph growled casually past bond had never cared for orleans it was a priest and myth ridden town without charm or gaiety it was content to live off joan of arc and give the visitor a hard holy glare while it took his money bond consulted his michelin goldfinger would stop at fivestar hotels and eat fillets of sole and roast chicken it would be the arcades for him perhaps the moderne bond would have liked to stay outside the town and sleep on the banks of the loire in the excellent auberge de la montespan his belly full of quenelles de brocket he would have to stick closer to his fox he decided on the hotel de la gare and dinner at the station buffet when in doubt bond always chose the station hotels they were adequate there was plenty of room to park the car and it was better than even chances that the buffet de la gare would be excellent and at the station one could hear the heartbeat of the town the nightsounds of the trains were full of its tragedy and romance the drone on the receiver had stayed constant for ten minutes bond noted his way to the three hotels and cautiously crept into the town he went down to the river and along the lighted guais he had been right the rolls was outside the arcades bond turned back into the town and made for the station the hotel de la gare was all he had expected cheap oldfashioned solidly comfortable bond had a hot bath went back to his car to make sure the rolls hadnt moved and walked into the station restaurant and ate one of his favourite meals two aeufs cocotte a la creme a large sole meuniere and an adequate camembert he drank a welliced pint of rose danjou and had a hennessys three star with his coffee at tenthirty he left the restaurant checked on the rolls and walked the virtuous streets for an hour one more check on the rolls and bed at six oclock the next morning the rolls hadnt moved bond paid his bill had a cafe complet with a double ration of coffee at the station motored down to the quais and backed his car up a side street this time he could not afford to make a mistake goldfinger would either cross the river and head south to join n for the riviera or he would follow the north bank of the loire also perhaps for the riviera but also on the route for switzerland and italy bond got out of the car and lounged against the parapet of the river wall watching between the trunks of the plane trees at eightthirty two small figures came out of the arcades the rolls moved off bond watched it follow the quais until it was out of sight then he got behind the wheel of the aston martin and set off in pursuit bond motored comfortably along the loire in the early summer sunshine this was one of his favourite corners of the world in may with the fruit trees burning white and the soft wide river still big with the winter rains the valley was green and young and dressed for love he was thinking this when before chateauneuf there was a shrill scream from twin bosch horns and the little triumph tore past the hood was down there was the blur of a pretty face hidden by white motoring goggles with dark blue lenses although bond only saw the edge of a profile a slash of red mouth and the fluttering edge of black hair under a pink handkerchief with white spots he knew she was pretty from the way she held her head there was the authority of someone who is used to being admired combined with the selfconsciousness of a girl driving alone and passing a man in a smart car bond thought that would happen today the loire is dressed for just that chasing that girl until you run her to ground at lunchtime the contact at the empty restaurant by the river out in the garden under the vine trellis the friture and the icecold vouvray the cautious sniffing at each other and then the two cars motoring on in convoy until that evening well down to the south there would be the place they had agreed on at lunch olive trees crickets singing in the indigo dusk the discovery that they liked each other and that their destinations could wait then next day they would leave her car in the hotel garage and go off in his at a tangent slowly knowing there was no hurry for anything driving to the west away from the big roads what was that place he had always wanted to go to simply because of the name yes entre deux seins a village near les baux perhaps there wasnt even an inn there well then they would go on to les baux itself at the bouches du rhone on the edge of the camargue there they would take adjoining rooms in the fabulous baumaniere the only hotelrestaurant in france with michelins supreme accolade they would eat the gratin de langouste and perhaps because it was traditional on such a night drink champagne and then bond smiled at his story and at the dots that ended it not today today youre working today is for goldfinger not for love today the only scent you may smell is goldfingers expensive aftershave lotion not what would she use english girls made mistakes about scent he hoped it would be something slight and clean balmains vent vert perhaps or carons muguet bond tuned up his receiver for reassurance then hushed it and motored on relaxed playing with his thoughts of the girl filling in the details of course he might meet up with her again they seemed to be keeping pretty close company she must have spent the night in orleans where what a waste but wait a minute suddenly bond woke up from his daydreaming the open hood reminded him hed seen that triumph before it had been at ferryfield must have taken the flight after goldfinger it was true he hadnt seen the girl or noted the registration number but surely it was the same if so for her to be still on goldfingers tail after three hundred miles was more than coincidence and she had been driving with dimmed lights the night before here whats going on bond stepped on the accelerator he was approaching nevers hed anyway have to close up for the next big turning he would kill two birds with one stone and also see what the girl was up to if she was keeping station somewhere between him and goldfinger there would have to be some furious thinking and it would be a blasted nuisance it was hard enough keeping up with goldfinger with another tail sandwiched between them it would become hellish difficult she was still there perhaps two miles behind the rolls keeping well back as soon as he caught sight of her little glittering rump bond slowed well well who was she what the hell was all this about bond motored on his face morose and thoughtful the little convoy kept on still following the wide black sheen of n that runs like a thick dangerous nerve down through the heart of france but at moulins bond nearly lost the scent he had to double back quickly and get on to n goldfinger had turned at right angles and was now making for lyons and italy or for macon and geneva bond had to do some fast motoring and then was only just in time to avoid running into trouble he had not worried much about the pitch of the homer he had counted on a sight of the triumph to slow him down suddenly he realized that the drone was becoming a howl if he hadnt braked hard down from the ninety he was doing he would have been on top of the rolls as it was he was barely creeping along when he came over a rise and saw the big yellow car stopped by the wayside a mile ahead there was a blessed carttrack bond swerved into it and stopped under cover of a low hedge he took a small pair of binoculars out of the glove compartment got out of the car and walked back yes damn it goldfinger was sitting below a small bridge on the bank of a stream he was wearing a white dust coat and white linen driving helmet in the style of german tourists he was eating having a picnic the sight made bond hungry what about his own lunch he examined the rolls through the rear window he could see part of the koreans black shape in the front seat there was no sign of the triumph if the girl had still been on goldfingers tail she would have had no warning she would have just kept her head down and stepped on the gas now she would be somewhere ahead waiting in ambush for the rolls to come by or would she perhaps bonds imagination had run away with him she was probably on her way to the italian lakes to join an aunt some friends a lover now goldfinger was on his feet tidy man thats right pick up the scraps of paper and tuck them away carefully under the bridge why not throw them in the stream suddenly bonds jaw tightened what did those actions of goldfinger remind him of was bond romancing again or was the bridge a post box had goldfinger been instructed to leave something one of his bars of gold under this particular bridge france switzerland italy it was convenient for all of them the communist cell in lyons for instance one of the strongest in france and this was a good place to use with a clear field of view up and down the road goldfinger scrambled up the bank bond drew back under cover he heard the distant grind of the old selfstarter he cautiously watched the rolls until it had disappeared it was a pretty bridge over a pretty stream it had a survey number set in the arch the sixth bridge from some town on n easy to find bond got quickly out of the car and slid down the shallow bank it was dark and cool under the arch there were the shadows of fish in the slow clear pebbled water bond searched the edge of the masonry near the grass verge exactly in the centre below the road there was a patch of thick grass against the wall bond parted the grass there was a sprinkling of freshly turned earth bond dug with his fingers there was only one it was smooth to the touch and brickshaped it needed some strength to lift it bond brushed the earth off the dull yellow metal and wrapped the heavy bar in his handkerchief he held the bar under his coat and climbed back up the bank on to the empty road chapter thirteen if you touch me there bond felt pleased with himself a whole lot of people were going to get very angry with goldfinger you can do a lot of dirty work with twenty thousand pounds now plans would have to be altered conspiracies postponed perhaps even lives saved and if it ever got to an inquiry by smersh which was unlikely as they were the sort of realistic people who cut their losses it could only be assumed that some sheltering tramp had found the gold bar bond lifted the secret flap under the passenger seat and slipped the bar inside dangerous stuff he would have to contact the next station of the service and hand it over to them they would get it back to london in the embassy bag bond would have to report this quickly it confirmed a lot m might even want to warn the deuxieme and have the bridge watched to see who came but bond hoped that would not happen he didnt want a scare started just when he was getting close to goldfinger he wanted the skies over goldfinger to be blue and clear bond got moving now there were other things to think about he must catch up with the rolls before macon and get the next fork to geneva or lyons right he must solve the problem of the girl and if possible get her off the road pretty or not she was confusing the issue and he must stop and buy himself something to eat and drink it was one oclock and the sight of goldfinger eating had made him hungry and it was time to fill up and check the water and oil the drone of the homer grew louder he was in the outskirts of macon he must close up and take the risk of being spotted the busy traffic would hide his lowslung car it was vital to know if the rolls crossed the saone for the bourg road or if it turned right at the bridge and joined the n for lyons far down the rue rambuteau there was a glimpse of yellow over the railway bridge and through the little square the high yellow box kept on towards the river bond watched the passersby turn their heads to follow the gleaming rolls the river would goldfinger turn right or keep on across the bridge the rolls kept straight on so it was switzerland bond followed over into the suburb of st laurent now for a butcher and a baker and a wine shop a hundred yards ahead the golden head of a calf hung over the pavement bond glanced in his driving mirror well well the little triumph was only feet away from his tail how long had she been there bond had been so intent on following the rolls that he hadnt glanced back since entering the town she must have been hiding up a ide street so now coincidence was certainly out something must be done sorry sweetheart ive got to mess you up ill be as gentle as i can hold tight bond stopped abruptly in front of the butchers shop he banged the gears into reverse there was a sickening scrunch and tinkle bond switched off his engine and got out he walked round to the back of the car the girl her face tense with anger had one beautiful silken leg on the road there was an indiscreet glimpse of white thigh the girl stripped off her goggles and stood legs braced and arms akimbo the beautiful mouth was taut with anger the aston martins rear bumper was locked into the wreckage of the triumphs lamps and radiator grille bond said amiably if you touch me there again youll have to marry me the words were hardly out of his mouth before the open palm cracked across his face bond put up a hand and rubbed his cheek now there was quite a crowd there was a murmur of approval and ribaldry allez y la gosse maintenant le knockout the girls rage had not dissipated with the blow you bloody fool what the hell do you think youre doing bond thought if only pretty girls were always angry they would be beautiful he said your brakes cant be up to much my brakes what the hell do you mean you reversed into me gears slipped i didnt know you were so close it was time to calm her down im most frightfully sorry ill pay for all the repairs and everything it really is bad luck lets see what the damage is try and back away doesnt look as if our bumpers have overridden bond put a foot on the triumphs bumpers and rocked dont you dare touch my car leave it alone angrily the girl climbed back into the drivers seat she pressed the selfstarter the engine fired metal clanged under the bonnet she switched off and leant out there you are you idiot youve smashed the fan bond had hoped he had he got into his own car and eased it away from the triumph bits of the triumph released by bonds bumper tinkled on to the road he got out again the crowd had thinned there was a man in a mechanics overalls he volunteered to call a breakdown van and went off to do so bond walked over to the triumph the girl had got out and was waiting for him her expression had changed now she was more composed bond noticed that her eyes which were dark blue watched his face carefully bond said it really wont be too bad probably knocked the fan out of alignment theyll put temporary headlamps in the sockets and straighten up the chrome youll be off again by tomorrow morning now bond reached into his pocket for his notecasethis is maddening for you and ill certainly take all the blame heres a hundred thousand francs to cover the damage and your expenses for the night and telephoning your friends and so on please take it and call it quits id love to stay here and see you get on the road all right tomorrow morning but ive got an appointment this evening and ive simply got to make it no the one word was cool definite the girl put her hands behind her back and waited but what was it she wanted the police have him charged with dangerous driving ive got an appointment this evening too ive got to make it ive got to get to geneva will you please take me there its not far only about a hundred miles we could do it in two hours in that she gestured at the db iii will you please there was a desperate urgency in the voice no cajolery no threats only a blazing need for the first time bond examined her as more than a pretty girl who perhaps they were the only explanations bond had found to fit the facts wanted to be picked up by goldfinger or had a blackmail on him but she didnt look capable of either of these things there was too much character in the face too much candour and she wasnt wearing the uniform of a seductress she wore a white rather masculine cut heavy silk shirt it was open at the neck but it would button up to a narrow military collar the shirt had long wide sleeves gathered at the wrists the girls nails were unpainted and her only piece of jewellery was a gold ring on her engagement finger she wore a very wide black stitched leather belt with double brass buckles it rose at the back to give some of the support of a racing drivers corset belt her short skirt was charcoalgrey and pleated her shoes were expensivelooking black sandals which would be comfortable and cool for driving the only touch of colour was the pink handkerchief which she had taken off her head and now held by her side with the white goggles it all looked very attractive but the getup reminded bond more of an equipment than a young girls dress there was something faintly mannish and openair about the whole of her behaviour and appearance she might thought bond be a member of the english womens ski team or spend a lot of her time in england hunting or showjumping although she was a very beautiful girl she was the kind who leaves her beauty alone she had made no attempt to pat her hair into place as a result it looked as a girls hair should look untidy with bits that strayed and a rather crooked parting it provided the contrast of an uneven jagged dark frame for the pale symmetry of the face the main features of which were blue eyes under dark brows a desirable mouth and an air of determination and independence that came from the high cheekbones and the fine line of the jaw there was the same air of selfreliance in her figure she held her body proudly her fine breasts outthrown and unashamed under the taut silk her stance with feet slightly parted and hands behind her back was a mixture of provocation and challenge the whole picture seemed to say now then you handsome bastard dont think you can little woman me youve got me into this mess and by god youre going to get me out you may be attractive but ive got my life to run and i know where im going bond weighed her request how much of a nuisance would she be how soon could he get rid of her and get on with his business was there any security risk against the disadvantages there was his curiosity about her and what she was up to the memory of the fable he had spun round her and which had now taken its first step towards realization and finally the damselindistress business any womans appeal for help bond said curtly ill be glad to take you to geneva now then he opened up the back of the aston martin lets get your things in while i fix up about the garage heres some money please buy us lunch anything you like for yourself for me six inches of lyon sausage a loaf of bread butter and half a litre of macon with the cork pulled their eyes met and exchanged a flurry of masculinefeminine masterslave signals the girl took the money thank you ill get the same things for myself she went to the boot of the triumph and unlocked it no dont bother i can manage these she hauled out a bag of golf clubs with a cover zipped shut and a small expensive looking suitcase she brought them over to the aston martin and rejecting bonds offer of help fitted them in alongside bonds suitcase she watched him lock the back of the car and went back to the triumph she took out a wide blackstitched leather shoulder bag bond said what name and address shall i give what bond repeated his question wondering if she would lie about the name or the address or both she said i shall be moving about better say the bergues at geneva the names soames miss tilly soames there was no hesitation she went into the butchers shop a quarter of an hour later they were on their way the girl sat upright and kept her eyes on the road the drone on the homer was faint the rolls must have gained fifty miles bond hurried they flashed through bourg and over the river at pont dain now they were in the foothills of the jura and there were the sbends of n bond went at them as if he was competing in the alpine trials after the girl had swayed against him twice she kept her hand on the handle on the dash and rode with the car as if she were his spare driver once after a particularly sharp dry skid that almost took them over the side bond glanced at her profile her lips were parted and her nostrils slightly flared the eyes were alight she was enjoying herself they came to the top of the pass and there was the run down towards the swiss frontier now the homer was sending out a steady howl bond thought i must take it easy or we shall be running into them at the customs he put his hand under the dash and tuned the noise down he pulled in to the side of the road they sat in the car and ate a polite but almost silent picnic neither making any attempt at conversation both it seemed with other things on their minds after ten minutes bond got going again he sat relaxed motoring easily down the curving road through the young whispering pines the girl said whats that noise magneto whine gets worse when i hurry started at orleans have to get it fixed tonight she seemed satisfied with this mumbojumbo she said diffidently where are you heading for i hope i havent taken you very far out of your way bond said in a friendly voice not at all as a matter of fact im going to geneva too but i may not stop there tonight may have to get on depends on my meeting how long will you be there i dont know im playing golf theres the swiss womens open championship at divonne im not really that class but i thought it would be good for me to try then i was going to play on some of the other courses fair enough no reason why it shouldnt be true but bond was certain it wasnt the whole truth he said do you play a lot of golf whats your home course quite a lot temple it had been an obvious question was the answer true or just the first golf course she had thought of do you live near there ive got an aunt who lives at henley what are you doing in switzerland holiday business import and export oh bond smiled to himself it was a stage conversation the voices were polite stage voices he could see the scene beloved of the english theatre the drawingroom sunshine on hollyhocks outside french windows the couple sitting on the sofa on the edge of it she pouring out the tea do you take sugar they came out into the foothills there was a long straight stretch of road and in the distance the small group of buildings of the french customs the girl gave him no chance to get a glimpse of her passport as soon as the car stopped she said something about tidying up and disappeared into the dames bond had gone through the controle and was dealing with the triptyque when she reappeared her passport stamped at the swiss customs she chose the excuse of getting something out of her suitcase bond hadnt got time to hang about and call her bluff bond hurried on into geneva and pulled up at the imposing entrance of the bergues the baggagiste took her suitcase and golf clubs they stood together on the steps she held out her hand goodbye there was no melting of the candid blue eyes and thank you you drive beautifully her mouth smiled im surprised you got into the wrong gear at macon bond shrugged it doesnt often happen im glad i did if i can get my business finished perhaps we could meet again that would be nice the tone of voice said it wouldnt be the girl turned and went in through the swingdoors bond ran down to his car to hell with her now to pick up goldfinger then to the little office on the quai wilson he tuned the homer and waited a couple of minutes goldfinger was close but moving away he could either be following the right or the left bank of the lake from the pitch of the homer he was at least a mile outside the town which way to the left towards lausanne to the right towards evian the db iii was already on the lefthand road bond decided to follow its nose he got moving bond caught up with the high yellow silhouette just before coppet the tiny lakeside hamlet made famous by madame de stael he hid behind a lorry at his next reconnaissance the rolls had disappeared bond motored on watching to the left at the entrance to the village big solid iron gates were closing in a high wall dust hung in the air above the wall was a modest placard it said in faded yellow on blue entreprises auric ag the fox had gone to earth bond went on until he found a turning to the left he followed this until there was a lane which led back through the vineyards to the woods behind coppet and to the chateau of madame de stael bond stopped among the trees now he should be directly above the entreprises auric he took his binoculars got out and followed a footpath down towards the village soon on his right was a spiked iron railing there was rolled barbed wire along its top a hundred yards lower down the hill the railing merged into a high stone wall bond walked slowly back up the path looking for the secret entrance the children of coppet would have made to get at the chestnut trees he found it two bars of the railing widened to allow a small body through bond stood on the lower railing with all his weight widened the gap by another couple of inches and wormed his way through bond walked warily through the trees watching each step for dead branches the trees thinned there were glimpses of a huddle of low buildings behind a small manoir bond picked the thick trunk of a fir tree and got behind it now he was looking down on the buildings the nearest was about a hundred yards away there was an open courtyard in the middle of the courtyard stood the dusty silver ghost bond took out the binoculars and examined everything minutely the house was a wellproportioned square block of old red brick with a slate roof it consisted of two storeys and an attic floor it would probably contain four bedrooms and two principal rooms the walls were partly covered by a very old wistaria in full bloom it was an attractive house in his minds eye bond could see the whitepainted panelling inside he smelled the sweet musty sunshiny smell of the rooms the back door gave on to the wide paved courtyard in which stood the rolls the courtyard was open on bonds side but closed on the other two sides by singlestorey corrugated iron workshops a tall zinc chimney rose from the angle of the two workshops the chimney was topped by a zinc cowl on top of the zinc cowl was the revolving square mouth of what looked to bond like a decca radar scanner you see on the bridges of most ships the apparatus whirled steadily round bond couldnt imagine what purpose it served on the roof of this little factory among the trees suddenly the silence and immobility of the peaceful scene were broken it was as if bond had put a penny in the slot of a diorama on brighton pier somewhere a tinny clock struck five at the signal the back door of the house opened and goldfinger came out still dressed in his white linen motoring coat but without the helmet he was followed by a nondescript obsequious little man with a toothbrush moustache and hornrimmed spectacles goldfinger looked pleased he went up to the rolls and patted its bonnet the other man laughed politely he took a whistle out of his waistcoat pocket and blew it a door in the righthand workshop opened and four workmen in blue overalls filed out and walked over to the car from the open door they had left there came a whirring noise and a heavy engine started up and settled into the rhythmic pant bond remembered from reculver the four men disposed themselves round the car at a word from the little man who was presumably the foreman they began to take the car to pieces by the time they had lifted the four doors off their hinges removed the bonnet cover from the engine and had set about the rivets on one of the mudguards it was clear that they were methodically stripping the car of its armour plating almost as soon as bond had come to this conclusion the black bowlerhatted figure of oddjob appeared at the back door of the house and made some sort of a noise at goldfinger with a word to the foreman goldfinger went indoors and left the workmen to it it was time for bond to get going he took a last careful look round to fix the geography in his mind and edged back among the trees i am from universal export oh yes behind the desk there was a reproduction of the annigoni portrait of the queen on the other walls were advertisements for ferguson tractors and other agricultural machinery from outside the wide window came the hum of traffic along the quai wilson a steamer hooted bond glanced out of the window and watched it ride across the middle distance it left an enchanted wake across the flawless evening mirror of the lake bond looked back into the politely inquiring eyes in the bland neutral businessmans face we were hoping to do business with you what sort of business important business the mans face broke into a smile he said cheerfully its isnt it thought i recognized you well now what can i do for you the voice became cautious only one thing better make it quick and get along theres been the hell of a heat on since the dumont business theyve got me taped the locals and redland all very peaceful of course but you wont want them sniffing round you i thought it might be like that its only routine here bond unbuttoned his shirt and took out the heavy chunk of gold get that back would you and transmit this when you have a chance the man pulled a pad towards him and wrote in shorthand to bonds dictation when the man had finished he put the pad in his pocket well well pretty hot stuff wilco my routines at midnight this he indicated the gold can go to berne for the bag anything else ever heard of the entreprises auric at coppet know what they do i know what every engineering business in the area does have to tried to sell them some hand riveters last year they make metal furniture pretty good stuff the swiss railways take some of it and the airlines know which airlines the man shrugged i heard they did all the work for mecca the big charter line to india their terminus is geneva theyre quite a big competitor with allindia meccas privately owned matter of fact i did hear that auric co had some money in it no wonder theyve got the contract for the seating a slow grim smile spread across bonds face he got up and held out his hand you dont know it but youve just done a whole jigsaw puzzle in under a minute many thanks best of luck with the tractor business hope well meet again one day out in the street bond got quickly into his car and drove along the quai to the bergues so that was the picture for two days hed been trailing a silver ghost across europe it was an armourplated silver ghost hed watched the last bit of plating being riveted on in kent and the whole lot being stripped off at coppet those sheets would already be in the furnaces at coppet ready to be modelled into seventy chairs for a mecca constellation in a few days time those chairs would be stripped off the plane in india and replaced with aluminium ones and goldfinger would have made what half a million pounds a million for the silver ghost wasnt silver at all it was a golden ghost all the two tons of its bodywork solid eighteencarat white gold chapter fourteen things that go thump in the night james bond booked in at the hotel des bergues took a bath and shower and changed his clothes he weighed the walther ppk in his hand and wondered whether he should take it or leave it behind he decided to leave it he had no intention of being seen when he went back to the entreprises auric if by dreadful luck he was seen it would spoil everything to get into a fight he had his story a poor one but at least one that would not break his cover he would have to rely on that but bond did choose a particular pair of shoes that were rather heavier than one could expect from their casual build at the desk he asked if miss soames was in he was not surprised when the receptionist said they had no miss soames staying in the hotel the only question was whether she had left the hotel when bond was out of sight or had registered under another name bond motored across the beautiful pont du mont blanc and along the brightly lit quai to the bavaria a modest alsatian brasserie that had been the rendezvous of the great in the days of the league of nations he sat by the window and drank enzian washed down with pale lowenbrau he thought first about goldfinger there was now no doubt what he was up to he financed a spy network probably smersh and he made fortunes smuggling gold to india the country where he could get the biggest premium after the loss of his brixham trawler he had thought out this new way he first made it known that he had an armoured car that would only be considered eccentric many english bodybuilders exported them they used to go to indian rajahs now they went to oil sheiks and south american presidents goldfinger had chosen a silver ghost because with his modifications the chassis was strong enough the riveting was already a feature of the bodywork and there was the largest possible area of metal sheeting perhaps goldfinger had run it abroad once or twice to get ferryfield used to it then on the next trip he took off the armour plating in his works at reculver he substituted eighteencarat white gold its alloy of nickel and silver would be strong enough the colour of the metal would not betray him if he got in a smash or if the bodywork were scratched then off to switzerland and to the little factory the workmen would have been as carefully picked as the ones at reculver they would take off the plates and mould them into aircraft seats which would then be upholstered and installed in mecca airlines run presumably by some stooge of goldfingers who got a cut on each gold run on these runs once twice three times a year the plane would accept only light freight and a few passengers at bombay or calcutta the plane would need an overhaul be reequipped it would go to the mecca hangar and have new seats fitted the old ones the gold ones would go to the bullion brokers goldfinger would get his sterling credit in nassau or wherever he chose he would have made his hundred or two hundred per cent profit and could start the cycle all over again from the we buy old gold shops in britain to reculver geneva bombay yes thought bond gazing out across the glistening starlit lake thats how it would be a topnotch smuggling circuit with a minimum risk and maximum profit how goldfinger must smile as he pressed the bulb of the old boaconstrictor horn and swept past the admiring policemen of three countries he certainly seemed to have the answer the philosophers stone the finger of gold if he hadnt been such an unpleasant man if he wasnt doing all this to sustain the trigger finger of smersh bond would have felt admiration for this monumental trickster whose operations were so big that they worried even the bank of england as it was bond only wanted to destroy goldnnger seize his gold get him behind bars goldfingers goldlust was too strong too ruthless too dangerous to be allowed the run of the world it was eight oclock the enzian the firewater distilled from gentian that is responsible for switzerlands chronic alcoholism was beginning to warm bonds stomach and melt his tensions he ordered another double and with it a choucroute and a carafe of fondant and what about the girl this pretty authoritarian joker that had suddenly been faced in the deal what in hell was she about what about this golf story bond got up and went to the telephone booth at the back of the room he got on to the journal de geneve and through to the sports editor the man was helpful but surprised at bonds question no the various championships were of course played in the summer when the other national programmes were finished and it was possible to lure a good foreign entry to switzerland it was the same with all other european countries they liked to bring in as many british and american players as possible it increased the gates pas de quoi monsieur bond went back to his table and ate his dinner so much for that whoever she was she was an amateur no professional would use a cover that could be broken down by one telephone call it had been in the back of bonds mind reluctantly because he liked the girl and was excited by her that she could she just could have been an agent of smersh sent to keep an eye on goldfinger or bond or both she had some of the qualities of a secret agent the independence the strength of character the ability to walk alone but that idea was out she hadnt got the training bond ordered a slice of gruyere pumpernickel and coffee no she was an enigma bond only prayed that she hadnt got some private plot involving either him or goldfinger that was going to mess up his own operation and his own job was so nearly finished all he needed was the evidence of his own eyes that the story he had woven round goldfinger and the rolls was the truth one look into the works at coppet one grain of white gold dust and he could be off to berne that very night and be on to the duty officer over the embassy scrambler then quietly discreetly the bank of england would freeze goldfingers accounts all over the world and perhaps already tomorrow the special branch of the swiss police would be knocking on the door of entreprises auric extradition would follow goldfinger would go to brixton there would be a quiet rather complicated case in one of the smuggling courts like maidstone or lewes goldfinger would get a few years his naturalization would be revoked and his gold hoard illegally exported would trickle back into the vaults below the bank of england and smersh would gnash its bloodstained teeth and add another page to bonds bulging zapiska time to go for the last lap bond paid his bill and went out and got into his car he crossed the rhone and motored slowly along the glittering quai through the evening traffic it was an average night for his purpose there was a blazing threequarter moon to see by but not a breath of wind to hide his approach through the woods to the factory well there was no hurry they would probably be workirig through the night he would have to take it very easily and carefully the geography of the place and the route he had plotted for himself ran before bonds eyes like a film while the automatic pilot that is in all good drivers took the car along the wide white highway beside the sleeping lake bond followed his route of the afternoon when he had turned off the main road he drove on his sidelights he nosed the car off the lane into a clearing in the woods and switched off the engine he sat and listened in the heavy silence there was only a soft ticking from the hot metal under the bonnet and the hasty trip of the dashboard clock bond got out eased the door shut and walked softly down the little path through the trees now he could hear the soft heavy pant of the generator engine thumpah thumpah thumpah it seemed a watchful rather threatening noise bond reached the gap in the iron bars slipped through and stood straining his senses forward through the moondappled trees thumpah thumpah thumpah the great iron puffs were on top of him inside his brain bond felt the skincrawling tickle at the groin that dates from ones first game of hide and seek in the dark he smiled to himself at the animal danger signal what primeval chord had been struck by this innocent noise coming out of the tall zinc chimney the breath of a dinosaur in its cave bond tightened his muscles and crept forward foot by foot moving small branches carefully out of his way placing each step as cautiously as if he was going through a minefield the trees were thinning soon he would be up with the big sheltering trunk he had used before he looked for it and then stood frozen his pulse racing below the trunk of his tree spreadeagled on the ground was a body bond opened his mouth wide and breathed slowly in and out to release the tension softly he wiped his sweating palms down his trousers he dropped slowly to his hands and knees and stared forward his eyes widened like camera lenses the body under the tree moved shifted cautiously to a new position a breath of wind whispered in the tops of the trees the moonbeams danced quickly across the body and then were still there was a glimpse of thick black hair black sweater narrow black slacks and something else a straight gleam of metal along the ground it began beneath the clump of black hair and ran past the trunk of the trees into the grass bond slowly wearily bent his head and looked at the ground between his spread hands it was the girl tilly she was watching the buildings below she had a rifle a rifle that must have been among the innocent golf clubs ready to fire on them damn and blast the silly bitch bond slowly relaxed it didnt matter who she was or what she was up to he measured the distance planned each stride the trajectory of the final spring left hand to her neck right to the gun now bonds chest skidded over the hump of the buttocks and thudded into the small of the girls back the impact emptied the breath out of her with a soft grunt the fingers of bonds left hand flew to the throat and found the carotid artery his right hand was on the waist of the rifles stock he prised the fingers away felt that the safety catch was on and reached the rifle far to one side bond eased the weight of his chest off the girls back and moved his fingers away from her neck he closed them softly over her mouth beneath him he felt the body heave the lungs labouring for breath she was still out carefully bond gathered the two hands behind the girls back and held them with his right beneath him the buttocks began to squirm the legs jerked bond pinned the legs to the ground with his stomach and thighs noting the strong muscles bunched under him now the breath was rasping through his fingers teeth gnawed at his hand bond inched carefully forwards along the girl he got his mouth through her hair to her ear he whispered urgently tilly for christs sake stay still this is me bond im a friend this is vital something you dont know about will you stay still and listen the teeth stopped reaching for his fingers the body relaxed and lay soft under his after a time the head nodded once bond slid off her he lay beside her still holding her hands prisoned behind her back he whispered get your breath but tell me were you after goldfinger the pale face glanced sideways and away the girl whispered fiercely into the ground i was going to kill him some girl goldfinger had put in the family way bond let go her hands she brought them up and rested her head on them her whole body shuddered with exhaustion and released nerves the shoulders began to shake softly bond reached out a hand and smoothed her hair quietly rhythmically his eyes carefully went over the peaceful unchanged scene below unchanged there was something the radar thing on the cowl of the chimney it wasnt going round any more it had stopped with its oblong mouth pointing in their direction the fact had no significance for bond now the girl wasnt crying any more bond nuzzled his mouth close to her ear her hair smelled of jasmine he whispered tjont worry im after him too and im going to damage him far worse than you could have done ive been sent after him by london they want him what did he do to you she whispered almost to herself he killed my sister you knew her jill masterton bond said fiercely what happened he has a woman once a month jill told me this when she first took the job he hypnotizes them then he he paints them gold christ why i dont know jill told me hes mad about gold i suppose he sort of thinks hes that hes sort of possessing gold you know marrying it he gets some korean servant to paint them the man has to leave their backbones unpainted jill couldnt explain that i found out its so they wouldnt die if their bodies were completely covered with gold paint the pores of the skin wouldnt be able to breathe then theyd die afterwards theyre washed down by the korean with resin or something goldfinger gives them a thousand dollars and sends them away bond saw the dreadful oddjob with his pot of gold paint goldfingers eyes gloating over the glistening statue the fierce possession what happened to jill she cabled me to come she was in an emergency ward in a hospital in miami goldfinger had thrown her out she was dying the doctors didnt know what was the matter she told me what had happened to her what he had done to her she died the same night the girls voice was dry matter of fact when i got back to england i went to train the skin specialist he told me this business about the pores of the skin it had happened to some cabaret girl who had to pose as a silver statue he showed me details of the case and the autopsy then i knew what had happened to jill goldfinger had had her painted all over he had murdered her it must have been out of revenge for for going with you there was a pause the girl said dully she told me about you she she liked you she told me if ever i met you i was to give you this ring bond closed his eyes tight fighting with a wave of mental nausea more death more blood on his hands this time as the result of a careless gesture a piece of bravado that had led to twentyfour hours of ecstasy with a beautiful girl who had taken his fancy and in the end rather more than his fancy and this petty sideswipe at goldfingers ego had been returned by goldfinger a thousand a millionfold she left my employ the flat words in the sunshine at sandwich two days before how goldfinger must have enjoyed saying that bonds fingernails dug into the palms of his hands by god hed pin this murder on goldfinger if it was the last act of his life as for himself bond knew the answer this death he would not be able to excuse as being part of his job this death he would have to live with the girl was pulling at her finger at the claddagh ring the entwined hands round the gold heart she put her knuckle to her mouth the ring came off she held it up for bond to take the tiny gold circle silhouetted against the trunk of the tree glittered in the moonlight the noise in bonds ear was something between a hiss and a shrill whistle there was a dry twanging thud the aluminium feathers of the steel arrow trembled like a humming birds wings in front of bonds eyes the shaft of the arrow straightened the gold ring tinkled down the shaft until it reached the bark of the tree slowly almost incuriously bond turned his head ten yards away half in moonlight half in shadow the black melonheaded figure crouched its legs widely straddled in the judo stance the left arm thrust forward against the glinting semicircle of the bow was straight as a duellists the right hand holding the feathers of the second arrow was rigid against the right cheek behind the head the taut right elbow lanced back in frozen suspense the silver tip of the second arrow pointed exactly between the two pale raised profiles bond breathed the words dont move an inch aloud he said hullo oddjob damned good shot oddjob jerked the tip of the arrow upwards bond got to his feet shielding the girl he said softly out of the corner of his mouth he mustnt see the rifle he said to oddjob speaking casually peaceably nice place mr goldfinger has here want to have a word with him sometime perhaps its a bit late tonight you might tell him ill be along tomorrow bond said to the girl come on darling weve had our walk in the woods time to get back to the hotel he took a step away from oddjob towards the fence oddjob stamped his forward foot the point of the second arrow swung to the centre of bonds stomach oargn oddjob jerked his head sideways and downwards towards the house oh you think hed like to see us now all right you dont think well be disturbing him come on darling bond led the way to the left of the tree away from the rifle that lay in the shadowed grass as they went slowly down the hill bond talked softly to the girl briefing her youre my girl friend i brought you out from england seem surprised and interested by our little adventure were in a tough spot dont try any tricks bond jerked back his head this mans a killer the girl said angrily if only you hadnt interfered same to you said bond shortly he took it back im sorry tilly didnt mean that but i dont think you could have got away with it i had my plans id have been over the frontier by midnight bond didnt answer something had caught his eye on top of the tall chimney the oblong mouth of the radarthing was revolving again it was that that had spotted them heard them it must be some kind of sonic detector what a bag of tricks this man was bond hadnt meant to underestimate goldfinger had he managed to do so decisively perhaps if he had had his gun no bond knew that even his splitsecond draw wouldnt have beaten the korean wouldnt do so now there was a total deadliness about this man whether bond had been armed or unarmed it would have been a man fighting a tank they reached the courtyard as they did so the back door of the house opened two more koreans who might have been the servants from reculver ran out towards them through the warm splash of electric light they carried uglylooking polished sticks stop both men wore the savage empty grin that men from station j who had been in japanese prison camps had described to bond we search no trouble or the man who had spoken cut the air with a whistling lash of his stick hands up bond put his hands slowly up he said to the girl dont react whatever they do odd job came forward and stood menacingly watching the search the search was expert bond coldly watched the hands on the girl the grinning faces okay come they were herded through the open door and along a stoneflagged passage to the narrow entrance hall at the front of the house the house smelled as bond had imagined it would musty and fragrant and summery there were whitepanelled doors oddjob knocked on one of them yes oddjob opened the door they were prodded through goldfinger sat at a big desk it was neatly encumbered with importantlooking papers the desk was flanked by grey metal filing cabinets beside the desk within reach of goldfingers hand stood a shortwave wireless set on a low table there was an operators keyboard and a machine that ticked busily and looked like a barograph bond guessed that this had something to do with the detector that had intercepted them goldfinger wore his purple velvet smokingjacket over an opennecked white silk shirt the open neck showed a tuft of orange chesthair he sat very erect in a highbacked chair he hardly glanced at the girl the big chinablue eyes were fixed on bond they showed no surprise they held no expression except a piercing hardness bond blustered look here goldfinger what the hells all this about you put the police on to me over that ten thousand dollars and i got on your tracks with my girl friend here miss soames ive come to find out what the hell you mean by it we climbed the fence i know its trespassing but i wanted to catch you before you moved on somewhere else then this ape of yours came along and damned near killed one of us with his bow and arrow two more of your bloody koreans held us up and searched us what the hells going on if you cant give me a civil answer and full apologies ill put the police on you goldfingers flat hard stare didnt flicker he might not have heard bonds angrygentlemans outburst the finely chiselled lips parted he said mr bond they have a saying in chicago once is happenstance twice is coincidence the third time its enemy action miami sandwich and now geneva i propose to wring the truth out of you goldfingers eyes slid slowly past bonds head oddjob the pressure room part three enemy action chapter fifteen the pressure room bonds reaction was automatic there was no reason behind it he took one quick step forward and hurled himself across the desk at goldfinger his body launched in a shallow dive hit the top of the desk and ploughed through the litter of papers there was a heavy thud as the top of his head crashed into goldfingers breastbone the momentum of the blow rocked goldfinger in his chair bond kicked back at the edge of the desk got a purchase and rammed forward again as the chair toppled backwards and the two bodies went down in the splintering woodwork bonds fingers got to the throat and his thumbs went into its base and downwards with every ounce of his force then the whole house fell on bond a baulk of timber hit him at the base of the neck and he rolled sluggishly off goldfinger on to the floor and lay still the vortex of light through which bond was whirling slowly flattened into a disc a yellow moon and then into a burning cyclops eye something was written round the fiery eyeball it was a message an important message for him he must read it carefully one by one bond spelled out the tiny letters the message said sociйtй anonyme mazda what was its significance a hard bolt of water hit bond in the face the water stung his eyes and filled his mouth he retched desperately and tried to move he couldnt his eyes cleared and his brain there was a throbbing pain at the back of his neck he was staring up into a big enamelled light bowl with one powerful bulb he was on some sort of a table and his wrists and ankles were bound to its edges he felt with his fingers he felt polished metal a voice goldfingers voice flat uninterested said now we can begin bond turned his head towards the voice his eyes were dazzled by the light he squeezed them hard and opened them goldfinger was sitting in a canvas chair he had taken off his jacket and was in his shirt sleeves there were red marks round the base of his throat on a folding table beside him were various tools and metal instruments and a control panel on the other side of the table tilly masterton sat in another chair she was strapped to it by her wrists and ankles she sat bolt upright as if she was in school she looked incredibly beautiful but shocked remote her eyes gazed vacantly at bond she was either drugged or hypnotized bond turned his head to the right a few feet away stood the korean he still wore his bowler hat but now he was stripped to the waist the yellow skin of his huge torso glinted with sweat there was no hair on it the flat pectoral muscles were as broad as dinner plates and the stomach was concave below the great arch of the ribs the biceps and forearms also hairless were as thick as thighs the tenminutestotwo oil slicks of the eyes looked pleased greedy the mouthful of blackish teeth formed an oblong grin of anticipation bond raised his head the quick look round hurt they were in one of the factory workrooms white light blazed round the iron doors of two electric furnaces there were bluish sheets of metal stacked in wooden frames from somewhere came the whir of a generator there was a distant muffled sound of hammering and behind the sound the faraway iron pant of the power plant bond glanced down the table on which he lay spreadeagled he let his head fall back with a sigh there was a narrow slit down the centre of the polished steel table at the far end of the slit like a foresight framed in the vee of his parted feet were the glinting teeth of a circular saw bond lay and stared up at the little message on the lamp bulb goldfinger began to speak in a relaxed conversational voice bond pulled the curtains tight across the ghastly peepshow of his imagination and listened mr bond the word pain comes from the latin poena meaning penalty that which must be paid you must now pay for the inquisitiveness which your attack upon me proves as i suspected to be inimical curiosity as they say killed the cat this time it will have to kill two cats for i fear i must also count this girl an enemy she tells me she is staying at the bergues one telephone call proved that to be false oddjob was sent to where you were both hidden and recovered her rifle and also a ring which it happens that i recognize under hypnotism the rest came out this girl came here to kill me perhaps you did too you have both failed now must come the poena mr bond the voice was weary bored i have had many enemies in my time i am very successful and immensely rich and riches if i may inflict another of my aphorisms upon you may not make you friends but they greatly increase the class and variety of your enemies thats very neatly put goldfinger ignored the interruption if you were a free man with your talent for inquiry you would be able to find round the world the relics of those who have wished me ill or who have tried to thwart me there have as i said been many of these people and you would find mr bond that their remains resemble those of hedgehogs squashed upon the roads in summertime very poetic simile by chance mr bond i am a poet in deeds not often in words i am concerned to arrange my actions in appropriate and effective patterns but that is by the way i wish to convey to you that it was a most evil day for you when you first crossed my path and admittedly in a very minor fashion thwarted a minuscule project upon which i was engaged on that occasion it was someone else who suffered the poena that should have been meted out to you an eye was taken for the eye but it was not yours you were lucky and if you had then found an oracle to consult the oracle would have said to you mr bond you have been fortunate keep away from mr auric goldfinger he is a most powerful man if mr goldfinger wanted to crush you he would only have to turn over in his sleep to do so you express yourself most vividly bond turned his head the great brown and orange football of a head was bent slightly forward the round moonface was bland indifferent casually one hand reached out to the control panel and pressed down a switch there came a slow metallic growl from the end of the table on which bond lay it curved quickly up to a harsh whine and then to a shrill high whistle that was barely audible bond turned his head wearily away how soon could he manage to die was there any way he could hasten death a friend of his had survived the gestapo he had described to bond how he had tried to commit suicide by holding his breath by superhuman willpower after a few minutes without breathing unconsciousness had come but with the blackout of the senses will and intention had also left the body at once reason was forgotten the bodys instinct to live manned the pumps and got breath back into the body again but bond could try it there was nothing else to help him through the pain barrier before the blessing of death for death was the only exit he knew he could never squeal to goldfinger and live with himself again even in the unlikely event that goldfinger could be bought off with the truth no he must stick to his thin story and hope that the others who would now follow him on goldfingers trail would have better luck who would m choose probably the second killer in the small section of three he was a good man more careful than bond m would know that goldfinger had killed bond and he would give licence to kill in return in geneva would put him on to the scent that would end with bonds inquiry about the entreprises auric yes fate would catch up with goldfinger if bond could only keep his mouth shut if he gave the least clue away goldfinger would escape that was unthinkable now then mr bond goldfingers voice was brisk enough of these amiabilities sing as my chicago friends put it and you will die quickly and painlessly the girl also sing not and your death will be one long scream the girl i shall then give to oddjob as i did that cat for supper which is it to be bond said dont be a fool goldfinger i told my friends at universal where i was going and why the girls parents know that she went with me i made inquiries about this factory of yours before we came here we shall be traced here very easily universal is powerful you will have the police after you within days of our disappearance i will make a deal with you let us go and nothing more will be heard of the matter i will vouch for the girl you are making a stupid mistake we are two perfectly innocent people goldfinger said in a bored voice im afraid you dont understand mr bond whatever you have managed to find out about me which i suspect is very little can only be a grain of the truth i am engaged upon gigantic enterprises to take the gamble of letting either of you leave here alive would be quite ludicrous it is out of the question as for my being bothered by the police i shall be delighted to receive them if they come those of my koreans who can speak wont do so nor will the mouths of my electric furnaces which will have vaporized you both and all your belongings at two thousand degrees centigrade no mr bond make your choice perhaps i can encourage you there came the noise of a lever moving across iron teeth the saw is now approaching your body at about an inch every minute meanwhile he glanced at odd job and held up one finger a little massage from oddjob to begin with only grade one grades two and three are still more persuasive bond closed his eyes the sickly zoosmell of oddjob enveloped him big rasping fingers set to work on him carefully delicately a pressure here combined with a pressure there a sudden squeeze a pause and then a quick sharp blow always the hard hands were surgically accurate bond ground his teeth until he thought they would break the sweat of pain began to form pools in the sockets of his closed eyes the shrill whine of the saw was getting louder it reminded bond of the sawdustscented sounds of long ago summer evenings at home in england home this was his home this cocoon of danger he had chosen to live in and here he would be buried in some corner of a foreign blast furnace that is for ever two thousand degrees centigrade god rest ye merry gentlemen of the secret service what should he give himself as an epitaph what should be his famous last words that you have no choice about your birth but you can choose the way you die yes it would look well on a tombstone not savoir vivre but savoir mourir mr bond goldfingers voice held an ounce of urgency is this really necessary just tell me the truth who are you who sent you here what do you know then it will be so easy you shall both have a pill there will be no pain it will be like taking a sleeping draught otherwise it will be so messy so messy and distressing and are you being fair to the girl is this the behaviour of an english gentleman oddjobs torment had stopped bond turned his head slowly towards the voice and opened his eyes he said goldfinger there is nothing more to tell because there is nothing if you will not accept my first bargain i will make you another the girl and i will work for you how about that we are capable people you could put us to good use and get a knife two knives in my back thank you no mr bond bond decided it was time to stop talking it was time to start winding up the mainspring of willpower that must not run down again until he was dead bond said politely then you can go and yourself he expelled all the breath from his lungs and closed his eyes even i am not capable of that mr bond said goldfinger with good humour and now since you have chosen the stony path instead of the smooth i must extract what interest i can from your predicament by making the path as stony as possible oddjob grade two the lever on the table moved across iron teeth now bond could feel the wind of the saw between his knees the hands came back bond counted the slowly pounding pulse that utterly possessed his body it was like the huge panting power plant in the other part of the factory but in his case it was slowly decelerating if only it would slow down quicker what was this ridiculous will to live that refused to listen to the brain who was making the engine run on although the tank was dry of fuel but he must empty his mind of thought as well as his body of oxygen he must become a vacuum a deep hole of unconsciousness still the light burned red through his eyelids still he could feel the bursting pressure in his temples still the slow drum of life beat in his ears a scream tried to force its way through the clamped teeth die damn you die die damn you die damn you die damn you die damn you die chapter sixteen the last and the biggest the wings of a dove the heavenly choir hark the herald angels sing what else ought he to remember about paradise it was all so exactly like what he had been told in the nursery this sensation of flying the darkness the drone of the million harps he really must try and remember the dope about the place lets see now one got to the pearly gates a deep fatherly voice said almost in his ear this is your captain speaking we are coming in to land now will you please fasten your seat belts and extinguish your cigarettes thank you there must be a whole lot of them going up together would tilly be on the same trip bond squirmed with embarrassment how would he introduce her to the others to vesper for instance and when it came to the point which would he like the best but perhaps it would be a big place with countries and towns there was probably no more reason why he should run into one of his former girl friends here than there had been on earth but still there were a lot of people hed better avoid until he got settled in and found out the form perhaps with so much love about these things wouldnt matter perhaps one just loved all the girls one met hm tricky business with these unworthy thoughts in his mind bond relapsed into unconsciousness the next tiling he knew was a gentle sensation of swaying he opened his eyes the sun blinded them he closed them again a voice above and behind his head said watch it bud that ramps steeper than it looks almost immediately there was a heavy jolt a surly voice in front said cheesus youre telling me why in hell cant they put down rubber bond thought angrily thats a fine way to talk up here just because im new and they think no ones listening there was the bang of a swing door something hit bond sharply on a protruding elbow he shouted hey and tried to reach his elbow and rub it but his hands wouldnt move whaddya know hey sam better call the doc this ones come round sure here put him alongside the other bond felt himself being lowered it was cooler now he opened his eyes a big round brooklyn face was bent over his the eyes met his and smiled the metal supports of the stretcher touched the ground the man said how ya feelin mister where am i now there was panic in bonds voice he tried to rise but couldnt he felt the sweat break out on his body god was this still part of the old life at the thought of it a wave of grief poured through his body tears burned his eyes and trickled down his cheeks hey hey take it easy mister youre okay this is idlewild new york youre in america now no more troubles see the man straightened up he thought bond was a refugee from somewhere sam get movin this guys in shock okay okay the two voices receded mumbling anxiously bond found he could move his head he looked round he was in a whitepainted ward presumably something to do with the health department of the airport there was a row of tidy beds sun poured down from high windows but it was cool airconditioned he was on a stretcher on the floor there was another one next to it he strained his head sideways it was tilly she was unconscious her pale face framed in black hair pointed at the ceiling the door at the end of the ward sighed open a doctor in a white coat stood and held it goldfinger looking brisk cheerful walked swiftly down between the beds he was followed by oddjob bond wearily closed his eyes christ so that was the score feet gathered round his stretcher goldfinger said breezily well they certainly look in good shape eh doctor thats one of the blessings of having enough money when ones friends or ones staff are ill one can get them the very best medical attention nervous breakdowns both of them and in the same week would you believe it but i blame myself for working them both too hard now its my duty to get them back on their feet again dr foch hes the best man in geneva by the way was quite definite he said they need rest mr goldfinger rest rest and again rest he gave them sedatives and now theyre on their way to the harkness pavilion at the presbyterian goldfinger chuckled fatly sow and you shall reap eh doctor when i gave the harkness a million dollars worth of xray equipment i certainly never expected anything back but now i only had to put through a call and theyve got two fine rooms waiting for them now then there was a rustle of notes thank you for all your help with immigration fortunately they both had valid visas and i think immigration was satisfied that mr auric goldfinger was a sufficient guarantee that neither of them wants to overthrow the united states government by force what yes indeed and thank you mr goldfinger anything i can do i understand you have a private ambulance waiting outside bond opened his eyes and looked at where the doctors voice came from he saw a pleasant serious young man with rimless glasses and a crewcut bond said quietly and with desperate sincerity doctor there is absolutely nothing wrong with me or this girl we have been drugged and brought here against our will neither of us works or has ever worked for goldfinger i am warning you that we have been kidnapped i demand to see the chief of immigration i have friends in washington and new york they will vouch for me i beg of you to believe me bond held the mans eyes in his willing him to believe the doctor looked worried he turned to goldfinger goldfinger shook his head discreetly so that bond would not be insulted a surreptitious hand went up and tapped the side of his head away from bond goldfinger raised helpless eyebrows you see what i mean doctor its been like this for days total nervous prostration combined with persecution mania dr foch said they often go together it may need weeks at the harkness but im going to pull him round if its the last thing i do its the shock of these unfamiliar surroundings perhaps a shot of intraval sodium the doctor bent to his black bag i guess youre right mr goldfinger so long as harkness is looking after the case there came the tinkle of instruments goldfinger said its terribly sad to see a man break down so utterly a man who has been one of my best assistants he bent a sweet fatherly smile on bond there was a catch in his voice youll be all right james just relax and have a nice sleep i was afraid the flight might be too much for you just relax and leave everything to me bond felt the swab on his arm he heaved against his will a shower of curses poured from his lips then he felt the needle and opened his mouth and screamed and screamed while the doctor knelt beside him and delicately patiently wiped away the sweat from his forehead now it was a grey painted box of a room there were no windows light came from a single lamp inset in the centre of the ceiling round the lamp were concentric slits in the plaster and there was the neutral smell and faint hum of airconditioning bond found he could sit up he did so he felt drowsy but well he suddenly realized that he was ravenously hungry and thirsty when had he last had a meal two three days ago he put his feet down on the floor he was naked he examined his body oddjob had been careful there was no sign of damage save for the group of needlemarks on his right forearm he got up conquering dizziness and took a few steps in the room he had been lying on a ships type bunk with drawers under it the only other furniture in the room was a plain deal table and an upright wooden chair everything was clean functional spartan bond knelt to die drawers under the bunk and opened them they contained all the contents of his suitcase except his watch and the gun even the rather heavy shoes he had been wearing on his expedition to entreprises auric were there he twisted one of the heels and pulled the broad doublesided knife slid smoothly out of its scabbard in the sole with the fingers wrapped round the locked heel it made a workmanlike stabbing dagger bond verified that the other shoe held its knife and clicked the heels back into position he pulled ouj some clothes and put them on he found his cigarette case and lighter and lit a cigarette there were two doors of which one had a handle he opened this one it led into a small wellappointed bathroom and lavatory his washing and shaving things were neatly laid out there were a girls things beside them bond softly opened the other door into the bathroom it was a similar room to his own tilly mastertons black hair showed on the pillow of the bunk bond tiptoed over and looked down she was sleeping peace fully a halfsmile on the beautiful mouth bond went back into the bathroom softly closed the door and went to the mirror over the basin and looked at himself the black stubble looked more like three days than two he set to work to clean himself up half an hour later bond was sitting on the edge of his bunk thinking when the door without a handle opened abruptly oddjob stood in the entrance he looked incuriously at bond his eyes nickered carefully round the room bond said sharply oddjob i want a lot of food quickly and a bottle of bourbon soda and ice also a carton of chesterfields kingsize and either my own watch or another one as good as mine quick march chopchop and tell goldfinger i want to see him but not until ive had something to eat come on jump to it dont stand there looking inscrutable im hungry oddjob looked redly at bond as if wondering which piece to break he opened his mouth uttered a noise between an angry bark and a belch spat drily on the floor at his feet and stepped back whirling the door shut when the slam should have come the door decelerated abruptly and closed with a soft decisive double click the encounter put bond in good humour for some reason goldfinger had decided against killing him he wanted them alive soon bond would know why he wanted them alive but so long as he did bond intended to stay alive on his own terms those terms included putting oddjob and any other korean firmly in his place which in bonds estimation was rather lower than apes in the mammalian hierarchy by the time an excellent meal together with everything else including his watch bond had asked for had been brought by one of the korean servants bond had learned nothing more about his circumstances except that his room was close to water and not far from a railway bridge assuming his room was in new york it was either on the hudson or the east river the railway was electric and sounded like a subway but bonds new york geography was not good enough to place it his watch had stopped when he asked the time he got no answer bond had eaten all the food on the tray and was smoking and sipping a solid bourbon and soda when the door opened goldfinger came in alone he was wearing a regulation businessmans clothes and looked relaxed and cheerful he closed the door behind him and stood with his back to it he looked searchingly at bond bond smoked and looked politely back goldfinger said good morning mr bond i see you are yourself again i hope you prefer being here to being dead so as to save you the trouble of asking a lot of conventional questions i will tell you where you are and what has happened to you i will then put to you a proposition to which i require an unequivocal reply you are a more reasonable man than most so i need only give you one brief warning do not attempt any dramatics do not attack me with a knife or a fork or that bottle if you do i shall shoot you with this a smallcalibre pistol grew like a black thumb out of goldfingers right fist he put the hand with the gun back in his pocket i very seldom use these things when i have had to i have never needed more than one calibre bullet to kill i shoot at the right eye mr bond and i never miss bond said tont worry im not as accurate as that with a bourbon bottle he hitched up the knee of his trousers and put one leg across the other he sat relaxed go ahead mr bond goldfingers voice was amiable i am an expert in many other materials beside metals and i have a keen appreciation of everything that is one thousand fine as we say of the purest gold in comparison with that degree of purity of value human material is of a very low grade indeed but occasionally one comes across a piece of this stuff that can at least be put to the lower forms of use oddjob is an example of what i mean simple unrefined clay capable of limited exploitation at the last moment my hand hesitated to destroy a utensil with the durability i observed in yourself i may have made a mistake in staying my hand in any case i shall take the fullest steps to protect myself from the consequences of my impulse it was something you said that saved your life you suggested that you and miss masterton would work for me normally i would have no use for either of you but it just happens that i am on the brink of a certain enterprise in which the services of both of you could be of a certain minimal assistance so i took the gamble i gave you both the necessary sedatives your bills were paid and your things fetched from the bergues where miss masterton turned out to be registered under her real name i sent a cable in your name to universal export you had been offered employment in canada you were flying over to explore the prospects you were taking miss masterton as your secretary you would write further details a clumsy cable but it will serve for the short period i require your services and in case you think mr bond that my precautions were inadequate that you will be traced let me tell you that i am no longer in the least interested about your true identity nor the strength and resources of your employers you and miss masterton have utterly disappeared mr bond so have i so have all my staff the airport will refer inquiries to the harkness pavilion at the presbyterian hospital the hospital will never have heard of mr goldfinger nor of his patients the fbi and the cia have no record of me for i have no criminal history no doubt the immigration authorities will have details of my comings and goings over the years but these will not be helpful as for my present whereabouts and yours mr bond we are now in the warehouse of the hispeed trucking corporation a formerly respectable concern which i own through nominees and which has been equipped most thoroughly as the secret headquarters for the enterprise of which i spoke you and miss masterton will be confined to these quarters here you will live and work and possibly though personally i have doubts about miss mastertons inclinations in that respect make love and what will our work consist of mr bond for the first time since bond had known goldfinger the big bland face always empty of expression showed a trace of life a look almost of rapture illuminated the eyes the finely chiselled lips pursed into a thin beatic curve mr bond all my life i have been in love i have been in love with gold i love its colour its brilliance its divine heaviness i love the texture of gold that soft sliminess that i have learnt to gauge so accurately by touch that i can estimate the fineness of a bar to within one carat and i love the warm tang it exudes when i melt it down into a true golden syrup but above all mr bond i love the power that gold alone gives to its owner the magic of controlling energy exacting labour fulfilling ones every wish and whim and when need be purchasing bodies minds even souls yes mr bond i have worked all my life for gold and in return gold has worked for me and for those enterprises that i have espoused i ask you goldfinger gazed earnestly at bond is there any other substance on earth that so rewards its owner many people have become rich and powerful without possessing an ounce of the stuff but i see your point how much have you managed to collect and what do you do with it i own about twenty million pounds worth about as much as a small country it is now all in new york i keep it where i need it my treasure of gold is like a compost heap i move it here and there over the face of the earth and wherever i choose to spread it that corner blossoms and blooms i reap the harvest and move on at this moment i am proposing to encourage to force a certain american enterprise with my golden compost therefore the gold bars are in new york how do you choose these enterprises what attracts you to them i espouse any enterprise that will increase my stock of gold i invest i smuggle i steal goldfinger made a small gesture of the hands opening the palms persuasively if you will follow the simile regard history as a train speeding along through time birds and animals are disturbed by the noise and tumult of the trains passage they fly away from it or run fearfully or cower thinking they hide i am like the hawk that follows the train you have no doubt seen them doing this in greece for instance ready to pounce on anything that may be flushed by the trains passage by the passage of history to give you a simple example the progress of history produces a man who invents penicillin at die same time history creates a world war many people are dying or afraid of dying penicillin will save them through bribery at certain military establishments on the continent i obtain stocks of penicillin i water these down with some harmless powder or liquid and sell them at immense profit to those who crave the stuff you see what i mean mr bond you have to wait for the prey watch it carefully and then pounce but as i say i do not search out such enterprises i afiow the train of history to flush them towards me whats the latest one what have miss masterton and i got to do with it the latest oney mr bond is the last one it is also the biggest goldfingers eyes were now blank focused inwards his voice became low almost reverential at what he saw man has climbed everest and he has scraped the depths of the ocean he has fired rockets into outer space and split the atom he has invented devised created in every realm of human endeavour and everywhere he has triumphed broken records achieved miracles i said in every realm but there is one that has been neglected mr bond that one is the human activity loosely known as crime the socalled criminal exploits committed by individual humans i do not of course refer to their idiotic wars their clumsy destruction of each other are of miserable dimensions little bank robberies tiny swindles picayune forgeries and yet ready to hand a few hundred miles from here opportunity for the greatest crime in history stands waiting the stage is set the gigantic prize is offered only the actors are missing but the producer is at last here mr bond goldfinger raised a finger and tapped his chest and he has chosen his cast this very afternoon the script will be read to the leading actors then rehearsals will begin and in one week the curtain will go up for the single the unique performance and then will come the applause the applause for the greatest extralegal coup of all time and mr bond the world will rock with that applause for centuries now a dull fire burned in goldfingers big pale eyes and there was a touch of extra colour in his redbrown cheeks but it was still calm relaxed profoundly convinced theres no trace here reflected bond of the madman the visionary goldfinger had some fantastic exploit in mind but he had gauged the odds and knew they were right bond said well come on what is it and what do we have to do about it it is a robbery mr bond a robbery against no opposition but one that will need detailed execution there will be much paperwork many administrative details to supervise i was going to do this myself until you offered your services now you will do it with miss masterton as your secretary you have already been partly remunerated for this work with your life when the operation is successfully completed you will receive one million pounds in gold miss masterton will receive half a million bond said enthusiastically now youre talking what are we going to do rob the end of the rainbow yes goldfinger nodded that is exactly what we are going to do we are going to burgle fifteen billion dollars worth of gold bullion approximately half the supply of mined gold in the world we are going mr bond to take fort rnox chapter seventeen hoods congress fort knox bond shook his head seriously isnt that rather a tall order for two men and a girl goldfinger shrugged impatiently please put away your sense of humour for one week mr bond then laugh as much as you please i shall have under my command approximately one hundred men and women these people will be hand picked from the six most powerful gangster groups in the united states this force will amount to the toughest and most compact fighting unit that has ever been assembled in peace time all right how many men guard the vault at fort knox goldfinger slowly shook his head he knocked once on the door behind him the door flicked open oddjob stood on the threshold crouching alert when he saw that the meeting was still peaceful he straightened himself and waited goldfinger said you will have many questions to ask mr bond they will all be answered this afternoon beginning at twothirty it is now exactly twelve oclock bond glanced at his watch and adjusted it you and miss masterton will attend the meeting at which the proposition will be put to the heads of the six organizations i have mentioned no doubt these people will ask the same questions as occur to you everything will be explained afterwards you will settle down to detailed work with miss masterton ask for what you want oddjob will see to your welfare and also be on permanent guard do not be obstreperous or you will in stantly be killed and do not waste time trying to escape or to contact the outside world i have hired your services and i shall require every ounce of them is that a bargain bond said drily ive always wanted to be a millionaire goldfinger didnt look at him he looked at his fingernails then he gave bond one last hard glance and went out and shut the door behind him bond sat and gazed at the closed door he brusquely ran both hands through his hair and down over his face he said well well aloud to the empty room got up and walked through the bathroom to the girls bedroom he knocked on the door who is it me are you visible yes the voice was unenthusiastic come in she was sitting on the edge of the bed pulling on a shoe she was wearing the things bond had first seen her in she looked cool and collected and unsurprised by her surroundings she looked up at bond her eyes were aloof disdainful she said coldly precisely youve got us into this get us out bond said amiably i may be able to i got us out of our graves after getting us into them bond looked thoughtfully at the girl he decided it would be ungallant to spank her so to speak on an empty stomach he said this wont get us anywhere were in this together whether we like it or not what do you want for breakfast or lunch its a quarter past twelve ive eaten ill order yours and then come back and tell you the score theres only one way out of here and oddjob that korean ape is guarding it now then breakfast or lunch she unbent an inch thank you scrambled eggs and coffee please and toast and marmalade cigarettes no thank you i dont smoke bond went back to his room and knocked on the door it opened an inch bond said all right oddjob im not going to kill you yet the door opened farther oddjobs face was impassive bond gave the order the door closed bond poured himself a bourbon and soda he sat on the edge of the bed and wondered how he was going to get the girl on his side from the beginning she had resented him was that only because of her sister why had goldfinger made that cryptic remark about her inclinations what was there about her that he himself felt something withdrawn inimical she was beautiful physically desirable but there was a cold hard centre to her that bond couldnt understand or define oh well the main thing was to get her to go along otherwise life in prison would be intolerable bond went back into her room he left both doors open so that he could hear she was still sitting on the bed wrapped in a coiled immobility she watched bond carefully bond leaned against the jamb of the door he took a long pull at his whisky he said looking her in the eye youd better know that im from scotland yard the euphemism would serve were after this man goldfinger he doesnt mind he thinks no one can find us for at least a week hes probably right he saved our lives because he wants us to work for him on a crime its big business pretty scatterbrained but theres a lot of planning and paperwork weve got to look after that side can you do shorthand and typing yes her eyes were alight whats the crime bond told her he said of course it all sounds ridiculous and i daresay a few questions and answers will show these gangsters if they dont show goldfinger that the whole things impossible but i dont know goldfingers an extraordinary man from what i know about him he never moves unless the odds are right and i dont think hes mad at least not madder than other kinds of geniuses scientists and so on and theres no doubt hes a genius in his particular field so what are you going to do about it bond lowered his voice he said what are we going to do about it you mean we are going to play along and to the hilt no shirking and no funny business were going to be greedy for the money and were going to give him absolutely topnotch service apart from saving our lives which mean less than nothing to him its the only hope we or rather i because thats my line of country can have of a chance to queer his pitch how are you going to do that i havent the faintest idea something may turn up and you expect me to go along with you why not any other suggestions she pursed her lips obstinately why should i do what you say bond sighed theres no point in being a suffragette about this its either that or get yourself killed after breakfast its up to you the mouth turned down with distaste she shrugged her shoulders she said ungraciously oh all right then suddenly her eyes flared only dont ever touch me or i shall kill you there came the click of bonds bedroom door bond looked mildly down at tilly masterton the challenge is attractive but dont worry i wont take it up he turned and strolled out of the room one of the koreans passed him carrying the girls breakfast in his room another korean had brought in a typists desk and chair and a remington portable he arranged them in the corner away from the bed oddjob was standing in the doorway he held out a sheet of paper bond went up to him and took it it was a foolscap memo sheet the writing with a ball point was neat careful legible undistinguished it said prepare ten copies of this agenda meeting held under the chairmanship of mr gold secretaries j bond miss tilly masterton present helmut m springer the purple gang detroit jed midnight shadow syndicate miami and havana billy ring the machine chicago jack strap the spangled mob las vegas mr solo unione siciliano miss pussy galore the cement mixers har lem new york city agenda a project with the code name operation grand slam at the end of this was written you and miss masterton will be fetched at both will be prepared to take notes formal dress please bond smiled the koreans left the room he sat down at the desk slipped paper and carbons into the typewriter and set to at least he would show the girl that he was prepared to do his stint gosh what a crew even the mafia had come in how had goldfinger persuaded them all to come and who in heavens name was miss pussy galore bond had the copies finished by two oclock he went into the girls room and gave them to her together with a shorthand notebook and pencils he also read her goldfingers note he said youd better get these names in your head they probably wont be hard to identify we can ask if we get stuck ill go and get into my formal dress he smiled at her twenty minutes to go she nodded walking down the corridor behind oddjob bond could hear the sounds of the river the slapping of water on the piles below the warehouse the long mournful hoot of a ferry clearing her way the distant thump of diesels somewhere beneath his feet a truck started up revved and then growled away presumably towards the west side highway they must be on the top tier of the long twotiered building the grey paint in the corridor smelled new there were no side doors light came from bowls in the ceiling they reached the end oddjob knocked there was the sound of a yale key being turned and two lots of bolts being pulled and they walked through and into a large bright sunlit room the room was over the end of the warehouse and a wide picture window filling most of the facing wall framed the river and the distant brown muddle of jersey city the room had been dressed for the conference goldfinger sat with his back to the window at a large round table with a green baize cloth carafes of water yellow scratchpads and pencils there were nine comfortable armchairs and on the scratchpads in front of six of them were small oblong white parcels sealed with red wax to the right against the wall was a long buffet table gleaming with silver and cut glass champagne stood in silver coolers and there was a row of other bottles among the various foods bond noticed two round fivepound tins of beluga caviar and several terrines of foie gras on the wall opposite the buffet hung a blackboard above a table on which there were papers and one large oblong carton goldfinger watched them come towards him across the thick winered carpet he gestured to the chair on his left for tilly masterton and to the one on the right for bond they sat down the agenda goldfinger took the copies read the top one and handed them back to the girl he gave a circular wave of the hand and she got up and distributed the copies round the table he put his hand beneath the table and pressed a hidden bell the door at the back of the room opened one of the koreans came in and stood waiting is everything ready the man nodded you understand that no one is to come into this room but the people on your list good some of them perhaps all will bring a companion the companions will remain in the anteroom see that they have everything they wish the cards are there and the dice oddjob goldfinger glanced up at the korean who had remained behind bonds chair go and take up your position what is the signal oddjob held up two fingers right two rings on the bell you may go see that all the staff carry out their duties to perfection bond said casually how many staff have you got twenty ten koreans and ten germans they are all excellent men hand picked much goes on in this building it is like belowdecks in a manofwar goldfinger laid his hands flat on the table in front of him and now your duties miss masterton you will take notes of any practical points that arise anything that is likely to require action by me do not bother with the argument and chatter right bond was glad to see that tilly masterton now looked bright and businesslike she nodded briskly certainly and mr bond i shall be interested in any reactions you may have to the speakers i know a great deal about all these people in their own territories they are paramount chiefs they are only here because i have bribed them to come they know nothing of me and i need to persuade them that i know what i am talking about and will lead them to success greed will do the rest but there may be one or more who wish to back out they will probably reveal themselves in their cases i have made special arrangements but there may be doubtful ones during the talk you will scribble with your pencil on this agenda casually you will note with a plus or a minus sign opposite the names whether you consider each one for or against the project i shall be able to see what sign you have made your views may be useful and do not forget mr bond that one traitor among them one backslider and we could quickly find ourselves either dead or in prison for life who is this pussy galore from harlem she is the only woman who runs a gang in america it is a gang of women i shall need some women for this operation she is entirely reliable she was a trapeze artiste she had a team it was called pussy galore and her abrocats goldfinger did not smile die team was unsuccessful so she trained them as burglars cat burglars it grew into a gang of outstanding ruthlessness it is a lesbian organization which now calls itself the cement mixers even the big american gangs respect them she is a remarkable woman a buzzer sounded very softly beneath the table goldfinger straightened himself the door at the end of the room opened briskly and five men came in goldfinger rose in his chair and ducked his head in welcome he said my name is gold will you please be seated there was a careful murmur silently the men closed round the table pulled out chairs and sat down five pairs of eyes looked coldly warily at goldfinger goldfinger sat down he said quietly gentlemen in the parcels before you you will find one twentyfourcarat gold bar value fifteen thousand dollars i thank you for the courtesy of your attendance the agenda is selfexplanatory perhaps while we wait for miss galore i could run through your names for the information of my secretaries mr bond here and miss masterton no notes will be made of this meeting except on action you may wish me to take and i can assure you there are no microphones now then mr bond on your right is mr jed midnight of the shadow syndicate operating out of miami and havana mr midnight was a big goodliving man with a jovial face but slow careful eyes he wore a light blue tropical suit over a white silk shirt ornamented with small green palm trees the complicated gold watch on his wrist must have weighed nearly half a pound he smiled tautly at bond and said howdo then we have mr billy ring who controls the famous chicago machine bond thought he had never seen anyone who was less of a billy it was a face out of a nightmare and as the face turned towards bond it knew it was and watched bond for his reactions it was a pale pearshaped baby face with downy skin and a soft thatch of strawcoloured hair but the eyes which should have been pale blue were a tawny brown the whites showed all round the pupils and gave a mesmeric quality to the hard thoughtful stare unsoftened by a tic in the right eyelid which made the right eye wink with the heartbeat at some early stage in mr rings career someone had cut off mr rings lower lip perhaps he had talked too much and this had given him a permanent false smile like the grin of a halloween pumpkin he was about forty years old bond summed him up as a merciless killer bond smiled cheerfully into the hard stare of mr rings left eye and looked past him at the man goldfinger introduced as mr helmut springer of the detroit purple gang mr springer had the glazed eyes of someone who is either very rich or very dead the eyes were pale blue opaque glass marbles which briefly recognized bond and then turned inwards again in complete absorption with self the rest of mr springer was a man of distinction casually pinstriped hathawayshirted aquavelvad he gave the impression of someone who found himself in the wrong company a firstclass ticket holder in a thirdclass compartment a man from the stalls who has been shown by mistake to a seat in the pit mr midnight put his hand up to his mouth and said softly for bonds benefit dont be taken in by the duke my friend helmut was the man who put the piqued shirt on the hood daughter goes to vassar but its protection money that pays for her hockeysticks bond nodded his thanks and mr solo of the unione siciliano mr solo had a dark heavy face gloomy with the knowledge of much guilt and many sins his thick homrimmed spectacles helioed briefly in bonds direction and then bent again to the business of cleaning mr solos nails with a pocket knife he was a big chunky man half boxer half head waiter and it was quite impossible to tell what was on his mind or where his strength lay but there is only one head of the mafia in america andif mr solo had the job thought bond he had got it by strength out of terror it would be by the exercise of both that he kept it howdy mr jack strap of the spangled mob had the synthetic charm of a front man for the las vegas casinos but bond guessed he had inherited from the late lamented brothers spang thanks to other qualities he was an expansive showily dressed man of about fifty he was coming to the end of a cigar he smoked it as if he was eating it munching hungrily from time to time he turned his head sideways and discreetly spat a scrap of it out on to the carpet behind him behind this compulsive smoking there would be a lot of tension mr strap had quick conjurors eyes he seemed to know that his eyes frightened people because now presumably not wanting to frighten bond he gave them charm by crinkling them at the corners the door at the back of the room opened a woman in a black masculinecut suit with a high coffeecoloured lace jabot stood in the doorway she walked slowly unselfconsciously down the room and stood behind the empty chair goldfinger had got to his feet she examined him carefully and then ran her eyes round the table she said a collective bored hi and sat down mr strap said hi pussy and the others except mr springer who merely bowed made careful sounds of welcome goldfinger said good afternoon miss galore we have just been through the formality of introductions the agenda is before you together with the fifteenthousanddollar gold bar i asked you to accept to meet the expense and inconvenience of attending this meeting miss galore reached for her parcel and opened it she weighed the gleaming yellow brick in her hand she gave goldfinger a direct suspicious look all the way through all the way through miss galore held his eyes she said pardon my asking with the curt tone of a hard woman shopper at the sales bond liked the look of her he felt the sexual challenge all beautiful lesbians have for men he was amused by the uncompromising attitude that said to goldfinger and to the room all men are bastards and cheats dont try any masculine hocus on me i dont go for it im in a separate league bond thought she would be in her early thirties she had pale rupert brooke good looks with high cheekbones and a beautiful jawline she had the only violet eyes bond had ever seen they were the true deep violet of a pansy and they looked candidly out at the world from beneath straight black brows her hair which was as black as tilly mastertons was worn in an untidy urchin cut the mouth was a decisive slash of deep vermilion bond thought she was superb and so he noticed did tilly masterton who was gazing at miss galore with worshipping eyes and lips that yearned bond decided that all was now clear to him about tilly masterton goldfinger said and now i must introduce myself my name is not gold my credentials are as follows by various operations most of them illegitimate i have made a large sum of money in twenty years that sum now stands at sixty million dollars my operations have for the most part been confined to europe but you may be interested to know that i founded and subsequently disposed of the golden poppy distributors who operated out of hongkong the happy landings travel agency which some of you may have employed in emergency was organized and owned by me until i disbanded it i mention these minor concerns to show you that although you may not know me i have in the past acted at many removes on i believe all your behalfs that gentlemen and er madam is how i knew of you and how i came to invite here tonight what i have learned through my own experience to be the aristocracy if i may so describe it of american crime bond was impressed goldfinger had in three minutes flat got the meeting on his side now everyone was looking towards goldfinger with profound attention even miss pussy galores eyes were rapt bond knew nothing about the golden poppy distributors or the happy landings agency but they must have run like clockwork from the expressions on their former customers faces now everyone was hanging on goldfingers words as if he was einstein goldfingers face showed no emotion he made a throwaway gesture of his right hand he said flatly i have mentioned two projects of mine that were successful they were small there have been many others of a higher calibre not one of them has failed and so far as i know my name is on the police files of no country i say this to show you that i thoroughly understand my our profession and now gentlemen and madam i propose to offer you partnership in an undertaking that will assuredly place in each of your treasuries within one week the sum of one billion dollars mr goldfinger held up his hand we have different views in europe and america as to what constitutes the arithmetical expression a billion i use the word in the sense of one thousand million do i make myself clear chapter eighteen crime de la crime a tug hooted on the river another answered a flurry of engine noises receded mr jed midnight on bonds right cleared his throat he said emphatically mister gold or whatever your name is dont you worry about definitions a billion dollars is a lot of money whichever way you say it keep talking mr solo raised slow black eyes and looked across the table at goldfinger he said is very moch money yess but how moch your cut mister five billion jack strap from las vegas gave a short boisterous laugh listen fellers whats a few billion between friends if mister er whoosis can lead me to a billion dollars ill be glad to slip him a fin or even maybe a megafin for his trouble dont lets be smallminded about this huh mr helmut springer tapped his monocle on the gold brick in front of him everyone looked towards him mister ah gold it was the grave voice of the family lawyer these are big figures you mention as i understand it a total of some eleven billion dollars is involved mr goldfinger said with precision the exact figure will be nearer fifteen billion for convenience i referred only to the amounts i thought it would be possible for us to carry away a sharp excited giggle came from mr billy ring quite quite mr gold mr springer screwed his monocle back into his eye to observe goldfingers reactions but quantities of bullion or currency to that amount are to be found gathered together in only three depositories in the united states they are the federal mint in washington the federal reserve bank in new york city and fort knox in kentucky do you intend that we should er knock off one of these and if so which fort knox amidst the chorus of groans mr midnight said resignedly mister i never met any guy outside hollywood that had what youve got there ifscalled vision and vision mister is a talent for mistaking spots before the eyes for fabulous projects you should have a talk with your headshrinker or get yourself miltownized mr midnight shook his head sorrowfully too bad that billion sure felt good while i had it miss pussy galore said in a deep bored voice sorry mister none of my set of bent pins could take that kind of piggybank she made to get up goldfinger said amiably now hear me through gentlemen and er madam your reaction was not unexpected let me put it this way fort knox is a bank like any other bank but it is a much bigger bank and its protective devices are correspondingly stronger and more ingenious to penetrate them will require corresponding strength and ingenuity that is the only novelty in my project that it is a big one nothing else fort knox is no more impregnable than other fortresses no doubt we all thought the brink organization was unbeatable until half a dozen determined men robbed a brinkarmoured car of a million dollars back in it is impossible to escape from sing sing and yet men have found ways of escaping from it no no gentlemen fort knox is a myth like other myths shall i proceed to the plan billy ring hissed through his teeth like a japanese when he talked he said harshly listen shamus mebbe ya didnt know it but the third armoured is located at fort knox if thats a myth why dont the russkis come and take the united states the next time they have a team over here playing icehockey goldfinger smiled thinly if i may correct you without weakening your case mr ring the following is the order of battle of the military units presently quartered at fort knox of the third armoured division there is only the spearhead but there are also the th armoured cavalry regiment the th armour group the th engineer group and approximately half a division from all units of the united states army currently going through the armoured replacement training centre and military human research unit no there is also a considerable body of men associated with continental armoured command board no the army maintenance board and various activities connected with the armoured centre in addition there is a police force consisting of twenty officers and some four hundred enlisted men in short out of a total population of some sixty thousand approximately twenty thousand are combat troops of one sort or another and whos going to say boo to them jeered mr jack strap through his cigar without waiting for an answer he disgustedly tore the tattered stump out of his mouth and mashed it to fragments in the ashtray next to him miss pussy galore sucked her teeth sharply with the incisiveness of a parrot spitting she said go buy yourself some better smokes jacko that thing smells like burning wrestlers trunks shove it puss said mr strap inelegantly miss galore was determined to have the last word she said sweetly know what jacko i could go for a heman like you matter of fact i wrote a song about you the other day care to hear its title its called if i had to do it all over again id do it all over you a bray of laughter came from mr midnight a high giggle from mr ring goldfinger tapped lightly for order he said patiently now hear me through please gentlemen he got up and walked to the blackboard and pulled a roll map down over it it was a detailed town map of fort knox including the godman army airfield and the roads and railway tracks leading into the town the committee members on the right of the table swivelled their chairs goldfinger pointed to the bullion depository it was down on the lefthand corner en closed in a triangle formed by the dixie highway bullion boulevard and vine grove road goldfinger said i will show you a detailed plan of the depository in just a moment he paused now gentlemen allow me to point out the main features of this fairly straightforward township here he ran his finger from the top centre of the map down through the town and out beyond the bullion depository runs the line of the illinois central railroad from louisville thirtyfive miles to the north through the town and on to elizabethtown eighteen miles to the south we are not concerned with brandenburg station in the centre of the town but with this complex of sidings adjoining the bullion vault that is one of the loading and unloading bays for the bullion from the mint in washington other methods of transport to the vault which are varied in no particular rotation for security reasons are by truck convoy down the dixie highway or by freight plane to godman airfield as you can see the vault is isolated from these routes and stands alone without any natural cover whatsoever in the centre of approximately fifty acres of grassland only one road leads to the vault a fiftyyard driveway through heavily armed gates on bullion boulevard once inside the armoured stockade the trucks proceed on to this circular road which runs round the vault to the rear entrance where the bullion is unloaded that circular road gentlemen is manufactured out of steel plates or flaps these plates are on hinges and in an emergency the entire steel surface of the road can be raised hydraulically to create a second internal stockade of steel not so obvious to the eye but known to me is that an underground delivery tunnel runs below the plain between bullion boulevard and vine grove road this serves as an additional means of access to the vault through steel doors that lead from the wall of the tunnel to the first subground floor of the depository goldfinger paused and stood away from the map he looked round the table all right gentlemen there is the vault and those are the main approaches to it with the exception of its front door which is purely an entrance to the reception hall and offices any questions there were none all eyes were on goldfinger waiting once again the authority of his words had gripped them this man seemed to know more about the secrets of fort knox than had ever been released to the outside world goldfinger turned back to the blackboard and pulled down a second map over the first this was the detailed plan of the gold vault goldfinger said well gentlemen you can see that this is an immensely solid twostorey building somewhat like a square twolayered cake you will notice that the roof has been stepped for bomb protection and you will observe the four pill boxes on the ground at the four corners these are of steel and are connected with the interior of the building the exterior dimensions of the vault are a hundred and five by a hundred and twentyone feet the height from ground level is fortytwo feet the construction is of tennessee granite steellined the exact constituents are sixteen thousand cubic feet of granite four thousand cubic yards of concrete seven hundred and fifty tons of reinforcing steel and seven hundred and sixty tons of structural steel right now within the building there is a twostorey steel and concrete vault divided into compartments the vault door weighs more than twenty tons and the casing of the vault is of steel plates steel ibeams and steel cylinders laced with hoopbands and encased in concrete the roof is of similar construction and is independent of the roof of the building a corridor encircles the vault at both levels and gives access both to the vault and to the offices and storerooms that are housed in the outer wall of the building no one person is entrusted with the combination to the door of the vault various senior members of the depository staff must separately dial combinations known only to each of them naturally thebuilding is equipped with the latest and finest protective devices there is a strong guardpost within the building and immensely powerful reinforcements are at all times available from the armoured centre less than a mile distant do you follow me now as to the actual content of the vault these amount as i said earlier to some fifteen billion dollars worth of standard mint bars one thousand fine each bar is double the size of the one before you and contains four hundred troy ounces the avoirdupois weight being some twentyseven and a half pounds these are stored without wrappings in the compartments of the vault goldfinger glanced round the table and that gentlemen and madam he concluded flatly is all i can tell you and all i think we need to know about the nature and contents of fort knox depository unless there are any questions at this stage i will proceed to a brief explanation of how this depository may be penetrated and its contents seized there was siknce the eyes round the table were rapt intent nervously mr jack strap took a mediumsized cigar out of his vest pocket and stuffed it in the corner of his mouth pussy galore said sternly if you set fire to that thing i swear ill kayo you with my gold brick she took a threatening hold of the bar take it easy kid said mr strap out of the corner of his mouth mr jed midnight commented decisively mister if you can heist that joint you got yourself a summum cum laude go ahead and tell this is either a bust or the crime de la crime goldfinger said indifferently very well gentlemen you shall hear the plan he paused and looked carefully round the table and into each pair of eyes in turn but i hope you understand that total security must now prevail what i have said so far if repeated would be taken for the maunderings of a lunatic what i am about to say will involve all of us in the greatest peacetime conspiracy in the history of the united states may i take it that we are all bound by an oath of absolute secrecy almost instinctively bond watched the eyes of mr helmut springer from detroit while affirmatives in various tones of voice came from the others mr springer veiled his eyes his portentous you have my solemn word rang hollow to bond the candour was as false as a secondhand motor salesmans casually he drew a short straight minus line beside mr springers name on the agenda very well then goldfinger returned to his seat at the table he sat down picked up his pencil and began talking to it in a thoughtful conversational voice first and in some ways most difficult is the question of disposal one billion dollars of gold bullion weighs approximately one thousand tons to transport this amount would require one hundred tenton trucks or some twenty sixwheel heavy industry road transporters i recommend the latter vehicles i have a list of the charter companies who hire out this type of vehicle and i recommend that if we are to be partners you should proceed immediately after this meeting to contracting with the relevant companies in your territories for obvious reasons you will all wish to engage your own drivers and this i must leave in your hands no doubt mr goldfinger allowed himself the ghost of a smile the teamsters union will prove a fruitful source for reliable men and you will perhaps consider recruiting exdrivers from the negro red ball express that served the american armies during the war however these are details requiring exact planning and coordination there will also be a traffic control problem and no doubt you will make arrangements among yourselves for sharing out the available roads transport aircraft will be a subsidiary source of mobility and arrangements will be made to keep open the northsouth runway on the godman airfield your subsequent disposal of the bullion will of course be your own affair for my part goldfinger looked coolly round the table i shall initially be using the railroad and since i have a bulkier transport problem i trust you will allow me to reserve this means of egress for my own goldfinger did not wait for comment he continued in an even tone compared with this problem of transport the other arrangements will be relatively simple to begin with on d propose to put the entire population military and civilian of fort knox temporarily out of action exact arrangements have been made and only await my signal briefly the town is supplied with all drinking and other watersupplies by two wells and two filter plants yielding just under seven million gallons per day these are under the control of the post engineer this gentleman has been pleased to accept a visit from the superintendent and deputy superintendent of the tokyo municipal waterworks who wish to study the workings of a plant of this size for installation in a new suburb planned for the environs of tokyo the post engineer has been much flattered by this request and the japanese gentlemen will be accorded all facilities these two gentlemen who are of course members of my staff will be carrying on their persons relatively small quantities of a highly concentrated opiate devised by the german chemical warfare experts for just this purpose during the last war this substance disseminates rapidly through a volume of water of this magnitude and in its consequent highly diluted form has the effect of instant but temporary narcosis of any person drink ing half a tumbler of the infected water the symptoms are a deep and instant sleep from which the victim awakens much refreshed in approximately three days gentlemen goldfinger held out one hand palm upwards in the month of june in kentucky i consider it out of the question that a single resident is able to go through twentyfour hours without consuming half a glass of water there may perhaps be a handful of confirmed alcoholics on their feet on dday but i anticipate that we shall enter a town in which virtually the entire population has fallen into a deep sleep where they stand what was that fairytale miss galores eyes were shining with the vision puss in boots said mr jack strap in a surly voice go ahead mister this is good how do we get into the town we come in said goldfinger on a special train that will have left new york city on the night of dl there will be approximately one hundred of us and we shall be attired as red cross workers miss galore will i hope provide the necessary contingent of nurses it is to fill this minor but important role that she has been invited to this meeting miss galore said enthusiastically wilco roger over and out my girlsll look sweet in starch whaddya say jacko she leant sideways and nudged mr strap in the ribs i say theyd look better in cement overcoats said mr strap impatiently whaddya have to keep on butting in for keep going mister at louisville thirtyfive miles from fort knox i myself and an assistant will ask to be allowed to ride in the leading diesel we shall have delicate instruments we shall say that it will be necessary for us to sample the air as we approach fort knox for by this time news of the mysterious affliction that has struck down the inhabitants will have reached the outer world and there is likely to be some panic in the surrounding area and indeed in the country as a whole rescue planes may be expected to approach shortly after our arrival at dawn and an early task will be to man the control tower at godman airfield declare the base closed and reroute all planes to louisville but to go back for a moment shortly after leaving louisville my assistant and i will dispose of the driver and fireman by as humane methods as are possible and i shall personally bring the train i may say that i have the requisite knowledge of these locomotives through fort knox to the bullion sidings alongside the depository goldfinger paused he looked wijh slow grave eyes round the circle satisfied with what he saw he continued in the same even tone by this time gentlemen and madam your transport convoys should be arriving the traffic controller will dispose them in the neighbourhood of the depository according to a prearranged plan the airport staff will proceed by truck to godman airfield and take over and we shall enter the depository paying no heed to the sleeping bodies with which the landscape will be er decorated right mr solos dark eyes burned across the table he said softly sure is right so far now mebbe you he blew out his cheeks and gave a quick hard puff towards goldfinger like this and the twentyton door he fall down yes yes said goldfinger equably almost exactly like that he rose and went to the table under the blackboard lifted up the big ungainly carton and carried it carefully back and placed it on the table in front of him it seemed to be very heavy he sat down and continued while ten of my trained assistants are making preparations for the vault to be opened stretcher teams will enter the depository and remove to safety as many of the inmates as can be located bond thought he noticed a treacherous purr underlying goldfingers next words i am sure you will all agree gentlemen and madam that all unnecessary loss of life should be avoided thus far i hope you notice that there have been no casualties with the exception of two employees of the illinois central railroad who have received sore heads goldfinger didnt wait for comment but went on now he reached out and placed his hand on the carton when you gentlemen and your associates have needed weapons other than the conventional small arms where have you found them at military establishments gentlemen you have purchased submachine guns and other heavy equipment from quartermaster storekeepers at nearby military bases you have achieved this by the use of pressure blackmail or money i have done the same only one weapon would be powerful enough to blast open the bullion vault at fort knox and i obtained one after much seeking from a certain allied military base in germany it cost me exactly one million dollars this gentlemen is an atomic warhead designed for use with the corporal intermediate range guided missile cheesus kerist jed midnights hands reached for the edge of the table beside bond and gripped it all the faces round the table were pale bond could feel the skin taut over his own tensed jaw to break his tension he reached inside his coat pocket for the chesterfields and lit one he slowly blew out the flame and put the lighter back in his pocket god almighty what had he got himself into bond looked back down the vista of his knowledge of goldfinger the first meeting with the naked brown body on the roof of the floridiana cabana club the casual way he had rapped goldfingers knuckles the interview with m the meeting at the bank at which ithad been a question of tracking down a gold smuggler admittedly a big one and one who worked for the russians but still only a mansized criminal someone bond had taken trouble to beat at golf and then had pursued coolly efficiently but still as only one more quarry like so many others and now now it was not a rabbit in the rabbit hole not even a fox it was a king cobra the biggest most deadly inhabitant of the world bond sighed wearily once more into the breach dear friends this time it really was st george and the dragon and st george had better get a move on and do something before the dragon hatched the little dragons egg he was now nesting so confidently bond smiled tautly do what what in gods name was there he could do goldfinger held up his hand gentlemen and madam believe me this object is an entirely harmless lump of machinery it is not armed if i hit it with a hammer it would not explode nothing can make it explode until it is armed and that will not happen until the day mr billy rings pale face was shiny with sweat the words trembled slightly as they hissed out through the false grin mister what what about this thing they call er fallout fallout will be minimal mr ring and extremely localized this is the latest model the socalled clean atomic bomb but protection suits will be issued to the squad that first enters the ruins of the building they will form the first in the human chain that will remove the gold and pass it to the waiting trucks flying debris mister chunks of concrete and steel and so forth mr midnights voice came from somewhere in his stomach we shall take shelter behind the outer steel stockade of the depository mr midnight all personnel will wear earplugs there may be minor damage to some of the trucks but that hazard must be accepted da sleeping guys mr solos eyes were greedy mebbe dey jess sleeps a liddle longer mr solo obviously didnt worry too much about the sleeping guys we shall move as many as possible to safety we must i am afraid accept minor damage to the town i estimate that casualties among the population will approximately equal three days toll on the roads of fort knox our operation will merely serve to keep road accident statistics at a steady level damn nice of us mr midnights nerves had now recovered any more questions goldfingers voice was bland he had read out the figures estimated the prospects for the business now it was time to put the meeting to the vote details remain to be worked out exactly in that my staff here he turned first to bond and then to miss masterton will be assisting me this room will be our operations room to which you will all have access by day or by night the code word for the project is operation grand slam which will always be used in referring to the project may i suggest that those of you who wish to participate should brief one and only one of your most trusted lieutenants other staff can be trained for their functions as if this were a runofthemill bank robbery on dl a slightly wider briefing of staff will be necessary i know i can rely on you gentlemen and madam if you decide to participate to treat this whole project as an operation of war inefficiency or insecurity will of course have to be dealt with decisively and now gentlemen and madam i will ask you to reply on behalf of your respective organizations which of you wishes to enter this race the prize is gigantic the risks are minimal mr midnight goldfinger turned his head an inch to die right bond saw the wide open xray gaze devour his neighbour yes there was a pause or no chapter nineteen secret appendix mr gold jed midnight pronounced sonorously you are undoubtedly the greatest thing in crime since cain invented murder and used it on abel he paused and added emphatically i shall count it an honour to be associated with you in this enterprise thank you mr midnight and you mr ring bond was doubtful about mr billy ring he had scrawled plusses against all the names except ring and helmut springer to mr ring he had allotted a nought to springer a minus sign he had come to his conclusions by watching eyes mouths hands but nothing had been betrayed by the grinners unwavering false smile the wink in his right eye had been as steady on the pulsebeat as a metronome and he had kept his hands below the table now billy ring brought his hands up from below the table and formed a cats cradle with them on the green baize in front of him for a moment he watched the two thumbs twirling then he raised his nightmare face to goldfingers the tic in his right eye had stopped the two rows of teeth began to operate like a ventriloquists dummy mister he found difficulty with his bs ms and ps and produced them by bringing his upper lip down over his teeth like a horse does when it takes sugar out of your hand long time now my friends and i been back in legal what i mean the old days of leaving corpses strewn all over the landscape went out with the forties me and my associates we do all right with the girls the hemp and the racetrack and when were short theres our good friends the union to slip us the odd fin ya see mister the grinner opened his hands and then put them back into the cradle we figger the old days are gone big jim colossimo johnny torrio dion obannion al capone where are those guys today huh mister theyre pushing up the morning glory by the fence mebbe you werent around in the days when we used to hide up between fights in little bohemia up behind milwaukee well siree in those days people were shooting at each other so fast youd often need a programme to tell the act from the spectators so all right people got tired of it those that hadnt already got tired to death if you get my meaning and when the fifties come along and i take over the team its unanimous that we get out of the fireworks business and now what mister now you come along and put it to me that me and my friends assist you to let off the biggest fizzbang in history so what do i figger to say to your proposition misterer whoosis well i tell you mister everybodys got his price see and for a billion dollars its a deal well put away the marbles and bring out the slingshots were in grinner you sure take one hell of a long time to say yes commented mr midnight sourly goldfinger said cordially thank you for your most interesting statement mr ring i am very happy to welcome you and your associates mr solo mr solo prefaced his reply by reaching into his coat pocket and taking out a battery shaver he switched it on the room filled with the noise of angry bees mr solo leant his head back and began running the machine thoughtfully up the right side of his face while his uptilted eyes sought decision in the ceiling suddenly he switched the razor off put it down on the table in front of him and jerked his head down and forward like a snake striking the black gunmuzzles of his eyes pointed threateningly across the table at goldfinger and moved slowly from feature to feature of the big moonface half mr solos own face now looked naked the other half was dark with the italian swarthiness that comes from an uncontrollable beard growth bond guessed that he probably had to shave every three or four hours now mr solo decided to speak he spoke in a voice that brought chill into the room he said softly mister i been watching you you are a very relaxed man for someone who speaks such big things last man i knew was so much relaxed he got himself totally relaxed by a quick burst of the chopper okay okay mr solo sat back he spread open palms in reluctant surrender so i come in yes but mister there was a pause for emphasis either we get that billion or you get dead is okay with you goldfingers lips bent ironically thank you mr solo your conditions are quite acceptable i have every wish to stay alive mr helmut springer mr springers eyes looked deader than ever he said pompously i am still giving the matter my full consideration pray consult my colleagues while i deliberate mr midnight commented impatiently same old hell waits for what he calls inspiration hes guided messages from the almighty on the angels wavelength i guess he hasnt heard a human voice in twenty years and mr strap mr jack strap crinkled his eyes at goldfinger he said smoothly mister i figure you know the odds and you surely pay the best since one of our machines at vegas got the trots and gave continuous jackpots i guess if we provide the muscles and the guns this caperll pay off you can count me in mr strap turned off the charm his eyes now frightening again turned with goldfingers to miss pussy galore miss galore veiled her violet eyes so as not to have to look at either of them she said indifferently to the room at large business aint been so brisk in my corner of the woods she tapped with long silverpainted fingernails on the gold bar before her mind you i wont say im overdrawn at the bank lets put it im just a shade underdeposited yup sure ill come in me and my gals got to eat goldfinger allowed himself a halfsmile of sympathy that is excellent news miss galore and now he turned to face across the table mr springer might we ask if you have made up your mind slowly mr springer rose to his feet he gave the controlled yawn of an opera goer he followed the yawn with a small belch he took out a fine linen handkerchief and patted his lips his glazed eyes moved round the table and finally rested on goldfinger slowly his head moved from side to side as if he was trying to exercise fibrositis in his neck muscles he said gravely like a bank manager refusing a loan mr gold i fear your proposal would not find favour with my colleagues in detroit he gave a little bow which included everyone it only remains for me to thank you for a most interesting occasion good afternoon gentlemen and madam in the chilly silence mr springer tucked his handkerchief carefully into the lefthand cuff of his immaculate pinstripe turned and walked softly to the door and let himself out the door closed with a sharp click bond noticed gold fingers hand slip casually below the table he guessed that oddjob was getting his signal signal for what mr midnight said nastily glad hes out hes strictly a fourulcer man now then he got up briskly and turned to bond how about a little drink they all rose and gathered round the buffet bond found himself between miss pussy galore and tilly masterton he offered them champagne miss galore looked at him coldly and said move over handsome us girls want to talk secrets dont we yummy miss masterton blushed and then turned very pale she whispered adoringly oh yes please miss galore bond smiled sourly at tilly masterton and moved down the room jed midnight had witnessed the snub he got close to bond and said earnestly mister if thats your doll you better watch her pussy gets the girls she wants she consumes them in bunches like grapes if you follow me mr midnight sighed wearily cheesus how they bore me the lizzies youll see shell soon have that frail parting her hair three ways in front of the mirror bond said cheerfully ill watch out theres nothing much i can do shes an independent sort of a girl that so said mr midnight with a spark of interest well mebbe i can help to break it up he straightened his tie i could go for that masterton shes sure got natural resources see you around he grinned at bond and moved off down the room bond was having a quiet square meal off caviar and champagne and thinking how well goldfinger had handled the meeting when the door at the end of the room opened and one of the koreans hurried in and went up to goldfinger goldfinger bent his head to the whispered words his face became grave he rapped a fork on his glass of saratoga vichy gentlemen and madam he looked sadly round the group i have received bad news our friend mr helmut springer has met with an accident he fell down the stairs death was instantaneous ho ho mr rings laugh was not a laugh it was a hole in the face and what does that slappy hapgood his torpedo have to say about it goldfinger said gravely alas mr hapgood also fell down the stairs and has succumbed to his injuries mr solo looked at goldfinger with new respect he said softly mister you better get those stairs fixed before me and my friend giulio cometo use them goldfinger said seriously the fault has been located repairs will be put in hand at once his face grew thoughtful i fear these accidents may be misconstrued in detroit jed midnight said cheerfully dont give it a thought mister they love funerals up there and itll take a load off their minds old hell wouldnt have lasted much longer they been stoking the fires under him these twelve months he appealed to mr strap who stood next to him am i right jacko sure jed said mr strap sagely you got the score mr helmut m springer had to be hit hit mobese for murder when bond at last got to bed that night he couldnt wipe the word out of his mind oddjob had got the signal a double ringand springer and his guard had got hit there had been nothing bond could have done about it even if he had wanted to and mr helmut springer meant nothing to him probably richly deserved to be hit anyway but now some other people were going to get hit unless he and only he could do something about it when the meeting of paramount hoods had broken up to go about their various duties goldfinger had dismissed the girl and kept bond in the room he told bond to take notes and then for more than two hours went over the operation down to the smallest detail when they came to the doping of the two reservoirs bond had asked for details of the drug and its speed of action you wont have to worry about that why not everything depends on it mr bond goldfingers eyes had a faraway withdrawn look i will tell you the truth because you will have no opportunity of passing it on from now oddjob will not be more than a yard from your side and his orders will be strict and exact so i can tell you that the entire population of fort knox will be dead or incapacitated by midnight on dl the substance that will be inserted in the water supply outside the filter plant will be a highly concentrated form of gb youre mad you dont really mean youre going to kill sixty thousand people why not american motorists do it every two years bond stared into goldfingers face in fascinated horror it couldnt be true he couldnt mean it he said tensely whats this gb gb is the most powerful of the trilone group of nerve poisons it was perfected by the wehrmacht in but never used for fear of reprisals in fact it is a more effective instrument of destruction than the hydrogen bomb its disadvantage lies in the difficulty of applying it to the populace the russians captured the entire german stocks at dyhernfurth on the polish frontier friends of mine were able to supply me with the necessary quantities introduction through the water supply is an ideal method of applying it to a densely populated area bond said goldfinger youre a lousy bastard dont be childish we have work to do later when they had got to the problem of transporting the tons of gold out of the town bond had had one last try he said goldfinger youre not going to get this stuff away nobodys going to get their hundred tons of gold out of the place let alone five hundred youll find yourself tearing down the dixie highway in a truck with a few gold bars loaded with gamma rays and the american army on your tail and youll have killed sixty thousand people for that the things farcical even if you do get a ton or two away where the hell do you think youre going to hide it mr bond goldfingers patience was infinite it just happens that a soviet cruiser of the sverdlovsk class will be visiting norfolk virginia on a goodwill cruise at that time it sails from norfolk on d initially by train and then by transport convoy my gold will arrive on board the cruiser by midnight on dday i shall sail in the cruiser for kronstadt everything has been carefully planned every possible hitch has been foreseen i have lived with this operation for five years now the time has come for the performance i have tidied up my activities in england and europe such small debris as remains of my former life can go to the scavengers who will shortly be sniffing on my trail i shall be gone i shall have emigrated and mr bond i shall have taken the golden heart of america with me naturally goldfinger was indulgent this unique performance will not be immaculate there has not been enough time for rehearsals i need these clumsy gangsters with their guns and their men but i could not bring them into the plan until the last moment they will make mistakes conceivably they will have much trouble getting their own loot away some will be caught others killed i couldnt care less these men are amateurs who were needed so to speak for the crowd scenes they are extras mr bond brought in off the streets what happens to them after the play is of no interest to me whatsoever and now on with the work i shall need seven copies of all this by nightfall where were we so in fact reflected bond feverishly this was not only a goldfinger operation with smersh in the background smersh had even got the high praesidium to play this was russia versus america with goldfinger as the spearhead was it an act of war to steal something from another country but who would know that russia had the gold no one if the plan went off as goldfinger intended none of the gangsters had an inkling to them goldfinger was just another of them another gangster slightly larger than lifesize and goldfingers staff his drivers for the golden convoy to the coast bond himself and tilly masterton some would be killed including him and the girl some the koreans for instance would no doubt sail in the cruiser not a trace would be left not a witness it was modern piracy with all the oldtime trimmings goldfinger was sacking fort knox as bloody morgan had saked panama therewas no difference except that the weapons and the techniques had been brought up to date and there was only one man in the whole world who could stop it but how the next day was an unending blizzard of paperwork every halfhour a note would come in from goldfingers operations room asking for schedules of this copies of that estimates timetables lists of stores another typewriter was brought in maps reference books anything that bond re quisitioned but not once did oddjob relax the extreme care with which he opened the door to bonds knock not once did his watchful eyes wander from bonds eyes hands feet when he came into the room to bring meals or notes or supplies there was no question of bond and the girl being part of the team they were dangerous slaves and nothing else tilly masterton was equally reserved she worked like a machine quick willing accurate but uncommunicative she responded with cool politeness to bonds early attempts to make friends share his thoughts with her by the evening he had learnt nothing about her except that she had been a successful amateur iceskater in between secretarial work for unilevers then she had started getting star parts in iceshows her hobby had been indoor pistol and rifle shooting and she had belonged to two marksman clubs she had few friends she had never been in love or engaged she lived by herself in two rooms in earls court she was twentyfour yes she realized that they were in a bad fix but something would turn up this fort knox business was nonsense it would certainly go wrong she thought miss pussy galore was divine she somehow seemed to count on her to get her out of this mess women with a sniff were rather good at things that needed finesse instinct told them what to do bond was not to worry about her she would be all right bond came to the conclusion that tilly masterton was one of those girls whose hormones had got mixed up he knew the type well and thought they and their male counterparts were a direct consequence of giving votes to women and sex equality as a result of fifty years of emancipation feminine qualities were dying out or being transferred to the males pansies of both sexes were everywhere not yet completely homosexual but confused not knowing what they were the result was a herd of unhappy sexual misfits barren and full of frustrations the women wanting to dominate and the men to be nannied he was sorry for them but he had no time for them bond smiled sourly to himself as he remembered his fantasies about this girl as they sped along the valley of the loire entre deux seins indeed at the end of the day there was a final note from goldfinger five principals and myself will leave la guardia airport tomorrow at am in chartered plane flown by my pilots for aerial survey of grand slam you will accompany masterton will remain g bond sat on the edge of his bed and looked at the wall then he got up and went to the typewriter he worked for an hour typing singlespaced on both sides of the sheet exact details of the operation he folded the sheet rolled it to a small cylinder about the size of his little finger and sealed it carefully with gum next he typed on a slip of paper urgent and vital reward of five thousand dollars is guaranteed with no questions asked to the finder who delivers this message unopened to felix leiter care pinkertons detective agency nassau street new york city immediate cash on delivery bond rolled this message round the cylinder wrote reward in red ink on the outside and stuck the little package down the centre of three inches of scotch tape then he sat down again on the edge of the bed and carefully strapped the free ends of the scotch tape down the inside of his thigh chapter twenty journey into holocaust mister flying control is buzzing us wants to know who we are they say this is restricted air goldfinger got up from his seat and went forward into the cockpit bond watched him pick up the hand microphone his voice came back clearly over the quiet hum of the tenseater executive beechcraft good morning this is mr gold of paramount pictures corporation we are carrying out an authorized survey of the territory for a forthcoming a picture of the famous confederate raid of which resulted in the capture of general sherman at muldraugh hill yes thats right gary grant and elizabeth taylor in the lead whats that clearance sure weve got clearance let me see now yes here it is signed by chief of special services at the pentagon sure the commanding officer at the armoured centre will have a copy okay and thanks hope youll enjoy the picture bye goldfinger wiped the breezy expression off his face handed over the microphone and came back into the cabin he braced his legs and stood looking down at his passengers well gentlemen and madam do you think youve seen enough i think youll agree its all pretty clear and conforms with your copies of the town plan i dont want to go much lower than six thousand perhaps we could make one more circuit and be off oddjob get out the refreshments there was a mumble of comment and questions which goldfinger dealt with one by one oddjob got up from bonds side and walked down to the rear bond followed him and under his hard suspicious stare went into the little lavatory and locked the door he sat down calmly and thought there hadnt been a chance on the way down to la guardia he had sat with oddjob in the back of an unobtrusive buick saloon the doors had been locked on them by the driver and the windows tightly closed goldfinger had ridden in front the partition closed behind him oddjob had sat slightly sideways his hornridged hands held ready on his thighs like heavy tools he had not taken his eyes off bond until the car had driven round the boundary to the charter hangars and come up alongside the private plane sandwiched between goldfinger and oddjob bond had had no alternative but to climb up the steps into the plane and take his seat with oddjob beside him ten minutes later the others had arrived there was no communication with them except an exchange of curt greetings they were all different now no smart remarks no unnecessarytalk these were men who had gone to war even pussy galore in a black dacron macintosh with a black leather belt looked like some young ss guardsman once or twice in the plane she had turned and looked at bond rather thoughtfully but she hadnt answered his smile perhaps she just couldnt understand where bond fitted in who he was when they got back to la guardia there would be the same routine it was now or never but where among the leaves of lavatory paper but they might be disturbed too soon or not for weeks would the ashtray be emptied possibly not but one thing would there was a rattle at the doorhandle oddjob was getting restless perhaps bond was setting fire to the plane bond called coming ape he got up and lifted the seat he tore the little package off the inside of his thigh and transferred it to the underside of the foreedge of the seat the seat would have to be lifted to get at the elsan and that would certainly be looked to as soon as the plane got back to the hangar the reward stared back at him boldly not even the most hasty cleaner could miss it so long as no one preceded the cleaner but bond didnt think any of the passengers would lift the seat the little compartment was too cramped to stand comfortably in he softly put the seat down ran some water in the basin washed his face and smoothed his hair and walked out oddjob was waiting angrily he pushed past bond looked carefully round the lavatory and came out again shutting the door bond walked back to his seat now the sos was in the bottle and the bottle had been committed to the waves who would be the finder how soon everyone down to the pilot and copilot went to the blasted little lavatory before they got back on the ground as each one came out bond expected to feel the cold nose of a gun in his neck the harsh suspicious words the crackle of the paper being unfolded but at last they were back in the buick and speeding over the triborough into uptown manhattan and then down the river on the parkway and in through the wellguarded doors of the warehouse and back to work now it was a race a race between goldfingers calm unhurried efficient machine and the tiny gunpowder trail bond had lit what was going on outside during every hour of the next three days bonds imagination followed what might be happening leiter telling his chief the conference the quick flight down to washington the fbi and hoover the army the president leiter insisting that bonds conditions be adhered to that no suspicious moves be made no inquiries started that no one moved an inch except according to some master plan that would operate on the day and get the whole gang into the bag so that not one of them escaped would they accept bonds conditions or would they not dare take the chance had they talked across the atlantic with m had m insisted that bond should be somehow pulled out no m would see the point he would agree that bonds life must be disregarded that nothing must jeopardize the big cleanup they would have to get the two japanese of course somehow beat out of them the code message goldfinger would be waiting for on d was that how it was going or was it all a shambles leiter away on another assignment who is this what does it stand for some crazy loon hi smith check on this could you get down to the warehouse and take a look sorry mister no five grand for you heres car fare back to la guardia afraid youve been hoaxed or worse still had none of these things happened was the plane still standing in a corner of the field unserviced night and day the torment of thoughts went through bonds head while the work got cleared and the hours ticked by and the deadly machine whirred quietly on d came and flashed by in a last fever of activity then in the evening came the note from goldfinger first phase of operation successful entrain as planned at midnight bring copies of all maps schedules operation orders g in close formation with bond and tilly masterton he in a white surgeons coat she dressed as a nurse wedged in the middle the goldfinger contingent marched swiftly through the almost empty concourse of pennsylvania station and down to the waiting special everyone including goldfinger was wearing the conventional white garb and armbands of a medical field force and the dim platform was crowded with the ghostly waiting figures of the posses from the gangs the silence and tension was appropriate for an emergency force hurrying to the scene of a disaster and the stretcher and decontamination suits being loaded into the compartments added drama to the scene the superintendent was talking quietly with the senior physicians in the shape of midnight strap solo and ring nearby stood miss galore with a dozen palefaced nurses who waited with eyes bent as if they stood beside an open grave without makeup their exotic hairdos tucked into dark blue red cross caps they had been well rehearsed they were giving an excellent performance dutiful merciful dedicated to the relief of human suffering when the superintendent saw goldfinger and his party approaching he hurried up tr gold his face was grave im afraid the news coming through isnt too good guess itll all be in the papers tonight all trains held at louisville no reply from the depot at fort knox but well get you through all right god almighty doctor whats going on down there people coming through from louisville are talking about the russians spraying something from the air of course the superintendent looked keenly at goldfinger im not believing that kind of stuff but what is it food poisoning goldfingers face was solemn he said in a kindly voice my friend thats what weve got to find out thats why were being rushed down if you want me to make a guess but mark you its only a guess its a form of sleeping sickness trypanosomiasis we call it that so the superintendent was impressed by the sound of the malady well believe you me doctor were all mighty proud of you and your folks of the emergency force he held out his hand goldfinger took it best of luck doc and now if youll get your men and the nurses on board ill have this train on its way just as quick as may be thank you superintendent my colleagues and i will not forget your services goldfinger gave a short bow his contingent moved on board bond found himself in a pullman with tilly masterton across the aisle and the koreans and germans all around them goldfinger was in the front of the car talking cheerfully with his satraps miss pussy galore strolled by she ignored the upturned face of tilly masterton but gave bond the usual searching glance there was a banging of doors being closed pussy galore stopped and rested an arm on the back of the seat in front of bond she looked down at him hullo handsome long time no see uncle doesnt seem to let you off the lead much bond said hullo beautiful that outfit suits you fine im feeling rather faint how about doing a bit of nursing the deep violet eyes examined him carefully she said softly you know what mister bond i got a feeling theres something phoney about you i got instincts see just what are you and that doll she jerked her head back doing in this outfit we do all the work the train began to move pussy galore straightened herself she said mebbe you do but if any little thing goes wrong with this caper for my money itll be handsome who knows why get me she didnt wait for bonds answer but moved on down and joined the chiefs of staff meeting it was a confused busy night appearances had to be kept up before the inquisitive sympathetic eyes of the conductors lastminute conferences up and down the train had to wear the appearance of serious medical conclaves no cigar smoking no swearing no spitting jealousies and competition between the gangs had to be kept under rigid control the cold superiority of the mafia particularly visavis jack strap and his soft easy living crowd from the west might have led to gunplay if the chiefs hadnt been ready for trouble and constantly on the lookout for it all these minor psychological factors had been foreseen by goldfinger and prepared for the women from the cement mixers were carefully segregated there was no drinking and the gang chiefs kept their men occupied with further exact briefings dummy exercises with maps and lengthy discussions about their escape plans with the gold there was casual spying on each others plans and goldfinger was often called in to judge who should have which routes to the mexican border to the desert to canada to bond it was amazing that a hundred of the toughest crooks in america on edge with excitement and greed could be kept as quiet as they were it was goldfinger who had achieved the miracle apart from the calm dangerousquality of the man it was the minuteness of the planning and the confidence he exuded that calmed the battle nerves and created some sort of a teamspirit among the rival mobs as the iron gallop of the train stretched itself out through the flat lands of pennsylvania gradually the passengers fell into an uneasy troubled sleep but not goldfinger or oddjob they remained awake and watchful and soon bond gave up any idea he might have had of using one of his hidden knives on odd job and making a bid for freedom when the train slowed through a station or on an upgradient bond dozed fitfully wondering imagining puzzling over the superintendents words the superintendent had certainly thought they were the truth knew that fort knox was in emergency was his news from louisville the truth or part of the giant cover plan that would be necessary to get every member of the conspiracy in the bag if it was a cover plan how meticulously had it been prepared would someone slip up would there be some ghastly bungle that would warn goldfinger in time or if the news was true if the poison had been successful what did there remain for bond to do bond had made up his mind on one score somehow in the excitement of hhour he would get close to goldfinger and cut his throat with one of his hidden knives how much would that achieve apart from an act of private vengeance would goldfingers squad accept another mans order to arm the warhead and fire it who would be strong enough cool enough to take over mr soloprobably the operation would perhaps be half successful they would get away with plenty of gold except goldfingers men who would be lost without him to lead them and in the meantirne whatever else bond could not do had sixty thousand people already died was there anything he could have done to prevent that had there ever been a chance to kill goldfinger would it have done any good to make a scene at pennsylvania station bond stared at his dark reflection in the window listened to the sweet ting of the gradecrossing bells and the howl of the windhorn clearing their way and shredded his nerves with doubts questions reproaches chapter twentyone the richest man in history slowly the red dawn broke over the endless plain of black grass that gradually turned to the famous kentucky blue as the sun ironed out the shadows at six oclock the train began to slacken speed and soon they were gliding gently through the waking suburbs of louisville to come to rest with a sigh of hydraulics in the echoing almost deserted station a small respectful group was awaiting them goldfinger his eyes blackringed with lack of sleep beckoned to one of the germans picked up his authoritative little black bag and stepped down on to the platform there was a short serious conclave the louisville superintendent doing the talking and goldfinger interjecting a few questions and nodding gravely at the answers goldfinger turned wearily back to the train mr solo had been deputed to take his report he stood at the open door at the end of the pullman bond heard goldfinger say sorrowfully i am afraid doctor the situation is as bad as we feared i will now go forward to the leading diesel with this he held up the black bag and we will proceed slowly into the infected area would you please tell all personnel to be prepared to put on their masks i have masks for the driver and fireman all other railway personnel will leave the train here mr solo nodded solemnly right professor he closed his door goldfinger walked off downthe platform followed by his german strongarm man and the respectful headshaking group there was a short pause and then silently almost reverently the long train whispered its way out of the station leaving the little group of officials now reinforced by four rather shamefaced conductors with hands raised in benediction thirtyfive miles half an hour to go coffee and doughnuts were brought round by the nurses and for those whose nerves needed it two grains of dexedrine the nurses were pale silent there were no jokes no smart remarks the train was electric with tension after ten minutes there was a sudden slackening of speed and a sharp hiss from the brakes coffee was spilled the train almost stopped then there was a jerk and it gathered speed again a new hand had taken over on the dead mans handle a few minutes later mr strap came hurrying through the train ten minutes to go on your toes folks squads a b and c get their equipment on everythings going fine stay calm remember your duties he hurried through to the next compartment and bond heard the voice repeating its message bond turned to oddjob listen you ape im going to the lavatory and probably miss masterton will too he turned to the girl what about it tilly yes she said indifferently i suppose id better bond said well go ahead the korean beside the girl looked inquiringly at oddjob oddjob shook his head bond said unless you leave her alone im going to start a fight goldfinger wont like that he turned to the girl go ahead tilly ill see to these apes oddjob uttered a series of barks and snarls which the other korean seemed to understand the guard got up and said okay but not locking the door he followed the girl down the pullman and stood and waited for her to come out oddjob carried out the same routine with bond once inside bond took off his right shoe slid out the knife and slipped it down inside the waistband of his trousers one shoe would now have no heel but no one was going to notice that this morning bond washed himself the face in the mirror was pale and the bluegrey eyes dark with tension he went out and back to his seat now there was a distant shimmer away to the right and a hint of low buildings rising like a mirage in the early morning ground mist they slowly defined themselves as hangars with a squat control tower godman field the soft pounding howl of the train slackened some trim modern villas part of a new housing development slid by they seemed to be unoccupied now on the left there was the black ribbon of brandenburg station road bond craned the gleaming modern sprawl of fort knox looked almost soft in the light mist above its jagged outline the air was dear as crystal not a trace of smoke no breakfasts cooking the train slowed to a canter on station road there had been a bad motor accident two cars seemed to have met head on the body of a man sprawled half out of a smashed door the other car lay on its back like a dead beetle bonds heart pounded the main signal box came and went over the levers something white was draped it was a mans shirt inside the shirt the body hung down its head below the level of the window a row of modern bungalows a body clad in singlet and trousers flat on its face in the middle of a trim lawn the lines of mown grass were beautifully exact until near the man the mower had written an ugly flourish and had then come to rest on its side in the newly turned earth of the border a line of washing that had broken when the woman had grasped it the woman lay in a white pile at one end of the sagging string of family underclothes cloths and towels and now the train was moving at walking pace into the town and everywhere down every street on every sidewalk there were the sprawling figures singly in clumps in rockingchairs on the porches in the middle of intersections where the traffic lights still unhurriedly ticked off their coloured signals in cars that had managed to pull up and in others that had smashed into shop windows death dead people everywhere no movement no sound save the click of the murderers iron feet as his train slid through the graveyard now there was bustle in the carriages billy ring came through grinning hugely he stopped by bonds chair oh boy he said delightedly old goldie certainly slipped them the micky finn too bad some people were out for a ride when they got hit but you know what they say about omelettes cant make em without you break some eggs right bond smiled tightly thats right billy ring made his silent o of a laugh and went on his way the train trundled through brandenburg station now there were scores of bodies men women children soldiers the platform was scribbled with them faces upwards to the roof down in the dust cradled sideways bond searched for movement for an inquisitive eye for a twitching hand nothing wait what was that thinly through the closed window there came a soft mewing wail three perambulators stood against the ticket office the mothers collapsed beside them of course the babies in the perambulators would have drunk milk not the deadly water oddjob got to his feet so did the whole of goldfingers team the faces of the koreans were indifferent unchanged only their eyes flickered constantly like nervous animals the germans were pale grim nobody looked at anyone else silently they filed towards the exit and lined up waiting tilly masterton touched bonds sleeve her voice trembled are you sure theyre only asleep i thought i saw some sort of sort of froth on some of the lips bond had seen the same thing the froth had been pink he said i expect some of them were eating sweets or something when they fell asleep you know what these americans are always chewing something he softly mouthed the next words stay away from me there may be shooting he looked hard at her to see she understood she nodded dumbly not looking at him she whispered out of the corner of her mouth im going to get near pussy shell look after me bond gave her a smile and said good encouragingly the train clicked slowly over some points and slid to rest there came one blast of the diesels windhorn the doors swung open and the different groups piled out on to the platform of the bullion depository siding now everything went with military precision the various squads formed up in their battle orderfirst an assault group widi submachine guns then the stretcherbearers to get the guard and other personnel out of the vault then goldfingers demolition team ten men with their bulky tarpaulincovered package then a mixed group of spare drivers and trafficcontrol men then the group of nurses now all armed with pistols who were to stay in the background with a heavily armed reserve group that was to deal with any unexpected interference from anybody who as goldfinger had put it might wake up bond and the girl had been included in the command group which consisted of goldfinger oddjob and the five gang leaders they were to be stationed on the flat roofs of the two diesel locomotives which now stood as planned beyond the siding buildings and in full view of the objective and its approaches bond and the girl were to handle the maps the timetables and the stopwatch and bond was to watch out for fumbles and delays and bring them at once to goldfingers attention to be rectified by walkietalkie with die squad leaders when the bomb was due to be fired they would take shelter behind the diesels there came a double blast from the windhorn and as bond and the girl climbed to their position on the roof of the first diesel the assault squad followed by the other sections doubled across the twenty yards of open ground between the railway and bullion boulevard bond edged as close as he could to goldfinger goldfinger had binoculars to his eyes his mouth was close to the microphone strapped to his chest but oddjob stood between them a solid mountain of flesh and his eyes uninterested in the drama of the assault never flickered from bond and the girl bond under cover of scanning his plastic mapcase and keeping an eye on the stopwatch measured inches and angles he glanced at the nextdoor group of the four men and the woman they were gazing in frozen attention at the scene before them now jack strap said excitedly theyre through the first gates bond putting half his mind to work on his own plans took a quick look at the battlefield it was an extraordinary scene in the centre stood the huge squat mausoleum the sun glinting off the polished granite of its walls outside the big open field in which it stood the roads the dixie highway vine grove and bullion boulevard were lined with trucks and transporters two deep with the recognition flags of the gangs flying from the first and last vehicle of each convoy their drivers lay piled up outside the shelter of the surrounding guard wall of the vault while through the main gate poured the tidy disciplined squads from the train outside this world of movement there was absolute stillness and silence as if the rest of america was holding its breath at the committal of this gigantic crime and outside lay the bodies of the soldiers sprawling where they had fallen the sentries by their pill boxes still clutching their automatic pistols and inside the protecting wall two ragged squads of soldiers in battledress they lay in vague untidy heaps some bodies athwart or on top of their neighbours outside between bullion boulevard and the main gate two armoured cars had crashed into each other and now stood locked their heavy machine guns pointing one at the ground and the other at the sky a drivers body sprawled out of the turret of one of the vehicles desperately bond looked for a sign of life a sign of movement a hint that all this was a careful ambush nothing not a cat moved not a sound came out of the crowded buildings that formed a backdrop to the scene only the squads hurried about their tasks or now stood waiting in their planned dispositions goldfinger spoke quietly into his microphone last stretcher out bomb squad ready prepare to take over now the covering troops and the stretcherbearers were hurrying for the exit getting down under cover of the guard wall there would be five minutes delay to clear the area before the bomb squad now waiting bunched at the main gate would go in bond said efficiently theyre a minute ahead of time goldfinger looked past oddjobs shoulder the pale eyes were aflame they stared into bonds goldfingers mouth twisted into a harsh snarl he said through his teeth you see mr bond you were wrong and i was right ten more minutes and i shall be the richest man in the world the richest man in history what do you say to that his mouth spat out the words bond said equably ill tell you after those ten minutes are up will you said goldfinger maybe he looked at his watch and spoke rapidly into his microphone the goldfinger squad loped slowly through the main gate their heavy burden slung from four shoulders in a cradle of webbing goldfinger looked past bond at the group on the roof of the second diesel he called out triumphantly another five minutes gentlemen and then we must take cover he turned his eyes on bond and added softly and then we will say goodbye mr bond and thank you for the assistance you and the girl have given me out of the corner of his eye bond saw something moving moving in the sky it was a black whirling speck it reached the top of its trajectory paused and then came the earsplitting crack of a maroon signal bonds heart leapt a quick glance showed him the ranks of dead soldiers springing to life the machine guns on the locked armoured cars swinging to cover the gates a loudspeaker roared from nowhere stand where you are lay down your arms but there came a futile crackle of fire from one of the rearguard covering party and then all hell broke loose bond seized the girl round the waist and jumped with her it was a tenfoot drop to the platform bond broke his fall with his left hand and hoisted the girl to her feet with a jerk of his hip as he began to run close to the train for cover he heard goldfinger shout get them and kill them a splatter of lead from goldfingers automatic whipped at the cement to his left but goldfinger would have to shoot left handed it was oddjob that bond feared now as bond tore down the platform with the girls hand in his he heard the lightning scuffle of the running feet the girls hand tugged at him she screamed angrily no no stop i want to stay close to pussy ill be safe with her bond shouted back shut up you little fool run like hell but now she was dragging at him checking his speed suddenly she tore her hand out of his and made to dart into an open pullman door christ thought bond thats torn it he whipped the knife out of his belt and swirled to meet oddjob ten yards away oddjob hardly paused in his rush one hand whipped off his ridiculous deadly hat a glance to take aim and the black steel halfmoon sang through the air its edge caught the girl exactly at the nape of the neck without a sound she fell backwards on to the platform in oddjobs path the hurdle was just enough to put oddjob off the flying high kick he had started to launch at bonds head he turned the kick into a leap his left hand cutting the air towards bond like a sword bond ducked and struck upwards and sideways with his knife it got home somewhere near the ribs but the momentum of the flying body knocked the knife out of his hand there was a tinkle on the platform now oddjob was coming back at him apparently unharmed his hands outstretched and his feet splayed back ready for another leap or a kick his blood was up the eyes were red and there was a fleck of saliva at the open panting mouth above the boom and rattle of the guns outside the station three blasts sounded on the diesels windhorn oddjob snarled angrily and leapt bond dived at full length sideways something hit him a gigantic blow on the shoulder and sent him sprawling now he thought as he hit the ground now the death stroke he scrambled clumsily to his feet his neck hunched into his shoulders to break the impact but no blow came and bonds dazed eyes took in the figure of oddjob flying away from him up the platform already the leading diesel was on the move oddjob got to it and leapt for the footplate for a moment he hung his legs scrabbling for a foothold then he had disappeared into the cabin and the huge streamlined engine gathered speed behind bond the door of the quartermasters office burst open there was the hammer of running feet and a yell santiago st james the battlecry of cortez that leiter had once jokingly allotted to bond bond swivelled the strawhaired texan clad in his wartime marine corps battledress was pounding up the platform followed by a dozen men in khaki he carried a oneman bazooka by the steel hook he used for a right hand bond ran to meet him he said dont shoot my fox you bastard give over he snatched the bazooka out of leiters hand and threw himself down on the platform splaying out his legs now the diesel was two hundred yards away and about to cross the bridge over the dixie highway bond shouted stand clear to get the men out of line of the recoil flash clicked up the safe and took careful aim the bazooka shuddered slightly and the tenpound armourpiercing rocket was on its way there was a flash and a puff of blue smoke some bits of metal flew off the rear of the flying engine but then it had crossed the bridge and taken the curve and was away not bad for a rookie commented leiter may put the rear diesel out but those jobs are twins and he can make it on the forward engine bond got to his feet he smiled warmly into the hawklike slategrey eyes you bungling oaf he said sarcastically why in hell didnt you block that line listen shamus if youve got any complaints about the stage management you can tell them to the president he took personal command of this operation and its a honey theres a spotter plane overhead now theyll pick up the diesel and well have old goldilocks in the hoosegow by midday how were we to know he was going to stay aboard the train he broke off and thumped bond between the shoulderblades hell im glad to see you these men and i were detailed off to give you protection weve been dodging around looking for you and getting shot at by both sides for our pains he turned to the soldiers aint that right men they laughed sure is capn bond looked affectionately at the texan with whom he had shared so many adventures he said seriously bless you felix youve always been good at saving my life it was darn nearly too late this time im afraid tilly mastertons had it he walked off up the train with felix at his heels the little figure still lay sprawled where she had fallen bond knelt beside her the brokendoll angle of the head was enough he felt for her pulse he got up he said softly poor little bitch she didnt think much of men he looked defensively at leiter felix i could have got her away if shed only followed me leiter didnt understand he put his hand on bonds arm and said sure kid take it easy he turned to his men two of you carry the girl into the qms office over there obrien you go for the ambulance when youve done that stop over at the command post and give em the facts say weve got commander bond and ill bring him right over bond stood and looked down at the little empty tangle of limbs and clothes he saw the bright proud girl with the spotted handkerchief round her hair in the flying tr now she had gone high up over his head a whirling speck soared into the sky it reached the top of its flight and paused there came the sharp crack of the maroon it was the ceasefire chapter twentytwo the last trick it was two days later felix leiter was weaving the black studillac fast through the lanes of dawdling traffic on the triborough bridge there was plenty of time to catch bonds plane the evening boac monarch to london but leiter enjoyed shaking up bonds low opinion of american cars now the steel hook that he used for a right hand banged the gear lever into second and the low black car leapt for a narrow space between a giant refrigerator truck and a mooning oldsmobile whose rear window was almost obscured by holiday stickers bonds body jerked back with the kick of the bhp and his teeth snapped shut when the manoeuvre was completed and the angry hooting had vanished behind them bond said mildly its time you graduated out of the kiddicar class and bought yourself an express carriage you want to get cracking this pedalling along ages one one of these days youll stop moving altogether and when you stop moving is when you start to die leiter laughed he said see that green light ahead bet i can make it before it goes red the car leapt forward as if it had been kicked there was a brief hiatus in bonds life an impression of snipelike flight and of a steel wall of cars that someone parted before the whiplash of leiters triple klaxons a hundred yards when the speedometer touched ninety and they were across the lights and cruising genteelly along in the centre lane bond said calmly you meet the wrong traffic cop arid that pinkerton card of yours wont be good enough it isnt so much that you drive slowly its holding back the cars behind theyll book you for the sort of car you need is a nice elderly rolls royce silver ghost with big plateglass windows so you can enjoy the beauties of nature bond gestured towards a huge automobile junk heap on their right maximum fifty and it can stop and even go backwards if you want to bulb horn suit your sedate style matter of fact there should be one on the market soon goldfingers and by the same token what the hells happened to goldfinger havent they caught up with him yet leiter glanced at his watch and edged into the outside lane he brought the car down to forty he said seriously tell you the truth were all a bit worried the papers are needling us or rather edgar hoovers crowd like hell first they had a gripe at the security clampdown on you we couldnt tell them that wasnt our fault and that someone in london an old limey called m had insisted on it so theyre getting their own back say were dragging our feet and so forth and im telling you james leiters voice was glum apologetic we just havent a clue they caught up with the diesel goldfinger had fixed the controls at thirty and had let it run on down the line somewhere he and the korean had got off and probably this galore girl and the four hoods as well because theyve vanished too we found his truck con voy of course waiting on the eastbound highway out of elizabethville but never a driver most probably scattered but somewhere theres goldfinger and a pretty tough team hiding up they didnt get to the sverdlovsk cruiser at norfolk we had a plainclothes guard scattered round the docks and they report that she sailed to schedule without any strangers going aboard not a cats been near that warehouse on east river and no ones shown at idlewild or the frontiers mexico and canada for my money that jed midnight has somehow got them out to cuba if theyd taken two or three trucks from the convoy and driven like hell they could have got down to florida somewhere like daytona beach by the early hours of d l and midnights darn well organized down there the coast guards and the air force have put out all theyve got but nothings shown yet but they could have hidden up during the day and got over to cuba during the night its got everybody worried as hell and its no help that the presidents hopping mad bond had spent the previous day in washington treading the thickest richest red carpet there had been speeches at the bureau of the mint a big brass lunch at the pentagon an embarrassing quarter of an hour with the president and the rest of the day had been hard work with a team of stenographers in edgar hoovers suite of offices with a colleague of bonds from station a sitting in at the end of that there had been a brisk quarter of an hours talk with m on the embassy transatlantic scrambler m had told him what had been happening on the european end of the case as bond had expected goldfingers cable to universal export had been treated as emergency the factories at reculver and coppet had been searched and extra evidence of the gold smuggling racket had been found the indian government had been warned about the mecca plane that was already en route for bombay and that end of the operation was on the way to being cleaned up the swiss special brigade had quickly found bonds car and had got on to the route by which bond and the girl had been taken to america but there at idlewild the fbi had lost the scent m seemed pleased with the way bond had handled operation grand slam but he said the bank of england were worrying him about goldfingers twenty million pounds in gold goldfinger had assembled all this at the paragon safe deposit co in new york but had withdrawn it on dl he and his men had driven it away in a covered truck the bank of england had ready an order in council to impound the gold when it was found and there would then be a case to prove that it had been smuggled out of england or at least that it was originally smuggled gold whose value had been increased by various doubtful means but this was now being handled by the us treasury and the fbi and since m had no jurisdiction in america bond had better come home at once and help tidy things up oh yes at the end of the conversation ms voice had sounded gruff there had been a very kind request to the pm that bond should be allowed to accept the american medal of merit of course m had had to explain via the pm that the service didnt go in for those sort of thingsparticularly from foreign countries however friendly they were too bad but m knew that this was what bond would have expected he knew the rules bond had said yes of course and thank you very much and hed take the next plane home now as they motored quietly down the van wyck expressway bond was feeling vaguely dissatisfied he didnt like leaving ragged ends to a case none of the big gangsters had been put in the bag and he had failed in the two tasks he had been given to get goldfinger and get goldfingers bullion it was nothing but a miracle that operation grand slam had been broken it had been two days before the beechcraft had been serviced and the cleaner who found the note had got to pinkertons only half an hour before leiter was due to go off to the coast on a big racing scandal but then leiter had really got cracking to his chief then to the fbi and the pentagon the fbis knowledge of bonds record plus contact with m through the central intelligence agency had been enough to get the whole case up to the president within an hour after that it had just been a case of building up the gigantic bluff in which all the inhabitants of fort knox had participated in one way or another the two japanese had been taken easily enough and it was confirmed by chemical warfare that the three pints of gb carried as gin in their briefcases would have been enough to slay the entire population of fort knox the two men had been quickly and forcibly grilled into explaining the form of the all clear cable to goldfinger the cable had been sent then the army had declared emergency road and rail and air blocks had turned back all traffic to the fort knox area with the exception of the gangster convoys which had not been hindered the rest was playacting right down to the pink froth and the squalling babies which it was thought would add nice touches of verisimilitude yes it had all been very satisfactory so far as washington was concerned but what about the english end who in america cared about the bank of englands gold who cared that two english girls had been murdered in the course of this business who really minded that goldfinger was still at liberty now that americas bullion was safe again they idled across the drab plain of idlewild past the tenmilliondollar steel and cement skeletons that would one day be an adult airport and pulled up outside the makeshift huddle of concrete boxes that bond knew so well already the well mannered iron voices were reaching out to them pan american world airways announces the departure of its president flight pa transworld airways calling captain murphy captain murphy please and the pearshaped vowels and fluted diction of boac boac announces the arrival of its bermudan flight ba passengers will be disembarking at gate number neyne bond took his bag and said goodbye to leiter he said well thanks for everything felix write to me every day leiter gripped his hand hard he said sure thing kid and take it easy tell that old bastard m to send you back over soon next visit well take some time off from the razzmatazz time you called in on my home state like to have you meet my oilwell bye now leiter got into his car and accelerated away from the arrival bay bond raised his hand the studillac dryskidded out on to the approach road there was an answering glint from leiters steel hook out of the window and he was gone bond sighed he picked up his bag and walked in and over to the boac ticket counter bond didnt mind airports so long as he was alone in them he had half an hour to wait and he was quite content to wander through the milling crowds have a bourbon and soda at the restaurant and spend some time choosing something to read at the bookstore he bought ben hogans modern fundamentals of golf and the latest raymond chandler and sauntered along to the souvenir shop to see if he could find an amusing gimmick to take back to his secretary now there was a mans voice on the boac announcing system it called out a long list of monarch passengers who were required at the ticket counter ten minutes later bond was paying for one of the latest and most expensive ballpoint pens when he heard his own name being called will mr james bond passenger on boac monarch flight no to gander and london please come to the boac ticket counter mr james bond please it was obviously that infernal tax form to show how much he had earned during his stay in america on principle bond never went to the internal revenue office in new york to get clearance and he had only once had to argue it out at idlewild he went out of the shop and across to the boac counter the official said politely may i see your health certificate please mr bond bond took the form out of his passport and handed it over the man looked at it carefully he said im very sorry sir but theres been a typhoid case at gander and theyre insisting that all transit passengers who havent had their shots in the last six months should be topped up its most annoying sir but ganders very touchy about these things too bad we couldnt have managed a direct flight but theres a strong headwind bond hated inoculations he said irritably but look here im stuffed with shots of one kind or another been having them for twenty years for one damned thing or another he looked round the area near the boac departure gate seemed curiously deserted he said what about the other passengers where are they theyve all agreed sir just having their shots now it wont take a minute sir if youll come this way oh well bond shrugged his shoulders impatiently he followed the man behind the counter and through a door to the boac station managers office there was the usual whiteclothed doctor a mask over the bottom of his face the needle held ready last one he asked of the boac official yes doctor okay coat off and left sleeve up please too bad theyre so sensitive up at gander damned sight too bad said bond what are they afraid of spreading the black death there came the sharp smell of the alcohol and the jab of the needle thanks said bond gruffly he pulled down his sleeve and made to pick his coat up from the back of the chair his hand went down for it missed it went on down down towards the floor his body dived after the hand down down down all the lights were on in the plane there seemed to be plenty of spare places why did he have to get stuck with a passenger whose arm was hogging the central armrest bond made to get up and change his seat a wave of nausea swept over him he closed his eyes and waited how extraordinary he was never airsick he felt the cold sweat on his face handkerchief wipe it off he opened his eyes again and looked down at his arms the wrists were bound to the arms of his chair what had happened he had had his shot and then passed out or something had he got violent what the hell was all this about he glanced to his right and then stared aghast oddjob was sitting there oddjob odd job in bo ac uniform oddjob glanced incuriously at him and reached for the stewards bell bond heard the pretty dingdong back in the pantry there was the rustle of a skirt beside him he looked up it was pussy galore trim and fresh in the blue uniform of a stewardess she said hi handsome she gave him the deep searching look he remembered so well from when from centuries ago in another life bond said desperately for christs sake whats going on where did you come from the girl smiled cheerfully eating caviar and drinking champagne you britishers sure live the life of reilly when you get up twenty thousand feet not a sign of a brussels sprout and if theres tea i havent got around to it yet now you take it easy uncle wants to talk to you she sauntered up the aisle swinging her hips and disappeared through the cockpit door now nothing could surprise bond goldfinger in a boac captains uniform that was rather too large for him the cap squarely on the centre of his head closed the cockpit door behind him and came down the aisle he stood and looked grimly down at bond well mr bond so fate wished us to play the game out but this time mr bond there cannot possibly be a card up your sleeve ha the sharp bark was a mixture of anger stoicism and respect you certainly turned out to be a snake in my pastures the great head shook slowly why i kept you alive why i didnt crush you like a beetle you and the girl were useful to me yes i was right about that but i was mad to have taken the chance yes mad the voice dropped and went slow and now tell me mr bond how did you do it how did you communicate bond said equably we will have a talk goldfinger and i will tell you certain things but not until you have taken off these straps and brought me a bottle of bourbon ice soda water and a packet of chesterfields then when you have told me what i wish to know i will decide what to tell you as you say my situation is not favourable or at least it doesnt appear to be so i have nothing to lose and if you want to get something out of me it will be on my own terms goldfinger looked gravely down i have no objection to your conditions out of respect for your abilities as an opponent you shall spend your last journey in comfort oddjob the voice was sharp ring the bell for miss galore and undo those straps get into the seat in front there is no harm he can do at the rear of the plane but he is not to approach the cockpit door if need be kill him at once but i prefer to get him to our destination alive understand arrgh five minutes later bond had what he wanted the tray in front of him was down and on it were his whisky and cigarettes he poured himself a stiff bourbon goldfinger was seated in the chair across the aisle waiting bond picked up his drink and sipped it he was about to take a deeper drink when he saw something he put the glass carefully down without disturbing the little round paper coaster that had stuck to the bottom of his glass he lit a cigarette picked up his drink again and removed the icecubes and put them back in the ice bucket he drank the whisky down ahnost to the end now he could read the words through the bottom of the glass he carefully put the glass down without disturbing the coaster the message had read im with you xxx p bond turned and made himself comfortable he said now then goldfinger first of all whats going on how did you get this plane where are we heading goldfinger crossed one leg over the other he gazed away from bond up the aisle he said in a relaxed conversational tone i took three trucks and drove across country to the vicinity of cape hatteras one of the trucks contained my personal hoard of gold bullion the other two contained my drivers spare personnel and those gangsters i required none of them except miss galore i kept a nucleus of the staff i would need paid off the others with huge sums and dispersed them gradually along the route at the coast i held a meeting with the four gang leaders in a deserted place having left miss galore under some pretext with the trucks i shot the four men in my usual fashion one bullet for each i went back to the trucks and explained that the four men had chosen money and independent action i was now left with six men the girl and the bullion i hired a plane and flew to newark new jersey the crates of gold being passed off as lead for xray plates from there i proceeded alone to a certain address in new york from which i talked with moscow by radio and explained the mishap to operation grand slam in the course of the talk i mentioned your name my friends whom i believe you know goldfinger looked hard at bond pass under the generic name of smersh they recognized the name of bond and told me who you were i at once understood a great deal of what had previously been hidden from me smersh said they would greatly like to interview you i pondered the matter in due course i conceived the plan which you now see in operation posing as a friend of yours i had no difficulty in finding out the flight on which you were booked three of my men were formerly of the luftwaffe they assured me there would be no difficulty in flying this plane the rest was mere detail by cool bluffing impersonation and the use of a certain amount of force all the boac personnel at idlewild the crew of this plane and the passengers were given the necessary injections from which they will now be recovering we changed clothes with the unconscious crew the bullion was loaded on the plane you were dealt with and carried out on a stretcher and in due course the new boac crew with their stewardess boarded the plane and we took to the air goldfinger paused he lifted a hand resignedly of course there were small hitches we were told to follow taxiway alpha to runway four and it was only by following a klm plane that we were successful the idlewild routine was not easy to master and we must have seemed somewhat clumsy and inexperienced but mr bond with assurance strong nerves and a gruff intimidating manner it is never difficult to override the civil service mentality of what after all are minor employees i understand from the wireless operator that a search for this plane is under way they were already questioning us before we were out of vhp range at nantucket then the distant early warning system queried us on high frequency that did not disturb me we have enough fuel we have already had clearance from moscow for east berlin kiev or murmansk we shall take whichever route the weather dictates there should be no trouble if there is i shall talk my way out of it on the radio no one is going to shoot down a valuable boac plane the mystery and confusion will protect us until we are well within soviet territory and then of course we shall have disappeared without trace to bond there had been nothing fantastic nothing impossible about goldfinger since he had heard the details of operation grand slam the theft of a stratocruiser as goldfinger had explained it was preposterous but no more so than his methods of smuggling gold his purchase of an atomic warhead when one examined these things while they had a touch of magic of genius even they were logical exercises they were bizarre only in their magnitude even the tiny manoeuvre of cheating mr du pont had been quite brilliantly contrived there was no doubt about it goldfinger was an artist a scientist in crime as great in his field as cellini or einstein in theirs and now mr bond of the british secret service we made a bargain what have you to tell me who put you on to me what did they suspect how did you manage to interfere with my plans goldfinger sat back placed his hands across his stomach and looked at the ceiling bond gave goldfinger a censored version of the truth he mentioned nothing about smersh or the location of the postbox and he said nothing about the secrets of the homer a device that might be new to the russians he concluded so you see goldfinger you only just got away but for tilly mastertons intervention at geneva youd have been in the bag by now youd be sitting picking your teeth in a swiss prison waiting to be sent to england you underestimate the english they may be slow but they get there you think youll be pretty safe in russia i wouldnt be too sure weve got people even out of there before now ill give you one last aphorism for your book goldfinger never go a bear of england chapter twentythree tlc treatment the plane throbbed on high above the weather over the great moonlit landscape the lights had been turned out bond sat quietly in the darkness and sweated with fear at what he was going to do an hour before the girl had brought him dinner there was a pencil hidden in the napkin she had made some tough remarks for the benefit of oddjob and gone away bond had eaten some scraps of food and drunk a good deal of bourbon while his imagination hunted round the plane wondering what he could conceivably do to force an emergency landing at gander or somewhere else in nova scotia as a last resort could he set fire to the plane he toyed with the idea and with the possibility of forcing the entrance hatch open both ideas seemed impracticable and suicidal to save him the trouble of pondering over them the man whom bond had seen before at the bo ac ticket counter one of the germans came through and stopped by bonds chair he grinned down at bond boac takes good care of you isnt it mister goldfinger thinks you might have foolish notions i am to keep an eye on the rear of the plane so just sit back and enjoy the ride isnt it when bond didnt answer the man went on back to the rear section something was nagging at bonds mind something connected with his previous thoughts that business about forcing the hatch now what was it that had happened to that plane flying over persia back in bond sat for a while and stared with wide unseeing eyes at the back of the seat in front of him it might work it just conceivably might bond wrote on the inside of the napkin ill do my best fasten your seat belt xxx j when the girl came to take his tray bond dropped the napkin and then picked it up and handed it to her he held her hand and smiled up into the searching eyes she bent to pick up the tray she kissed him quickly on the cheek she straightened herself she said toughly ill see you in my dreams handsome and went off to the galley and now bonds mind was made up he had worked out exactly what had to be done the inches had been measured the knife from his heel was under his coat and he had twisted the longest end of his seat belt round his left wrist all he needed was one sign that oddjobs body was turned away from the window it would be too much to expect oddjob to go to sleep but at least he could make himself comfortable bonds eyes never left the dim profile he could see reflected in the perspex oblong of the window of the seat in front but oddjob sat stolidly under the reading light he had prudently kept burning his eyes staring at the ceiling his mouth slightly open and his hands held ready and relaxed on the arms of his chair one hour two hours bond began to snore rhythmically drowsily he hoped hypnotically now oddjobs hands had moved to his lap the head nodded once and pulled itself up shifted to get more comfortable turned away from the piercing eye of light in the wall rested on its left cheek away from the window bond kept his snores exactly even getting under the koreans guard would be as difficult as getting past a hungry mastiff slowly inch by inch he crouched forward on the balls of his feet and reached with his knife hand between the wall and oddjobs seat now his hand was there now the needlesharp tip of the dagger was aimed at the centre of the square inch of perspex he had chosen bond grasped the end of his seat belt tightly in his hand drew the knife back two inches and lunged bond had had no idea what would happen when he cut through the window all he knew from the press reports of the persian case was that the suction out of the pressurized cabin had whirled the passenger next to the window out through the window and into space now as he whipped back his dagger there was a fantastic howl almost a scream of air and bond was sucked violently against the back of oddjobs seat with a force that tore the end of the seat belt from his hand over the back of the seat he witnessed a miracle oddjobs body seemed to elongate towards the howling black aperture there was a crash as his head went through and his shoulders hit the frame then as if the koreans body was toothpaste it was slowly foot by foot sucked with a terrible whistling noise through the aperture now oddjob was out to his waist now the huge buttocks stuck and the human paste moved only inch by inch then with a loud boom the buttocks got through and the legs disappeared as if shot from a gun after that came the end of the world with an appalling crash of crockery from the galley the huge plane stood on its nose and dived the last thing bond knew before he blacked out was the high scream of the engines through the open window and a fleeting vision of pillows and rugs whipping out into space past his eyes then with a final desperate embrace of the seat in front bonds oxygenstarved body collapsed in a sear of lung pain the next thing bond felt was a hard kick in the ribs there was a taste of blood in his mouth he groaned again the foot smashed into his body painfully he dragged himself to his knees between the seats and looked up through a red film all the lights were on there was a thin mist in the cabin the sharp depressurization had brought the air in the cabin down below the dewpoint the roar of the engines through the open window was gigantic an icy wind seared him goldfinger stood over him his face fiendish under the yellow light there was a small automatic dead steady in his hand goldfinger reached back his foot and kicked again bond lit with a blast of hot rage he caught the foot and twisted it sharply almost breaking the ankle there came a scream from goldfinger and a crash that shook the plane bond leapt for the aisle and threw himself sideways and down on to the heap of body there was an explosion that burned the side of his face but then his knee thudded into goldfingers groin and his left hand was over the gun for the first time in his life bond went berserk with his fists and knees he pounded the struggling body while again and again he crashed his forehead down on to the glistening face the gun came quavering towards him again almost indifferently bond slashed sideways with the edge of his hand and heard the clatter of metal among the seats now goldfingers hands were at his throat and bonds at goldfingers down down went bonds thumbs into the arteries he threw all his weight forward gasping for breath would he black out before the other man died would he could he stand the pressure of goldfingers strong hands the glistening moonface was changing deep purple showed through the tan the eyes began to nicker up the pressure of the hands on bonds throat slackened the hands fell away now the tongue came out and lolled from the open mouth and there came a terrible gargling from deep in the lungs bond sat astride the silent chest and slowly one by one unhinged his rigid fingers bond gave a deep sigh and knelt and then stood slowly up dazedly he looked up and down the lighted plane by the galley pussy galore lay strapped in her seat like a heap of washing farther down in the middle of the aisle the guard lay spreadeagled one arm and the head at ridiculous angles without a belt to hold him when the plane dived he must have been tossed at the roof like a rag doll bond brushed his hands over his face now he felt the burns on his palm and cheeks wearily he went down on his knees again and searched for the little gun it was a colt automatic he flicked out the magazine three rounds left and one in the chamber bond half walked half felt his way down the aisle to where the girl lay he unbuttoned her jacket and put his hand against her warm breast the heart fluttered like a pigeon under his palm he undid the seat belt and got the girl face down on the floor and knelt astride her for five minutes he pumped rhythmically at her lungs when she began to moan he got up and left her and went on down the aisle and took a fully loaded luger out of the dead guards shoulder holster on the way back past the shambles of the galley he saw an unbroken bottle of bourbon rolling gently to and fro among the wreckage he picked it up and pulled the cork and tilted it into his open mouth the liquor burned like disinfectant he put the cork back and went forward he stopped for a minute outside the cockpit door thinking then with a gun in each hand he knocked the lever down and went through the five faces blue in the instrument lights turned towards him the mouths made black holes and the eyes glinted white here the roar of the engines was less there was a smell of frightsweat and cigarette smoke bond stood with his legs braced the guns held unwavering he said goldfingers dead if anyone moves or disobeys an order i shall kill him pilot whats your position course height and speed the pilot swallowed he had to gather saliva before he could speak he said sir we are about five hundred miles east of goose bay mr goldfinger said we would ditch the plane as near the coast north of there as we could get we were to reassemble at montreal and mr goldfinger said we would come back and salvage the gold our ground speed is two hundred and fifty miles per hour and our height two thousand how much flying can you do at that altitude you must be using up fuel pretty fast yes sir i estimate that we have about two hours left at this height and speed get me a time signal the navigator answered quickly just had one from washington sir five minutes to five am dawn at this level will be in about an hour where is weathership charlie about three hundred miles to the northeast sir pilot do you think you can make goose bay no sir by about a hundred miles we can only make the coast north of there right alter course for weathership charlie operator call them up and give me the mike yes sir while the plane executed a wide curve bond listened to the static and broken snatches of voice that sounded from the amplifier above his head the operators voice came softly to him ocean station charlie this is speedbird galgy calling c for charlie galgy calling charlie galgy a sharp voice broke in galgy give your position galgy give your position this is gander control emergency galgy london came over faintly an excited voice began chattering now voices were coming at them from all directions bond could imagine the fix being quickly coordinated at all flying control stations the busy men under the arcs working on the big plot telephones being lifted urgent voices talking to each other across the world the strong signal of gander control smothered all other transmissions weve located galgy weve got them at about n by e all stations stop transmitting priority i repeat we have a fix on galgy suddenly the quiet voice of c for charlie came in this is ocean station charlie calling speedbird charlie calling galgy can you hear me come in speedbird bond slipped the small gun into his pocket and took the offered microphone he pressed the transmitter switch and talked quietly into it watching the crew over the oblong of plastic c for charlie this is galgy speedbird hijacked last evening at idlewild i have killed the man responsible and partly disabled the plane by depressurizing the cabin i have the crew at gunpoint not enough fuel to make goose so propose to ditch as close to you as possible please put put line of flares a new voice a voice of authority perhaps the captains came over the air speedbird this is c for charlie your message heard and understood identify the speaker i repeat identify the speaker over bond said and smiled at the sensation his words would cause speedbird to c for charlie this is british secret service agent number repeat number whitehall radio will confirm i repeat check with whitehall radio over there was a stunned pause voices from round the world tried to break in some control presumably gander cleared them off the air c for charlie came back speedbird this is c for charlie alias the angel gabriel speaking okay ill check with whitehall and wilco the flares but london and gander want more details bond broke in sorry c for charlie but i cant hold five men in my sights and make polite conversation just give me the sea conditions would you

you on the radar and well keep constant watch on your wavelength have whisky for one and iroas for five waiting good luck over bond said thanks c for charlie add a cup of tea to that order would you ive got a pretty girl on board this is speedbird saying over and out bond released the switch and handed the microphone to the radio officer he said pilot theyre putting down flares and keeping constant watch on our wavelength wind force two long smooth swell with no broken crests now take it easy and lets try and get out of this alive as soon as we hit the water ill get the hatch open until then if anyone comes through the cockpit door he gets shot right the girls voice sounded from the door behind bond i was just coming to join the party but i wont now getting shot doesnt agree with me but you might call that man back and make it two whiskies tea makes me hiccup bond said pussy get back to your basket he gave a last glance round the cockpit and backed out of the door two hours two years later bond was lying in the warm cabin in weathership charlie listening dreamily to an early morning radio programme from canada various parts of his body ached he had got to the tail of the plane and made the girl kneel down with her head cradled in her arms on the seat of a chair then he had wedged himself in behind and over her and had held her lifejacketed body tightly in his arms and braced his back against the back of the seat behind him she had been nervously making facetious remarks about the indelicacy of this position when the belly of the stratocruiser had thudded into the first mountain of swell at a hundred miles an hour the huge plane skipped once and then crashed nose first into a wall of water the impact had broken the back of the plane the leaden weight of the bullion in the baggage compartment had torn the plane in half spewing bond and the girl out into the icy swell lit red by the line of flares there they had floated half stunned in their yellow lifejackets until the lifeboat got to them by then there were only a few chunks of wreckage on the surface and the crew with three tons of gold round their necks were on their way down to the bed of the atlantic the boat hunted for ten minutes but when no bodies came to the surface they gave up the search and chugged back up the searchlight beam to the blessed wall of iron of the old frigate they had been treated like a mixture of royally and people from mars bond had answered the first most urgent questions and then it had all suddenly seemed to be too much for his tired mind to cope with now he was lying luxuriating in the peace and the heat of the whisky and wondering about pussy galore and why she had chosen shelter under his wing rather than under goldfingers the connecting door with the next cabin opened and the girl came in she was wearing nothing but a grey fishermans jersey that was decent by half an inch the sleeves were rolled up she looked like a painting by vertes she said people keep on asking if id like an alcohol rub and i keep on saying that if anyones going to rub me its you and if im going to be rubbed with anything its you id like to be rubbed with she ended lamely so here i am bond said firmly lock that door pussy take off that sweater and come into bed youll catch cold she did as she was told like an obedient child she lay in the crook of bonds arm and looked up at him she said not in a gangsters voice or a lesbians but in a girls voice will you write to me in sing sing bond looked down into the deep blueviolet eyes that were no longer hard imperious he bent and kissed them lightly he said they told me you only liked women she said i never met a man before the toughness came back into her voice i come from the south you know the definition of a virgin down there well its a girl who can run faster than her brother in my case i couldnt run as fast as my uncle i was twelve thats not so good james you ought to be able to guess that bond smiled down into the pale beautiful face he said all you need is a course of tlc whats tlc short for tender loving care treatment its what they write on most papers when a waif gets brought in to a childrens clinic id like that she looked at the passionate rather cruel mouth waiting above hers she reached up and brushed back the comma of black hair that had fallen over his right eyebrow she looked into the fiercely slitted grey eyes whens it going to start bonds right hand came slowly up the firm muscled thighs over the flat soft plain of the stomach to the right breast its point was hard with desire he said softly now his mouth came ruthlessly down on hers
