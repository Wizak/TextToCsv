john mortimer rumpole rumpole of the bailey contents rumpole and the younger generation rumpole and the alternative society rumpole and the honourable member rumpole and the married lady rumpole and the learned friends rumpole and the heavy brigade for irene shubik rumpole and the younger generation i horace rumpole barrister at law next birthday old bailey hack husband to mrs hilda rumpole and father to nicholas rumpole i who have a mind full of old murders legal anecdotes and memorable fragments of the oxford book of english verse together with a dependable knowledge of bloodstains blood groups fingerprints and forgery by typewriter i who am now the oldest member of my chambers take up my pen at this advanced age during a lull in business in order to write my reconstructions of some of my recent triumphs in the courts of law hoping thereby to turn a bob or two which wont be immediately grabbed by the taxman or my clerk henry or by she who must be obeyed and perhaps give some sort of entertainment to those who like myself have found in british justice a lifelong subject of harmless fun when i first considered putting pen to paper in this matter of my life i thought i must begin with the great cases of my comparative youth the penge bungalow murder where i gained an acquittal alone and without a leader or the great brighton benefit club forgery which i contrived to win by reason of my exhaustive study of typewriters in these cases i was for a brief moment in the public eye or at least my name seemed almost a permanent feature of the news of the world but when i come to look back on that period of my life at the bar it all seems to have happened to another rumpole an eager young barrister whom i can scarcely recognize and whom i am not at all sure i would like at least not enough to spend a whole book with him i am not a public figure now so much has to be admitted but some of the cases i shall describe the wretched business of the honourable member for instance or the charge of murder brought against the youngest and barmiest of the appalling delgardo brothers did put me back on the front page of the news of the world but i suppose i have become pretty well known if not something of a legend round the old bailey in pommeroys wine bar in fleet street in the robing room at london sessions and in the cells at brixton prison they know me there for never pleading guilty for chainsmoking small cigars and for quoting wordsworth when they least expect it such notoriety will not long survive my nottobedelayed trip to golders green crematorium barristers speeches vanish quicker than chinese dinners and even the greatest victory in court rarely survives longer than the next sundays papers to understand the full effect on my family life however of that case which i have called rumpole and the younger generation it is necessary to know a little of my past and the long years that led up to my successful defence of jim timson the yearold sprig the young hopeful and apple of the eye of the timsons a huge and industrious family of south london villains as this case was by and large a family matter it is important that you should understand my family my father the reverend wilfred rumpole was a church of england clergyman who in early middle age came reluctantly to the conclusion that he no longer believed any one of the articles as he was not fitted by character or training for any other profession however he had to soldier on in his living in croydon and by a good deal of scraping and saving he was able to send me as a boarder to a minor public school on the norfolk coast i later went to keble college oxford where i achieved a dubious third in law you will discover during the course of these memoirs that although i only feel truly alive and happy in law courts i have a singular distaste for the law my fathers example and the number of theological students i met at keble gave me an early mistrust of clergymen whom i have always found to be most unsatisfactory witnesses if you call a clergyman in mitigation the old darling can be guaranteed to add at least a year to the sentence when i first went to the bar i entered the chambers of c h wystan wystan had a moderate practice acquired rather by industry than talent and a strong disinclination to look at the photographs in murder cases being particularly squeamish on the fascinating subject of blood he also had a daughter hilda wystan as was now mrs hilda rumpole and she who must be obeyed i was ambitious in those days i did my best to cultivate wystans clerk albert and i started to get a good deal of criminal work i did what was expected of me and spent happy hours round the bailey and sessions and my fame grew in criminal circles at the end of the day i would take albert for a drink in pommeroys wine bar we got on extremely well and he would always recommend his mr rumpole if a solicitor rang up with a particularly tricky indecent assault or a nasty case of receiving stolen property there is no point in writing your memoirs unless you are prepared to be completely candid and i must confess that in the course of a long life i have been in love on several occasions i am sure that i loved miss porter the shy and nervous but at times liberated daughter of septimus porter my oxford tutor in roman law in fact we were engaged to be married but the engagement had to be broken off because of miss porters early death i often think about her and of the different course my home life might have taken for miss porter was in no way a girl born to command or expect implicit obedience during my service with the ground staff of the raf i undoubtedly became helplessly smitten with the charms of an extremely warmhearted and gallant officer in the waafs by the name of miss bobby okeefe but i was no match for the wings of a pilot officer as appeared on the chest of a certain sam threefingers dogherty during my conduct of a case which i shall describe in a later chapter which i have called rumpole and the alternative society i once again felt a hopeless and almost feverish stirring of passion for a young woman who was determined to talk her way into holloway prison my relationship with hilda wystan was rather different to begin with she seemed part of life in chambers she was always interested in the law and ambitious first for her widowed father and then when he proved himself unlikely lord chancellor material for me she often dropped in for tea on her way home from shopping and wystan used to invite me in for a cup one year i was detailed off to be her partner at an inns of court ball there it became clear to me that i was expected to marry hilda it seemed a step in my career like getting a brief in the court of appeal or doing a murder when she proposed to me as she did over a glass of claret cup after an energetic waltz hilda made it clear that when old wystan finally retired she expected to see me head of chambers i who have never felt at a loss for a word in court found absolutely nothing to say in that silence the matter was concluded so now you must picture hilda and me twentyfive years later with a son at that same east coast public school which i just managed to afford from the fruits of crime in our matrimonial home at froxbury court gloucester road we were having breakfast and between bites of toast i was reading my brief for that day an old bailey trial of the yearold jim timson charged with robbery with violence he having allegedly taken part in a wage snatch on a couple of elderly butchers an escapade planned in the playground of the local comprehensive as so often happens the poet wordsworth that old sheep of the lake district sprang immediately to mind and i gave tongue to his lines well knowing that they must only serve to irritate she who must be obeyed trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home heaven lies about us in our infancy i looked at hilda she was impassively demolishing a boiled egg i also noticed that she was wearing a hat as if prepared to set out upon some expedition i decided to give her a little more wordsworth prompted by my reading the story of the boy timson shades of the prison house begin to close upon the growing boy hilda spoke at last rumpole youre not talking about your son i hope youre never referring to nick shades of the prison house begin to close not round our son of course not round nick shades of the public school have grown round him the thousandquidayear remand home hilda always thought it indelicate to refer to the subject of school fees as if being at mulstead were a kind of unsolicited honour for nick she became increasingly businesslike hes breaking up this morning shades of the prison house begin to open up for the holidays nick has to be met at at liverpool street and given lunch when he went back to school you promised him a show you havent forgotten hilda was clearing away the plates rapidly to tell the truth i had forgotten the date of nicks holidays but i let her assume i had a long planned treat laid on for him of course i havent forgotten the only show i can offer him is a robbery with violence in number court at the old bailey i wish i could lay on a murder nicks always so enjoyed my murders it was true on one distant half term nick had sat in on the peckham billiard hall stabbing and enjoyed it a great deal more than treasure island i must fly daddy gets so crotchety if anyones late and he does love his visits hilda removed my halfempty coffee cup our father which art in horsham give my respects to the old sweetheart it had also slipped my mind that old c h wystan was laid up with a dicky ticker in horsham general hospital the hat was no doubt a clue i should have followed hilda usually goes shopping in a headscarf by now she was at the door and looking disapproving old sweetheart is hardly how you used to talk of the head of your chambers somehow i can never remember to call the head of my chambers daddy the door was open hilda was making a slow and effective exit tell nick ill be back in good time to get his supper your wish is my command i muttered in my best imitation of a slave out of chou chin chow she chose to ignore it and try not to leave the kitchen looking as though its been hit by a bomb i hear oh master of the blue horizons i said this with a little more confidence as she had by now started off on her errand of mercy and i added for good measure she who must be obeyed i had finished my breakfast and was already thinking how much easier life with the old bailey judge was than marriage soon after i finished my breakfast with hilda and made plans to meet my son at the start of his holidays from school fred timson star of a dozen court appearances was seeing his son in the cells under the old bailey as the result of a specially arranged visit i know he brought the boy his best jacket which his mother had taken specially to the cleaners and insisted on his putting on a tie i imagine he told him that they had the best brief in the business to defend him mr rumpole having always done wonders for the timson family i know that fred told young jim to stand up straight in the witness box and remember to call the judge my lord and not show his ignorance by coming out with any gaffe such as your honour or sir the world that day was full of fathers showing appropriate and paternal concern the robbery with which jim timson was charged was an exceedingly simple one at about pm one friday evening the date being september the two elderly brixton butchers mr cadwallader and mr lewis stein closed their shop in bombay road and walked with their weeks takings round the corner to a narrow alleyway known as greens passage where their grey austin van was parked when they got to the van they found that the front tyres had been deflated they stooped to inspect the wheels and as they did so they were attacked by a number of boys some armed with knives and one flourishing a cricket stump luckily neither of the butchers was hurt but the attache case containing their money was snatched chief inspector persil white the old darling in whose territory this outrage had been committed arrested jim timson all the other boys got clean away but no doubt because he came from a family well known indeed almost embarrassingly familiar to the chief inspector and because of certain rumours in the school playground he was charged and put on an identity parade the butchers totally failed to identify him but when he was in the remand centre young jim according to the evidence had boasted to another boy of having done the butchers as i thought about this case on my way to the temple that morning it occured to me that jim timson was a year younger than my son but that he had got a step further than nick in following his fathers profession i had always hoped nick would go into the law and as i say he seemed to thoroughly enjoy my murders in the clerks room in chambers albert was handing out the work for the day rather as a trainer sends his string of horses out on the gallops i looked round the familiar faces my friend george frobisher who is an old sweetheart but an absolutely hopeless advocate was being fobbed off with a nuisance at kingston county court young erskinebrown who wears striped shirts and what i believe are known as chelsea boots was turning up his wellbred nose at an indecent assault at lambeth and saying he would prefer a little civil work adding that he was sick to death of crime i have very little patience with erskinebrown a person who is tired of crime i told him quite candidly is tired of life your dangerous and careless at clerkenwell is on the mantelpiece mr hoskins albert said hoskins is a gloomy fellow with four daughters hes always lurking about our clerks room looking for cheques as ive told him often enough crime doesnt pay or at any rate not for a very long time when a young man called maclay had asked in vain for a brief i invited him to take a note for me down at the old bailey at least hed get a wig on and not spend a miserable day unemployed in chambers our oldest member uncle tom also asked albert if there were any briefs for him not in the least expecting to find one to my certain knowledge uncle tom hasnt appeared in court for fifteen years when he managed to lose an undefended divorce case but as he lives with a widowed sister a lady of such reputed ferocity that she makes she who must be obeyed sound like mrs tiggywinkle he spends most of his time in chambers he looks remarkably well for you arent actually expecting a brief uncle tom are you erskinebrown asked i cant like erskinebrown time was uncle tom started one of his reminiscences of life in our chambers time was when i had more briefs in my corner of the mantelpiece erskinebrown than youve seen in the whole of your short career at the bar now he was opening a brown envelope i only get invitations to insure my life its a little late for that albert told me that the robbery was not before before mr justice everglade in number i court he also told me who was prosecuting none other than the tall elegant figure with the silk handkerchief and gold wristwatch leaning against the mantelpiece and negligently reading a large cheque from the director of public prosecutions guthrie featherstone mp he removed the silk handkerchief dabbed the end of his nose and his small moustache and asked in that voice which comes over so charmingly saying nothing much about any important topic of the day in world at one agin me rumpole are you agin me he covered a slight yawn with the handkerchief before returning it to his breast pocket just come from an allnight sitting down at the house i dont suppose your robbery will be much of a worry only possibly to young jim timson i told him and then gave albert his orders for the day mrs rumpoles gone down to see her father in horsham how is wystan no better is he uncle tom sounded as gently pleased as all old men do when they hear news of illness in others much the same uncle tom thank you and young nick my son master nick albert had always been fond of nick and looked forward to putting him through his paces when the time came for him to join our stable in chambers hes breaking up today so hell need meeting at liverpool street then he can watch a bit of the robbery were going to have your son in the audience id better be brilliant guthrie featherstone now moved from the fireplace you neednt bother old darling its his dad he comes to see oh touch rumpole distinctement tauchil featherstone talks like that then he invited me to walk down to the bailey with him apparently he was still capable of movement and didnt need a stretcher even after a sleepless night with the gas mains enabling bill or whatever it was we walked together down fleet street and into ludgate circus featherstone wearing his overcoat with the velvet collar and little round bowler hat i puffing a small cigar and with my old mac flapping in the wind i discovered that the gentleman beside me was quietly quizzing me about my career at the bar youve been at this game a long while rumpole featherstone announced i didnt disagree with him and then he went on you never thought of taking silk rumpole qc i almost burst out laughing not on your nelly rumpole queer customer thats what theyd be bound to call me im sure you could with your seniority i had no idea then of exactly what this featherstone was after i gave him my view of qcs in general perhaps if i played golf with the right judges or put up for parliament they might make me an artificial silk or at any rate a nylon it was at that point i realized i had put up a bit of a black sorry i forgot you did put up for parliament yes you never thought of rumpole qc featherstone had apparently taken no offence never i told him i have the honour to be an old bailey hack thats quite enough for me at which point we turned up into newgate street and there it was in all its glory touched by a hint of early spring sunshine the old bailey a stately law court decreed by the city fathers an edwardian palace with an extensive modern extension to deal with the increase in human fallibility there was the dome and the blindfold lady well its much better she doesnt see all thats going on that in fact was our english version of the palais de justice complete with murals marble statues and underground accommodation for some of the choicest villains in london terrible things go on down the bailey horrifying things why is it i never go in the revolving door without a thrill of pleasure a slight tremble of excitement why does it seem a much jollier place than my flat in gloucester road under the strict rule of she who must be obeyed these are questions which may only be partly answered in the course of these memoirs at the time when i was waving a cheerful umbrella at harry the policeman in the revolving door of the old bailey extension my wife hilda was at her daddys bedside at the horsham general arranging her dozen early daffs and gently probing so she told me that evening on the subject of his future and mine ill have to give up you know i cant go on forever crocked up im afraid said wystan nonsense daddy youll go on for years i imagine hilda did her best to sound bracing whilst putting the daffs firmly in their place no hilda no theyll have to start looking for another head of chambers this gave hilda her opportunity rumpoles the senior man apart from uncle tom and he doesnt really practice nowadays your husband the senior man wystan looked back on a singularly uneventful life how time flies i recall when he was the junior man my pupil you said he was the best youngster on bloodstains youd ever known hilda was doing her best for me rumpole yes your husband was pretty good on bloodstains shaky though on the law of landlord and tenant what sort of practice has rumpole now i believe today its the old bailey hilda was plumping pillows doing her best to sound casual and her father showed no particular enthusiasm for my place of work its always the old bailey isnt it most of the time yes i suppose so not a frightfully good address the old bailey not exactly the swi of the legal profession sensing that daddy would have thought better of me if id been in the court of appeal or the chancery division hilda told me she thought of a master stroke oh rumpole only went down to the bailey because its a family he knows it seems theyve got a young boy in trouble this appealed to daddy he gave one of his bleak smiles which amount to no more than a brief withdrawal of lips from the dentures son gone wrong he said very sad that especially if he comes of a really good family that really good family the timsons was out in force and waiting outside number i court by the time i had got on the fancy dress yellowing horsehair wig gown become more than a trifle tattered over the years and bands round the neck that albert ought to have sent to the laundry after last weeks death by dangerous driving as i looked at the timson clan assembled i thought the best thing about them was the amount of work of a criminal nature they had brought into chambers they were all dressed for the occasion the men in dark blazers suede shoes and grey flannels the ladies in tightfitting suits high heels and elaborately piled hairdos i had never seen so many exclients together at one time mr rumpole ah bernard youre instructing me mr bernard the solicitor was a thirtyish perpetually smiling man in a pinstriped suit he regarded criminals with something of the naive fervour with which young girls think of popular entertainers had i known the expression at the time i would have called him a grafters groupie im always your instructing solicitor in a timson case mr rumpole mr bernard beamed and fred timson a kindly man and most innocent robber stepped out of the ranks to do the honours nothing but the best for the timsons best solicitor and best barrister going you know my wife vi young jims mother seemed full of confidence as i took her hand i remembered i had got vi off on a handling charge after the croydon bank raid well there was really no evidence uncle cyril fred introduced the plumpish uncle with the small moustache whom i was sure i remembered what was his last outing exactly carrying housebreaking instruments by night uncle dennis you remember den surely mr rumpole i did dens last little matter was an alleged conspiracy to forge log books and dens doris aunty doris came at me in a blur of hennaed hair and darkish perfume what was doriss last indiscretion could it have been receiving a vast quantity of stolen scampi acquitted by a majority at least i was sure of that and yours truly frederick timson the boys father regrettable but we had a slipup with freds last spot of bother i was away with flu george frobisher took it over and he got three years he mustve only just got out so mr rumpole you know the whole family a family to breed from the timsons must almost keep the old bailey going singlehanded youre going to do your best for our young jim im sure mr rumpole i didnt find the simple faith of the timsons that i could secure acquittals in the most unlikely circumstances especially encouraging but then jims mother said something which i was to long remember hes a good boy he was ever so good to me while dad was away so that was jimbos life head of the family at fourteen when dad was off on one of his regular visits to her majesty its young jims first appearance like at the old bailey fred couldnt conceal a note of pride it was jim boys bar mitzvah his first communion so we chatted a little about how all the other boys got clean away which i told them was a bit of luck as none of them would go into the witness box and implicate jim and bernard pointed out that the identification by the butchers was pretty hopeless well what did he expect would you have a photographic impression of the young hopeful who struck you a smart blow on the back of the head with a cricket stump we talked with that curious suppressed excitement there always is before a trial however disastrous the outcome may be and i told them the only thing we had to worry about as if that were not enough was jims confession to the boy in the remand centre a youth who rejoiced in the name of peanuts malloy peanuts malloy little grass fred timson spoke with a deep contempt old persil white fitted him up with that one didnt he uncle cyril said it as if it were the most natural thing in the world and only to be expected chief detective inspector white bernard explained why should the chief inspector want to fit up your jimbo it was a question to which i should have known what their answer would be because hes a timson thats why said fred because hes the apple of our eye like uncle den told me and the boys mother added being as hes the baby of the family old persild fit up his mother if itd get him a smile from his super as fred said this the chief inspector himself greyhaired and avuncular walked by in plain clothes with a plainclothes sergeant morning chief inspector fred carried on without drawing breath morning fred morning mrs timson the chief inspector greeted the family with casual politeness after all they were part of his daily work and vi sniffed back a good morning chief inspector mr timson well shift our ground remove good friends like hamlet after seeing the ghost i thought it was better to continue our conference in private so we went and sat round a table in the canteen and when we had sorted out who took how many lumps and which of them could do with a choc roll or a cheese sandwich the family gave me the lowdown on the chief prosecution witness the chief inspector put that little grass peanuts molloy into jims painting class at the remand centre fred had no doubt about it jim apparently poured out his soul to peanuts the evidence sounded to my old ears completely convincing and bernard read us a snatch from his file we planned to do the old blokes from the butchers and grab the wages that i reminded the assembled company is what peanuts will say jim told him you think id bring jim up to talk in the nick like that the timsons aint stupid fred was outraged and vi pursing her lips in a sour gesture of wounded respectability added his dads always told him never say a word to anyone youre banged up with bound to be a grass one by one aunty doris uncle den and uncle cyril added their support thats right freds always brought the boy up proper like the way he should be hed never speak about the crime not to anyone he was banged up with specially not to one of the molloys the molloys vi spoke for the timsons and with deep hatred noted grasses that family always has been the molloys is beyond the pale well known for it aunty doris nodded her hennaed topknot wisely peanutss grandad shopped my old father in the streatham coop robbery prewar that was i had a vague memory then of what fred timson was talking about the streatham coop case one of my better briefs a long case with not much honour shown among thieves as far as i could remember then you can understand mr rumpole no timson would ever speak to a molloy so youre sure jimbo never said anything to peanuts i was wondering exactly how i could explain the deep but not particularly creditable origins of this family hostility to the jury i give you my word mr rumpole aint that enough for you no timson would ever speak to a molloy not under any circumstances there were not many matters on which i wouldtake fred timsons word but the history of the streatham coop case came back to me and this was one of them its part of the life of an old bailey hack to spend a good deal of his time down in the cells in the basement area where they keep the old door of newgate kicked and scarred through which generations of villains were sent to the treadmill the gallows or the whip you pass this venerable door and ring a bell youre let in and your names taken by one of the warders who bring the prisoners from brixton theres a perpetual smell of cooking and the warders are snatching odd snacks of six inches of cheese butties and a gallon of tea lunch is being got ready and the cells under the bailey have a high reputation as one of the best caffs in london by the door the screws have their pinups and comic cartoons of judges you are taken to a waitingroom three steel chairs and a table and you meet the client perhaps he is a novice making his first appearance like jim timson perhaps hes an old hand asking anxiously which judge hes got knowing their form as accurately as a bettingshop proprietor whoever he is the client will be nervously excited keyed up for his great day full of absurd hope the worst part of a barristers life at the old bailey is going back to the cells after a guilty verdict to say goodbye theres no purpose in it but as a point of honour it has to be done even then the barrister probably gets the best reaction and almost never any blame the client is stunned knocked out by his sentence only in a couple of weeks time when the reality of being banged up with the sour smell of stone walls and his own chamber pot for company becomes apparent does the convict start to weep he is then drugged with sedatives and agatha christies from the prison library when i saw the youngest timson before his trial that morning i couldnt help noticing how much smaller and how much more experienced he looked than my nick in his clean sports jacket and carefully knotted tie he was well dressed for the dock and he showed all the carefully suppressed excitement of a young lad about to step into the limelight of number i with an old judge twelve jurors and a mixed bag of lawyers waiting to give him their undivided attention me speak to peanuts no timson dont ever speak to a molloy its a point of honour like jim added his voice to the family chorus since the raid on the streatham coop your grandfather dad told you about that did he yes dad told me well dad wouldnt let me speak to no molloy he wouldnt put up with it like i stood up grinding out the stub end of my small cigar in the old oxo tin thoughtfully provided by hms government it was i thought about time i called the meeting to order so jim i asked him whats the defence little jim knitted his brows and came out with his contributionwell i didnt do it thats an interesting defence somewhat novel so far as the timsons are concerned ive got my alibi aint i jim looked at me accusingly as at an insensitive visitor to a garden who has failed to notice the remarkable display of gladioli oh yes your alibi im afraid i didnt sound overwhelmed with enthusiasm dad reckoned it was pretty good mr bernard had his invaluable file open and was reading from that lessthaninspiring document our notice of alibi straight from school on that friday september nd i went up to tea at my aunty doriss and arrived there at exactly at pm my uncle den came home from work accompanied by my uncle cyril at pm when this alleged crime was taking place i was sat round the television with my aunty and two uncles i well remember we was watching the newcomers all very neat and workmanlike well that was it the family gave young jim an alibi clubbed together for it like a new bicycle however i had to disappoint mr bernard about the bright shining alibi and we went through the swing doors on our way into court we cant use that alibi we cant mr bernard look wounded as if id just insulted his favourite child think about it bernard dont be blinded by the glamour of the criminal classes call the uncles and the aunties let them all be crossexamined about their records the jury realize our jimbo comes from a family of villains who keep a cupboard full of alibis for all occasions mr bernard was forced to agree but i went into my old place in court thinking that the devilish thing about that impossible alibi was that it might even be true so there i was sitting in my favourite seat in court down in the firing line and there was jim boy undersized for a prisoner just peeping over the edge of the dock guarded in case he ran amok and started attacking the judge by a huge dock officer there was the jury solid and grey listening impassionately as guthrie featherstone spread out his glittering mass of incriminating facts before them i dont know why it is that juries all look the same take twelve good men and women off the street and they all look middleaged anonymous slightly stunned an average jury of average people trying an average case perhaps being a jury has become a special profession for specially average people what do you want to do when you grow up my boy be a jury man daddy well done my boy you can work a fivehour day for reasonable expenses and occasionally send people to chokey so as the carefully chosen words of guthrie featherstone passed over our heads like expensive hair oil and as the enthusiastic young maclay noted it all down and the rumpole supporters club the timsons sat and pursed their lips and now and then whispered lies all lies to each other i sat watching the judge rather as a noted toreador watches the bull from the barrier during the preliminary stages of the corrida and remembered what i knew of mr justice everglade known to his few friends as florrie everglades father was lord chancellor about the time when jims grandfather was doing over the streatham coop educated at winchester and balliol he always cracked the times crossword in the opening of an egg he was most happy with international trust companies suing each other on nice points of law and was only there for a fortnights slumming down the old bailey i wondered exactly what he was going to make of peanuts molloy members of the jury its right that you should know that it is alleged that timson took part in this attack with a number of other youths none of whom have been arrested featherstone was purring to a halt the boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled i muttered but the judge was busy congratulating learned counsel for her majesty the queen who was engaged that morning in prosecuting the pride of the timsons it is quite right you should tell the jury that mr featherstone perfectly right and proper if your lordship pleases featherstone was now bowing slightly and my hackles began to rise what was this the old chumsleague fellow members of the athenaeum i am most grateful to your lordship for that indication featherstone did his wellknown butler passing the sherry act again i wondered why the old darling didnt crawl up on the bench with mr justice everglade and black his boots for him so i imagine this young mans defence is he wasnt ejusdem generis with the other lads the judge was now holding a private conversation a mutual admiration society with my learned friend i decided to break it up and levered myself to my feet i m sorry your lordship was asking about the defence the judge turned an unfriendly eye on me and fumbled for my name i told you he was a stranger to the old bailey where the name of rumpole is i think tolerably well known yes mr er the clerk of the court handed him up a note on which the defenders name was inscribed rumpole i am reluctant to intrude on your lordships confidential conversation with my learned friend but your lordship was asking about the defence you are appearing for the young man timson i have that honour at which point the doors of the court swung open and albert came in with nick a boy in a blazer and a schooltie who passed the boy in the dock with only a glance of curiosity i always thank god when i consider the remote politeness with which i was treated by the reverend wilfred rumpole that i get on extremely well with nick we understand each other my boy and i and have when hes at home formed a strong but silent alliance against the almost invincible rule of she who must be obeyed he is as fond as i am of the sherlock holmes tales and when we walked together in hyde park and kensington gardens young nick often played the part of holmes whilst i trudged beside him as watson trying to deduce the secret lives of those we passed by the way they shined their shoes or kept their handkerchiefs in their sleeves so i gave a particularly welcoming smile to nick before i gave my attention back to florrie and as jim timsons counsel i told his lordship i might know a little more about his case than counsel for the prosecution to which mr justice everglade trotted out his favourite bit of latin i imagine he said loftily your client says he was not ejusdemgeneris with the other lads ejusdem generis oh yes my lord hes always saying that ejusdem generis is a phrase in constant use in his particular part ofbrixton i had hit a minor jackpot and was rewarded with a tinkle of laughter from the timsons and a smile of genuine congratulation from nick mr justice everglade was inexperienced down the bailey he gave us a bare hour for lunch and nick and i had it in the canteen there is one thing you can say against crime the catering facilities arent up to much nick told me about school and freely confessed as im sure he wouldnt have done to his mother that hed been in some sort of trouble that term there was an old deserted vicarage opposite schoolhouse and he and his friends had apparently broken in the scullery window and assembled there for poker parties and the consumption of cherry brandy i was horrified as i drew up the indictment which seemed to me to contain charges of burglary at common law house breaking under the forcible entries act contravening the betting gaming lotteries act and serving alcohol on unlicensed premises crabtree actually invited a couple of girls from the village nick continued his confession but bagnold never got to hear of that bagnold was nicks headmaster the school equivalent of persil white i cheered up a little at the last piece of information then theres no evidence of girls as far as your case goes theres no reason to suppose the girls ever existed as for the other charges which are serious yes yes i suppose they are rather i imagine you were walking past the house on sunday evening and attracted by the noise you went to investigate dad bagnold came in and found us playing poker nick wasnt exactly being helpful i tried another line i know my lord my client was only playing poker in order not to look too pious whilst he lectured his fellow sixth formers on the evils of gambling and cherry brandy dad be serious i am serious dont you want me to defend you no bagnolds not going to tell the police or anything like that i was amazed he isnt whats he going to do well ill miss next terms exeat do extra work i thought i should tell you before you got a letter thank you nick thank you im glad you told me so theres no question of the police the police nick was laughing of course not bagnold doesnt want any trouble after all were still at school i watched nick as he finished his fish and chips and then turned my thoughts to jim timson who had also been at school but with no kindly bagnold to protect him back in court i was crossexamining that notable grass peanuts molloy a skinnier more furtive edition of jim timson the crossexamination was being greatly enjoyed by the timsons and nick but not much by featherstone or chief detective inspector persit white who sat at the table in front of me i also thought that mr justice florrie everglade was thinking that he would have been happier snoozing in the athenaeum or working on his grossepoint in egerton terrace than listening to me bowling fast inswingers at the juvenile chief witness for the prosecution you dont speak the molloys and the timsons are like the montagues and the capulets i put it to peanuts what did you say they were the judge had of course given me my opportunity i smacked him through the slips for a crafty single not ejusdem generis my lord i said nick joined in the laughter and even the ranks of featherstone had to stifle a smile the usher called silence we were back to the business in hand tell me peanuts how would you describe yourself is that a proper question featherstone uncoiled himself gracefully i ignored the interruption i mean artistically are you a latterday impressionist do all your oils in little dots do you abstract painter white squares on a white background do you indulge in watches melting in the desert like dear old salvador dali i dont know what youre talking about peanuts played a blocking shot and featherstone tried a weary smile to the judge my lord neither i must confess do i sit quietly featherstonej i muttered to him all will be revealed to you i turned my attention back to peanuts are you a dedicated artist the rembrandt of the remand centre i hadnt done no art before peanuts confirmed my suspicions so we are to understand that this occasion when jim poured out his heart to you was the first painting lesson youd ever been to peanuts admitted it youd been at the remand centre how long couple of months i was done for a bit of an affray i didnt ask you that and im sure the reason you were on remand was entirely creditable what i want to know is what inspired you with this sudden fascination for the arts well the chief screw he suggested it now we were beginning to get to the truth of the matter like his old grandfather in the streatham coop days jim had been banged up with a notable grass you were suddenly told to join the painting class werent you and put yourself next to jim something like that yeah what did he say florrie frowned it was all very strange to him and yet he was starting to get the hint of something that wasnt quite cricket something like that my lord i repeated slowly giving the judge a chance to make a note and you were sent there not in the pursuit of art peanuts but in the pursuit of evidence you knew that and you supplied your masters with just what they wanted to hear even though jim timson didnt say a word to you everyone in court including nick looked impressed di white bit hard on a polo mint and featherstone oozed to his feet in a rescue bid thats great dad thanks nick sorry its not a murder i dont know quite what my learned friend is saying is he suggesting that the police oh its an old trick i said staring hard at the chief inspector bang the suspect up with a notable grass when youre really pushed for evidence they do it with grownups often enough now theyre trying it with children mr rumpole the judge sighed you are speaking a language which is totally foreign to me let me try and make myself clear my lord i was suggesting that peanuts was put there as a deliberate trap by now even the judge had the point you are suggesting that mr molloy was not a genuine amateur painter no my lord merely an amateur witness yes i actually got a faint smile i see please go on mr rumpole another day or so of this i felt and id get invited to tea at the athenaeum what did you say first to jim as you drew your easel alongside dont remember dont you i think we was speaking about the stones what stones are these the judges ignorance of the life around him seemed to be causing him some sort of wild panic remember this was and i was in a similar state of confusion until nick whispering from behind me gave me the clue the rolling stones my lord the information meant nothing to him im afraid a great deal of this case seems to be taking place in a foreign tongue mr rumpole jazz musicians as i understand it my lord of some notoriety by courtesy of nick i filled his lordship in on the scene well the notoriety hasnt reached me said the judge providing the obedient featherstone with the laugh of the year if not the century when the learned prosecuting counsel had recovered his solemnity peanuts went rambling on we was talking about the stones concert at the hammersmith odeon wed both been to it like and well we talked about that and then he said jim said well he said as how he and the other blokes had done the butchers the conversation had now taken a nasty turn i saw that the judge was writing industriously jim said that he and the other blokes had done the butchers florrie was plying his pencil then he looked up at me well mr rumpole is that a convenient moment to adjourn it was a very convenient moment for the prosecution as the evidence against us would be the last thing the jury heard before sloping off to their homes and loved ones it was also a convenient moment for peanuts he would have his second wind by the morning so there was nothing for it but to take nick for a cup of tea and a pile of crumpets in the abc and so home to she who must be obeyed so picture us three that evening finishing dinner and a bottle of claret celebrating the return of the young master at hack hall counsels castle rumpole manor or froxbury court gloucester road hilda had told nick that his grandpa had sent his love and expected a letter and also dropped me the encouraging news that old ch wystan was retiring and quite appreciated that i was the senior man nick asked me if i was really going to be head of chambers seeming to look at me with a new respect and we drank a glass of claret to the future whatever it might be then nick asked me if i really thought peanuts molloy was lying if hes not hes giving a damn good imitation then i told hilda as she started to clear away nick enjoyed the case even though it was only a robbery oh nick i wish youd been there to hear me crossexamine about the bloodstains in the penge bungalow murder nick wasnt born when you did the penge bungalow murder my wife is always something of a wet blanket i commiserated with my son bad luck old boy you were great with that judge i think nick had really enjoyed himself there was this extraordinary judge who was always talking latin and dad was teasing him you want to be careful hilda was imposing her will on the pudding plates how you tease judges if youre to be head of chambers on which line she departed leaving nick and i to our claret and conversation i began to discuss with nick the horrifying adventure of the speckled band youre still reading those tales are you i asked nick well not lately but you remember i used to read them to you didnt i after she had ordered you to bed when you werent too busy noting up your murders and remember we were holmes and watson when we went for walks in hyde park i remember one walk that was odd as i recall it had been our custom ever at a weekend before nick went away to boarding school i lit a small cigar and looked at the great detective through the smoke tell me holmes what did you think was the most remarkable piece of evidence given by the witness peanuts molloy when he said they talked about the rolling stones holmes you astonish me you see watson we were led to believe they were such enemies i mean the families were theyd never spoken i see what youre driving at have another glass of claret stimulates the detective ability i opened another bottle a clatter from the kitchen telling me that the lady was not about to join us and there they were chatting about a pop concert didnt that strike you as strange my dear watson it struck me as bloody rum if you want to know the truth holmes i was delighted to see nick taking over the case theyd both been to the concert well that doesnt mean anything not necessarily i mean was at that concert were you indeed it was at the end of the summer holidays i dont remember you mentioning it i said i was going to the festival hall i found this confidence pleasing knowing that it wasnt to be shared with hilda very wise your mother no doubt feels that at the hammersmith odeon they reenact some of the worst excesses of the roman empire you didnt catch sight of peanuts and young jimbo did you there were about two thousand fans all screaming i dont know if it helps no if they were old mates i mean jim might really have confided in him all tht same peanuts is lying andrew noticed it youve got the instinct nick youve got a nose for the evidence your career at the bar is bound to be brilliant i raised my glass to nick when are you taking silk shortly after this she entered with news that nick had a dentists appointment the next day which would prevent his reappearance down the bailey all the same he had given me a great deal of help and before i went to bed i telephoned bernard the solicitor tore him away from his fireside and instructed him to undertake some pretty immediate research next morning albert told me that hed had a letter from old ch wystan hildas daddy mentioning his decision to retire i think well manage pretty well with you mr rumpole as head of chambers albert told me theres not much you and i wont be able to sort out sir over a glass or two in pommeroys wine bar and soon well be welcoming master nick in chambers nick well yes i had to admit it he is showing a certain legal aptitude itll be a real family affair mr rumpole like father like son if you want my opinion i remembered alberts words when i saw fred timson waiting for me outside the court but before i had time to brood on family tradition bernard came up with the rolledup poster for a pop concert i grabbed it from him and carried it as unobtrusively as possible into court when jim told you hed done up the butchers he didnt tell you the date that that had happened peanuts was back facing the bowling and featherstone was up to his usual tricks rising to interrupt my lord the date is set out quite clearly in the indictment the time had come quite obviously for a burst of righteous indignation my lord i am crossexamining on behalf of a yearold boy on an extremely serious charge id be grateful if my learned friend didnt supply information which all of us in court know except for the witness very well do carry on mr rumpole i was almost beginning to like mr justice everglade no he never told me when like i thought it was sometime in the summer peanuts tried to sound cooperative sometime in the summer are you a fan of the rolling stones peanuts yes remind me they were still vaguely puzzled the judge was hunting back through his notes sleek as a butler with a dish of peas featherstone supplied the information the musicians my lord and so was jim a fan i ploughed on ignoring the gentlemans gentleman he was yes you had discussed music before you met in the remand centre before the nick oh yes peanuts was following me obediently down the garden path you used to talk about it at school yes in quite a friendly way i was conscious of a startled fred timson looking at his son and of jim in the dock looking for the first time ashamed we was all right yes did you ever go to a concert with jimbo please think carefully we went to one or two concerts together peanuts conceded in the evening yes what would you do call at his home and collect him youre joking oh no peanuts in this case im not joking at all no harm i thought at that stage in underlining the seriousness of the occasion course i wouldnt call at his home your families dont speak you wouldnt be welcomed in each others houses the montagues and the capulets mr rumpole the old sweetheart on the bench had finally got the message i gave him a bow to show my true love and affection if your lordship pleases your lordship puts it extremely aptly i turned back to peanuts so what would you do if you were going to a concert wed leave school together like and then hang around the caffs hang around the caffs cafoys mr rumpole mr justice everglade was enjoying himself translating the answer yes of course the cafays until it was time to go up west if my lord would allow me up to the west end of london together yes so you wouldnt be separated on these evenings you went to concerts together it was one of those questions after which you hold your breath there can be so many wrong answers no we hung around together rumpole breathed a little more easily but he still had the final question the great gamble with all jim timsons chips firmly piled on the red fait vosjeux msieurs et mesdames of the old bailey jury i spun the wheel and did that happen when you went to the rolling stones at the hammersmith odeon a nasty silence then the ball rattled into the hole peanuts said yes that was this summer wasnt it we were into the straight now cantering home in the summer yeah you left school together and hung around the caffs like then we went up the odeon together all the time i told you didnt i peanuts looked bored and then amazed as i unrolled the poster bernard had brought rushed by taxi from hammersmith with the date clearly printed across the bottom my lord my learned friend might be interested to know the date of the only rolling stones concert at the hammersmith odeon this year i gave featherstone an unwelcome eyeful of the poster he might like to compare it with the date so conveniently set out in the indictment when the subsequent formalities were over i went down to the cells this was not a visit of commiseration no time for a sorry old sweetheart but and a deep consciousness of having asked one too many questions all the same i was in no gentle mood in fact it would be fair to say that i was bloody angry with jimbo you had an alibi you had a proper reasonable truthful alibi and joy of joys it came from the prosecution why the hell didnt you tell me jim who seemed to have little notion of the peril he had passed answered me quite calmly dad wouldntve liked it dad whats dad got to do with it i was astonished he wouldntve liked it mr rumpole not me going out with peanuts so you were quite ready to be found guilty to be convicted of robbery just because your dad wouldnt like you going out with peanuts molloy dad got the family to alibi me jim clearly felt that the timsons had done their best for him keep it in the family though it was heavily kid on the irony was lost on jim he smiled politely and stood up eager to join the clan upstairs well anyway thanks a lot mr rumpole dad said i could rely on you to win the day like id better collect me things if jim thought i was going to let him get away as easily as that he was mistaken rumpole rose in his crumpled gown doing his best to represent the majesty of the law no wait a minute i didnt win the day it was luck the purest fluke it wont happen again youre joking mr rumpole jim thought i was being modest dad told me about you he says you never let the timsons down i had a sudden vision of my role in life from young jims point of view and i gave him the voice of outrage which i use frequently in court i had a message of importance for jim timson do you think thats what im here for to help you along in a career like your dads jim was still smiling maddeningly my god i shouldnt have asked those questions i shouldnt have found out the date of the concert then youd really be happy wouldnt you you could follow in dads footsteps all your life sharp spell of borstal training to teach you the mysteries of housebreaking and then a steady life in the nick you might really do well you might end up in parkhurst maximum security wing doing a glamorous twenty years and a hero to the screws at which the door opened and a happy screw entered for the purpose of springing young jim until the inevitable next time weve got his things at the gate mr rumpole come on jim you cant stay here all night ive got to go jim agreed i dont know how to face dad really me being so friendly with peanuts jim i tried a last appeal if youre at all grateful for what i did oh i am mr rumpole im quite satisfied generous of him then you can perhaps repay me why arent you on legal aid its not that leave him leave your dad jim frowned for a moment he seemed to think it over then he said i dont know as how i can you dont know mum depends on me you see like when dad goes away she depends on me then as head of the family so he left me and went up to temporary freedom and his new responsibilities my mouth was dry and i felt about years old so i took the lift up to that luxurious eatery the old bailey canteen for a cup of tea and a penguin biscuit and pushing his tray along past the urns i met a philosophic chief inspector persil white he noticed my somewhat lugubrious expression and tried a cheering dont look so miserable mr rumpole you won didnt you nobody won the truth emerges sometimes inspector even down the old bailey i must have sounded less than gracious the wiley old copper smiled tolerantly hes a timson it runs in the family well get him sooner or later yes yes i suppose you will at a table in a corner i found certain members of my chambers george frobisher percy hoskins and young tony maclay now resting from their labours their wigs lying among cups of old bailey tea buns and choccy bics i joined them wordsworth entered my head and i gave him an airing trailing clouds of glory do we come marvellous win that i was telling them young maclay thought i was announcing my triumph yes rumpole i hear youve had a splendid win old george ever generous smiled genuinely pleased itll be years before you get the cheque hoskins grumbled not in entire forgetfulness and not in utter nakedness but trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home i was thinking of jim trying to sort out his situation with the help of wordsworth you dont get paid for years at the old bailey i try to tell my grocer that if you had to wait as long to be paid for a pound of sugar i tell him as we do for an armed robbery hoskins was warming to a wellloved theme but george dear old george was smiling at me albert tells me hes had a letter from wystan i just wanted to say im sure wed all like to say youll make a splendid head of chambers rumpole heaven lies about us in our infancy shades of the prison house begin to close upon the growing boy but he beholds the light and whence it flows he sees it in his joy i gave them another brief glimpse of immortality george looked quite proud of me and told maclay rumpole quotes poetry he does it quite often but does the growing boy behold the light i wondered or was the old sheep of the lake district being unduly optimistic itll be refreshing for us all to have a head of chambers who quotes poetry george went on at which point percy hoskins produced a newspaper which turned out to contain an item of news for us all have you seen the times rumpole no i havent had time for the crossword guthrie featherstone hes taken silk it was the apotheosis the great day for the labourconservative member for wherever it was one time unsuccessful prosecutor of jim timson and now one of her majestys counsel called within the bar and he went down to the house of lords tailored out in his new silk gown a lace jabot knee breeches with diamante buckles patent shoes black silk stockings lace cuffs and a fullbottomed wig that made him look like a pedigree but not overbright spaniel however guthrie featherstone was a tall man with a good calf in a silk stocking and he took with him marigold his lady wife who was young enough and i suppose pretty enough for henry our junior clerk to eye wistfully although she had the sort of voice that puts me instantly in mind of headscarves and gymkhanas that high pitched nasal whining which a girl learns from too much contact with the saddle when young and too little with the timsons of this world in later life the couple were escorted by albert whod raided moss bros for a top hat and morning coat for the occasion and when the lord chancellor had welcomed guthrie to that special club of queens counsel they came back to chambers where champagne was served by henry and old miss patterson our typist in wystans big room looking out over temple gardens ch wystan our retiring head was not among those present as the party began and i took an early opportunity to get stuck into the beaded bubbles after the fourth glass i felt able to relax a bit and wandered to where featherstone in all his finery was holding forth to erskinebrown about the problems of appearing en travestie i arrived just as he was saying its the stockings thatre the problem oh yes they would be i did my best to sound interested keeping them up i do understand well marigold my wife marigold i looked across to where mrs qc was tinkling with laughter at some old legal anecdote of uncle toms it was a laugh that seemed in some slight danger of breaking the wine glasses that marigold her sisters a nurse you know and she put me in touch with this shop which supplies suspender belts to nurses among other things really this conversation seemed to arouse some dormant sexual interest in erskinebrown yards of elastic for the larger ward sister but it works miraculously youre wearing a suspender belt erskinebrown was frankly fascinated you sexy devil i hadnt realized the full implications i told the qc of rising to the heights of the legal profession i wandered off to where uncle tom was giving marigold a brief history of life in our chambers over the last halfcentury percy hoskins was in attendance and george its sometime since we had champagne in chambers uncle tom accepted a refill from albert its sometime since we had a silk in chambers hoskins smiled at marigold who flashed a row of wellgroomed teeth back at him i recall we had a man in chambers once called drinkwater oh before you were born hoskins and some fellow came and paid drinkwater a hundred guineas for six months pupillage and you know what this drinkwater fellow did bought us all champagne and the next day he ran off to calais with his junior clerk we never saw hide nor hair of either of them again he paused marigold looked puzzled not quite sure if this was the punch line of course you could get a lot further in those days on a hundred guineas uncle tom ended on a sad note and marigold laughed heartily your husbands star has risen so quickly mrs featherstone only ten years call and hes an mp and leading counsel hoskins was clearly so excited by the whole business he had stopped worrying about his cheques for half an hour oh its the pr you know guthries frightfully good at the pr i felt like everglade marigold was speaking a strange and incomprehensible language guthrie always says the most important thing at the bar is to be polite to your instructing solicitor dont you find that mrrumpole polite to solicitors its never occurred to me guthrie admires you so mr rumpole he admires your style of advocacy i had just sunk another glass of the beaded bubbles as passed by albert and i felt a joyous release from my usual strong sense of tact and discretion i suppose it makes a change from bowing three times and offering to black the judges boots for him marigolds smile didnt waver he says youre most amusing out of court too dont you quote poetry only in moments of great sadness madam or extreme elation guthries so looking forward to leading you in his next big case this was an eventuality which i should have taken into account as soon as i saw guthrie in silk stockings as a matter of fact it had never occurred to me leading me did you say leading me well he has to have a junior now doesnt he naturally he wants the best junior available now hes a leader now hes left the junior bar i raised my glass and gave marigold a version of browning just for a pair of knee breeches he left us just for an elastic suspender belt as supplied to the nursing profession at which the qc himself bore down on us in a rustle of silk and drew me into a corner i just wanted to say i dont see why recent events should make the slightest difference to the situation in chambers you are the senior man in practice rumpole henry was passing with the fizzing bottle i held out my glass and the tide ran foaming in it you wrong me brutus i told featherstone you said an older soldier not a better a quotation touchd very apt is it i mean all this will make absolutely no difference ill still support you rumpole as the right candidate for head of chambers i didnt know about being a candidate having thought of the matter as settled and not being much of a political animal but before i had time to reflect on whatever the honourable member was up to the door opened letting in a formidable draught and the head of chambers ch wystan shes daddy wearing a tweed suit extremely pale supported by albert on one side and a stick on the other made the sort of formidable entrance that the ghost of banquo stages at dinner with the macbeths wystan was installed in an armchair from which he gave us all the sort ot wintry smile which seemed designed to indicate that all flesh is as the grass or something to that effect albert wrote to me about this little celebration i was determined to be with you and the doctor has given permission for no more than one glass of champagne wystan held out a transparent hand into which albert inserted a glass of non vintage wystan lifted this with some apparent effort and gave us a toast to the great change in chambers now we have a silk guthrie featherstone qc mp i had a large refill to that wystan absorbed a few bubbles wiped his mouth on a clean folded handkerchief and proceeded to the oration wystan was never a great speech maker but i claimed another refill and gave him my ears you featherstone have brought a great distinction to chambers isnt that nice guthrie marigold proprietorially squeezed her masters fingers you know when i was a young man you remember when we were young men uncle tom we used to hang around in chambers for weeks on end wystan had gone on about these distant hard times at every chambers meeting i well recall we used to occupy ourselves with an old golf ball and mashieniblick trying to get chip shots into the wastepaper baskets albert was a boy then a mere child mr wystan albert looked suitably demure and we used to pray for work any sort of work didnt we uncle tom we were tempted to crime only way we could get into court uncle tom took the feed line like a professional moderate laughter except for rumpole who was busy drinking and then i heard wystan rambling on but as you grow older at the bar you discover its not having any work that matters its the quality that counts here here im always saying we ought to do more civil this was the dutiful erskinebrown inserting his oar now guthrie featherstone qc mp will of course command briefs in all divisions planning contract wystans voice sank to a note of awe even chancery i was so afraid after ive gone that this chambers might become known as merely a criminal set wystans voice now sank in a sort of horror and of course theres no doubt about it too much criminal work does rather lower the standing of a chambers couldnt you install pithead baths hadnt actually meant to say it aloud but it came out very loud indeed ah horace wystan turned his pale eyes on me for the first time so we could have a good scrub down after we get back from the old bailey now horace rumpole and i mean no disrespect whatever to my soninlaw wystan returned to the oration from far away i heard myself say daddy as i raised the hardworking glass horace does practise almost exclusively in the criminal courts one doesnt get the really fascinating points of law not in criminal work erskinebrown was adding unwanted support to the motion ive often thought we should try and attract some really lucrative tax cases into chambers that im afraid did it just as if i were in court i moved slightly to the centre and began my speech tax cases i saw them all smiling encouragement at me marvellous tax cases make the world go round compared to the wonderful world of tax crime is totally trivial what does it matter if some boy loses a year a couple of years of his life its totally unimportant anyway hell grow up to be banged up for a good five shut up with his own chamber pot in some convenient hole we all prefer not to think about there was a deafening silence which came loudest from marigold featherstone then wystan tried to reach a settlement now then horace your practice no doubt requires a good deal of skill skill who said skill i glared round at the learned friends any fool could do it its only a matter of life and death thats all it is crime its a sort of a game how can you compare it to the real world of off shore securities and deductible expenses all you young men in chambers can learn an enormous amount from horace rumpole when it comes to crime wystan now seemed to be the only one who was still smiling i turned on him you make me sound just like fred timson really whoevers fred timson i told you wystan never had much of a practice at the bar consequently he had never met the timsons erskinebrown supplied the information the timsons are rumpoles favourite family an industrious clan of south london criminals arent they rumpole hoskins added wystan looked particularly pained south london criminals i mean do we want people like the timsons forever hanging about in our waiting room i merely ask the question he was not bad this erskinebrown with a big future in the nastier sort of breach of trust cases do you do you merely ask it i heard the pained bellow of a distant rumpole the timsons and their like are no doubt grist to rumpoles mill wystan was starting on the summing up but its the balance that counts now youll be looking for a new head of chambers are we still looking my friend george frobisher had the decency to ask and wystan told him id like you all to think it over carefully and put your views to me in writing we should all try and remembei its the good of the chambers that matters not the feelings however deep they may be of any particular person he then called on alberts assistance to raise him to his feet lifted his glass with an effort of pure will and oifered us a toast to the good of chambers i joined in and drank deep it having been a good thirty seconds since i had had a glass to my lips as the bubbles exploded against the tongue i noticed that the featherstones were holding hands and the brand new artificial silk was looking particularly delighted something and perhaps not only his suspender belt seemed to be giving him special pleasure some weeks later when i gave hilda the news she was deeply shocked guthrie featherstonel head of chambers we were at breakfast in fact nick was due back at school that day he was neglecting his cornflakes and reading a book by general acclaim im sorry hilda looked at me as if shed just discovered that id contracted an incurable disease he can have the headaches working out alberts extraordinary bookkeeping system i thought for a moment yes id like to have been head of chambers and then put the thought from me if only you could have become a qc she was now pouring me an unsolicited cup of coffee qc ct thats enough to keep me busy ct whatevers ct counsel for the timsons i tried to say it as proudly as i could then i reminded nick that id promised to see him off at liverpool street finished my cooling coffee stood up and took a glance at the book that was absorbing him expecting it to be perhaps that spinechilling adventure relating to the footprints of an enormous hound to my amazement the shocker in question was entitled simply studies in sociology its interesting nick sounded apologetic you astonish me old bagnold was talking about what i should read if i get into oxford of course youre going to read law nick were going to keep it in the family hilda the barristers daughter was clearing away deafeningly i thought perhaps ppe and then go on to sociology nick sounded curiously confident before hilda could get in another word i made my position clear ppe thats very good nick thats very good indeed for gods sake lets stop keeping things in the family later as we walked across the barren stretches of liverpool street station with my son in his school uniform and me in my old striped trousers and black jacket i tried to explain what i meant thats whats wrong nick thats the devil of it theyre being born around us all the time little mr justice everglades little timsons little guthrie featherstones all being set off to follow in fathers footsteps we were at the barrier shaking hands awkwardly lets have no more of that no more following in fathers footsteps no more nick smiled although i have no idea if he understood what i was trying to say im not totally sure that i understood it either then the train removed him from me i waved for a little but he didnt wave back that sort of thing is embarrassing for a boy i lit a small cigar and went by tube to the bailey i was doing a long firm fraud then a particularly nasty business out of which i got a certain amount of harmless fun rumpole and the alternative society in some ways the coppers the fuzz old bill whatever you may care to call them are a very conservative body when they verbal up the criminal classes and report their alleged confessions in the nick they still use the sort of cockney argot that went out at the turn of the century and perfectly welleducated bank robbers who go to the ballet at covent garden and holidays in corfu are still reported as having cried its a fair cop guv or you got me bang to rights at the moment theyre apprehended in the early s however when flower power flooded the country with a mass of long hair long dresses and the sweet smell of the old quarter of marrakesh the fuzz showed itself remarkably open to new ideas provincial drug squads were issued with beads afghan waistcoats headbands and guitars along with their size eleven boots and took lessons in a new language learning to say cool it man or make love not war instead of you got me bang to rights it was also a time when the figures of the establishment fell into disrepute and to be a barrister however close to the criminal fraternity was to be regarded by the young as a sort of undesirable cross between judge jeffries and mr nixon as i knew from the sullen looks of the young ladies nick who was then at oxford and reading ppe brought home in the holidays i have never felt so clearly the number of different countries all speaking private languages and with no diplomatic relations into which england is divided i cannot think for instance of a world more remote from the temple or the inns of court than that tumbledown victorian house in the west country which the community who inhabited it had christened nirvana and which contained a tortoise who looked to me heavily drugged a number of babies some surprisingly clean young men and women a painintheneck named dave and a girl called kathy trelawny whom i never met until she came to be indicted in the coldsands crown court on a charge of handling a phenomenal amount of cannabis resin valued at about ten thousand pounds coldsands is a rather unpopular resort in the west of england with a high rainfall a few regency terraces a large number of old peoples homes and a string quartet at teatime in the winter gardens on the face of it an unlikely place for crime to flourish but a number of young people did form a community there at nirvana a place which the local inhabitants regarded as the scene of numerous orgies to this house came a dealer named jack resplendent in his hippie attire to place a large order for cannabis which kathy trelawny set about fulfilling with the aid of a couple of persian law students with whom she had made contact at bristol university very soon after the deal was done and a large quantity of money handed over jack the hippie was revealed as detective sergeant jack smedley of the local force the strong arm of the law descended on nirvana the persian law students decamped to an unknown address in morocco and rumpole who had had a few notable successes with dangerous drugs was dug out of old bailey and placed upon the from paddington to coldsands enjoying the lare luxury of a quiet corner seat in the firstclass luncheon car by courtesy of the legal aid fund of great britain i could afford the firstclass luncheon and spread myself the more readily as i was staying in a little pub on the coast not five miles from coldsands kept by my old mates and companions in arms expilot officer threefingers dogherty and his wife bobby cxwaaf unchallenged beauty queen of the station at dungeness who was well known to look like betty grable from behind and phyllis dixey from the front and to have a charm a refreshing impertinence and a contempt for danger unrivalled i am sure by either of those famous pinups from reveille i have spoken of bobby already in these reminiscences and i am not ashamed to say that although i was already married to hilda when we met she captured my heart and continued to hold it fast long after the handsome pilot officer captured hers i was therefore keenly booking forward to renewing my acquaintance with bobby we had had a desultory correspondence but we hadnt met for many years i was also looking forward to a holiday at the seaside for which miss trelawnys little trouble seemed merely to provide the excuse and the financial assistance so i was as you can imagine in a good mood as we rattled past reading and cows began to be visible standing in fields chewing the cud as though there were no law courts or judges in the world you very rarely see a cow down the bailey which is one of the reasons i enjoy an occasional case on circuit circuit takes you away from chambers away from the benevolent despotism of albert the clerk above all away from the constant surveillance of she who must be obeyed i began to look forward to a good oldfashioned railway lunch i thought of a touch of brown windsor soup rapidly followed by steamed cod castle pudding mousetrap cream crackers and celery all to be washed down with a vintage bottle of chateau great western as we charged past didcot a furtivelooking man in a short offwhite jacket which showed his braces and a mournful expression looked down at me ah waiter brown windsor soup i fancy to start with were just doing the grilled platter sir i detected in the mans voice a certain gloomy satisfaction grilledwhat fried egg and brunchburger served with chips and a nice tomato a nice tomato oh very well perhaps with a suitable anaesthetic the brunchburger could be taken and to drink a reasonable railway claret no wines on this journey sir we got gin in miniatures i dont care for gin at lunchtime especially in miniatures regretfully i came to the conclusion that circuit life had deteriorated and wondered what the devil they had done with all the brown windsor soup at coldsands station a middleaged man in a neat suit and rimless glasses was there to meet me he spoke with a distinct and reassuring westcountry accent air horace rumpole im friendly thank god someone is i was warned you liked your little joke mr rumpole by london agents they recommended you as a learned counsel who has had some success with drugs oh i have had considerable success with drugs and a bit of luck with murder rape and other offences against the person im afraid we dont do much crime at friendly sanderson and friendly were mainly conveyancing by the way i think theres a couple of typing errors in the instructions to counsel mr friendly looked deeply apologetic i hastened to reassure him fear not friendly i never read the instructions to counsel i find they blur the judgtment and confuse the mind we were outside the station now and a battered taxi rattled into view youll want to see the client friendly sounded resigned she might expect it youre going to nirvana eventually arent we all no friendly i shall steer clear of the lotus eaters of no balaclava road a land i rather imagine in which it seems always afternoon bring the client for a con at my hotel after dinner nine oclock suit you youll be at the george thats where the bar put up then if its where the bar put up i shall avoid it im staying with old mates from my days in the raf they run a stately pleasuredome known as the crooked billet the little pub place out on the bay i noticed friendly smiled when he spoke of the doghertys delight a place i had no doubt of a high reputation the taxi had stopped now and i was wrestling with the door when i had it open i was in a high and holiday mood out on the bay indeed with no sound but the sea sighing and the muted love call of the lobster know what i say friendly when you get a bit of decent crime at the seaside relax and enjoy it friendly was staring after me perhaps understandably bewildered as i drove away the taxi took me out to the crooked billet and back about twentyfive years the pub was on the top of some cliffs above a sandy beach and a leaden sea from the outside it seemed an ordinary enough building offwhite battered with a neglected patch of garden but inside it was almost a museum to the great days of world war two behind the bar were sams trophies a nazi helmet a plaster mr churchill which could actually puff a cigar a model spitfire dangled from the ceiling there were framed photographs of expilot officer dogherty in his flying jacket standing by his beloved lancaster and a signed portrait of vera lynn at the height of her career even the pintable appeared to be an antique looted from some naafi there was also an old piano a string of fairy lights round the bottles and a comforting smell of stale booze someone was clanking bottles behind the bar but i could see no more than a comfortable bottom in old blue slacks i put out a red alert calling all air crew calling all air crew parade immediately at which bobby dogherty turned straightened up and smiled age had not actually withered her but it had added to the generosity of her curves her blonde hair looked more metallic than of old and the lines of laughter round her mouth and eyes had settled into permanent scars she had a tipped cigarette in her mouth and her head was tilted to keep the smoke out of her eyes she looked as always irrepressibly cheerful as if middle age like the war was a sort of joke and there to be enjoyed rumpole you old devil you look beautiful i said as i had often done in the past and meant it just as much liar drop of rum i didnt see why not and perched myself on a bar stool while she milked the rum bottle soon rumpole was in reminiscent mood takes me right back to the naafi hop new years eve sam was out bombing something and i had you entirely to myself for a couple of hours of the boompsadaisy not to mention the lambeth walk i raised my glass and gave our old salutation heres to the good old duke the good old duke bobby was on her second gin and tonic and she remembered you never took advantage i lit a small cigar it caught me in the back of the throat something i shall regret till the day i cough myself into extinction hows old sam hows expilot officer threefingers dogherty bloody doctor for the first time bobby looked less than contented doctor doctor mackay came here with a face like an undertaker she gave a passable imitation of a gloomy scottish medico mrs dogherty your husbands got to get out of the licensing trade or ill not give him more than another year get him into a small bungalow and on to soft drinks can you imagine sam in a bungalow or on soft drinks the mind boggles hell find lime juice and soda has a pleasant little kick to it thats what the doctor told me the kick of a mouse i should imagine in carpet slippers i told the quack sams not scared sam used to go out every night to kill himself he misses the war dreadfully i expect he does saturday night in the crooked billet and a bloody good pissup its the nearest he gets to the old days in the raf you want to be careful he doesnt rush out and bomb torquay i warned her and was delighted to see her laugh youre not joking the point is should i tell sam wont your doctor mackay tell him you know how sam is he wont see hide nor hair of the doctor so what should i do why ask me i looked at her having no advice to give youre the bloody lawyer darling youre meant to know everything at which point i was aware that behind us a man had come into the bar i turned and saw him scowling at us he was wearing a blazer an raf scarf in an open shirt and scuffed suede shoes i saw a goodlooking face grey hair and a grey moustache all gone slightly to seed it was none other than expilot officer sam threefingers dogherty were not open yet he seemed to have not yet completely awakened from a deep afternoon kip as he advanced on us blinking at the lights round the bar sam cant you see who it is bobby said and her husband who had at last identified the invasion roared at me my god its old grounded rumpole rumpole of the ops room he moved rapidly to behind the bar and treated himself to a large teachers which he downed rapidly what the hell brings you to this neck of the woods he wrote us a letter never read letters heres to the good old duke he was on his second whisky and considerably more relaxed what brings me a lady you might say a damsel in bloody great distress youre not still after bobby are you sam was only pretending to be suspicious of course till the day i die but your wifes not in distress exactly arent i bobby looked down into the depths of her gin and tonic and i filled them in on the nature of my mission the lady in question is a certain miss kathy trelawny one of the lotus eaters of nirvana balaclava road done for the possession of a suitcase full of cannabis resin i had put up as we used to say in the old days a black if i had asked the reverend ian paisley to pray for the pope i couldnt have invited an icier gaze of disapproval than sam gave me as he said youre defending her against your crafty constabulary come in here does she not bloody likely that crowd from balaclava road wouldnt get past the door anyway they dont drink the glass of teachers was recharged to banish the vision of the lotus eaters invading the crooked billet dear me is there no end to their decadence but you know my client never clapped eyes on her thank god no doubt shes about as glamorous as an unmade bed oh no doubt at all gloomily i thought he was almost certainly right something peering through glasses i thought out of a mop of unwashed hair sam came out from behind the bar and started to bang about straightening chairs and tables switching on more lights how can you defend that creature easy prop myself to my feet in court and do my best but you know damn well shes guilty its the one great error everyone makes about my learned profession they think we defend people who have told us they did the deed this legend doesnt add to the esteem in which barristers are held and i sighed a little as i exploded the myth for the thousandth time ah there youre wrong i dont know that at all pull the other one sam shared the usual public view of legal eagles i dont know and if she ever admitted it to me id have to make her surrender and plead guilty weve got a few rules old sweetheart we dont deceive courts not on purpose you mean you think shes innocent sam made it clear that no one who lived in a commune called nirvana could possibly be innocent of anything he told you sam hes got rules about it bobby was polishing glasses and coming to the rescue of an old friend at the moment i think shes the victim of a trick by the police thats what ill have to go on thinking until she tells me otherwise thats ridiculous the police dont trick people not in england sam clearly felt hed not delivered us from the nazi hordes for nothing never had a plain clothes copper come in here and order a large scotch after closing time i asked him the bastards but thats entirely different yes of course anyway whos paying you to defend miss slagheap thats what id like to know sam was triumphant it hurt me but i had to tell him fasten your seat belt old darling you are miss kathy trelawny is on legal aid and i am here by courtesy of the ratepayers of coldsands i lifted my rum in sams direction thank you threefingers thank you for your hospitality bloody hell sam sounded more sorrowful than angry and it gave him an excuse to turn the handle once more on the teachers we dont mind do we sam as always bobbys was the voice of tolerance we dont mind buying horace the odd drink occasionally later i sat in the residents lounge a small room which opened off the bar and tried to shut out the considerable noise made by sams regular customers middleaged men mostly in a sort of uniform of cavalry twill trousers and hacking jackets i was working on my brief and already i had a plan of campaign when the detective sergeant went to buy miss trelawnys cannabis he was disguised as a hippie and acting i was quite prepared to argue as an agent provocateur if i could establish that my client would never have committed any sort of crime unless the police had invited her to i might given a fair wind and a sympathetic judge have the whole of the police evidence excluded which would lead to the collapse of the prosecution a zen service of thanksgiving at nirvana and rumpole triumphant i had brought a number of law reports on the question of agent provocateur and was interested to discover that it was the old hanging judges who regarded these beasts with particular disfavour its odd how gentler days have somehow dimmed our passion for liberty i had worked out an argument that might appeal to a judge who still had some of the old spark left in him when the door from the bar opened to admit mr friendly and my client i had i felt known miss kathy trelawny for a long time she had floated before my eyes from my early days with the old oxford book of english verse as herricks julia or lovelaces lucasta or la belle dame sans merci or the lady of shallot as she smiled she reminded me strongly of rosalind in the forest of arden or viola comforting the lovesick duke she had a long slender neck a mass of coppercoloured hair friendly blue eyes and she was exceedingly clean as soon as i saw her i decided that my one ambition in life was to keep her out of holloway i had to take a quick gulp from the glass beside me before i could steady my nerve to read out a passage from the depositions miss trelawny was sitting quietly looking at me as if i was the one man in the world she had always wanted to meet and she hoped we would soon be finished with the boring case so we could talk about something interesting and deeply personal real cool house man i was reading out the detective sergeants evidence with disgust you cant score nothing in this hick town you dont get no trouble from the fuzz just from the way the old darling talked didnt you twig he was a sergeant from the local drug squad miss trelawny showed no particular reaction and friendly quickly filled the silence my client has never come up against the police before well have a bit of fun with this case i told them what sort of fun exactly friendly sounded doubtful as if he didnt exactly look on the coming trial as the annual dinner dance of the coldsands rotary a preliminary point in the absence of the jury we will ask the judge to rule the whole of detective sergeant jack smedley alias jack the hippies evidence inadmissable on the sole ground on what sole ground that it was obtained contrary to natural justice in that it constituted a trick that it is the testimony of an agent provocateur we dont get many of those in conveyancing friendly looked distinctly out of his depth a nasty foreign expression for a nasty foreign thing spies and infiltrators policemen in disguise who worm their way into an englishmans home and trap him into crime why should they do that mr rumpole i stood up and directed my answer at my client her warm and allembracing smile and her total silence were beginning to unnerve me so they can clap innocent citizens into chokey and notch up another conviction on their collective braces bloody unbritish like bidets and eating your pud after the cheese now i mean your average circuit judge circus judges we call them down the bailey friendly consulted a note its his honour james crispinrice tomorrow we were in luck i knew old rice crispies well at the bar he was a thoroughly decent chap who had once stood as a liberal candidate he was the product of the navy and a minor public school no doubt hed had it firmly implanted in him in the fourth form never trust a sneak they had left the door slightly open and through it i could hear the old familiar sound of bobby thumping the piano you think he might rule out the evidence i got up and shut the door blotting out some remarkable tuneless rendering of the golden oldies which had started up a cote de chez dogherty if we can implant a strong dislike of sergeant smedley in the old darling i told them disgusting behaviour your honour the police are there to detect crime not manufacture it whats the country coming to constables tricked out in beads and singing to a small guitar conning an innocent girl into making huge collections of cannabis resin from some persian pushers she met at bristol university shed never have done it if the policeman hadnt asked her wouldnt you miss trelawny friendly gave her the cue to speak she ignored it so on i went showing her my quality withdraw the evidence from the jury your honour its unenglish unethical and clearly shows that this crime was deliberately created by the police the whole business is a vile outrage to our ageold liberties wordsworth crept into my mind and i didnt send him about his business it is not to be thought of that the flood of british freedom which to the open sea i paused insecure on the words and then very quietly and for the first time miss kathy trelawny spoke with words appropriattly supplied by the old sheep of the lake district of the worlds praise from dark antiquity hath flowed with pomp of waters unwithstood should perish she looked at me i took over we must be free or die who speak the tongue that shakespeare spake i decided id had enough of wordsworth and asked her surprised you know it wordsworth a little i thought no one did nowadays whenever i come out with him in the bar mess they look amazed unusual for a client to know wordsworth i teach kids english oh yes of course you do i had learned from the brief that all the inhabitants of nirvana were in work theres one thing i wanted to ask you now she had broken the ice there seemed to be no holding her but friendly stood up as if anxious to bring the conference to an end well we shouldnt keep mr rumpole any longer ask me miss trelawny yes her smile was unwavering what do you want me to say exactly say say nothing look rely on me with a little help from wordsworth and keep your mouth firmly closed i opened the door great gusts of singing blew in on us from the bar bobbys voice was leading well meet again dont know where dont know when but were bound to meet again some sunny day i remembered my craven cowardice in not speaking to bobby on the occasion of the naafi hop and i asked miss trelawny to join me for a drink fortunately friendly remembered that his wife would be waiting up for him and i took my client alone into the bar as we sat at the counter sam came up to us swaying only slightly like a captain on the deck of his wellloved ship he looked at kathy trelawny with amazed approval where did you get this popsy rumpole he leant across the bar to chat to my client intimately you shouldnt be with the ground staff my dear youre definitely officer material whats it to be ill have a coke i dont drink really she was smiling at him the smile i thought uncomfortably of universal love bestowed on everyone regardless of age or sex ohdontyou you dont drink sam took offence theres nothing else you dont do is there quite a lot of things sam ignored this and recalled the good old days as he passed me a rum remember rumpole we used to divide the popsies into beer waafs and gin waafs he winked at kathy trelawny in my opinion youre a large pink gin she told you sam she doesnt drink i reminded sam he was getting impatient did you pick up this beautiful bit of crackling in a bloody baptist chapel he poured miss trelawny a cocacola take no notice of him my dear you can be teetotal with rumpole but lets launch our friendship on a sea of sparkling shampoo id probably sink kathy trelawny smiled at him not with me you wouldnt let me introduce myself pilot officer threefingersdogherty threefingers refers to the measures of my whisky my hands are in perfect order to demonstrate this he put a hand on hers across the bar i havent met many pilot officers kathy i feel i know her well enough to call her kathy for the rest of this narrative withdrew her hand she was still smiling well youve met me my dear sam rambled on undiscouraged one of the glamour boys one of the brylcreem brigade one of the very very few he stood himself another teachers and if i had a crate available id bloody well smuggle you up in the sky for a couple of victory rolls you see him you see groundstaff rumpole well wed leave him far below us grounded i dont think we should do that kathy protested the only time she stopped smiling was when sam made a joke why ever not sam frowned i think im going to need him as she said this i felt ridiculously honoured rumpole why ever should you need rumpole what did you say your name was i didnt now my time had come i had great pleasure in performing the introduction this is miss kathy trelawny of nirvana balaclava road and i added in a whisper to sam the wellknown unmade bed sam looked like a man who has just lifted what he imagined was a glass of vintage champagne and discovered it contained nothing but seven up he looked at kathy with pronounced distaste and said no bloody wonder you dont drink its just something i dont like doing she smiled back at him naturally naturally you wont have a pink gin like a normal girl excuse me he moved away from us shouting drink up please havent any of you lot got homes the piano stopped people started to drift out into the night was that meant to be a joke all that pilot officer business kathy asked me no joke at all sam was a great man on bombers he could find any target youd care to mention in the pitch dark on three fingers of whisky he was good sam extremely good you mean good at killing people when she put it like that i supposed that was what i did mean kathy turned to look at bobby who was sitting on the piano stool lighting a cigarette she asked me and i told her that was sams wife and i used to think she was gorgeous gorgeous for the war time anyway things were a bit utility then and now i looked at her children seem to grow up more beautiful it must be the orange juice or the peace sam gave us a crescendo version of time please and i walked my client to the bus shelter it was a still rather warm september night the sea murmured perpetually and the moonlight lit up the headland and whitened the strip of beach there were only very few words for it and i recited them to kathy as we moved away from the cars starting up round the crooked billet it is a beauteous evening calm and free the holy time is quiet as a nun breathless with adoration we read poetry at the house kathy told me its a good way to end the day someone reads a poem anything and then she shivered on that warm night and said they wont lock me up will they i told you well knock out the evidence put your trust in rumpole i tried to sound as cheerful as possible but she stood still trembling slightly her hand on my arm my brother petes locked up in turkey twelve years he was always such a scared kid he couldnt sleep with the door shut neither of us could what on earth did your brother do in turkey drugs she said and i wondered what sort of an idiot her brother must be then she asked me will it be over soon itll be over there were lights coming up the hill to take her away from me thats my bus why dont you come and see me in nirvana then the most strange thing happened she leant forward and kissed me quite carefully on the cheek then she was gone and i was saying to myself nirvana why ever not i walked back to the crooked billet in a state of ridiculous happiness flower power that year was exceedingly potent i was up early the next morning sinking a boiled egg in the residents lounge as the sun sparkled on the sea and bobby fussed around me pouring tea sam was still asleep god was in his heaven and with old rice crispies on the bench i could find nothing particularly wrong with the world after breakfast i put a drop of eaudecologne on the handkerchief ran a comb through the remaining hair and set off for the coldsands seat of justice when i got down to the shire hall and into the wig and gown i had my first view of the inhabitants of nirvana the lotus eaters of balaclava road they were out in force clean jeans mexicanlooking shawls the statutory baby one tall coloured boy whom i later discovered to be called oswald was carrying a small flute i just hoped they werent going to mistake the whole business for a bit of harmless fun round the south african embassy morning you must be rumpole welcome to the western circuit i was being addressed by a tall fellow with a rustic tan beneath his wig a gentleman farmer and gentleman barrister i looked down to discover if he had jodphur boots on under the pinstripes tooke vernon tookes my name im prosecuting you awfully decent of you i smiled at him tooke glanced disapprovingly at my supporters club i say rumpole where did you get that shower from rentahippie what a life eh gangbangs on the national assistance did i detect in farmer tookes voice a note of envy used to be a decent area he continued balaclava road until that lot got their foot in the door squatters are they theyve got a nineyear lease and theyve all got jobs the only fellows scrounging off the state tooke are you and i really rumpole tooke looked pained well theyre paying you on the rates arent they most amusing he looked as if id pointed out a bad case of foot and mouth in the herd but he offered me a cigarette from a gold case i refused and produced the remains of a small cigar from the waistcoat pocket tooke ignited it with a gold lighter is this going to take long he asked anxiously coldsands gymkhana tomorrow we tend to make it rather a day out take long i dont suppose so its quite a simple point of law law rumpole did you say law the casually dropped word seemed to fill tooke with a certain amount of dread thats right you do have law i suppose down on the western circuit i left tooke and moved towards the commune a young man with dark hair and a permanent frown who seemed to be their leader greeted me as i thought in an unfriendly fashion you her lawyer i admitted it kathy smiling as ever introduced him to me as a friend of hers named dave hawkins i speculated with a ridiculous stab of regret that the friendship was a close one this is dave oh yes will she be going in today dave wanted to be put in the picture in into the witness box i mean theres something i want her to say its pretty important i was accustomed to being the sole person in charge of my cases i put dave right patiently dave may i call you mr hawkins if i were a doctor taking out your appendix old darling you wouldnt want kathy would you telling me where to put the knife at this point the usher came out of court and called katherine trelawny youd better answer your bail as i said this kathy gave a little shiver and asked me will they lock me up now of course not trust me the usher called her again i dropped the remnants of the small cigar on the marble floor of the shire hall and ground it underfoot the lance was in the rest sir galahad rumpole was about to do battle for the damsel in distress or words to that effect halfway through the afternoon things were going pretty well rice crispies doing his job in a very decent fashion was decidedly interested in the point of agent provocateur kathy was smiling in the dock the commune were gripped by the spectacle and outside the court room the baby unaware of the solemnity of the occasion was yelling lustily in the witness box detective sergeant jack smedley was looking extremely square clean shaven and in his natty old bill uniform i see detective sergeant i had the pleasure to put to him you are no longer wearing your beads beads what beads are those the judge was puzzled i was wearing beads your honour on the occasion of my visits to balaclava road beads with the uniform his honour couldnt believe his ears no one had sported beads in the navy not with the uniform with the embroidered jeans and the waistcoat of afghan goat and the purple silk drapery knotted round your neck i pursued my advantage i was in plain clothes your honour plain clothes sergeant you were in fancy dress i rode over a titter from the commune now perhaps youll tell the court whats happened to your gaucho moustache i i shaved it off why in view of certain comments your honour passed in the station it wasnt a gaucho more a viva zapata actually a viva what was that mr rumpole the judge seemed to feel the world slipping away from him the officer was affecting the moustache your honour of a wellknown south american revolutionary this news worried the old darling on the bench deeply a south american can you tell me officer what was the purpose of this elaborate disguise the witness paused i filled the gap with my humble submission may i suggest an answer sergeant you took it into your head to pose as a drug dealer in order to trap this quite innocent young woman i had the pleasure of pointing out kathy in the dock into taking part in a filthy trade she wouldnt otherwise have dreamed of well yes but what did he say rice crispies pounced on the grudging admission your honour the witness tried to start again shorthand writer just read me that answer there was a long pause while the elderly lady shuffled through her notes but at last the passage was reproduced in order to trap this quite innocent young woman into taking part in a filthy trade well yes but the judge made a note of that i could have kissed the old darling however i pressed on but what sergeant she wasnt so innocent what reason had you to suppose that her way of life your honour what i want you to tell me officer is this the judge weighed in in support of rumpole did you have any reason to believe that this young woman was dealing in drugs before you went there in your viva what zapata your honour i helped him along thank you mr rumpole im much obliged we had received certain information the sergeant did his best to make it sound sinister and will you let us into the secret officer what was this information that miss trelawny was the type to get involved involved by you involved already tooke who seemed to feel the case was eluding his grasp rose to his feet i shall be calling the evidence your honour of the neighbour miss tigwell very well mr tooke but if the evidence shows no previous attempt to deal in drugs then you would agree the whole of this crime was a result of your fertile imagination i fired a final salvo at the witness but the judge interrupted me perfectly fairly doesnt that rather depend mr rumpole on the effect of miss tigwells evidence when we hear it if your honour pleases of course as always your honour is perfectly right i rewarded that upright fellow rice crispies with a low bow and sat down in a mood of quiet selfcongratulation i hadnt been sitting long before the man dave was at my side whispering furiously is that all youre going to ask you want to have a go i whispered back do borrow the wig old darling the evidence of kathys previous malpractices was offered to us in the person of miss tigwell who lived opposite at no balaclava road and whose idea of entertainment appeared to be gazing into the windows of nirvana in the daily hope of moral indignation i could tell exactly what they were what were they miss tigwell perverted all living higgledypiggledy men and women black and white did your supervision include the bedrooms well no but they all sat together in the front room sat together what did they talk about i couldnt hear that they were a community thats what it comes to they might well have been trappist monks for all you knew i dont know if air rumpole is suggesting his client is a trappist monk tooke made a mistake he should have left the jokes to me rice crispies didnt smile now miss tigwell apart from the fact that persons of different sex sat together did you ever observe anything suspicious from your post in the crows nest i saw a man giving her money miss tigwell was playing her king quite a lot of money it was in ten pound notes was this the first time you had ever seen money passing or any sort of dealing going on in nirvana the first time yes the judge was making a note i decided to play my ace and prayed that i wouldnt be trumped by the prosecution can you describe to his honour the man you saw passing the money dreadfullooking person a clear criminal type looked as if hed been dragged through a hedge backwards longhair and a horrible sort of moustache beads embroidered jeans afghan goats hair and purple silk fancy for the neck i saw detective sergeant exhippie smedley bow his head in shame and i knew i was home and dry disgusting i saw it all quite distinctly miss tigwell ended in triumph congratulations madam you have now given us a perfectly accurate description of detective smedley of the local force as i took off the wig in the robing room farmer tooke was looking distinctly worried i did my best to cheer him up ah tooke i have good news for you hope to get you all off in time for the gymkhana tomorrow got a daughter have you in the potato race do you think the judge is agin me tooke felt all was not well with the prosecution not you personally but i know what hes thinking do you encourage that sort of police officer and hell be out in a frock on the prom tomorrow soliciting the chairman of the bench tooke saw the point i say i suppose that sort of thing is worrying not english if you want my opinion at which tooke climbing into his burberry put the law behind him and extended an invitation what are you doing tonight rumpole i mean therell be a few of us dining at the bar hotel with the leader of the circuit roast lamb sea shanties and old jokes from quarter sessions no not tonight tooke oh well im sorry we like to give our visitors a little hospitality tonight i am dropping out dinner at nirvana was a distinct surprise id expected nut cutlets and carrot juice i got an excellent steak and kidney pud and a very drinkable claret oswald had told me he was something of a wine freak the house was clean and the big cushions and old sofas remarkably comfortable the babies were good enough to withdraw from the company the recordplayer gave us unobtrusive flute music from the andes and kathy tended to all my needs filling my glass and lighting my cigar and remained a perpetual pleasure to the eye i began to think that id rather live at balaclava road than at the gloucester road mansion flat with she who must be obeyed id rather sit back on the scatter cushions at nirvana and let my mind go a complete blank than drag myself down to the bailey on a wet monday morning to defend some overexcited pakistani accused of raping his social worker in fact i thought that for tuppence for a packet of small cigars id give up the law and spend the rest of my life in a pair of old plimsolls and grey flannel bags shrimping on the beach at coldsands the only fly in this soothing ointment was the fellow dave when i told kathy she wouldnt even have to go into the witness box if we won our agent provocateur argument dave said im not sure i agree with that i told him firmly that i wasnt sure he had to when we brought you here i thought youd understand its not just another case dave protested protesting seemed to be his main occupation every case is just another case i told him to you all right to us its a chance to say what we have to cant we put the law straight on the drug scene i mean this isnt a den of thieves is it youve seen nirvana oswald put the point more gently he was right of course i had seen nirvana nows our only chance to get through to the law dave told me i decided to instruct him on the facts of life the law you know where the law is now down in the george hotel drinking the circuit port and singing what shall we do with the drunken sailor the law is talking about the comical way the old lord chief passed a death sentence the law is in another world but it thinks its the whole world just as you lot think the worlds nothing but poetry and perhaps the occasional puff of a dangerous cigarette thats what weve got you for to put our point of view across dave had mistaken my function youve got me to get you out of trouble thats what youve got me for im not going to get up tomorrow and teach old rice crispies to sing protest songs to a small guitar youre just not taking this case seriously dave was totally wrong and i told him so oh yes i am i am seriously determined to keep kathy out of prison at which miss trelawny said it was time for their nightly poem she found a book and gave it to me open me you like this read it to us so i read to the lotus eaters quietly at first and then with more emphasis enjoying the sound of my own voice it is a beauteous evening calm and free the holy time is quiet as a nun breathless with adoration the broad sun is sinking down in its tranquillity they were all listening as though they actually enjoyed it except for dave who was whispering to kathy dear child dear girl that walkest with me here if thou appear untouched by solemn thought kathy was shushing dave making him listen to the old sheep i looked at her as i read the last lines thy nature is not therefore less divine thou liest in abrahams bosom all the year and worshippst at the temples inner shrine god being with thee when we know it not i slammed the book shut i needed to sleep before court in the morning the officer was only doing his duty active your honour in the pursuit of crime tooke was making his final speech on the point of evidence to an unenthusiastic audience or in the manufacture of a crime thats what troubles me the judge was really troubled bless him he went on if i thought this young woman only collected drugs only got in touch with any sort of supplier because of the trap set for her then would you concede mr tooke i would have to reject the evidence i think your honour would tooke was a lovely prosecutor everything was going extremely well when rice crispies adjourned for lunch so i was in festive mood when i set off for a crab sandwich and a nourishing stout in the pub opposite the shire hall looking forward to whetting my whistle and putting the final touch on my clinching argument but i was stopped by friendly who said the client wanted to see me as a matter of urgency he led me into a small room decorated with old framed leases and eighteenthcentury maps of coldsands and there clearly bursting with news to impart were miss kathy trelawny and her friend dave we want to tell the truth i closed the door carefully and looked at her dave without encouragement what truth its the only way i can get peters case across kathy said she was smiling no longer peter my brother i told you he was busted in turkey i remember well this isnt turkey and its not peters case or anyone elses i looked at kathy its yours kathy wants you to know why she did it she was about to speak and i almost shouted at her hoping it still wasnt too late shut up you see i had the conference is over got to get a bite of lunch come on friendly i moved to the door it appears we have new instructions mr rumpole friendly looked concerned not half so concerned as i was the old instructions are doing very nicely thank you dont say a word until this evening when its all over tell me what you like she wants everyone to know how else can we get petes case into the papers dave like an idiot had moved between me and the door i had no way of escaping the fusillade of truth which kathy then let fly i got the stuff last year after pete got busted in istanbul i was going to sell it anyway it was going to cost ten thousand pounds to get him out in lawyers fees and she looked at me almost accusingly bribes i suppose he got twelve years weve got to get people to care about peter so it was quite clear she was telling me that she hadnt committed her crime as the result of a request from an agent provocateur she had the stuff before detective sergeant smedley of the west country drug squad first came to nirvana that was the truth the last thing in the world i wanted to know i looked at my watch and turned to friendly what is there a back to london friendly run outside for gods sake and see if you cant whistle me up a taxi im retiring from this case friendly totally puzzled by the turn of events left us running out on us dave never made an unexpected remark why for gods sake kathy asked me and i had to tell her let me try and explain my existence is bound by a small blue volume handed down like the tablets on the day of my call to the bar by a master of my inn in a haze of port and general excitement what the hells he talking about dave couldnt resist interrupting but kathy told him to listen i went on with such calm as i could muster barristers down the ages have killed they have certainly committed adultery although that sort of thing doesnt appeal to me some may well have coveted their neighbours camels and no doubt worshipped graven images but i dont believe theres one of us who has ever gone on to fight a case after our client has told us in clear crystal ringing tones that they actually did the deed you mean you wont help me kathy looked as if it had never occurred to her i cant now but kathy wants to tell the judge the pot laws ridiculous and about pete its my duty to preside over your acquittal not your martyrdom to the dubious cause of intoxication i told her ill see the judge and tell him i cant act for you any longer personal reasons the old foolll think you fancy her i cant imagine where dave got that farfetched idea and i went on ignoring him youll get another barrister what you tell him is your business ill ask the judge to adjourn for a week or two youll still be on bail whats the matter afraid to stick your neck out or would you starve to death if they made pot legal dave was about to start on another of his political speeches but kathy silenced him she asked him to leave us alone and i told him to go and find friendly and my taxi he went he had smashed my defence and i was alone with kathy looking at the pieces i thought we got along together kathy was smiling again i couldnt help admiring her courage i mean you keep talking about clients i didnt think i was a client i thought i was more of a friend actually never have friends for clients that really ought to be one of the ten commandments i dont suppose you could forget what i told you of course i could id like nothing more than to forget it id forget it at once if i wasnt a bloody barrister and theres nothing more important than that in your life being a barrister i thought about this very carefully unfortunately there was only one answer no poetry doesnt mean a damn thing to you friendship doesnt mean anything youre just an old man with a heart full of a book about legal etiquette kathy was angry now shed stopped smiling youre saying just what i have long suspected i had to agree with her why dont you do something about it what do you suggest she moved away from me and went and looked out of the window at the sunshine and the municipal begonias at last she said i might leave coldsands and come up to london do a language course and dave would dave be coming with you daves stuck here organizing the house i want to get away have a bit of a rest from homemade muesli and debates about the geezer i thought well id get a flat in london i could come and have lunch with you sometimes when youre in the old bailey every man has his price is that mine a lunch down the old bailey not enough more than enough probably much more something to think about in the long cold nights with she who must be obeyed she suddenly turned on me she was holding on to my arm as if afraid of falling im not going to prison you wont let them send me to prison there was only one way now dave had done his damnedest i can go and see the judge he might agree to a suspended sentence i dont know i can go and see him thats right he likes you i could see you get along go and see him please go and see him she was smiling again eager i had to tell her the facts of life you know what it means if i go and see the judge for you i i plead guilty she knew i left her then and went to the door we still had our trump card dear old rice crispies was simply aching to get away to the gymkhana his honour judge crispinrice was delighted to see rumpole and the prosecuting tooke he made us nescaf with the electric kettle in his room he looked younger with his wig off and when we had settled such vital matters as how much milk and no sugar thank you he and tooke tried to make me envious of their previous nights revelry in the bar mess we had a good evening you should have been with us rumpole didnt we have a splendid evening vernon the leader gave us the floral dance tooke relived the great moment old pascoe is wonderful for he entertained us in song the judge offered us a senior service youd have enjoyed it a splendid evening we fined little moreton a dozen bottles of claret for talking shop at dinner tooke was bubbling at the memory we then started hacking away at the penalty how many bottles were left none judge as far as i remember i thought the time had come to return their thoughts to the business in hand look here judge i said at the risk of being fined for talking shop if if it so happened i could persuade my client to plead guilty his honour was stirring his cup giving me no great assistance you might be grateful for a short afternoon even this didnt hook him i went on a little desperately shes a remarkable girl so i can see old rice crispies smiled then perhaps i thought i could rope him into nirvana knows a good deal about wordsworth i didnt know if this would sway the judicial mind wordsworth is he a mitigating factor poor old sheep of the lake district he cant afford to lose admirers no well shed get the full benefit of pleading guilty he was using his judges voice i stood up like a barrister cant you tell me any more than that there are rules i thought you might indicate the tariff you know the tariff how much was it twenty pounds weight a fair wallop it was only cannabis i tried to make it sound like broken biscuits they use the stuff just like whisky it doesnt occur to them but it isnt whisky is it the judges voice again its a class b drug as defined by the dangerous drugs act but what do we know about it that its illegal isnt that all we need to know he looked at me then and gave me a charming smile my god rumpole are we going to see you turning up in court in beads shes got a good character i played my last card the judge drained his nescafe well you know about a good character everyone had a good character once i mean if we let everyone out because of their good character no one would ever go inside thatm be a scandal all those empty prisons i said it with too much feeling rice crispies looked at me as if i were coming out in a rash i say rumpole youre not getting involved in this case are you involved of course not no naturally but i was thinking possibly a suspended sentence at which his honour judge crispinrice put his wig back on and said something which was no help at all youve got your job to do rumpole and ive got mine i sweated my guts out in my speech in mitigation and the judge listened to me with perfect courtesy he then gave kathy trelawny three years in the nicest possible way and she was taken down to the cells vernon tooke came up to me in the robing room he was on his way to the gymkhana well ended nice and quick yes tooke very quickly going back to london tomorrow ill be going back tomorrow quite an attractive sort of person your client yes tooke all the same to prison she had to go when i came out into the main hall the commune was standing in a little group oswald was playing a lament on his flute and the baby was silent none of them spoke to me but i heard a voice at my elbow say it seems a shame sir a girl like that it was detective sergeant jack the hippie smedley and he added what we both knew its an evil place holloway out in the street i was nearly run over by a police car miss kathy trelawny was sitting in the back and saw me she was still smiling joviality was at its height in the crooked billet that night sam told all his old stories and bobby played the piano i stood beside her my glass of rum on the piano top and in a pause she looked across at her husband look at sam she said hes happy as a tick whats he want with a slow death on lime juice in a bungalow i made up my mind im not going to tell him are you in favour of that people not telling people things people not scattering information like bombs oh yes i told her im all in favour of that then she played roll out the barrel and we all joined in our voices floating out over the sea until sam called time please i never saw the people from nirvana again rumpole and the honourable member youre giving me a rape my clerk albert had just handed me a brief he then returned to the complicated business of working out the petty cash account his desk was covered with slips of paper a cash box and odd bits of currency i never inquired into alberts system of bookkeeping nor did anyone else in chambers dont you want it mr rumpole i turned to look at henry our second clerk henry had joined as an office boy a small tousled figure who scarcely seemed able to read or write albert used him mainly to run errands and make instant coffee and told him he would only be allowed to take a barrister into court when hed learnt to shine his shoes and clean his fingernails henry had changed over the years his shoes were now gleaming he wore a neat pinstriped suit with a waistcoat and was particularly assiduous in his attentions to guthrie featherstone qc mp our head of chambers albert as head clerk got ten percent of our earnings but henry was on a salary i had thought for a long time that henry thought albert past it and had his eye on a head clerks position i should add so you can get the complete picture of life in our clerks room that our old lady typist had left us and we had a new girl called dianne who read quite extraordinarily lurid novels when she wasnt typing spent a great deal of the day titivating in the loo and joined henry in looking pityingly at albert as he struggled to adjust the petty cash you dont ask whether you want a rape i told henry sharply rape comes uninvited i was gathering my post from the mantelpiece and looked at it with disgust like little brown envelopes from the inland revenue morning rumpole i became aware of the presence of young erskinebrown who was standing by the mantelpiece also watching albert in his struggle to balance the budget he was holding some sort of legal document and wearing a shirt with broad stripes elasticsided boots and an expression of amused contempt at alberts business methods as i have made clear earlier in these reminiscences i dont like erskinebrown i greeted him civilly however and asked him if hed ever done a rape as you know rumpole i prefer the civil side i really find crime moderately distasteful at this point erskinebrown started to complain to albert about the typing of the distasteful document some mortgage or other act of oppression he was carrying and albert said if he was interrupted hed have to start again on his column of figures i happened to glance down at the pound notes on alberts desk and noticed one marked with a small red cross in the corner but i thought no more of it at the time i then turned my attention to my brief which i immediately noticed was a paying one and not legal aided i carried it into my room with increased respect the first thing i discovered was that my client was a labour mp named ken aspen the next was that he was accused of no less a crime than the rape of one of his loyal party workers a girl called bridget evans in his committee room late on the night before the election i couldnt help feeling pleased and slightly flattered that such a case had come my way the press box at the bailey was bound to be full and the words of the rumpole might once again decorate the news of the world then i unfolded an election poster and saw the face of aspen the workers friend a reasonably goodlooking man in his early forties frowning slightly with the concentrated effort of bringing us all a new heaven and a new earth which would still be acceptable to the gnomes of zurich the poster i had was scrawled over and defaced apparently by the hand of the complainant miss bridget evans at the time of the alleged crime i lit a small cigar and read on in my instructions and as i read the wonder grew that an honourable member with a wife and family and a house in hampstead garden suburb should put it all at risk for a moment of unwelcomed pleasure on the floor of his committee room by night i had heard of political suicide but this was ridiculous and i believed that any jury would find it incredible too of course at that time i hadnt had the pleasure of meeting mrs kenneth aspen so bumble whitelock when they made him chief justice of the seaward isles i dont know some godforsaken hole had this man in the dock before him found guilty of living on immoral earnings and he was puzzled about the sentence so he sent a runner down to the docks where the old chief justice was boarding a p o steamer home with the urgent messages how much do you give a ponce look ill do this it was my practice to retire with my old clerk albert to pommeroys wine bar in fleet street at the end of a days work to strengthen myself with a glass or two of claret before braving the tube and she who must be obeyed during such sessions i seek to divert albert with a joke or two usually of a legal nature i was in full swing when one of the girls who works at pommeroys interrupted us with the full glasses of chateau fleet street albert had his wallet out and was paying for the treat no sir quite honestly i happened to see the note as albert handed it over it was marked with a small red cross in the corner all right my turn next so the message was i returned to my story how much do you give a ponce and the answer came back immediately from the old chief justice by very fast rickshaw never more than two and six cheers i dont know why but that story always makes me laugh albert was laughing politely also never more than two and six you like that one do you albert ive always liked it sir its like a bloody marriage albert weve got to know each others anecdotes perhaps youd like a divorce sir let young henry do your clerking for you i looked over to the bar erskinebrown was having a drink with henry and dianne they were drinking vermouth and henry seemed to be showing some photographs henry wed sit in here over a cinzano bianco and hed show me the colour snaps of his holiday in majorca no albert well rub along for a few more years who got me this brief for instance the solicitors sir they like the cut of your jib i ventured to contradict my old clerk privately paid rapes dont fall from the sky like apples in a high wind however my jib is cut then albert told me how the job had been done proving once again his true value as a clerk i have the odd drink in here with mr myers of your instructing solicitors their managing clerk remember old myersy he grows prize tomatoes likes to be asked about them sir if i may suggest it fellow with glasses overcoat pockets stuffed with writs smokes a mixture of old bed socks i remember myersy thats him mr rumpole he thinks our only chance is to crucify the girl seems a bit extreme now albert started to reminisce recalling my old triumphs i remember you sir when you crossexamined the complainant in that indecent assault in the old kilburn alhambra you brought out as hed touched her up during the movietone news and she admitted shed sat through the whole of rosemarie and a halfhour documentary about wild life on the river dee before she complained to the manager as i recollect she fainted during your questioning got her on the wing around the tenth question it was true the witness had plummeted like a partridge right out of the witness box i told old myersy that said albert proudly will rumpole be afraid of attacking her he said i told him theres not a woman in the world my mr rumpoles afraid of i was i suppose a little late in returning to the mansion flat in gloucester road as i hung up the coat and hat i was greeted by a great cry from the kitchen of rumpole it was my wife hilda she who must be obeyed and i moved towards the source of the shout muttering being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire in the kitchen mrs rumpole was to be seen dimly as through a mist of feathers she was plucking a bird have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require i was watching the clock hilda told me ignoring shakespeare ive been watching it since half past six something blew up a rape i bought a bottle of plonk i put my peaceoffering down on the table hilda told me that wouldnt be enough for the feast planned for the morrow for which she was denuding a guineafowl our son nick back from his year at an american university was bringing his intended a miss erica freyburg to dinner with the family if hes bringing erica i said ill slip down to the health food centre and get a magnum of carrot juice i had already met my potential daughterinlaw a young lady with strong views on dietary matters and indeed on every other subject under the sun whom nick had met in baltimore sometimes i think youre just jealous of erica jealous about nicky i had got the bottle of plonk open and was sitting at the kitchen table the snow of feathers settling gently you want your son to be happy dont you of course of course i want him to be happy then i put my problem to hilda can you understand why an mp an honourable member with a wife and a couple of kids should suddenly take it into his head to rape anyone an mp what sides he on labour oh well then hilda had no doubt about it it doesnt surprise me in the least the next day the honourable member ken aspen was sitting in my chambers flanked by his solicitors clerk myers and a calm competent handsome woman who was introduced to me as his wife anna i suggested that she might find it less embarrassing to slip out while we discussed the intimate details perhaps to buy a hat well some judges still like hats on women in court but mrs aspen anna told me that she intended to stay with her husband every moment that she could a dutiful wife you see and the loyalty shone out of her aspen spoke in a slightly modified publicschool accent and i thought the ken and the just flattened vowels were a concession to the workers like a cloth cap on a labour member being a politician he started off by looking for a compromise couldnt i perhaps have a word with miss bridget evans no i couldnt nor could i form a coalition with the judge to defeat her on a vote of no confidence i received kens permission to call him mr aspen and then i asked him to tell his story it seemed that it was late at night in the committee room and both janice crowshott the secretary and paul etherington the agent had gone home bridget evans asked aspen into her office saying the duplicating machine was stuck when he got in she closed the door and started to talk about politics youre going to tell me that the door of the duplicating room was locked so you could have a good old chat about home rule for wales of course not or that it was during a few strong words about the export figures that her clothes got torn she started to accuse me of being unfaithful to her i was puzzled to my principles oh those i wanted to hear his defence not his platitudes she said id betrayed her and all the party workers id betrayed socialism well you were used to hearing that i supposed that must be part of the wear and tear of life in the dear old labour party then she started talking about anna she wanted ken to leave me mrs aspen was leaning forward half smiling at me it was the whole setup she objected to the house in hampstead garden suburb the kids schools where do they go exactly sarahs at the convent and edwards down for westminster and the loyal voters are down for the comprehensive i couldnt resist it but it earned me a distinctly unfriendly look from mrs aspen i think after that she started screaming at me all sorts of abuse obscenities i cant remember righteous indignation and then she started clawing at me telling me i didnt even have the courage to the courage to what to make love to her thats what ken believed mrs aspen supplied the answer shed have made an excellent witness and i began to regret she wasnt on trial thank you is that true of course its true ken made love to her as she wanted on the floor again mrs aspen provided the answer you believed that was what she wanted at last my client spoke up for himself yes yes thats what i believed i lit a small cigar and began to get a sniff of a defence the house of lords has decided its a mans belief that matters in a rape case there are very few women among the judges of the house of lords meanwhile the honourable member carried on with the good work she was goading me shouting and screaming and then when i saw what shed done to my face on the poster i found the election poster scored over with a pen and torn you saw that iheny yes yes i think so youd better be sure about this you saw this poster scrawled on before anything happened yes im almost sure not almost sure mr aspen qtate quite sure well yes she didnt do it when you were there no so she must have done it before she called you into the room that would seem to follow mr myers took his pipe out of his mouth for the first time oh yes mr myers you see the point i congratulated him is it important the member asked innocently oh no a triviality it only means she hated your guts before anyone suggests you might have raped her you know mr aspen if youre applying the same degree of thought to the economy as you are to this case no wonder the pounds dickie i have been politer to clients but aspen took it very well he stood up smiling and said youre right the case is yours mr rumpole ill go back to worrying about the pound mrs aspen also stood and looked at me as though i was a regrettable necessity in their important lives like drains i said nothing cheering case i told them we havent got a case yet because at the moment mr myers doesnt know a damn thing about miss bridget evans that evening the fatted guineafowl was consumed i brought home three very decent bottles of claret from pommeroy and we entertained nick and his intended it was always a treat to have nick at home with us even though hed given up reading sherlock holmes and taken to sociology a subject which might for me be entirely written in the hieroglyphics of some remote civilization i can think of no social theory which could possibly account for such sports as rumpole and she who must be obeyed and i honestly dont believe were exceptions being surrounded by a sea of most peculiar and unclassifiable individuals dinner was over but we still sat round the table and i was giving the company one of my bluechip legal anecdotes guaranteed to raise a laugh it was the one about the retiring chief justice of the seaward isles how much do you give a ponce i was laughing myself now in joyful anticipation of the punch line and the answer came back by very fast rickshaw never more than two and six nick joined me in a burst of hilarity hilda said well thank goodness thats over and erica looked totally mystified then she told us that nick had been offered a vacancy in the department of social studies in the university of baltimore which came as something of a surprise to us as we both thought nick had settled on the job hed been offered at warwick so its not decided hilda said voicing the general anxiety from our point of view i suppose warwick would have certain advantages over baltimore i told nick i doubt the academic standards are any higher erica was defensive no but it is a great deal nearer gloucester road another glass of water i rose and poured for erica she was a goodlooking girl and seemed healthy enough although i regretted her habit of drinking water as i told her scientific research has conclusively proved that water causes the hair to drop out fallen arches and ingrowing toe nails they should pass a law against it at this point erica did her best to raise the level of the conversation by saying nickys told me all about your work i think its just great the way you stand up in court for the underprivileged i will stand up in court for absolutely any underprivileged person in the world provided theyve got legal aid whats your motivation in taking on these sort of cases erica asked me seriously and i told her my motivation is the money i think youre just rationalizing he does it because he cant resist the sound of his own voice nick who knows most about me told her but i would allow no illusions money if it wasnt for the legal aid cheque i tell you rumpole would be silent as the tomb the old bailey would no longer echo with my pleas for acquittal and the voice of the rumpole would not be heard in the strand but as it is the poor and the underprivileged can rely on me im sure they can erica sounded consoling and the legal aid brings us a quite drinkable claret i refilled my glass from jack pommeroys wine bar as a matter of fact i get privately paid sometimes sometimes i get a plum erica wants to come and hear you in court nick told me and she smiled how could i miss it well im not exactly a tourist attraction if im going to live in england i want to know all i can about your mores erica explained well if she wanted to see the natives at their primitive crafts who was i to stop her come next week down the bailey nickll bring you for lunch well have steak and kidney pud like the old days nick used to drop in at the bailey when he came back from school he enjoyed the occasional murder didnt you nick thats settled then well have a bit of fun fun what sort of fun erica sounded doubtful and i told her rape mr myers of my instructing solicitors went to the honourable members constituency and discovered gold miss bridget evans was not greatly liked in the local party being held to be a leftwing activist and a bloody nuisance more important than her adherence to the late leon trotsky was her affair with paul etherington the labour party agent i was gloating over this and other and more glorious goodies provided by the industrious myers when there was a knock on my door in chambers and in filtered erskinebrown glowing with some mysterious triumph rumpole one doesnt want to bother the head of chambers why not bother him hes got very little on his mind except settling a nice fat planning case and losing at golf to the lord chancellor guthrie featherstone qc old sweetheart is ripe for bothering i turned my attention back to the past of miss bridget evans its our head clerk erskinebrown went on mysteriously albert you want to go and bother him erskinebrown could restrain himself no longer hes a criminal our head clerk is a criminal rumpole i looked at the man with considerable disapproval as an ornament of the civil side dont you find that sort of word a little distasteful i have proof and erskinebrown fished a pound note out of his pocket i examined it curiously looks like a fairly conventional portrait of her majesty theres a red cross in the corner he announced proudly i put it there i marked the money in the petty cash i looked at my fellow barrister in astonishment ive suspected albert for a long time well i saw him in pommeroys wine bar and i got the note hed paid with off one of the girls perhaps its difficult for you to believe extremely i stood up and fixed him with an unfriendly gaze a private eye taking up the bar as a profession what do you mean rumpole i mean in my day they used to be nasty little men in macs sniffing round the registers in cheap hotels they used to spy into bedrooms with fieldglasses in the everpresent hope of seeing male and female clothing scattered around its the first time i ever heard of a private dick being called to the bar and becoming an expert on the law of contract i handed the marked pound back to erskinebrown the wellknown dick he looked displeased its obvious that i will have to go straight to the head of chambers as he made for the door i stopped him why not i said oh just one thing that may have escaped your attention my dear watson whats that yesterday afternoon i borrowed five pound notes from petty cash no doubt notes decorated by you and i paid for all of alberts drinks in pommeroys rumpole are you sure i could see he felt his case crumbling i would really advise you erskinebrown as a learned friend not to go round chambers making these sort of wild allegations against our clerk a man whos been here old darling since you were in nappies very well rumpole im sorry i interrupted your rape erskinebrown had the door open he was about to slink away say no more old sweetheart not one word more oh convey my condolences to the unfortunate henry the position of second clerk must be continually frustrating when i was alone i was well pleased albert and i had been together now for forty years and i was anxious not to cross my old dutch and the evidence little myersy had uncovered put me in mind of lewis caroll oh hast thou slain the jabberwock come to my arms thou beamish boy not yet father i said to myself but i will oh yes i certainly will tomatoes doing well mr myers are they i apply a great deal of artificial you see mr rumpole and theyre just coming up to the fourth truss fourth truss are they lively little blighters then we were waiting outside court mr and mrs aspen were sitting on a bench he looking curiously relaxed she glaring across at miss bridget evans who was looking young and demure on a bench some distance away meanwhile i was going through the old legal gambit of chatting up the instructing solicitor i showed concern for his tomatoes he asked after my son whom he remembered as a visitor to the courts of law nick oh hes the brains of the family sociology theyve offered him a lectureship at warwick university and hes engaged to be married met her in america and now hes bringing the lady to live in england i never had a family mr myers told me and added i do find having young kids about plays merry hell with your tomatoes at which point mrs anna aspen drew me aside for a conference the first thing she said surprised me a little i just hope youre not going to let me down let you down mrs aspen so far as i can see youre in no danger of the nick im in danger of losing everything i ever worked for i understand no you dont understand mr rumpole its been hard work but i made ken fight i made him go for the nomination i made him fight for the seat when he got in he wanted i dont know to relax on the back benches he said hed throw in ideas but i told him to fight for the pjpss job and hes got it she looked across to where her husband was actually trying the ghost of a smile in bridgets direction he cant see its either him or her now ken cant see that youre right about him looking for compromises sometimes it makes me so angry angrier than the idea of your husband and miss bridget evans on the floor of the office oh that why should i worry about that before i could answer her question an usher came out to invite the honourable member to step into the dock and we were away when you go into court in a rape case its like stepping into a refrigerator with the light off all the men on the jury are thinking of their daughters and all the women are sitting with their knees jammed together i found a sympatheticlooking moderately tarty middleaged lady juror the sort that might have smiled at the honourable member and thought why didnt you ring me dearie id have saved you all this trouble but her lips snapped shut during the opening by mr twentyman qc for the prosecution and i despaired of her even the judge old sam parkin an amiable old darling perfectly capable of giving a conditional discharge for manslaughter or putting an old lag on probation even old sam looked when the case opened as if hed just heard the clerk say put up jack the ripper now he seemed to be wanning to miss bridget evans who was telling her hairraising story with effective modesty as i tottered to my feet old sam gave me an icy look when you start to crossexamine in a rape case you open the flap of the tent and youre out in the blizzard miss bridget evans this this incident involving mr aspen occurred at on wednesday night i dont know i wasnt watching the clock the door of the court opened to admit the rumpole fan club my son nick and erica his intended she was wearing an ethnic skirt and gave me a warm smile as though to encourage my efforts on behalf of the underprivileged and the oppressed after all the witnesses had conveniently departed when there was no one there to establish my clients innocence after it was all over what did you do i went home a serious and terrible crime had been committed and you went home tucked yourself up in bed and went to sleep and you said not one word to the police about it until the following day albert also of the fan club was sitting in front of me next to mr myers i heard his penetrating whisper hes doing the old alhambra cinema technique it was nice to feel that dear old albert was proud of me when you went to bed did you go alone i dont see what thats got to do with it her answer had a hint of sharpness and for the first time there was a centimetre up in some of the jurors eyebrows did you go alone i told you i went to bed miss evans i shall ask my question again and i shall go on asking it all night if its necessary in the interests of my client did you go to bed alone do i have to answer that sort of question my lord yes you do and my lord will so direct i got in before sam could draw breath perhaps if you answer mr rumpoles questions shortly you will be out of the box quite quickly and your painful experience will be over sam parkin meant well but i intended to keep her there a little while longer yes i went to bed alone how long had that been going on how long had what been going on mr rumpole sam asked that the witness had taken to sleeping alone my lord you were no longer friendly with mr etherington paul and i we split about two years ago if youre interested in the truth i began to hear what a barrister longs for when hes crossexamining the note of anger yes miss evans i am interested in the truth and i expect the ladies and gentlemen of the jury are also the tarty lady nodded perceptibly she and i were beginning to reach an understanding mr rumpole is it going to help us to know about this young lady and paul sam was doing his best paul etherington my lord he was the parliamentary agent im anxious not to keep this witness longer than is necessary i understand my lord it must be most unpleasant almost as unpleasant i thought as five years in the nick which was what the honourable member might expect if i didnt demolish miss evans but i have my duty to do and a couple of refreshers to earn mr twentyman qc whispered a thought bitchily to his junior you had been living with paul etherington for two years before you parted yes so you were eighteen when you started living together just nearly eighteen and before that i was at school you had lovers before paul yes how many one or two or three or four how many or didnt they stay long enough to be counted my dear friend the lady juror gave a little disapproving sigh i had misjudged her the old darling was less afille dejoie than a member of the festival of light but i saw erica whisper to nick and he held her hand shushing her mr rumpole sam had flushed beneath his wig i took a swift move to lower his blood pressure i apologize my lord pure unnecessary comment i withdraw it at once your mr rumpole is doing us proud i heard mr myers whisper to albert who replied complacently his old hand has lost none of its cunning myersy after a dramatic pause i played the ace how old were you when you had the abortion i looked round the court and met ericas look not exactly a gaze of enraptured congratulation i was nineteen it was perfectly legal miss evans was now on the defensive i got a certificate from the psychiatrist saying you were unfit for childbirth i suppose so and the psychiatrist certified you were emotionally unstable it was a shot in the bloody dark but i imagine thats what trick cyclists always say to prevent any unwanted increase in the population something like that yes i gave ken aspen a cheering glance he was busy writing a note containing i hoped more ammunition for rumpole in the firing line so the jury have to rely in this case on the evidence of a yovosg vroman vfho has been certified emotionally unstable the jury were looking delightfully doubtful as the usher brought me the note from the dock no ammunition not even any congratulation but just one line scrawled leave her alone now please k a i crumpled the note with visible irritation in such a mood no doubt did nelson put the glass to his blind eye when reading the signal to retreat just three months ago you were rushed into hospital youd taken a number of sleeping tablets by accident i continued to attack no why well it was i told you id just parted from paul come now miss evans just think youd parted from paul over a year ago i was i was confused was it then you first met mr aspen just just about that time and fell in love with him no she was really angry now but she managed to smile at the jury who didnt smile back if i could have dropped dead of a coronary at that moment i thought miss bridget evans might be dancing for joy became so obsessed with him that you were determined to pursue him at any cost to him or to his family shall i tell you the truth i didnt even like him and that night after you and mr aspen had made love love is that what you call it he refused to leave his wife and children we never discussed his wife and children and it was in rage because he wouldnt leave his family that you made up this charge to ruin him you hate him so much i dont hate him oh can it be you are still in love with him i never hated him i tell you i was indifferent to him it was the answer i wanted and just the moment to hold up the poster of kens face scrawled on by miss evans in her fury so indifferent that you did that to his face on the wall perhaps after before because you had done that early in the evening hadnt you in one of your crazy fits of rage and jealousy now bridget evans was crying her face in her hands but whether in fury or grief or simply to stop the questions not i but the jury would have to judge will that poster be exhibit mr rumpole sam spoke in his best matteroffact judges voice and i gave him a bow of deep satisfaction and said if your lordship pleases is that your work i was entertaining nick and erica to an apresgouxt drink in pommeroys wine bar a group from chambers guthrie featherstone erskinebrown my friend george frobisher and old uncle tom were at the bar the rumpole family occupied a table in that part of pommeroys where ladies are allowed to assemble i felt as if id spent a day digging the roads in a muck sweat and exhausted after the crossexamination i was of course moderately well pleased with the way it had gone and i had asked joan the waitress to bring us a bottle of pommeroys cooking champagne and ericas special a cocacola when it came i took a quick glassful and answered her question when it goes well we made a bit of headway this afternoon you sure did erica was a bit upset nick looked from one to the other of us embarrassed is that the way you make your living erica repeated a humble living with an occasional glass of cooking champagne with paying briefs attacking women i must confess i hadnt thought of bridget evans as a woman but as a witness i tried to explain not women in particular i attack anyone regardless of age or sex who chooses to attack my client god knows which is the criminal him or her but old darling thats what were rather trying to find out what worries ricky is nick was doing his best to explain the girl has to go through all that i mean its not only the rape not only the rape well its like shes getting punished isnt it arent you rather rushing things i mean whos saying a rape took place wellisntshe oh i see you think its enough if she says it its a different sort of crime is it i mean not like murder or shoplifting or forging cheques they still have to be proved in the oldfashioned way but rape some dotty girl only has to say you did it and you trot off to chokey without asking embarrassing questions look you dont want to discuss a boring old case whatve you been doing nick getting ready for warwick but erica wasnt to be deterred of course we should discuss the case shed have made an advocate this erica she was dogged i mean its the greatest act of aggression that any human being can inflict ricky dads just doing his job im sorry we came nicky looked at his watch no doubt hoping they had an appointment im glad oh sure im glad erica was smiling quite mirthlessly hes a field study in archaic attitudes look old sweetheart is it archaic to believe in some sort of equality of the sexes she looked taken aback at that equality youre into equality for gods sake yes give you equal pay certainly let you be allin wrestlers and lord chancellor by all means ill even make the supreme sacrifice and give up giving my seat in the bus but youre asking for women witnesses to be more equal than any other witnesses but in that sort of case erica wasnt to be won over by any sort of irony a man forcing his masculinity or a woman getting her revenge i suggested i mean i dont suppose ill ever have to actually choose between being raped and being put in the cooler for five years banged up with a bar of soap and a chamber pot but if i ever had youre being defensive again erica smiled at me quite tolerantly ami the arguments kind of painful so you make a little joke perhaps but its not exactly a joke i mean have you considered the possibility of my client being innocent well hed better be thats all i can say after what you did to that girl this afternoon hed better be then nick remembered they were due at the pictures and they left me erica with the warm feeling of having struck a blow for her sex nick perhaps a little torn between us but holding ericas arm as he steered her out i went over to the bar for a packet of small cigars and there were the learned friends pouring over a pink slip of paper which jack pommeroy was showing them as soon as i drew up beside the bar jack showed me the cheque it was made out to me from a firm of solicitors called sprout and pennyweather and had my name scrawled on the back it was for the princely sum of nine pounds fifty my remuneration for a conference i looked at my purported signature and felt unaccountably depressed no need to tell us rumpole said guthrie featherstone qc mp its alberts signature its peaceful down here extraordinarily peaceful the honourable member was eating spaghetti rings and drinking hot sweet tea down in the cells sam parkin had declined bail in the lunch hour he seemed extraordinarily contented a fact which worried me not a little im afraid its hardly a three rosettes in the michelin as far as the grubs concerned i apologized to aspen its tasteless stodge like nursery tea sort of comforting really there are only two important things to remember one you saw the poster scribbled on as soon as you came into the room i tried to wrench his attention back to the case and you believed she wanted it thats all you just believed it did you have to ask her those questions aspen looked at me more in sorrow than in anger yes dragging out her life for the vultures in the press box i want you to win this bizarre ambition of mine made the honourable member smile you sound like my wife she wants me to win always im so tired its peaceful down here isnt it very peaceful look out old darling youre not falling in love with the nick are you i had seen it before that terrible look of resignation for years oh as long as i can remember annas worked so hard on me winning he seemed to be talking to himself i felt strangely superfluous sitting on platforms chatting up ministers keeping in with the press trying to convince the faithful that it all still meant something my wife anna you know she wanted me in the cabinet shed like to have been a ministers wife and what did you want it was a long time before he answered me and then he said i wanted it to stop calling your own client is the worst part of a trial you cant attack him or lead him or do anything but stand with your palms sweating and hope to god the old nitwit tells the right story mrs aspen was staring at her husband as if to transfer to him a little of her indomitable will he stood in the witness box smiling gently as though someone else was on trial and he was a not very interested spectator i showed him the defaced poster and asked the five thousand dollar question did you see that had been done when you went into the room he looked at me almost as if i was the one to be pitied and said after a pause i cant remember i smiled as if id got exactly the answer i wanted a bit of a sickly smile did miss evans start talking about your wife about anna yes did she want you to leave your wife did she sam parkin was helping me out in the silence i cant i cant exactly remember she went on and on goading me what happened then it was then the honourable member showed his first sign of passion shed been asking for it all that claptrap about betraying the party all those cliches about power corrupting i suddenly got angry it was then i then you what made made love to her in anger sam parkin was frowning i suppose so yes i saw annas look of fear and then the judge leaned forward to ask just tell us this mr aspen did you believe that was what she wanted so the old darling on the bench had chucked ken aspen a lifebelt i hoped to god the drowning man wasnt going to push it away it seemed about a year before he answered i dont know what i believed then exactly it wasnt your fault if i may say sir when i got back to the clerks room albert was as ever consoling it was the client thats right albert these things are always so much easier without clients i saw that henry our second clerk was smiling as he told me that there was a chambers meeting and i was to go up to our learned leaders room when albert offered to take me up henry said that featherstone had said that it was a meeting for members of chambers only and our head clerk wasnt invited albert looked at me and i could see he was worried cheer up albert i told him see you at pommeroys later featherstone was pouring us all earl grey out of his fine bone china tea service it seems that albert has been pursuing a long career of embezzlement he said as he handed round sugar that seems a very long word for nine pounds fifty i told them id say the correct legal expression was fiddling i dont see how we can excuse crime whatever you call it erskinebrown was clearly appearing for the prosecution anyway it was my nine pounds fifty it seems to me i can call it what i like i can call it a christmas present at which uncle tom who was dozing in the corner said i suppose it will be christmas again soon how depressing apparently its not justyour money rumpole featherstone sat judicially behind his desk isnt it is there the slightest evidence that anyone else suffered i asked the assembled company the petty cash erskinebrown was the only one to answer i told you about the petty cash i was too tired to argue with erskinebrown you told me youd borrowed from alberts float yes and paid for the drinks in pommeroys you were lying werent you rumpole now even featherstone realized erskinebrown had gone too far erskinebrown he said thats not the sort of language we use to another member of chambers if rumpole says he borrowed the money then i for one am prepared to accept his word as a gentleman suddenly i grew impatient with the learned friends i pushed myself to my feet then youre a fool thats all i can say as a gentleman of course i was lying what does rumpole say he was doing uncle tom asked george for information lying dear me how extraordinary i lied because i dont like people being condemned i explained it goes against my natural instincts thats very true he never prosecutes you dont prosecute do you rumpole george gave me a friendly smile i liked old george no i dont prosecute all right now well hear rumpoles defence of albert erskinebrown leant back in featherstones big leather chair trying to look like a juvenile judge it doesnt seem to me that its albert thats in trouble not in trouble its us legal gentlemen learned friends so friendly and so gentlemanly that we never check his books or ask to see his accounts of course he cheats us little small bits of cheating nine pounds fifty to buy a solicitor a drink or two in pommeroys he feels its a mark of respect due to a gent like calling you sir when you go wittering on about the typing errors in your statement of claim rather an odd mark of respect wouldnt you say rumpole featherstone stopped me and called the meeting to order i move we vote on this its a matter for the police erskinebrown said predictably rumpole you wouldnt agree the learned leader was asking for my vote youd hardly expect him to erskinebrown could never let a sleeping rumpole lie well alberts part of my life he always has been i remember when albert first came to us as a boy he was always whistling out of tune uncle tom was reminiscing and i added my tuppence worth hes like the wornout lino in the chambers loo and the cells under the old bailey i feel comfortable with abert hes like home and he goes out and grubs for briefs in a way were too gentlemanly to consider hes cheated us theres no getting away from that george interrupted me quite gently well weve got to be cheated occasionally thats what its all about isnt it i looked round at their blank faces otherwise youd spend your whole life counting your change and adding up bills and chucking grown men into chokey because they didnt live up to the high ideals of the chambers or the party or some bloody nonsense i dont know that i exactly follow george was doing his best neither do i ive done a rather bloody case im sorry i sat down beside our oldest member how are you uncle tom i never expected christmas to come again so quickly this was uncle toms contribution now featherstone was summing up personally speaking quite personally and without in any way condoning the seriousness of alberts conduct rapes bloody tiring i told them specially when you lose i would be against calling in the police this was featherstones judgement not very gentlemanly having old bill in chambers stamping with his great feet all over the petty cash vouchers i lit my last small cigar on the other hand albert in my view must be asked to leave immediately all those in favour at featherstones request all the other hands went up well rumpole said erskinebrown teller for the ayes have you anything to say have you anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed against you i blew out smoke as i told them an old chestnut they say mr justice snaggs once asked a murderer that bugger all came a mutter from the dock so snaggs j says to the murders counsel did your client say something bugger all my lord the counsel replied funny thing says mr justice snaggs i thought i heard him say something my story ended in a hoot of silence it was one that my old clerk albeit laughed at quite often in pommeroys wine bar a couple of nights later i was sitting alone in pommeroys telling myself a few old legal anecdotes when to my surprise and delight nick walked in alone he sat down and i ordered a bottle of the best chateau fleet street i dropped into chambers albert wasnt there no we have a new clerk henry im sorry about the case yes the honourable member got five years i took a mouthful of claret to wash away the taste of prisons and saw nick looking at me he had a strong desire to be found guilty i dont know why exactly so really you neednt have asked all those questions well yes nick yes i had to ask them now are we going to see you both on sunday there was a pause nick looked at me he obviously had something far more difficult to communicate than the old confessions of poker games in the deserted vicarage during his schooldays i wanted to tell you first you see well ive decided to take the job in baltimore ricky wants to go back i mean we can get a house there and well her familyd miss her if she were stuck with me in england her family theyre very close yes yes i suppose they are apparently her mother hates the idea of ricky being in england he smiled shes the sort of woman thatd start sending us food parcels i could think of nothing to say except it was good of you nick good of you to spare the time to drop into chambers well be back quite often ricky and i well be back for visits you and ricky of course well then cheers we had one for our respective roads and i gave my son a bit of advice theres one thing youll have to be careful of you know living in america whats that the hygiene it can be most awfully dangerous the purity the terrible determination not to adulterate anything you will be very careful of it wont you nick some weeks later as i was packing the bulging briefcase after breakfast for a day down the bailey with a rather objectionable fraud she who must be obeyed came in with a postcard from our son and his intended written in midair with a handsome picture of a jet and a blue sky on the front and kisses from nick and ricky on the back i handed it back to her and she gave it an attentive reread as she sat down for another cup of tea then she said you know why erica went back home dont you i confessed total ignorance she didnt like it when she came to see you in court she didnt like the way you asked all those questions she made that quite clear when they were here for lunch last sunday when they came to say goodbye she thought the questions you asked that girl were tasteless distasteful i was on my way to the door thats the word distasteful theres a picture of their jet on the front of this postcard i saw it very handsome i opened the kitchen door as dramatically as possible fare thee well and if forever still forever fare thee well it takes a bad moment to make me fall back on lord byron dont be silly hilda frowned whatre you going to do today rumpole it was a day like all the others and i said i suppose go on asking distasteful questions rumpole and the married lady life at the bar has its ups and downs and there are times when there is an appalling decrease in crime when all the decent villains seem to have gone on holiday to the costa brava and lawfulness breaks out at such times rumpole is unemployed as i was one morning when i got up late and sat in the kitchen dawdling over breakfast in my dressing gown and slippers much to the annoyance of she who must be obeyed who was getting the coffee cups shipshape so that they could be piped on board to do duty as teacups later in the day i was winning my daily battle with the tormented mind who writes the times crossword when hilda not for the first time in our joint lives compared me unfavourably with her late father daddy got to chambers dead at nine every day of his life your old dad old c h wystan got to chambers dead on nine and spent the morning on the times crossword i do it at home thats the difference between us you should be grateful grateful hilda frowned for the companionship i suggested i want you out of the house rumpole dont you understand that so i can clear up the kitchen o woman in our hours of ease uncertain coy and hard to please hilda doesnt like poetry i could tell by her heavy sigh just a little peace so i can be alone to get on with things and when i come home a little late in the evenings when i stop for a moment in pommeroys wine bar to give myself strength to face the inner circle you never seem particularly grateful to have been left alone in the house to get on with things youve been wasting time thats what i resent wasted time and now doth time waste me i switched from scott to shakespeare the reaction of my lifemate was no better chattering to that idiot george frobisher i really dont know why you bother to come home at all now nicks gone it seems quite unnecessary nick it was a year since nick had gone to america and we hadnt had a letter since christmas you know what i mean we used to be a family we had to try at least for nicks sake oh why dont you go to work nickll be back i moved from the table and put an arm on her shoulder she shook it off do you believe that when hes got married when hes got his job at the university of baltimore why on earth should he want to come back to gloucester road hell want to come back sometime to see us hell want to hear all our news what ive been doing in court i said giving hilda her opening what youve been doing in court you havent been doing anything in court apparently at which moment the phone rang in our livingroom and hilda who loves activity dashed to answer it i heard her telling the most appalling lies through the open door no its mrs rumpole ill see if i can catch him hes just rushing out of the door on his way to work i joined her in my dressing gown it was my new clerk the energetic henry he wanted me to come into chambers for a conference and i asked him if the world had come to its senses and crime was back in its proper place in society no he told me as a matter of fact it wasnt crime at all you havent even shaved hilda rebuked me daddyd never have spoken to his clerk on the telephone before hed had a shave i put down the telephone and gave mrs rumpole a look which i hoped was enigmatic its a divorce i told her as i walked through the temple puffing a small cigar on the way to the factory i considered the question of divorce well youve got to take what you can nowadays and i suppose divorce is in a fairly healthy state divorce figures are rising whats harder to understand is the enormous popularity of marriage i remembered the scene at breakfast that morning and i really began to wonder how marriage ever became so popular i mean was it home life with she who must be obeyed gloucester road seemed to be my place of work of hard backbreaking toil it was a relief to get down to the temple for relaxation by that time i had reached my chambers no i equity court a place of peace and quiet it felt like home when i got into the hallway i opened the door of the clerks room and was greeted by an extraordinary sight a small boy i judged him to be about ten years old was seated on a chair beside dianne our typist he was holding a large litup model of a jet aeroplane and zooming it through the air at a noise level which would have been quite unacceptable to the new york port authority i shut the door and beat a hasty retreat to the privacy of my sanctum but when i opened my own door i was astounded to see a youngish female seated in my chair wearing hornrimmed specs and apparently interviewing a respectable middleaged lady and a man who gave every appearance of being an instructing solicitor i shut that door also and turned to find the zealous henry crossing the hall towards me bearing the most welcome object in my small world a brief henry i said in some panic theres a woman seated in my chair miss phyllida trant sir shes been with us for the last few months expupil of mr erskinebrown you havent met her i searched my memory ive met the occasional whiff of french perfume on the stairs miss trants anxious to widen her experience hence the french perfume she wants to know if she could sit in on your divorce case ive got the brief here thripp v thripp youre the wife mr rumpole am i jolly good i took the brief and life improved considerably at the sight of the figure written on it marked a hundred and fifty guineas these thripps are the sort to breed from oh and i dont know if youre aware of this henry there seems to be a child in the clerks room with an aeroplane hes here for the conference i didnt follow his drift whats the child done it doesnt want a divorce too its the child of the family in thripp v thripp henry explained patiently and i rather gather the chief bone of contention so long now mr rumpole he moved away towards the clerks room sorry to have interrupted your day at home you can interrupt my day at home any time you like for a brief marked a hundred and fifty guineas miss phyllida trant did you say yes sir you dont mind her sitting in do you couldnt you put her off henry tell her a divorce case is sacrosanct itd be like a priest inviting a few lady friends to join in the confessional i told her youd have no objection miss trants very keen to practise then couldnt she practise at home were about the only chambers without a woman mr rumpole its not good for our image he seemed determined so i gave him a final thought on my way into the conference our old clerk albert never wanted a woman in chambers he said there wasnt the lavatory accommodation so there i was at the desk having a conference in a divorce case with miss phyllida trant sitting in mr perfect the solicitor looking grave and the client mrs thripp leaning forward and regarding me with gentle trusting eyes as i say she seemed an extremely nice and respectable woman and i wasnt to know that she was to cause me more trouble than all the murderers i have ever defended as soon as you came into the room i felt safe somehow mr rumpole i knew norman and i would be safe with you norman the child of the family miss trant supplied the information thank you miss trant the little aviator in the clerks room quite but if im to help you youll have to do your best to help me too anything what is it you want exactly mrs thripp seemed entirely cooperative well dear lady a couple of black eyes would come in extremely handy i said hopefully mrs thripp looked at miss trant puzzled mr rumpole means has your husband ever used physical violence miss trant explained well no not actual violence pity i commiserated with her mr thripp doesnt show a very helpful attitude you see if were going to prove cruelty we dont have to do we i noticed then that miss trant was sitting in front of a pile of legal text books intolerable conduct since the divorce law reform act i thought then that its not the frivolity that makes women intolerable its the ghastly enthusiasm the mustard keeness to get into the lacrosse team the relentless drive to learn the divorce law reform act by heart that and the french perfume i could have managed that conference quite nicely without miss trant i said to her however as politely as possible the divorce law reform act which year did you say yes i smiled at mrs thripp well you know how it is go down the old bailey five minutes and youve found theyve passed another divorce reform act thank you miss trant for reminding me now then whats this intolerable conduct exactly he doesnt speak mrs thripp told me well a little silence can come as something of a relief in the wear and tear of married life i dont think you understand mrs thripp smiled patiently he hasnt spoken a word to me for three years three years good god how does he communicate the instructing solicitor laid a number of little bits of paper on my desk by means of notes i then discovered that the man thripp who i was not in the least surprised to learn was a chartered accountant used his matrimonial home as a sort of post office when he wished to communicate with his wife he typed out brusque and businesslike notes documents which threw a blinding light in my opinion on the mans character to my socalled wife one note read if you and your socalled son want to swim in hot water you can go to the public baths from your socalled husband this was fixed it seemed to a padlocked geyser another billet doux was found in the biscuit tin in the larder to my socalled wife i have removed what you left of the assorted tea biscuits to the office for safe keeping are you determined to eat me into bankruptcy your socalled husband to my socalled wife im going out to my masonic ladies night tomorrow its a pity i havent got a lady to take with me dont bother to wait up for me your socalled husband f thripp i made two observations about this correspondence one was that it revealed a depth of human misery which no reasonable woman would tolerate and the other was that all the accountant thripps notes were written on an italian portable about ten years old my husbands got an old olivetti he cant really type mrs thripp told me many years ago i scored a notable victory in the great brighton benefit club forgery case and it was during those proceedings i acquired my vast knowledge of typewriters having solved the question of the type however got me no nearer the heart of the mystery let me understand i said to mrs thripp are you interested in someone else someone else mrs thripp looked pained youre clearly an intelligent obviously still a reasonably attractive woman thank you mr rumpole mrs thripp smiled modestly are there not other fish in your particular sea one mans quite enough for me thank you i see apparently youre still living with your husband living with him of course im living with him the flats in our joint names mrs thripp said this as though it explained everything i was still bewildered wouldnt you and the young hopeful outside be better off somewhere else anywhere else theres your mother in ruislip mr perfect supplied the information thank you mr perfect i turned back to mrs thripp as your solicitor points out anyones mother in ruislip must surely be better than life with a chartered accountant who locks up the geyser and removes the tea biscuits to his office i move out apparently the thought had never occurred to her unless youre a glutton for punishment move out and let him get away with it i rose to my feet and tried to put the point more clearly your flat in muswell hill scene of historic events though it may well be is not the field of waterloo mrs thripp if you withdraw to happier pastures there would be no defeat no national disaster mrs thripp is anxious about the furniture mr perfect offered an explanation the furniture shes afraid her husband would dispose of the lounge suite if she left the flat how much human suffering can be extracted by a lounge suite i asked the rhetorical question i cant believe its the furniture there was a brief silence and then mrs thripp asked quietly wont you take me on mr rumpole i thought of the rent and the enormous amounts of money she who must be obeyed spends on luxuries like vim i also remembered the fact that crime seemed remarkably thin on the ground and said t of course dear lady of course ill take you on thats what im here for like an old taxi cab waiting in the rank been waiting quite a little time if you want to know the truth you snap your fingers and ill drive you almost anywhere you want to go only itd be a help if we knew exactly what destination you had in mind ive told mr perfect what i want you want a divorce those are my instructions mr perfect told me but his client put it a little differently i want my husband taken to court those are my instructions mr rumpole i have spoken in these reminiscences of my old friend george frobisher george is a bachelor who has lived in an hotel in kensington since his sister died he is a gentle soul unfitted by temperament for a knockabout career at the bar but he is a pleasant companion for a drink at pommeroys after the heat and labour of the day that evening i bought the first round two large clarets flushed with the remunerative collapse of the thripp marriage things are looking up george i raised my glass to my old friend and he in turn toasted me a little theres light at the end of the tunnel today i got a hundred and fifty pound brief for a divorce thats funny so did i george sounded puzzled sure to last at least six days six refreshers at fifty pounds a day think of that george well theres that much to be said for the institution of marriage i never felt the need of marriage somehow george told me with one chained friend perhaps a jealous deadly foe the longest and the dreariest journey go i gave george a snatch of shelley and a refill ive had a bit of an insight into marriage since reading that divorce brief george was in a thoughtful mood if we were married we couldnt sit pleasantly together i told him youd be worrying what time i got home and when i did get home you wouldnt be pleased to see me i really cant see why a person puts up with marriage george went on when a woman starts conversing with her husband by means of little notes i looked at him curiously got one of those have you there seemed to be an epidemic of matrimonial noteleaving and she cut the ends off his trousers george seemed deeply shocked sounds a sordid sort of case cheers we refreshed ourselves with pommeroys claret and george went on to tell me about his divorce he was going to an evening at his lodge you know what this jezebel did only snipped off the ends of his evening trousers with nail scissors intolerable conduct that you know under the act i kept george abreast of the law moss bros was closed the wretched fellow had to turn up at the caf royal with bags that looked as if theyd been gnawed by rats well thats marriage for you thank god i live by myself in the royal borough hotel snug as a bug in there are you george we have television in the residents lounge now coloured television look here you must dine with me there one night rumpole bring hilda if youd care to wed like to george coloured television well i say thatll be a treat quiet life of course but the point of it is a man can keep his trousers more or less safe from destruction in the royal borough hotel i must admit that george frobisher and i loitered a little in pommeroys that night and when i got home hilda had apparently gone up to bed she often had an early night with a glass of milk and a library book i went into the kitchen and switched on the light all was quiet on the western front but i saw it on the table a note from my lady wife if you condescend to come home your dinners in the oven i took the hint and was removing a redhot plate of congealed stew from the bowels of our ancient cooker when the telephone rang in the livingroom i went to answer it and heard a womans voice i just had to ring you i feel so alone in the world so terribly lonely look its not terribly convenient just now it was my client in the case of thripp v thripp dont say that its my life how can you say its not convenient all right a quick word i supposed the ancient stew could wait a little longer hes going to say the most terrible things about me ive got to see you shall we say tomorrow four oclock but not here i told her firmly i dont know how i can wait youve waited for three years havent you look forward to seeing you then goodnight now beloved lady i said that i suppose to cheer up mrs thripp and to soften the blow as i put down the receiver just before i did so i heard a little click and remembered that hilda had insisted on an extension in our bedroom the next day our clerks room was buzzing henry was on the telephone dispatching barristers to farflung magistrates courts that smooth young barrister erskinebrown was opening his post and collecting papers and uncle tom old t c rowley was starting his day of leisure in chambers by standing by the mantelpiece and greeting the workers the ops room was even graced by the presence of our head of chambers guthriefeatherstone qc mp who was taking time off from such vital affairs of state as the poultry marketing act to supervise dianne who was beating out one of his learned opinions on our old standard imperial henry told me that my divorce conference was waiting in my room and erskinebrown gave his most condescending smile divorcing now rumpole he asked me i told him i was and asked him if he was still foreclosing on mortgages im all for a bit of divorce in chambers featherstone smiled tolerantly widens our repertoire you were getting into a bit of a rut with all that crime horace crime it seems a better world a cleaner world down at the old bailey i told him dont you find criminal clients a little depressing criminal clients they behave so well really rumpole erskinebrown sounded quite shocked what do they do i asked him knock people on the head rob banks cause at the worst a temporary inconvenience they dont converse by means of notes they dont lock up the geyser they dont indulge in three years silence to celebrate the passage of love love have you become an expert on that rumpole erskinebrown seemed amused rumpole in love should sell a bomb at the solicitors law stationers and ill tell you another great advantage of criminal customers i went on theyre locked up mostly pending trial they cant ring you up at all hours of the day and night now you get involved in a divorce and your lifes taken over we used to have all the facts of divorce cases printed out in detail in the times uncle tom remembered oh hello uncle tom it used to make amusing reading better than all this rubbish they print now about the common market far more entertaining erskinebrown left to go about his business not before i had told him that divorce for all its drawbacks was a great deal less sordid than foreclosing on mortgages and then henry presented me with another brief a mere twentyfive guineas this time to be heard by old archie mcfee the dock street magistrate youre an old girl called mrs wainscott sir henry told me charged with keeping a disorderly house an old pro is this what ive sunk to now henry plodding the pavements flogging my aged charms round the dock street magistrates court i checked the figure on the front of the brief twentyfive smackers not bad i suppose for a short time in dock street makes you wonder what i could earn round the west end i left henry then he seemed not to be amused the other side that is to say mr f thripp and his legal advisers had supplied his wife married in some faroff and rash moment in a haze of champagne and orange blossom with the evidence to be used against her i was somewhat dismayed when i discovered that this evidence included an equal number of notes typed on the same old olivetti as that used by the husband but travelling in the opposite direction i picked out at random to my socalled husband if you want your shirts washed take them down to the office and let her do them she does everything else for you doesnt she your socalled wife oh dear mrs thripp i wish you hadnt written this i put down the note which i had been viewing through a magnifying glass to check the type by the way whom did you suspect of doing his washing for him i looked at the client so did miss trant who was sitting in in pursuit of knowledge of rumpoles methods so did mr perfect master norman thripp who had joined us sat in a corner pointing a toy submachine gun at me in a way i did my best to ignore who we had him watched mr rumpole mr perfect told me he has an elderly secretary apparently shes a grandmother there doesnt seem to be anyone else there doesnt seem to be anyone else for either of you i picked up the husbands answer he alleges you assaulted his trousers no no i didnt do that mr rumpole his evening trousers were damaged apparently probably at the cleaners you remember he refused to take me to his ladies night he went on his own so his trousers cant have been all that bad can they did you mind him going i was finding the thripp marriage more and more mysterious mind of course i minded why because i wanted to go with him of course you wanted to go with the man who hasnt spoken to you for three years who communicates by wretched little notes who locked up your bath water at this point mrs thripp brought out a small lace handkerchief and started to sob i dont know i dont know why i wanted to go with him the sobs increased in volume i looked at mrs thripp with deep approval all right mrs thripp im simply asking the questions your husbands barrister will ask unless were extremely lucky you think my case is hopeless mrs thripp was mopping up noisily mr rumpoles afraid you may not make a good witness it was miss phyllida trant giving her learned opinion uninvited miss trant im afraid i was somewhat sharp with her you may know all about divorce law reform acts but i know all about witnesses mrs thripp will be excellent in the box i patted the still slightly heaving thripp shoulder well done mrs thripp you broke down at exactly the right stage of the crossexamination i picked up the first of the wretched chartered accountants notes i was by now looking forward to blasting him out of the witness box and saw i am going to my masonic ladies night its a pity i havent got a lady to take with me theres not a man sitting as a judge in the family division i promised her who wont find that note from your husband absolutely intolerable when the thripps mire etfils had been shepherded out by their solicitor perfect miss trant loitered and said she wanted my advice i expressed some surprise that she didnt know it all but i lit a small cigar and in the best tradition of the bar prepared to have my brains picked it seemed that miss trant had been entrusted with a brief for the prosecution before that great tribunal old archibald mcfee at the dock street magistrates court its a disorderly house i mean its an open and shut case i cant think why mrs wainscotts defending the old trouts probably got a weird taste for keeping out of holloway i blew out smoke savouring a bit of fun in the offing fate had decreed that i should be prosecuted by miss phyllida trant i kept cunningly quiet about my interest in the case of the police v wainscott and erskinebrowns former pupil proceeded to deliver herself into my hands what i wanted to ask you was how much law should i yes take i mean how many books will this magistrate want on the prosecution case miss trant had asked for it i stood and gave her my learned opinion my dear miss trant old archie mcfee is a legal beaver double first in jurisprudence reads russel on crime in bed and the appeal cases on holiday you want to pot the old bawdyhouse keeper quote every case you can think of archieu love you for it how many books do you need my advice to you is fill the taxi so we all gathered at dock street magistrates court there was old mother wainscott sitting beneath a pile of hennaed hair in the dock and there was old archie mcfee looking desperately bored and gazing yearningly at the clock as miss trant with a huge pile of dusty law books in front of her and her glasses on the end of her nose lectured him endlessly on the law relating to disorderly houses section of the statute sir any person who acts or behaves him or herself as master or mistress or as the person having the care government or managements of any bawdy house or other disorderly house shall be deemed to be the keeper thereof now if i might refer you to singleton and ellison i qb page do you have to refer me to it miss trant the learned magistrate sighed heavily oh yes sir im sure youll find it most helpful i sat smiling quietly like a happy spider as miss trant walked into the web she had looked shocked when she discovered that i was defending now she would discover that i had deceived her archie mcfee couldnt stand law his sole interests were rose growing amateur dramatics and catching the back to esher i was amazed she couldnt see the fury rising to the level of his stiff collar as he watched the clock and longed for victoria it is interesting to observe that in r v jones it was held that all women under years of age are girls although females may be women at the age of eighteen miss trant was unstoppable i suppose it interests you miss trant oh yes indeed sir turning now if you please sir to the sexual offences act a very long time later when it came to my turn and the prosecution had sunk under the dead weight of the law i made a speech guaranteed to get old archie off to the station in three minutes flat sir my learned friend has referred you to many books i would only remind you of one a wellknown book hi which it is written thou shall not bear false witness i glared at the young officer in charge of the case and i would apply that remark to the alleged observations of the police officer yes im not satisfied this charge is made out summons dismissed as archie went he fired his parting shot with costs miss trant mrs thripp rang me at home again that evening and told me that her solicitor perfect had fixed up a hearing in ten days time she wondered how she could live until then and told me i was her only friend in the world i was comforting her as best i could and stemming the threatened flow of tears over the wire by saying youll be free in a couple of weeks think of that old darling when i noticed that hilda had come into the room and was viewing me with a look of disapproval i put down the phone i suppose to a hostile observer the movement may have looked guilty however she who must be obeyed affected to ignore it and said casually im having tea with dodo tomorrow dodo dodo perkins and i were tremendously close at wycombe abbey said hilda coldly oh dodo yes of course the live one shes living in devon nowadays shes running her own tea shop well nice part devon you wont have seen her for some years we correspond i sent her a postcard and said lets meet when youre next up in london she gave me a look i can only describe as meaningful i want to ask her advice about something we may do some shopping and have tea at harrods well go easy on the chocolate gateaux what i know how much these teas at harrods cost i dont want to see all my profit on the disorderly house vanishing down dodos little red lane hilda ignored this and merely gave me some quite gratuitous information dodo never hiked you you know that rumpole she went leaving me only vaguely disconcerted when i went to the gin bottle however to prepare an evening booths and tonic i was astonished to notice a pencil mark on the label apparently intended to record the drinking habits of rumpole i sloshed out the spirit well past the plimsoll line our existence in froxbury court i thought was beginning to bear an uncomfortable resemblance to the way life was lived in maison thripp my life in those days seemed inseparable from women and their troubles when i got to chambers the next morning i found miss phyllida trant in my room her glasses off her eyes red and her voice exceedingly doleful she announced that after careful thought she had decided in view of her disastrous appearance at the dock street magistrates court to give up the bar and take up some less demanding profession and after youd been so helpful miss trants undeserved gratitude gave me an unusual twinge of guilt please dont mention it i wanted to get her off the subject of my unhelpful advice i know ill never make it i mean i know the law i was top student of my year and i interrupted her and said being a lawyers got almost nothing to do with knowing the law an open and shut case i had all the police observations and i went and lost it that wasnt because you didnt know all about the law it was because you didnt know enough about archie mcfee you just made rings round me never underestimate the craftiness of rumpole now i was giving her genuinely helpful advice it seems ungrateful after youd been so kind to me i wish you wouldnt go on saying that miss trant but ill have to give it up you cant once youre a lawyer youre addicted its like smoking or any other habitforming drug you get hooked on crossexamination you get a taste for great gulps of fresh air from the cells youll find out no no i wont ever i lit a small cigar and sat down at the desk opposite her she looked surprisingly young and confused and i found myself wanning to miss trant for some reason i wanted her to continue her struggle against magistrates and judges and cunning opponents even her appearance at dock street had shown some misguided courage you know we all have our disappointments i do you she looked incredulous one year i did the penge bungalow murder without a leader and the great brighton benefit club forgery case which is where i got my vast knowledge of typewriters and what am i doing now playing around with disorderly houses i have even sunk to a divorce i looked at her and saw a solution you know what your mistake is in court i mean miss trant shook her head she still had no idea of where shed gone wrong i would suggest a little more of the feminine qualities ask anyone in the temple how does rumpole carry on in court answer rumpole woos rumpole insinuates rumpole winds his loving fingers round the jury box or lies on his back purring if your lordship pleases like old mother wainscott from dock street i was rewarded with a small smile as she said thats ridiculous lawyers and tarts i told her and i meant it are the two oldest professions in the world and we always aim to please if i had managed to cheer up miss trant and even return her small nose to the legal grindstone i had no luck with she who must be obeyed relations as they say deteriorated and i got up one morning to find her suitcase packed and standing in the hall hilda was in the livingroom hatted coated and ready for travel you can come home as late as you like now rumpole and you can spend all the time you like with her her whoever could she be talking about ive heard her time and time again on the telephone dont be ridiculous i tried a light laugh thats a client rumpole ive lived with you for a good many years man and boy and ive never known you to be telephoned by a client at home i usually have quiet undemanding clients murderers dont fuss robbers can usually guess the outcome so that theyre calm and resigned divorcing ladies are different theyre inclined to telephone constantly so ive noticed also theyre always on bail theyre not kept locked up in brixton pending the hearing mores the pity im going to stay with dodo im going to stay with dodo and help her out with her business the tea shop i tried hard to remember this dodo who was coming to play a major part in our lives its far better i leave you rumpole to enjoy your harem listen hilda i did my best to remain calm i have a client whose unhappy marriage may well provide you and dodo with another tea in hatreds that cant be why youre leaving there was one of those silences that had become so frequent between us and then she said no no it isnt then why youve changed rumpole you dont go to work in the mornings and as for the gin bottle you marked it that was unforgiveable then dont forgive me an englishmans gin bottle is his castle at which point the phone rang hilda picked it up apparently thinking it was a taxi she had ordered but it was of course mrs thripp the wellknown married lady who seemed to depend entirely on rumpole hilda handed me the phone as though her worst suspicions were now thoroughly justified hilda went while i was still pacifying the client in the days that followed i stayed later at pommeroys got my own breakfast had a poached egg in the evenings and turned up alone and unaccompanied to have dinner with george frobisher at the royal borough hotel in kensington we sat in a drafty diningroom surrounded by lonely persons whose tables were littered with their personal possessions their own bottles of sauce their half bottles of wine their pills their saccharin and their medicines it was the sort of place that encourages talking in whispers so george and i muttered over the coffee getting such warmth as we could from our thimblefuls of port im sorry its not thursday george told me sadly they give us the chicken on thursday tonight it was the veal so it must be monday soup of the day is exactly the same all through the week enjoy your pommes de terre d iatiglaise did you boiled spuds excellent hildau be sorry she missed this hilda cares for veal does she we always get veal on mondays so we know where we are george suddenly remembered something monday good god ive got this divorce case tomorrow the other side stole a march on us they expedited the hearing george yes rumpole whats your divorce about exactly i told you im a husband tomorrow its just that well ive got one too you know i confessed im a wife horrible case i think i told you we allege this monstrous female savaged my trousers furthermore she hasnt spoken to me for three years she hasnt spoken toyout she started it thats a damned lie george i felt a sense of outrage on behalf of mrs thripp and raised my voice a nearby diner looked up from his soup of the day oh really and is it a damned lie about the bath water what about the bath water you ran off all the hot water deliberately you put a note on the geyser out of bounds i havent had a bath there for the last month i have to go all the way to ruislip to my mothers rumpole youre against me of course im against you im the wife you want to turn me out of the house and my child your child youve alienated normans affections what youve turned him against me its no doubt a strange habit of barristers to identify themselves so closely with their clients but by now we had both raised our voices and the other diners were listening but looking studiously away as though they were overhearing a domestic quarrel that is the most pernicious rubbish i ever heard and if you dare to put that forward in court i shall cut you in small pieces george and give you to the usher ive behaved like a saint oh yes you joan of arc george was becoming quite spirited and i suppose youre job himself id have to be to put up with you you are nothing but a great big bully george oh youre all very fine and brave when youve got someone weaker than yourself you weaker than me i told you youre a jezebel bluebeard lady macbeth lets just see how you stand up in court george lets just see how you stand up to crossexamination dont rely on crossexamination its the evidence that matters by the way im making my evening trousers an exhibit at this startling news the other diners had given up all pretence of not listening and were gazing at each other with a wild surmise i wasnt taking these allegations against my wronged client lying down anyone george can lacerate their own evening trousers with a pair of nail scissors its been done before thank you for the dinner rumpole perhaps in the long watches of the night george perhaps as you are watching match of the day on your colour tv it may occur to you to do the decent thing and let this case go undefended hasnt an unhappy woman suffered enough i left the diningroom then with all the diners staring at me when i got home and poured myself an unlimited gin i began to wonder exactly what they had thought of my relationship with my old friend george frobisher when i had rashly advised mrs thripp that there wasnt a man sitting as a judge who wouldnt be appalled at hearing of her treatment at the hands of thripp i had made a serious miscalculation i had forgotten that mrs justice appelby sat in the family division of the high court of justice and her ladyship was known as the only genuine male chauvinist pig in the building they used to say that when she went out on circuit to try murders she used to put on a thin line of lipstick before summing up to the jury that was the nearest mrs justice appelby ever got to the art of seduction if the judge was an unpleasant surprise mr f thripp was a disappointment he was hardly ideal casting for the part of bluebeard in fact he looked decidedly meek and mild a small man in rimless glasses and a nervous smile we could have hoped for something about twice the size the clerk called the case and we were off i rose to open a tale whose lightest word would harrow up the soul and freeze the young blood i weighed in on a high note this is one of the strangest cases this court may ever have heard the case of a bluebeard who kept his wife a virtual prisoner in their flat in muswell hill who denied her the simple comforts of biscuits and bath water who never gave her the comfort of his conversation and communicated with her by means of brusque and insulting little notes mr rumpole mrs justice appelbys blood was no doubt frozen already she looked unimpressed may i remind you of something the jury box is empty this is a trial by judge alone i dont require to be swayed by your oratory which no doubt is enormously effective in criminal cases just give me the relevant dates will you i gave her the dates and then i called my client she had dressed in black with a hat an excellent costume for funerals or divorces after a gentle introduction i put her husbands notes to her you and your socalled son can be off to your mothers in ruislip let her pay for the light you leave blazing in the toilet that was pinned up on my kitchen cupboard and what was the effect on you mrs thripp of that heartbreaking notice to quit she stayed for more apparently it was mrs justice appelby answering my question she turned to the witness box with that cold disapproval women reserve especially for each other well you didnt go did you why not i didnt know what he would do if i left him mrs thripp was looking at her husband i was puzzled to see that the look wasnt entirely hostile but the judge was after her like a terrier mrs thripp you put up with this intolerable conduct from your husband for three years why exactly i suppose i was sorry for him sorry for him why i thought hed never manage on his own when we came out for lunch i saw norman waiting outside the court he had a brand new armoured car with flashing lights a mounted machine gun and detachable soldiers in battle dress someone was doing well from this case apart from rumpole and george frobisher in the afternoon i crossexamined the respondent thripp miss trant sitting beside me in her virginal wig waited with baited breath for my first question mr thripp is there anything hi your conduct to your wife of which you are thoroughly ashamed in the pause while thripp examined this poser i whispered to miss tram my eager apprentice good question that if he says yes hes made a damaging admission if he says no hes a selfsatisfied idiot at which point thripp said no proving himself a selfsatisfied idiot really mr thripp you have behaved absolutely perfectly her ladyship had the point i made that fifteen love to rumpole in the second set im going out to my masonic ladies night its a pity i havent got a lady to take with me i was quoting from the thripp correspondence is that the way a perfect husband writes to his wife perhaps not buti was annoyed with her you see i had asked her to the ladies night asked her i left a note for her naturally she didnt reply tell me mr thripp did you actually want your wife to accompany you to your masonic ladies night oh yes indeed this inhuman monster who drains away your bath water and refuses to wash your shirts you were looking forward to spending a pleasant evening with her i had no one else to go with and would rather go with her than no one of course i would shes my wife isnt she mr thripp i suggest all your charges against her are quite untrue theyre not untrue but you wanted her with you you wanted to flaunt her on your arm at the cafe royal why come mr thripp will you answer that question it can hardly have been because you love her there was a long pause and i began to have an uneasy suspicion that i had asked one question too many then i knew i had because mr thripp said in the sort of matteroffact tone he might have used to announce the annual audit yes i do i love her i looked across at mrs thripp she was sighing with a sort of satisfaction as if she had achieved her object at last mr rumpole mrs justice appelbys voice like a cold shower woke me from my reverie is it really too late for commonsense to prevail commonsense my lady could there not be one final attempt at a reconciliation i felt a sinking in the pit of the stomach could it be that even divorce was slipping away from us and george and i would both have to go back to the crossword puzzle i have no power to order this the judge did her best to look pleasant it was not a wild success but it does seem to me that mr and mrs thripp might meet perhaps in counsels chambers simply to explore the possibilities of a reconciliation there is one very important consideration of course and i refer to young norman thripp the child of the family i shall adjourn now until tomorrow morning at which her ladyship rose smartly and we were all upstanding in court obedient to mrs justice appelbys orders the thripps met in my room that afternoon george frobisher and i our differences now sunk in the face of the new menace from the judge shared my small cigars and our anxieties theyve been there a long time george was looking nervously at my closed door im afraid it doesnt look too healthy just then the clerks room door opened for henry to come out about some business i had a brief glimpse of norman thripp the child of the family seated at diannes desk he was banging the keys of our old standard imperial no doubt playing at secretaries in my opinion george was still grumbling they shouldnt allow women on the bench that mrs justice appelby what does she think shes doing depriving us of our refreshers before i could agree wholeheartedly the door of my room opened to let out a beaming thripp well gentlemen he said i think well be withdrawing the case tomorrow we still have one or two things to talk over talk over well thatll be a change said mrs thripp following him out then they collected norman who was still happily playing with diannes typewriter and took him home leaving george and i in a state of gloomy suspense the next morning i got to the law courts early climbed into the fancy dress and found mrs thripp and young norman waiting for me outside mrs justice appelbys forum in the family division well mrs thripp i suppose we come to bury caesar not to praise him what do you mean mr rumpole youre dropping the case mrs thripp to my surprise was shaking her head and opening her handbag she brought out a piece of paper and handed it to me her voice tremulous with indignation no mr rumpole she said im going on with the case i got this this morning leaning up against the cornflakes packet at breakfast i took the note from her the old barrister you dug ups going to lose this case ill have you and your socalled son out of here in a week your socalled husband i read the typewritten document and then studied it with more care hes mad thats what he is i cant live with a maniac mr rumpole as far as my client was concerned the reconciliation was clearly off mrs thripp weve got to beat him ive got to think of norman caged up with a man like that yes norman i pulled out my watch weve got a quarter of an hour i feel the need of a coffee do you think norman would like a doughnut im sure wed be glad to not we mrs thripp in this instance i think id like to see young norman on his own so i took norman down to the cafd in the crypt of the law courts and as he tucked into a doughnut and fizzy orangeade i brought the conversation round to the business in hand rum business marriage youve never been married have you norman i lit a small cigar and gazed at the young hopeful through the smoke of course not norman found the idea amusing no seriously married people have odd ways of showing their love and affection have they some whisper endearments some send each other abusive notes some even have to get as far as the divorce court to prove they cant do without each other a rum business care for another doughnut no no im all right thanks he was eating industriously with sugar on the end of his nose as i moved in to the attack all right you were all right werent you norman when they really looked like separating i dont know what you mean when they were both trying to win you over to their side when you got a present a week from mum and a rival present from dad tanks planes guns its been a sort of arms race between them hasnt it norman i dont know what youre talking about mr rumpole norman repeated with rather less conviction this mad impulse of your parents to get together again doesnt show much consideration for you or for me either come to that i dont mind if they get together its their business isnt it yes norman their business im not stopping them he took another doughnut he was going to need it really course im not the second doughnut came and i gave norman a fragment of my autobiography i dont do much divorce you know crime mainly i was in the great brighton benefit club forgery whats forgery the child was roundeyed with innocence you had to admire the act oh youre good norman youll come out wonderfully in your interviews with the police the genuine voice of innocence whats forgery i whipped out the latest item in the thripp correspondence this is inspect it carefully norman all the other notes were typewritten sos this norman kept his head the others were done on the old olivetti your parents keep in muswell hill this mornings note was typed on a standard imperial with a small gap in the capital s i got out my folding pocket glass and offered it to him here borrow my glass norman dared to do so and examined the evidence typed on the imperial on which dianne in my chambers hammers out my socalled learned opinions the typewriter you were playing with so innocently yesterday in the clerks room i put it to you norman you typed that last note in a desperate effort to keep this highly profitable divorce case going norman looked up from my magnifying glass and said i didnt see any gap in the capital s didnt you norman the judge will what judge for the first time he sounded rattled the judge who tries you for forgery a word you understand perfectly ill take the evidence now i retrieved the last incriminating note four years they gave the chief villain in the brighton case they wouldnt norman looked at me i felt almost sorry for him as if he were my client as your lawyer norman i can only see one way out for you a full confession to your mum and dad he bit hard into the second doughnut seriously considering the possibility and one more word of advice norman settle for being a chartered accountant youve got absolutely no talent for crime my old friend george was extremely angry with me when norman confessed and the thripps were reunited we lost all our refreshers he told me just because i had to behave like a damned detective i explained to him that i couldnt resist using the skills i had learnt in the great brighton fraud case and he told me to stick to crime in the future you rumpole said george severely have absolutely buggered up the work in the family division further surprises were in store when i got back to the mansions in search of the poached egg and the lonely bed i found hildas case in the hall and she apparently just arrived and still in her overcoat installed wearily in her chair by the simulated coals of our electric fire rumpole whats the matter fallen out with dodo had a bit of a scene over a drop scone youre home early daddy was never back home at three oclock in the afternoon he always stayed in chambers till six oclock regular as clockwork every day of his life my divorce collapsed under me i lit a small cigar hilda rose and started to make the room shipshape a long neglected task youre going to seed rumpole you hang about at home in the mornings and you know why my divorce collapsed i thought i should tell her if im not here to keep an eye on you youll go to seed completely i blew out smoke and warmed my knees at the electric fire the clients were reconciled because however awful it is however silent and unendurable however much they may hate each others guts and quarrel over the use of the geyser they dont want to be alone isnt that strange hilda theyd rather have war together than a lonely peace if id stayed away any longer youd have gone to seed completely she was throwing away the times for a couple of weeks o woman in our hours of ease i got to my feet and gave her the snatch of walter scott again uncertain coy and hard to please youd have stayed home from chambers all day doing the crossword and delving into the gin bottle and variable as the shade by the light of quivering aspens made i moved to the door if youre going to the loo rumpole try to remember to switch the light off when pain and anguish ring the brow a ministering angel thou i was half way down the passage when i heard she calling after me its for your own good rumpole im telling you for your own good rumpole and the learned friends now more than ever seems it rich to die to cease upon the midnight with no pain doctor hanson told you rumpole youre not dying youve got flu i was lying on my back in a pair of flannel pyjamas my brow with anguish moist and fever dew and hilda most efficiently playing the part of matey or ward sister was pouring out the linctus into a spoon and keeping my mind from wandering whatever doctor hanson who in my humble opinion would be quite unable to recognize a case of death when he saw it might say i felt a curious and trancelike sense of detachment not at all unpleasant and seriously wondered if rumpole were not about to drop off the twig fade far away dissolve and quite forget what thou among the leaves hast never known the weariness the fever and the fret as i recited to her hilda took advantage of the open mouth to slide in the spoonful of linctus i didnt relish the taste of artificially sweetened hair oil all the same little johnny keats lord byrons pissabed poet had put the matter rather well then more than ever seemed it rich to get away from it all no more judges no more bowing and saying if your lordship pleases no more hopelessly challenging the verbals no more listening to endless turgid speeches from my learned friends for the prosecution to cease upon the midnight with no pain from my position between two worlds i heard the telephone beside the bed ringing distantly hilda picked it up and told whoever it was that they couldnt speak to mr rumpole who who cant speak to me well hes busy at the moment hilda lied to the telephone in fact i had done absolutely nothing for the last three days busy im not busy busy dying hilda laughed i thought a trifle flippantly thats what he says anyway no henry well not this week certainly its my clerk my clerk henry i returned to earth and grabbed the telephone from she im sorry to hear youre dying sir henry as alwaysj sounded perfectly serious and not tremendously interested dying henry well thats a bit of an exaggeration there was a con for you sir at brixton prison the dartford post office robbery mr bernards got the safe blower a safe blowing in dartford i felt my head clear and swung my legs out of bed and feet to the floor theres nothing like the prospect of the old bailey for curing all other diseases ill tell mr bernard you cant be there tell him nothing of the sort henry ill be there no trouble at all ill just fling on a few togs as i made for the wardrobe hilda looked at me as if my recent flirtation with the unknown had been some sort of a charade i thought you were dying she said dying as i explained to her would have to be postponed safe blowing came first when i was dressed wrapped in a muffler and buttoned into an overcoat by matey i set out for chambers and there i made two unpleasant discoveries the first being that there were those who would not have regretted rumpoles continued absence from chambers by reason of death at that time we were suffering from a good deal of overcrowding and erskinebrowns small room which opened into the entrance hall had to accommodate not only erskinebrown himself but his expupil miss phyllida trant and his two new pupils who sometimes dived into my room to borrow books and then shot out again like frightened rabbits also my old friend george frobisher took refuge there whenever his old friend hoskins with whom george shared a room was having an intimate conference with a divorcee as i passed erskinebrowns open door i could see his room was bursting at the seams and as i hung up my hat and coat in the hallway i heard the voice of the erskinebrown say he supposed theyd have to hang on in that black hole of calcutta a little longer but he added at least he cant be with us forever who cant be with us forever it was miss trants voice rumpole of course i mean hes bound to retire sometime hes a good age and henrys been telling me hes not all that well i chose that moment to stick my nose into the black hole morning erskinebrown nose to the grindstone miss trant miss trant looked up from the brief she was reading and gave me a smile she really has decidedly pretty teeth ever since i deceived her so heartlessly i have become almost fond of miss trant oh hello rumpole i thought you were off sick erskinebrown was trying to move georges particulars of nuisance off his statement of claim recovered now i sneezed loudly rumpole resurrected sorry to disappoint you thats a nasty cold youve got oughtnt you to be in bed miss trant was solicitous i looked at her brief neatly underlined in red and green points for and against women are such industrious creatures whos your client oh just a thief hell have to plead guilty hes said such ridiculous things to the police you twist his arm philly judges dont like you wasting the courts time with hopeless cases erskinebrown was one of natures pleaders i decided that the stage of her career had come when miss trant might benefit from some proper advice never plead guilty i told her that should be written up in letters a foot high in every room in chambers a foot high we havent got the room for it erskinebrown was still sulking and george looked up from the corner of the desk he was occupying as though hed just noticed me hello rumpole havent seen you about lately ive been dying i say dont do that i should miss your help with the crossword thinking uneasily that the sole justification of my existence seemed to be helping george frobisher with the crossword i went into the clerks room and henry presented me with the brief in the dartford post office robbery youve got plenty of time air rumpole they dont want the two of you down there till three oclock now the two of us i was puzzled the defendant wheelers got a certificate for two counsel excellent giving me a junior are they someone to take a note well not exactly mr rumpole henry had the grace to look embarrassed youre being led theyre briefing a silk you can take it easy for once i was being led i was a junior barrister in the th year of my life easy i dont want to take it easy im afraid i exploded at henry havent they heard im out of rompers im off the bloody leading rein i managed the penge bungalow murder alone and without a leader i came out of the clerks room clutching my junior brief and was met with a whiff of aftershave as the tall elegant figure of guthrie featherstone qc appeared through the front door in his gents natty velvetcollared overcoat and bowler hat slumming down in chambers after a triumph in the house hullo rumpole he greeted me affably im afraid youre going to see a lot of my back this week your back what do you mean your back im leading you in the dartford post office robbery he smiled in a damnably friendly fashion and went into the clerks room youre leading me featherstone i called after him but he affected not to hear i went on towards my room but as i passed her open door i looked in once more on that tireless worker miss phyllida trant you were perfectly right miss trant i ought to have stayed in bed i dont expect youve noticed brixton prison as youve driven down to brighton on a sunny sunday morning the prison gates are down a long extremely dreary street off the main road you pass little knots of visitors girl friends black mums with their babies and large screws going or coming from their time off being a screw has become something of a growth industry i met one who gave up school teaching for wardering the pays so much better and you get free golf no matter what the weather is like in other parts of london a fine rain always seems to be falling on the long walk down to brixton that day featherstone had parked his wellmanicured rover up in the main road and leader and junior walked together up to the gates of the prison house our client was a wellknown minor south london villain named charlie wheeler a professional safe blower with a string of convictions going back to his childhood days when charlie forced the dr barnardos box in the local church and which included many notable exploits with safes the evidence against him wasnt much just charlies fingerprints found on a fragment of gelignite left beside the blown safe in the post office it wasnt much but it was quite satisfactory evidence provided you were appearing for the prosecution if you were for the defence well youd have to improvise i explained this to featherstone but he looked gloomy and said if you ask me this case is as dead as a doornail so are we all eventually i tried to cheer him up two men in stocking masks hold up the post office one has a shotgun and our friend wheelers fingerprints are on a lump of explosive i know i know wed reached the prison doors and i rang the visitors bell featherstone smiled faintly i wonder why he didnt leave his visiting card ill tell you old sweetheart i was serious old cons like charlie wheeler dont have visiting cards the small hole in the huge wooden doors rattled open i waved featherstone in after you my learned friend leaders always go into prison first as soon as i get into a prison i become moody and depressed and have a strong desire to scream and fight my way out if this is how a visitor feels treated with respect even deference by the screws i dont know how i could stand a fiveyear sentence and yet ive had clients who greet five years rather like a pound from the poor box i have also been entirely convinced since my seventh year that i would land up in the nick sooner or later for some trivial reason or other and fear it constantly that wet afternoon in the inner courtyard at brixton with the killer airedales sniffing around at the end of their leads and the trusty boys planting out crysanths in the sooty flower beds the feeling came over me more strongly than ever stronger than the fear of death when they put me inside i said to myself ill volunteer to be one of those trusties that plant out the crysanths at least ill get to learn about horticulture but before i could plan further we were in the neat glasspanelled interview room you could see through the walls to where in a succession of similar rooms cons were having meetings with their briefs in the centre of the complex the screws sat by a table on which cacti grew in pots among stones providing half a dozen elegant and miniature japanese gardens i can tell you its really very cosy in brixton so we all sat round charlie wheelers advisors featherstone the qcj rumpole the junior bernard the solicitor and joyce his secretary a jolly fairhaired girl in jeans and a mac dressed more for a wet weekend in haslemere than the nick who clutched the file and was inclined to giggle disconcertingly during serious passages of the evidence i once had her in court in a murder and she laughed so audibly at the pathologists report that she had to be led out well we were both younger then now she seemed moderately composed as charlie wheeler held out his hand to me as though we were alone in the room im glad to see you mr rumpole itd amaze you the reputation you got in e wing i felt a dry cough coming on and my head still swam a little they can inscribe that on my tombstone he had an amazing reputation round e wing youre not going to die are you mr rumpole charlie seemed genuinely concerned i was considering the possibility im that glad youre doing my case im not exactly doing your case charlie i hated to disappoint him your case is being conducted by mr guthrie featherstone qc mp his name is constantly mentioned charlie in the corridors of power i havent heard much of you charlie looked doubtfully at the qc mp not from the blokes in e wing rumpole if i may featherstone was apparently about to gather up the reins of course of course my learned leader you want to conduct this conference well its your right now then wheeler he means you charlie i translated rumpole please i shall make a note of all your words of wisdom from now on i got out a note book and pen featherstone went on with admirable calm what i wanted to say wheeler was not too fast if you dont mind i was putting him down at dictation speed were here to fight this case were going to leave no stone unturned to fight it to the best of my poor ability my poor ability i repeated what seemed to me to be a key phrase as i wrote but mr bernards no doubt told you who our judge is featherstone went on ignoring the interruption i know charlie sounded deeply depressed judge bullingham so any sort of attack on the honesty of the police featherstone went on and bernard raised a voice in warning i told you charlie would act like a red rag to a bullingham i suppose you told him that i supplied the thought for charlie to chew over look mr bernards explained it to me i dont want to lay into dirty dickerson whos that featherstone looked puzzled and i enlightened him from my memory of the brief i imagine that is a reference to detective inspector dickerson the officer in charge of the case i mean there aint a whole lot of point charlie seemed resigned for which featherstone was extremely grateful well exactly the evidence against you is undisputable so whats the point of annoying the judge with a whole lot of questions i told you charlie bernard nodded wisely i mean if i dont say nothing against dickerson if i keep quiet like well how much mr rumpole i were hoping for an eight hope springs eternal in the human breast i could tell him no more in my experience listen to the wise words of the learned leader when they came the leaders words were by no means filled with original thought any sort of attack on the police in a case like this will add considerably to your sentence so lets be sensible i must warn you wheeler the time may very well come when i have to throw in my hand you mean charlies hand dont you i said and featherstone looked at me as if he wished hed been lumbered with any other junior counsel in the temple however old and near to death as we walked back to the main road and the parked rover featherstone put his problem in a nutshell i cant make bricks without straw rumpole down the bailey you have to make bricks without bricks you never get the luxury of straw of course ill mitigate featherstone said sportingly i tried to point out the hopelessness of this course what could you say in mitigation my client only called in for a yp stamp my lord but as he was kept waiting behind ten old ladies with pension books and a lunatic arguing over a dog licence he lost his patience and blew the safe well rumpole hardly we were standing on each side of the rover eyeing each other in an unfriendly fashion across the polished roof as featherstone unlocked the drivers door forget mitigation for a moment i told him whats the use of spending your life in an attitude of perpetual apology do you think charlie wheelers going to blow a safe without gloves even in a sub post office in dartford do you think hes going to leave a bit of spare gelignite around with his trade mark on it is that the mark of a professional featherstone slid into the drivers seat and opened the passenger door think about it featherstone i bundled myself into the car beside him it would be like you standing up in court and mitigating in your pyjamas i decided that evening to drown all uneasy thoughts as to the conduct of wheelers defence in three or four glasses of chateau fleet street in pommeroys wine bar i went there with my old friend george frobisher and saw that the watering hole was well filled barristers at one end of the bar including erskinebrown miss trant and guthrie featherstone going walkabout among his loyal subjects journalists at the other and myself and george at one of the crowded tables in the snug they say uncle toms not too well george told me about our oldest no longer practising member of chambers who is nowadays they say old t c rowley is distinctly seedy well hes a good age hes over whats good about being over i really would have liked an answer to this question does the pain of hopeless frustration in which we all live become at such an age a dull and bearable ache of resignation is the loss of hearing and eyesight compensated for by a palate more than ever sensible to the thin warmth of chateau fleet street before i could press george further on the subject however a young man in a tweed suit with hornrimmed glasses and a falling lock of fair hair detached himself from the journalists group and approached our table mrrumpole i admitted it philbeam i write the in depth column in the sunday george stood i dont believe he trusts journalists forgive me rumpole i thought id call in on old tom on my way back to the hotel any messages give him my love oh and tell him well all be joining him eventually really rumpole george sounded shocked and he went whereupon philbeam sat opposite me and fixed me with his glittering hornrims i made him welcome and ordered further clarets a gentleman of the press ill always be grateful for the space you gave me during the penge bungalow murder i think that was before my time i rather think it was probably reported by your grandfather philbeam i could see by looking at him had a point i was in court when you defended ken aspen the rape case with the member of parliament hardly one of my major triumphs admired the way you crossexamined that girl i was just wondering where all this chat with the smoothtalking philbeam was getting us when he leaned forward and said what i wanted to ask you mr rumpole was yes have you ever run up against a detective inspector dickerson round dartford somewhere dirty dickersoni was interested have you heard that too philbeam smiled you know how he got his name noi saidive no idea so he started to tell me up by the bar i heard featherstone say sante as he raised his glass to erskinebrown i discovered later that erskinebrown had been picked to make one of his comparatively rare apppearances at the bailey in the role of prosecuting counsel in the dartford post office case and that featherstone was drinking to what promised to be a most civilized occasion with both sides being of the greatest possible assistance to each other and prosecution and defence collaborating in seeing charlie wheeler put gently away for a very long time indeed whilst this was going on philbeam was telling me of an investigation his paper was carrying out on dickerson there were the usual sort of allegations villains verballed unless they paid up money taken for not opposing bail and such like police procedure i once did an interview with a man called harris philbeam told me minor sort of south london villain loads of convictions sounds like my kind of criminal never printed it of course but harry harris told me d i dickerson once handed him a stolen cigarette case got his fingerprints all over it then he made harris pay him quid not to be prosecuted for the theft glory hallelujah i had my first hint then of how dangerously charlie wheeler might be defended you are a blessing philbeam in an excellent disguise i trust this is not an isolated incident ive got a whole file on dickerson of course i cant use it yet the leading lady likes to win his libel actions leading lady thats what we call our editor i let that pass i had an urgent mission for philbeam can you find us harris i know the pubs he goes to shouldnt be difficult oh please i beg you philbeam find him leave no pub unturned he sounds like a small straw we might just make a brick or two with him until harris was found i had really nothing to go on nothing that i could make featherstone use as ammunition in a fight even if i had harris and a pile of similar cannonballs i was beginning to doubt if i could ever get guthrie to fire a shot i looked across to my learned leader at the bar and saw him get out a large silk handkerchief and sneeze it was not i feared a signal to change rather a trumpet call to retreat lacking harris or any other tangible defence i had to fall back on the flu as ammunition for my learned leader accordingly i brought to court a throat spray a pile of clean handkerchiefs and a packet of cough drops which could be opened and noisily consumed during vital parts of the prosecution evidence i ranged these weapons out in front of me on the first remarkably uneventful day in court it was so uneventful in fact and so little was said on behalf of the defence that his honour judge bullingham became positively benign one of the unsolved mysteries of the universe and a matter i find it hard to speculate upon that such relatively straightforward problems as free will or life after death is why on earth ronnie bullingham was ever made an old bailey judge its not his fault that he has a thick heavily veined neck and the complexion of a beetroot past its first youth his personal habits such as picking his teeth and searching in his ear with his little finger while on the bench i can forgive and his unreasoning prejudice against all black persons defence lawyers and probation officers i can mercifully attribute to some deep psychological cause perhaps the bulls mother if such a person can be imagined was assaulted by a black probation officer who was on his way to give evidence for the defence what i cannot forgive is his honours appalling treatment of the english language his summingups have to be translated by the court of appeal like pages of urdu and all the jury get is a vague impression of a man so shaken with rage that some dreadful crime must have caused it the only kind of sentence in which bullingham never falters is one of seven years and up so there we were before this appalling tribunal charlie wheeler resigned bernard tremendously anxious his nice secretary blushing as the judge stared with undisguised hostility at her trousers and erskinebrown taking mr fingleton the fingerprint expert through his predictably damaging evidence it was a rare occasion peace and tranquillity in bullinghams court mr fingleton said erskinebrown do you produce enlarged photographs of the first second and third fingers of the defendant wheeler yes i carefully unfolded the first of my pile of hankies and loudly blew the rurnpole nose diverting the attention of some of the jury does the defence admit them the bull glared towards us featherstone rose and bowed as if hed been addressing the house of lords those are admitted my lord well thank you said the judge in an unprecedented burst of good manners im very much obliged to you mr featherstone i bet you are old darling i muttered as featherstone sank gracefully back into his seat and do you also produce enlarged photographs of the fingerprints on the small piece of gelignite taken by detective inspector dickerson from the scene of the crime yes i could see it was time to use the throat spray i lifted it to the open mouth now what do you say about those two sets of fingerprints i puffed the throat spray regrettably i couldnt drown the answer i have found distinct points of similarity and by points of similarity you mean the bull wanted it spelt out for the jury the break in the first whorl on the index finger for instance my lord is exactly the same in both cases the photographs were handed round twelve good jurypersons who were flattered into becoming experts yes i think the members of the jury can see that quite clearly you can cant you bullinghams manner to the jury was a nice mixture of a creep and a crow and so mr fingleton what is your conclusion just tell the jury erskinebrowns approach was more subtle he simply wanted the witness to tell us his views provided of course they were the views of the prosecution my conclusion is fingleton was an experienced witness he turned politely to the jury but rumpole was an experienced defender he worked at the throat spray producing a cloud of medicated mist and created a genuine diversion even fingleton paused and turned to look this is not a hospital the judges remark seemed painfully obvious i would stress that for the benefit of junior counsel for the defence yes mr fingleton in the enforced silence that followed fingleton struck the fingerprints are identical my lord thank you very much mr fingleton erskinebrown sat down with great pleasure i dont know what i expected of the rustling silk in front of me an attack on the whole theory of the fingerprint as first promulgated by professor purkinje of the university of breslau the classification into whorls loops arches and composites pioneered by sir e r henry of the bengal police something anything to puzzle the jury and infuriate the bull as it was the qc rose in all his glory to deliver himself of his single ban mot no questions my lord i cant do anything with this evidence featherstone whispered to me as he sat down no you cant i told him i gave out a final fusillade of coughs the only effect of which was to drown the judge as he thanked my leader with every appearance of delight for his brilliant contribution to the trial that evening i was rereading my brief in the livingroom at froxbury court with a still slightly feverish eye i came again to something in charlie wheelers proof of evidence that had always puzzled me a conversation he had had with d i dickerson at about two in the morning in a police cell charlies recollection of the event hadnt been particularly clear but it seemed there had been an offer of bail in exchange for a confession and it had ended in some sort of temporary agreement because the officer had shaken charlies hand before leaving him for the rest of the night i read the short unilluminating paragraph through several times before something which could hardly be called an idea more a vague hint of the possibility of some future thought floated into my mind i lit a small cigar which considerably improved the quality of my cough and gazed at the rising smoke then the telephone rang a most unexpected caller none other than mrs marigold featherstone speaking directly from the sick bed she was heartbroken to tell me but poor guthrie had a temperature of it had come at the worst possible time what with the foreign office dinner next week and his speech on devolution she really couldnt let guthrie risk all that by coming down to the old bailey of course not dont dream of it you keep the old darling tucked up in bed rumpole was extremely solicitous and keep the hotwaterbottles going and beef tea constantly simmering on the hob the old baileys a nasty draughty place marigold sounded grateful and passed the phone to her husband who croaked an apology and said did i mind holding the fort and he was sure i agreed there was nothing to do ut to mitigate in view of the evidence we had heard quite right guthrie i assured him of course well have to plead no i wont attack the officer in charge of the case ill adopt your technique i admired it so much no questions my lord that really endeared you to the old bull you had the old sweetheart purring now you stay in bed guthrie twentyfour hours at least dont you dream of moving i was putting down the phone with a grin of pure pleasure when hilda came in flushed from the washing up and asked who was on the phone i stood and greeted her with words of delight oh frabjous day hilda i said callooh callay he chortled in his joy what on earths the matter with you rumpole the matter nothings the matter its an occasion for rejoicing ive given up my learned leader the flu then i phoned the night editor of that prestigious sunday paper which examines our lives in depth and left a message for the industrious philbeam i got up early the next morning and was down at ludgate circus as the allnight printers came off work and indulged myself in the treat of breakfast in jocks cafe opposite the old bailey a place patronized by the discerning coppers reporters and meat porters of smithfield where the two eggs rashers and fried slice are the best in london and where i have roughed out over a third cup of coffee some of my most devastating crossexaminations and most moving speeches for the defence i was joined at breakfast by philbeam to whom i gave the glad tidings that the worlds greatest mitigator was docked in bed for the remainder of the trial my spirits were only a little dashed by the fact that philbeam had so far failed in his search for harris ive been round twenty pubs he told me no joy but ive got a number to phone place where his sister works he looked at his watch they wont be open till oh find him philbeam old darling we may be all set for the unmasking of dirty dickerson i sent philbeam about his business and went over to the palais de justice the dear old place was as i liked it best quiet and peaceful with only a few tired cleaning ladies and sleepy attendants to greet me i got changed into my working clobber wig gown and so on at my leisure and went down to the lower ground floor i had rung bernard the night before and asked him to meet me for an early conference with the client but when i got to the old battered newgate door which divides the safe sheep from the imperilled goats i found only the secretary joyce looking harassed and with her arms full of files oh mr rumpole she panted at me mr bernard wont be with you this morning a funeral not his a clients thats all right then im just going down the cells to see charlie oh oh well im with mr hoskins on a fraud in the west court weve got a conference over there and you run along my dear i reassured her i believe i can cope with a conference alone and without a leader at which she went off gratefully and i went up to the iron gate to do what no sensible barrister ever does see a client alone before a trial perhaps i was too full of my sudden freedom from the leading rein to be sensible at that moment and i was still in a cheerful mood when the screw left his mug of tea and jam sandwich to open the door to me got wheeler have you i asked him charlie wheeler well i dont think hes gone out anywhere this screw was a wit he dont get many invitations not many invitations thats rich that is exceeding rich i laughed appreciatively you know what being an old bailey hack over the years blunts it blunts the sensitivity the sensitivity comes out like hair on the comb and when you go down the cells youre prepared to laugh at anything you ever paid dickerson money charlie wheeler and i were a deux in the interview room both smoking away at my small cigars id never entertain it oh i know some as paid him including harry harris you knows a lot dont you charlie looked at me with some admiration i try to keep abreast of the underworld so you were known to the detective inspector as a dedicated nonpayer you could say that there was a pause as i searched for charlies statement in the brief then he said mr featherstone not here today we had a bit of luck with the flu it says somewhere here that the d i was on the point of offering you bail that seemed funny to me like very funny with your record of course he wanted something for it he was asking me to put my hands up like sign a confession you werent going to i never done that mr rumpole its not the way i work all the same yes i strung him along a bit i let him think we might do a deal we even shook hands on it like yes tell me more about that shook hands on the deal like well he put out his hand like and took mine you ever had your hand taken by a police officer before this was the part that interested me no only me collar show me how he shook hands with you you be the detective inspector charlie took my hand but only for a moment it was all over in a second and i never made no statement it aint in me character how did dickerson look when he shook hands with you did he look pleased triumphant i couldnt hardly see him what it was in my cell in the dartford nick i dont know about two oclock of a morning i was half asleep well he was in the dark like he did seem that little bit nervous nervous well you know what you expect from a man of his build good firm grip well that hand of his felt a bit clammy and soft i stood up the vague thought had not only become an idea but a plan of attack a series of questions for crossexamination how do you feel about this case mr rumpole charlie looked up at me doubtfully feel like stout cortez who when with the eagle eyes he stared at the pacific and all his men looked at each other with a wild surmise you got me there mr rumpole keats its been an autumn of keats to cease upon the midnight with no pain quite enough of that were recovered now rumpole resurrected you reckon weve got a chance mr rumpole a tiny chance perhaps like a small electric light bulb in a dark cell more chance than mitigating i sat down again at the table and started to explain the position as clearly as i could to charlie i cant tell you understand that i cant put you in the box and let the jury have your excellent record as a safe blower read out to them but i want your express instructions you ave them mr rumpole what you got in mind i think i ought to ask inspector dirty dickerson a few impertinent questions so this is what im going to ask him with your kind permission it was then that i got charlie wheelers instructions to do exactly as i did in his trial i think in view of the following disastrous happenings i should make that perfectly clear d i dickerson was a large smiling man with greying hair which covered the top of his ears and a bright and expensive silk tie and matching handkerchief he looked the sort of man who would be the life and soul of the office party or the man on the package holiday to ibiza you would be most careful to move away from he was holding his prized possession a small plastic bag containing a minute quantity of gelignite labelled exhibit i as erskinebrown came to the end of his questions we have heard from the expert that wheelers fingerprints are on that small piece of gelignite where did you find it beside the safe at the scene of the crime my lord dickerson said respectfully in the dartford post office the bull weighed in yes my lord thank you detective inspector erskinebrown sat down his duty done have you any questions to ask the detective inspector the judge dared me just a few my lord rumpole rose slowly to his feet well then get on with it the judge was treating the defence with his usual courtesy do you know a man named harris harry harris there are two ways to crossexamine depending on the witness and your mood you either start off politely asking a series of questions to which the answer will be yes gaining the subjects confidence and agreement leading him gently up the garden path to a carefully planned booby trap or you go in like an old warship with all guns blazing i had decided that the bulls court at the bailey was no place for subtlety and i went in for the broadside approach the d i looked somewhat taken aback but answered with his usual bonhomie i know a harry harris a friend of charlie wheelers yes how would you describe him you want me to describe him mr rumpole has asked the questions the risk is on his head the bulls image was imprecise but his knowing leer at the jury made his meaning plain harris is a minor villain sir round the dartford area you asked for it mr rumpole the judge was delighted and the jury smiled i battled on ignoring the barracking from the bench have you had any financial dealings with harris my lord as if i hadnt got enough opponents erskinebrown rose to interrupt erskinebrown i muttered will you not interrupt my crossexamination can i ask how questions about this man harris are in any way relevant to the case of wheeler erskinebrown persisted with a glare of judicial encouragement quite right the judge challenged me whats this man harris got to do with this case not this case my lord but then your question is entirely irrelevant a simple mind that of the bull my lord when the character of this officer is called into question oh really are you attacking this officers character the judge tried a voice of dangerous courtesy but only succeeded in sounding ordinarily rude i wasnt offering him a gold medal at this the jury laughed bullingham let that one go and then said i can only assume youre making this attack on instructions i take full responsibility my lord i see your learned leader isnt in court unfortunately my lord he is struck down by the flu i tried to sound depressed bullingham came insultingly to my aidperhaps youd like me to adjourn this crossexamination so it can be done properly by learned leading counsel thank you my lord i am quite happy to proceed i had no time to loose for gods sake guthries flu might be better by the next day the judge tried a last attack i hope you are not making this suggestion without being in a position to call harris i looked round the court and at this moment my good angel philbeam came bursting in through the swing doors i put my stake on an even chance and said certainly i can call him at this point the witness nobly volunteered to answer my questions however objectionable they might be and i beckoned philbeam to my side the news was not good harriss sister had been contacted but hadnt heard of her brother for two years philbeam whispered shall i keep trying for gods sake i whispered back and then straightened to hear d i dickerson tell the judge that he never had any financial dealings of any sort with harris the bull wrote this down carefully and said very well mr rumpole has his answer although it probably wasnt the one he wanted with this judge the rapier was always replaced by the bludgeon do you want to try your luck with any more questions mr rumpole just one or two my lord detective inspector when charlie wheeler was in the dartford nick where the j udge frowned in the police cells at dartford police station i translated politely there is such a thing as plain english mr rumpole just as well to use it bullingham said that to me i had no time to lose my temper with him and i was off in pursuit of the di did you ever on any occasion at dartford police station shake hands with charlie wheeler there was a moments hesitation and the witness put his big hands in his jacket pockets is my english plain enough for you shake his hand i may have done have you ever shaken a prisoners hand before not that i can remember so why should you have shaken hands with charlie wheeler suddenly the court was quiet the jury were paying attention dickerson took a long ten seconds to think of his answer your client told me he was about to make a confession statement i was congratulating him on showing a bit of sense the silence was broken by a general giggle led by the judge is that the answer you wanted mr rumpole the bull was positively beaming yes my lord it is i wished to establish that this officer took my client by the hand as he was prepared to make a confession the jury were reminded from the bench once again i ignored the interruption and asked the witness did you discuss bail with him on that occasion bail no sir there was no discussion of bail whatsoever dickerson looked pained at the suggestion did you say you wouldnt oppose bail if he made a confession i said nothing of the sort my lord bullingham sighed heavily threw down his pencil and turned on me mr rumpole are there any further allegations of a serious nature to be made against this officer only one my lord may i have exhibit i please the usher brought me the little lump of gelignite in its plastic bag that is the small piece of gelignite the judge took great pleasure in reminding the jury with your clients fingerprints on it exactly my lord who found this piece of gelignite detective inspector i did at the scene of the crime did you show it to any other officer when i got back to the station when you got back to the station so the jury must rely on your evidence and your evidence alone to satisfy them that this small piece of gelignite was ever at the scene of the crime if my evidence isnt good enough if your evidence isnt good enough detective inspector charlie wheeler is entitled to be acquitted i felt the quietness in court again the jury were listening i leant forward and spoke to the witness as though we were alone in the room have you ever in your long experience known a safe blower to leave his gelignite with his fingerprints on it at the scene of a crime at which of course the judge had to comment to the jury if criminals never made mistakes we would have no trials at the old bailey however i felt they were becoming more interested in the witness than the judge and i went on quickly you see there is another possibility the jury may have to consider is there dickerson smiled politely interested we have no idea when the fingerprints got on the gelignite havent we or where is it just possible detective inspector that charlie wheeler only touched the gelignite in the dartford police station there was another minute pause before he answered i dont know what you mean it was time to tell the jury exactly what i meant and bring charlies defence out into the open in that dark cell at two oclock in the morning do you think you had the gelignite this little piece of gelignite concealed in your palm when you held your hand out to him and shook hands as you had never shaken hands with any prisoner in your life before is that the only explanation of how charlie wheelers fingerprints got on to exhibit i i hadnt expected dickerson to crumble and apologize but i had hoped for a bluster an outraged denial which might have said more than he intended but he was too experienced a witness for that he only smiled tolerantly and said if thats what wheeler told you i mean if then its a load of nonsense you know that mr rumpole is it all lies detective inspector bullingham asked all lies my lord the judge wrote that last answer down in case he forgot it then he gave the jury one of his least lovable grins its always painful to watch an officer of this sort of length of service under attack members of the jury i expect wed all be glad of a break back at ten past two air erskinebrown so ignoring rumpole he bundled himself out of court mr featherstone heard from the doctor sir henry was waiting for me as i came out of court hes to stay in bed for the rest of the week he was asking is it all over tell him its all going according to plan nothing to send his temperature up in the lift on my way up to the robing room i met miss phyllida trant she seemed in a mood of strange elation and told me that everything was going wonderfully everything i took your advice and i didnt plead she was positively glowing the light of battle burning behind her specs now it seems that theres no note of some of the verbals and most of it was after he was charged anyway and good news from somewhere you were right of course when you said always fight everything fight everything what else had we left to do i called the sunday paper again from the robing room philbeam had gone out again and left no message wheeler youre a coward as well as a thief you tied up this helpless sub post mistress and you robbed what makes it all a great deal more grave you deliberately chose through your counsel to attack the honesty and good name of someone of twentyfive years standing in the police force i mean detective inspector dickerson ive had the misfortune to sit here and hear that fine officer subjected to a number of questions we were at the last gasp of the wheeler trial a proceeding marked by the continued absence of any man called harris even so the jury had taken three hours to find charlie guilty by a majority a fact which had clearly displeased the judge i waited for the bull to finish the illphrased lecture and come to announce a figure when to the surprise of everyone in court there was a voice of protest from the dock i never silence the usher shouted but charlie battled on i never wanted my barrister to ask them questions i told him to keep quiet i sat quite still i couldnt blame charlie but i began to feel that we were at the start of something that could prove deeply embarrassing for rumpole ignoring the interruption the judge went on you have the most appalling record and it is clearly time that society was protected from you for a considerably long period the least sentence i can pass is one of twelve years imprisonment take him down charlie was removed from the dock i levered myself to my feet and started to move out of counsels row when bullingham stopped me just one moment i have something to add mr rumpole i stopped rooted to the spot the judge proceeded to sentence once more your attack on the integrity of detective inspector dickerson was not only not backed up by the evidence its now clear it was an adventure of your own without instructions i take a very serious view of it very serious indeed fourteen years i wondered but the judge contented himself with saying ominously i intend to report the matter in the proper quarter if your lordship pleases i gave him my politest bow a muchneeded lesson in courtroom manners and perhaps rumpoles last genuflection in front of the bench what had i to look forward to now except the end of life as i knew it as i took oil the wig and looked in the robing room mirror i seemed to see a new rumpole a man who might just possibly not be a barrister any more featherstone back in the land of the living was pacing his room i thought somewhat nervously while i sat in his big leather armchair and smoked a small cigar reported to the benchers of your inn a disciplinary hearing before the senate my dear horace i dont want to worry you on the contrary youre having a most calming effect i reassured him ive thought about retiring from the bar for a long time perhaps i shall start a small market garden behind gloucester road tube station ive had to write to the senate myself about the case guthrie looked embarrassed to tell them that the attack on dirty dickerson was an escapade dreamt up by your learned junior yes im sure you had to write and tell them that youll confirm that of course dont worry old sweetheart youve got a perfect alibi i stood as if in court my lord i call mrs marigold featherstone she will prove conclusively that my client was flat on his back having his chest rubbed with vick and chewing aspirin at the time of the dark deeds down the bailey rumpole dont you wish he is entirely innocent of the attempted rape of di clean fingers dickerson dont you wish youd been laid up with flu during r v wheeler i looked at him astonished at his lack of understanding you want to know the truth guvnor all right ill come clean youve got me bang to rights rumpole i loved that crossexamination i enjoyed every minute of it and whats more i swear by almighty god i was onto something if id only had a tiny bit of straw to make a brick with i hope youre not going to say that in front of the senate featherstone looked so worried that i comforted him by asking his advice what would you suggest i said as my brief he took me quite seriously and gave my hopeless case his most learned opinion i think he said at last id put it in this way in your enthusiasm understandable enthusiasm for your clients interests you were carried away rumpole in the heat of the moment you made an attack on the honesty of a senior police officer which you now deeply regret what do you think i might get probation the worst aspect of your case in my opinion featherstone was giving the matter judicial consideration now in your learned opinion is that you proceeded entirely without instructions i looked at him with astonishemnt do you think im totally insane i must say i was beginning to wonder of course i had instructions but at the conference in brixton we clearly decided i had another conference whilst you were tucked up with your hotwaterbottle charlie wheeler gave you instructions to put to this officer that he handed him the gelignite yes of course i got instructions of course featherstone asked the question which theyd be bound to ask in the senate you made a note of them at the time a note ive got too old for making notes in or out of court i carry things in my head theres no fool like an old fool of course i should have made a note our solicitor bernard will have a note of the conference or at any rate a recollection featherstone was doing his best bernard was off enjoying himself at some funeral or other he left me to the tender mercies of joyce then joyce will remember well get hold of joyce he saw another ray of light and reached for the phone joyce wasnt there oh she had some sort of fraud on with hoskins in the west court you mean you actually saw the client alone featherstone was reduced to the unalterable fact oh we live dangerously i told him down the old bailey the trouble is more trouble wheeler denied hed given you instructions he told the judge as much wouldnt you have done that in his place old darling as a matter of fact rumpole ive never been on trial for safe blowing i did my best to help featherstones imagination youve just waited three hours for the jury to find you guilty youve been told by learned leading counsel no less in brixton prison that its a few extra years for asking the dirty di certain rude questions wouldnt you deny youd given any instructions im too old to expect honour among safe blowers its a problem featherstone sat at his desk temporarily bankrupt of ideas i felt sorry for him to me it seems perfectly simple ill have to give it a good deal of thought give what a good deal of thought i was on my way to the door it was only then i realized that the old darling had actually briefed himself for my defence exactly what im going to say on your behalf to the senate soy i dont want you to say anything youd only mitigate featherstone wasnt the only one who has been giving thought to the nature of rumpoles defence a few days later hilda rang up chambers and invited my old friend george frobisher to dinner she put on a very passable meal for us and as we sat over our apple pie and cream gave me some words of wisdom apparently learned at her fathers knee daddy always said a man should stand up and admit hes in the wrong he said that was by far the best way hilda what are you talking about i was puzzled by the relevance of the thoughts of daddy he always told his clients an apology costs nothing but it can earn you untold gold in sympathy from the judge hilda finished triumphantly old c h wystan your daddy was hardly one of the nations fighters was he george a man with a good deal of wisdom for all that george and hilda seemed to be in agreement ill go and make some coffee all right quite all right ill leave you two gentlemen to your wine hilda left us and i poured port for george i meant to pluck out the heart of his mystery george i said how long is it since hilda last asked you to dinner with us it must be a good few years now a good few years yes it must be so why do you think my wife felt this sudden longing to have you share our cutlets you know perfectly well hildas worried rumpole and so am i very worried by the stand youre taking stand george what sort of stand is that this wretched man this wheeler how can he be worth risking your career over rumpole your wife cant understand that and i must say i have considerable difficulty he was worth defending everyones worth defending thats what were for isnt it do we have any other function but hilda says that you admitted to her that the man was a professional safe blower george looked at me distinctly puzzled but he had put his finger on the exact point professional of course so he wouldnt have left fingerprints do you honestly believe can you put your hand on your heart rumpole and tell me you really believe that this man wheeler was innocent oh come now george how many of your clients can you swear were innocent so you dont believe he was innocent if you ask my view of the matter and you know my view is strictly irrelevant all the same rumpole id like you to answer my questions i admired him then a new george quiet but firm and not to be put off i told him hed make a crossexaminer yet and poured him another glass of port then i gave him his answer no no i dont believe he was innocent in fact i think charlie wheeler probably blew the safe in the dartford post office so no injustice was done probably not george stood up then he was beaming at me apparently hugely relieved so that is good news rumpole youve seen sense at last hilda came in with the coffee tray and george gave her the glad tidings i believe your husbands seen sense at last i knew youd be able to talk to him hilda smiled as she poured the coffee youve always told me rumpole george is so sensible rumpoles always had a tremendous amount of respect for you george guthrie featherstone agrees it can all be dealt with by way of an apology arid now you admit it was unnecessary to attack the officer george took his coffee and smiled at me i hated to disappoint him unnecessary did you say unnecessary you said yourself wheeler was probably guilty george seemed to think that was an end of the matter guilty or innocent whats it matter what matters is he may have been convicted on faked evidence but rumpole if hed done it anyway hilda was as puzzled as george i did my best to explain it to them both we cant decide guilt or innocence thats not for us you know that george thats for twelve puzzled old darlings pulled off the street for three boring days with a safe blower but we can make sure theyre not lied to not deceived not tricked by some smiling copper who wants to take away their decision from them by a few conjuring tricks in a dark cell oh for gods sake have another glass of port i felt he needed it for he sat looking quite despondent and asked what on earth i thought i was going to do grow vegetables well probably have to go to the country to do it rumpole they wont disbar you george did his best to sound comforting i went over to the old desk in the corner and found a packet of small cigars suspend me disbar me i dont care i shant apologize for what i did for wheeler talk to him george please talk to him hilda sounded desperate george did his best rumpole forget wheeler for a moment youve got yourself to think about i found my cigars and lit one i was still searching for something i had concealed in a drawer of the desk oh i am thinking of myself you see hilda with the insurance policy and what wed get for this flat we could get quite a decent cottage and a smallholding a smallholding oh george has he gone quite mad you wouldnt know what to do with a smallholding rumpole dig it and dung it thats what id do and grow the stuff im rather keen on artichokes and marrows and parsnips and after a few years perhaps asparagus i had found what i wanted a seed catalogue full of fine colour photographs of prize vegetables look hilda do look at this please look at it i took the catalogue over to hilda and held it open at a particularly succulent row of runner beans dont you think it all looks rather splendid she shook her head hilda rumpole is incredibly urban all her life has revolved round law courts and barristers chambers she could only see a row of runners or even a picking of early peas through a haze of tears a man under our system is innocent until hes proved guilty and in the time that elapsed before my case was due to be heard in the senate by the tribunal that decides matters of discipline at the bar i continued business as usual although the briefs didnt exactly fall like summer rain onto the fertile soil of rumpoles chambers however i left home earlier than usual largely to escape the sorrowful and rebuking eye of she who must be obeyed often had breakfast on my own with the times crossword at jocks cafe and lingered late in pommeroys wine bar i was sitting there at a lonely table with my head deep in the evening standard when i heard erskinebrowns voice ringing from the bar vegetables did you say rumpole was going to grow vegetables he actually bought a catalogue a list of seeds with illustrations george sounded like a doctor announcing the symptoms of a fatal disease how old is rumpole do you think he might be going a bit screwy of course not the female voice was quite positive the first thing i learned at the bar was never underestimate the cunning of rumpole it was the clear and dulcet tone of miss trant for a while their voices were drowned in the general clatter of legal anecdotes journalists attempted seductions and cries for claret which make up the full orchestra of the sound of pommeroys and then i heard my old friend george booming sadly obstinate rumpoles incredibly obstinate you know what hes saying now even if they just suspend him for a little while even if they censure him hell leave the bar and he wont apologize then surely one things perfectly clear george it was erskinebrown again whats that rumpole has absolutely no one to blame but himself im going back to chambers come on philly ive just got to pick up a brief and then were off to the festival hall til catch you up i sank my head deeper in the londoners diary and then looked up as miss trants voice came again from about three feet away you going to send us up some nice fresh vegetables as i lowered the paper miss trant sat down and joined me uninvited it was amazing the confidence she had developed since her baptism of fire in dock street peas and carrots new potatoes sounds delicious i have been having doubts i suppose i needed someone to talk to at that moment life with hilda being then on the silent side looking back at my past life hanging round law courts i found absolutely no evidence for the proposition that i have green fingers neither have i what my pot plants all go yellow its only that whenever i visit prisons and see the trusties planting out straight rows of chrysanths in the sooty soil i think yes thats the job ill choose when im in the nick then an extraordinary thing happened miss trant actually seemed to lose her temper with me really youre not going to the nick you told me never to underestimate your cunning like the time when i was prosecuting you and you got me to bore the magistrate with a load of law and you won the case finally tumbled to that did you i smiled remembering the occasion well if you can think of that in the dock street mags court cant you deal with this little case of yours in the senate i shant apologize i told her that quite firmly and another surprise she didnt argue of course you wont why were you thinking of it was i creeping off to the country to grow vegetables its like pleading guilty well stuff that for a lark this slip of a girl had the spirit which was lacking in featherstone or hilda or even george the courage of an advocate miss trant i told her i remember when you first came to the chambers you weie a somewhat straightlaced young woman only interested in law reports ive learned a lot since then from your pupil master erskinebrown no from you what do you say we ought to have written up in chambers in letters a foot high never plead guilty i bricks without bricks miss trant bricks without the bloody shadow of a brick unless wellgoon unless someone could lay their hands on a man called harry harris when she had gone i sat on for a while alone i thought of my hearing before the senate of the inns of court what would that august body do to me change me utterly i might leave their presence as someone quite new perhaps even as myself it seemed to me that i had spent my whole life being other people safe blowers fraudsmen a few rather gentle murderers id had remarkably little time to be rumpole would i have time now and if i had time hanging heavy on my hands forever should i enjoy the experience of being my own genuine unadulterated rumpole at last jack pommeroy broke in on this uncomfortable reverie there was a phone call for me from philbeam he wanted me to stay where i was he was bringing a man round for a drink a man called harry harris a few nights later detective inspector dickerson was sitting in the corner of his favourite chinese restaurant waiting his eye lit up when a tall very thin man with grey hair came in for had this man not arrived the detective inspector was in great danger of having to pay his own bill harris dickerson waved a large hand at the empty chair at his table where you been keeping yourself harry i got word you wanted to see me dickerson you want to buy me a chinese do you the ai combination with the sweet and sour lobster id be glad to harris smiled patiently i thought you would you been a bit late on your instalments harris sorry dickerson ive been travelling at this point harris took a bulky envelope out of his breast pocket and handed it to the detective inspector whose manner became if possible even more affable well leave a forwarding address then well get on much more nicely if i can bleed you regular i think dickerson consulted the wine list a nice bottle of chablisd go well with the sweet and sour when harris had ordered the chablis from the chinese waiter he broached an awkward subject can we forget it now he asked and his voice had for the first time a whining tone forget what harris a couple of fingerprints on a gold case there was a long silence and then dickerson said youre so careless harris where you put your fingers youre as bad as your friend charlie wheeler i heard you fitted charlie up nicely too fitted him up who told you i fitted charlie up the jury convicted him didnt they dickerson sounded cautious but harris was laughing such a nice friendly lad charlie hed shake hands with anyone it was a little while before dickerson joined in the joke but apparently he found it irresistible all right harris he said through chuckles very funny very funny indeed but let it be a lesson to you if you dont bleed regular ill have your fingers round a lump of jelly just the way i did with charlie there was an interruption then when the waiter brought the chablis dickerson turned his attention to the temperature of the bottle if he hadnt done so he might have noticed the tip of a small metallic object hidden in the breast pocket of harriss jacket the reason for that and for my having a verbatim account of this conversation is that it was being taken down for posterity and the subsequent police inquiry on a small but efficient tape recorder which was later delivered to philbeams car parked outside the garden of delights whilst i was explaining matters to the senate the learned friends ot no i equity court were holding a chambers meeting i am grateful to george frobisher for supplying me with a note of what was said during my enforced absence the first item on the agenda was the question of accommodation in chambers and was raised by erskinebrown it seems likely he began that we will soon be having a vacancy in chambers what do you mean exactly miss trant asked the question well philly after todays hearing rumpoles made it quite clear he intends to leave the bar and grow vegetables vegetables i hadnt heard about the vegetables featherstone was understandably puzzled shouldnt we perhaps wait george suggested but erskinebrown was not to be stopped i think its important he said that we should decide what the policy is as you know my own room is impossibly overcrowded george frobisher is sharing with hoskins which isnt always convenient when it comes to conferences i mean do we take in another young man who could make himself useful and do a bit of paper work and so on the door was behind him and he didnt stop immediately when i opened it or do we use rumpoles room to relieve our acute accommodation problem do you want to take over my room erskinebrown i was back from my hearing from erskinebrowns point of view like bloody banquo at the dinner party he stopped in full flow and george said rumpole it cant be over ah horace featherstone pulled up a chair for the ghost of rumpole you can help us weve just been discussing the possible future so have i old darling and ill tell you what the possible future is rather interesting i lit a small cigar remember detective inspector dickerson hes suspended a full inquiry when he heard that in the nick charlie suddenly remembered giving me instructions so were applying to the court of appeal with fresh evidence i was rather thinking of doing it alone without a leader im sorry erskinebrown the vegetables have been postponed indefinitely i left them then the learned and astonished friends to sort out their accommodation problems knowing that rumpoles room would not be available in the foreseeable future when i got home to the mansions i found hilda sitting inert by one bar of a sullen electric fire she looked up as i came into the living room and said rumpole is it over im afraid so oh rumpole its over i know my dear no peace no quiet no just being rumpole above all no vegetables im doing rather a larky manslaughter tomorrow at chelmsford they let you off i couldnt imagine why she sounded so surprised i filled in the details acquitted by unanimous verdict left the dock without a stain on my character in fact i was commended for picking out one of the few rotten apples in that sweetsmelling barrowload the metropolitan police oh rumpole it was an astonishing moment she who must be obeyed actually had her arms round me she was holding me tightly rather as though i were some rare and precious object and not the old white elephant that continually got in her way hilda hilda youre not i looked down at her agitated head you werent worried were you worried well of course i was worried i she broke away and resumed the royal manner having you at home all day would have been impossible yes yes i suppose it would now we can go on just as before just as before i suppose it calls for a celebration i went to the drinks table and poured two booths taking care not to ruin them with too much tonic well just a tiny one ive got dinner to get and im sorry to have to tell you this hilda you know your old daddy old ch wystan was quite wrong i handed her a steadying g and t wrong why was daddy wrong never plead guilty come on old thing bottoms up i raised my glass hilda raised hers and we drank to a future which was going to be thanks to the wonders of tape recording and the fallibility of human nature as indistinguishable as possible from our past rumpole and the heavy brigade the story of my most recent murder and my defence of petey delgardo the youngest and perhaps the most appalling of the disagreeable delgardo brothers raises several matters which are painful not to say embarrassing for me to recall the tale begins with rumpoles reputation at its lowest and although it has now risen somewhat it has done so for rather curious and not entirely creditable reasons as you shall hear after the case of the dartford post office robbery which i have recounted in the previous chapter i noticed a distinct slump in the rumpole practice i had emerged as i thought triumphant from that encounter with the disciplinary authority but i suppose i was marked for a while as a barrister who had been reported for professional misconduct the quality of briefs which landed on the rumpole corner of the mantelpiece in our clerks room were deteriorating and i spent a great deal more time pottering round magistrates courts or down at sessions than i did in full flood round the marble halls of the old bailey so last winter picture rumpole in the november of his days walking in the mists under the black branches of bare trees to chambers and remembering thomas hood no warmth no cheerfulness no healthful ease no comfortable feel in any member no shade no shine no butterflies no bees no fruits no flowers no leaves no birds november as i walked i hoped there might be some sort of trivial little brief waiting for me in chambers in november an old mans fancy lightly turned to thoughts of indecent assault which might bring briefs at london sessions and before the uxbridge justices i had started forty years ago defending a charge of unsolicited grope on the northern line and thats what i was back to in my end is my beginning i pushed open the door of my chambers and went into the clerks room there was a buzz of activity very little of it i was afraid centring round the works of rumpole but henry was actually smiling as he sat in his shirtsleeves at his desk and called out mr rumpole stern daughter of the voice of god oh duty oh my learned clerk what are the orders for today henry mine not to reason why mine but to do or die before some court of summary jurisdiction theres a con waiting for you sir in a new matter from maurice nooks and parsley henry had mentioned one of the busiest firms of criminal solicitors who had a reputation of being not too distant from some of their heavily villainous clients in fact the most active partner was privately known to me as shady nooks new matter the stepney road stabbing mr nooks says youll have read about it in the papers in fact i had read about it in that great source of legal knowledge the news of the world the delgardo brothers leslie and basil were a legend in the east end they gave copiously to charity they had friends in show business and went on holiday with a certain police superintendent and a wellknown member of parliament they hadnt been convicted of any ortence although their young brother peter delgardo had occasionally been in trouble they ran a club known as the paradise rooms a number of protection rackets and a seaside home for orphans they were a devoted family and leslie and basil were said to be particularly concerned when their brother peter was seen by several witnesses kneeling in the street outside a pub called the old justice beside the bloodstained body of an east end character known as tosher macbride later a knife liberally smeared with blood of macbrides group was found beside the drivers seat of peter delgardos elderly daimler he was arrested in the paradise rooms to which he had apparently fled for protection after the death of tosher the case seemed hopeless but the name delgardo made sure it would hit the headlines i greeted the news that it was corning rumpoles way with a low whistle of delight i took the brief from henry my heart leaps up when i behold a rainbow in the sky or a murder in the offing i have to admit it i suddenly thought of the fly in the ointment i suppose theyre giving me a leader in a murder they havent mentioned a leader henry seemed puzzled i suppose itll be featherstone well at least itll get me back to the bailey my proper stamping ground i moved towards the door and it was then my clerk henry mentioned a topic which as you will see has a vital part to play in this particular narrative my hat now i am not particularly selfconscious as far as headgear is concerned and the old black anthony eden has seen it must be admitted a good many years service it has travelled to many farflung courts in fair weather and foul it once had a small glowing cigar end dropped in it as it lay under rumpoles seat in pommeroys it once blew off on a windy day in newington causeway and was run over by a bicycle the hat is therefore it must be admitted like its owner scarred and battered by life no longer in its first youth and in a somewhat collapsed condition all the same it fits me comfortably and keeps the rain out most of the time i have grown used to my hat and in view of our long association i have a certain affection for it i was therefore astonished when henry followed me to the door and in a lowered tone as if he were warning me that the coppers had called to arrest me he said the other clerks were discussing your hat sir over coffee my god they must be hard up for conversation to fill in a couple of hours round the abc and they were passing the comment its a subject of a good many jokes in the temple well its seen some service i took off the offending article and looked at it and it shows it quite frankly mr rumpole i cant send you down the bailey not on a topclass murder in a hat like it you mean the jury might get a peep at the titfer and convict without leaving the box i couldnt believe my ears mr featherstone wears a nice bowler mr rumpole i am not leading counsel henry i told him firmly i am not the conservativelabour mp for somewhere or other and i dont like nice bowlers our old clerk albert managed to live with thfs hat for a good many years theres been some changes made since alberts time mr rumpole henry had laid himself open and im afraid i made the unworthy comment oh yes i got some decent briefs in alberts time the penge bungalow murder the brighton forgery i wasnt put out to grass in the uxbridge magistrates court the chairs in my room in chambers have become a little wobbly over the years and my first thought was that the two large men sitting on them might be in some danger of collapse they both wore blue suits made of some lightweight material and both had gold wrist watches and identity bracelets dangling at their wrists they had diamond rings pink faces and brushed back black hair leslie delgardo was the eldest and the most affable his brother basil had an almost permanent look of discontent and his voice easily became querulous in attendance balanced on my insecure furniture were shady nooks a silver haired and suntanned person who also sported a large gold wristwatch and his articled clerk miss stebbings a nicelooking girl fresh from law school who had clearly no idea what area of the law she had got into i lit a small cigar looked round the assembled company and said our client is not with us of course hardly mr rumpole said nooks mr peter delgardo has been moved to the prison hospital hes never been a well boy our petey leslie delgardo sounded sorrowful our clients health has always been an anxiety to his brothers nooks explained i see i hastily consulted the brief the victim of the murder was a gentleman called tosher macbride know anything about him i believe he was a rent collector nooks sounded vague not a bad start the jury be against murder but if someone has to go it may as well be the rent collector i flipped through the depositions until i got to the place where i felt most at home the forensic report on the blood bloodstains on your brothers sleeve group consistent with ten percent of the population said nooks including tosher macbride and exhibit i a sheath knife mr macbrides blood on that or of course ten percent of the population knife found in your brothers ancient daimler fallen down by the drivers seat bloodstains on his coat sleeve bloodstained sheath knife in his car i know it looks black for young peter leslie shook his head sadly i looked up at him sharply lets say its evidence mr delgardo on which the prosecution might expect to get a conviction unless the judge has just joined the fulham road anarchists or the jurys drunk youll pull it off for petey it was the first time basil delgardo had spoken and his words showed i thought a touching faith in rumpole pull it off i shall sit behind my learned leader i presume youre going to guthrie featherstone qc in these chambers then nooks uttered words which were i must confess music to my ears well actually mr rumpole on this one no mr rumpole my brothers and i weve heard of your wonderful reputation said basil i did the penge bungalow murder without a leader i admitted but that was thirty years ago they let me loose on that weve heard golden opinions of you mr rumpole golden opinions leslie delgardo made an expansive gesture rattling his identity bracelet i got up and looked out of the window no one mentioned the hat pardon me leslie sounded puzzled and nooks added his voice to the vote of confidence mr delgardos brothers are peifectly satisfied mr rumpole to leave this one entirely to you now is the winter of my discontent made glorious summer by a firstclass murder i turned back to the group apologetic im sorry gentlemen insensitive im afraid all these months round the uxbridge magistrates court have blunted my sensitivity to your brother it can hardly seem such a sign of summer were perfectly confident mr rumpole you can handle it basil lit a cigarette with a gold lighter and i went back to the desk handle it of course i can handle it as i always say murder is nothing more than common assault with unfortunate consequences well arrange it for you to see the doctor nooks was businesslike im perfectly well thank you doctor lewis bleen said leslie and nooks explained patiently the wellknown psychiatrist on the subject of mr peter delgardos mental capacity poor petey hes never been right mr rumpole weve always had to look after him leslie explained his responsibilities as head of the family you could call him peter pan basil made an unexpected literary reference the little boy that never grew up i doubted the accuracy of this analogy i dont know whether peter pan was actually responsible for many stabbings down stepney high street but thats it mr rumpole leslie shook his head sadly peters not responsible you see not poor old petey no more responsible than a child doctor lewis bleen diploma of psychological medicine from the university of edinburgh headshrinker extraordinaire resident guru of whats bugging you answers to listeners problems had one of those accents which remind you of the tinkle of cups and the thud of dropped scones in edinburgh tearooms he sat and sucked his pipe in the interview room at brixton and looked in a motherly fashion at the youngest of the delgardos who was slumped in front of us staring moodily at nothing in particular remember me do you doctor b bleen petey had his brothers features but the sharpness of their eyes was blurred in his his big hands were folded in his lap and he wore a perpetual puzzled frown he also spoke with a stammer his answer hadnt pleased the good doctor who tried again do you know the time petey n n no disorientated as to time better pleased the doctor made a note that might just be because hes not wearing a watch i was unkind enough to suggest the doctor ignored me where are you peter inthen n nick i suggested hospital wing peter confirmed my suggestion orientated as to place was my diagnosis doctor bleen gave me a sour look as though id just spat out the shortcake possibly he turned back to our patient when we last met peter you told me you couldnt remember how macbride got stabbed nno there appears to be a complete blotting out of all the facts the doctor announced with quiet satisfaction mightnt it be worth asking him whether he was there when tosher got stabbed i was bold enough to ask at which nooks chipped in mr rumpole as a solictor of some little experience may i interject here if you have to i sighed and fished for a small cigar doctor bleen will correct me if im wrong but as i understand hes prepared to give evidence that at the relevant moment so far i have no idea when the relevant moment was i lit the cigar nooks carried on regardless mr delgardos mind was so affected that he didnt know the nature and quality of his act nor did he know that what he was doing was wrong you mean he thought he was giving tosher a warm handshake and welcome to the rent collectors union thats not exactly how i suggest we put it to the learned judge nooks smiled at me as though at a wayward child then how do you suggest we tell it to the old sweetheart guilty but insane mr rumpole we rather anticipated your advice would be that guilty but insane in law and have you anticipated what the prosecution might say peter has been examined by a doctor stotter from the home office i dont think youll find him unhelpful said doctor bleen charles stotter and i play golf together weve had a word about this case rum things you get up to playing golf it always struck me as a good game to avoid i turned and drew peter delgardo into the conversation well peter youll want to be getting back to the telly peter stood up i was surprised by his height and his apparent strength a big pale man in an old dressing gown and pyjamas just one question before you go did you stab tosher macbride the doctor smiled at me tolerantly oh i dont think the answer to that will be particularly reliable even the question may strike you as unreliable doctor all the same im asking it i moved closer to peter because if you did peter we can call the good shrink here and doctor stotter fresh from the golf course and theyll let you off lightly youll go to broadmoor at her majestys pleasure and of course her majesty will be thinking of you constantly youll get a lot more telly and some exciting basketweaving and a handful of pills every night to keep you quiet petey and if youre very good they might let you weed the doctors garden or play cricket against the second eleven of male warders but i cant offer you these delights until i know did you stab tosher i think my patients tired i turned on the trick cyclist at last and said hes not your patient at the moment hes my client doctor bleen has joined us at great personal inconvenience nooks was distressed then i wouldnt dream of detaining him a moment longer at which point doctor lewis bleen dpm left in what might mildly be described as a huff when hed been seen off the premises by a helpful trusty i repeated my question did you do it peter i c c c the answer whatever it was was a long time in coming nooks supplied a word killed him but peter shook his head couldnt of he was already c cut when i saw him like you see i cant let you get sent to hospital unless you did it i explained as though to a child if you didnt well just have to fight the case i wants you to f f fight it im not going into any nut house peter delgardos instructions were perfectly clear and if we fight we might very well lose you understand that my b b brothers have told me youre hot stuff they told me tip top awyer once again i was puzzled by the height of my reputation with the delgardos but i wasnt going to argue tip top really well lets say ive got to know a trick or two over the years a few wrinkles sit down peter peter sat down slowly and i sat opposite him ignoring the restive nooks and his articled clerk now hadnt you better tell me exactly what happened the night tosher macbride got stabbed i was working overtime a few days later when my door opened and in walked no less a person than guthrie featherstone qc mp our head of chambers my relations with featherstone ever since he pipped me at the post for the position of head have always been somewhat uneasy and were not exactly improved when i seized command of the ship when he was leading me in the matter of the dartford post office robbery we have little enough in common featherstone as henry pointed out wears a nice bowler and a black velvet collar on his overcoat his nails are well manicured his voice is carefully controlled as are his politics he gets on very well with judges and solicitors and not so well with the criminal clientele he has never been less than polite to me even at my most mutinous moments and now he smiled with considerable bonhomie rumpole youre a late bird just trying to feather my nest with a rather juicy little murder featherstone dropped into my tattered leather armchair reserved for clients and carefully examined his wellpolished black brogues maurice nooks told me hes not taking in a leader thats right i know the last time i led you wasnt succesfou im a bit of a back seat driver im afraid of course youre an old hand at crime featherstone conceded an old lag you might say but its a question of tactics in this case maurice said if i appeared it might look as if theyd rather overegged the pudding you think the jury might prefer a bit of good plain cooking i looked at him and he smiled delightfully you put things rather well sometimes there was a pause and then the learned leader got down to what was i suppose the nub and the purpose of his visit horace im anxious to put an end to any sort of rift between the two senior men in chambers it doesnt make for a happy ship aye aye sir i gave him a brief nautical salute from my position at the desk im glad you agree serieusement horace we dont see enough of each other socially he paused again but i could find nothing to say ive got a couple of tickets for the scales of justice ball at the savoy would you join me and marigold to say i was taken aback would be an understatement i was astonished lets get this quite clear featherstone oh guthrie please very well guthrie youre asking me to trip the light fantastic toe with your wife and if youd like to bring your good lady i looked at featherstone in total amazement my your missus are you referring at all to my wife she who must be obeyed do i take it you actually want to spend an evening out with she itll be great fun do you really think so he had lost me now i went to the door and unhooked the mac and the old hat preparatory to calling it a day however featherstone had some urgent matter to communicate apparently of an embarrassing nature oh and horace this is rather embarrassing its just that its well your name came up on the bench at our inn only last week i was lunching with mr justice prestcold that must have been a jolly occasion i told him like dinner with the macbeths i knew mr justice prestcold of old and he and i had never hit it off or seen eye to eye in fact you might say there was always a cold wind blowing in court between counsel and the bench whenever rumpole rose to his feet before prestcold j he could be guaranteed to ruin my crossexamination interrupt my speech fail to sum up the defence and send any rumpole client down for a hefty six if he could find the slightest excuse for it prestcold was an extraordinarily clean man his cuffs and bands were whiter than white he was forever polishing his rimless glasses on a succession of snowy handkerchiefs they say and god knows what truth there is in it that prestcold travels on circuit with a portable loo seat wrapped in plastic his clerk has the unenviable job of seeing that it is screwed in at the lodgings so his lordship may not sit where less fastidious judges have sat before he was asking who we had in chambers and i was able to tell him horace rumpole inter alia i cant imagine frank prestcold eating i suppose he might just be brought to sniff the bouquet of a grated carrot and he said you mean the fellow with the disgraceful hat mr justice prestcold was talking about my hat i couldnt believe my ears he seemed to think forgive me for raising this that your hat set the worst possible example to younger men at the bar with enormous selfcontrol i kept my temper well you can tell mr justice prestcold the next time youre sharing the benchers vegetarian platter that when i was last before him i took strong exception to his cufflinks they looked to me just as cheap and glassy as his eyes dont take offence horace its just not worth it you know taking offence at her majestys judges well look forward to the savoy best to your good lady i crammed on the hat gave him a farewell wave and left him i felt that evening that i was falling out of love with the law i really couldnt believe that mr justice prestcold had been discussing my hat i mean wasnt the crime rate rising wasnt the state encroaching on our liberties wasnt magna carta tottering whither habeus corpus what was to be done about the number of yearold girls who are making advances to old men in cinemas what i thought was hadnt judges of england got enough on their plates without worrying about my hat i gave the matter mature consideration on my way home on the inner circle and decided that they probably hadnt a few mornings later i picked up the collection of demands final demands and positively final demands which constitutes our post and among the hostile brown envelopes i found a gilded and embossed invitation card i took the whole lot into the kitchen to file away in the tidy bin when she who must be obeyed entered and caught me at it horace she said severely whatever are you doing with the post just throwing it away always throw bills away the first time they come in otherwise you only encourage them if you had a few decent cases rumpole if you werent always slumming round the magistrates courts you might not be throwing away bills all the time at which she pedalled open the tidy bin and spotted the fatal invitation whats that i think its the gas it was too late she had picked the card out from among the potato peelings i never saw a gas bill with a gold embossed crest before its an invitation to the savoy hotel she started to read the thing horace rumpole and lady you wouldnt enjoy it i hastened to assure her why wouldnt i enjoy it she wiped the odd fragment of potato off the card carried it into the livingroom in state and gave it pride of place on the mantelpiece i followed her protesting you know what it is boiled shirts prawn cocktail watching a lot of judges pushing their wives round the parquet to selections from oklahoma itll do you good rumpole thats the sort of place you ought to be seen in the scales of justice ball its quite impossible the situation was becoming desperate i dont see why i had an inspiration and assumed an expression of disgust were invited by marigold featherstone the wife of your head of chambers an old boot a domestic tyrant you know what the wretched guthrie caus her she who must be obeyed no the ball is out hilda you and marigold wouldnt hit it off at all well i thought she and sweet marigold would never meet so i was risking nothing i seized the hat and prepared to retreat got to leave you now murder calls why didnt you tell me we were back to murder this is good news hilda was remarkably cheerful that morning murder i told her is certainly better than dancing and i was gone about my business little did i know that the moment my back was turned hilda looked up the featherstones number in the telephone book you cant do it to peter i tell you you cant do it fight the case how can he fight the case leslie delgardo had quite lost the cool and knowing air of a successful east end businessman his face was flushed and he thumped his fist on my table jangling his identity bracelet and disturbing the notice of additional evidence i was reading that of bernard whelpton known as four eyes whelptons evidence doesnt help im sure youll agree mr rumpole nooks said gloomily you read that you read what four eyes has to say leslie collapsed breathless into my clients chair i read the document which ran roughly as follows tosher macbride used to take the mick out of peter on account he stammered and didnt have no girl friends one night i saw peter try to speak to a girl in the paradise rooms he was asking the girl to have a drink but his stutter was so terrible tosher said to her come on darling itll be breakfast time before the silly git finishes asking for a light ale after i heard peter delgardo say as hed get tosher he said hed like to cut him one night hes not a well boy leslie was wiping his forehead with a mauve silk handkerchief when i came out of the old justice pub that night i see tosher on the pavement and petey delgardo was kneeling beside him there was blood all over i looked up at nooks you know its odd no one actually saw the stabbing but petey was there wasnt he leslie was returning the handkerchief to his breast pocket and whats the answer about the knife in my humble opinion nooks opinions were often humble the knife in the car is completely damning oh completely i got up lit a small cigar and told leslie my own far from humble opinion you know id have had no doubts about this case if you hadnt just proved your brother innocent i did the big man in the chair looked at me in a wild surmise when you sent doctor lewis bleen the worldfamous trick cyclist the head shrinker extraordinaire down to see petey in brixton if youd done a stabbing and you were offered a nice quiet trip to hospital wouldnt you take it if the evidence was dead against you you mean peter turned it down leslie delgardo clearly couldnt believe his ears of course he did i told him cheerfully petey may not be all that bright poor old darling but he knows he didnt kill tosher macbride the committal was at stepney magistrates court and henry told me that there was a good deal of interest and that the vultures of the press might be there i thought i should warn you sir just in case you wanted to buy i know i know i interrupted him perhaps henry theres a certain amount of force in your argument vanity of vanities all is vanity said the preacher here was i a barrister of a certain standing doing a notable murder alone and without a leader the type of person whose picture might appear in the evening standard and i came to the reluctant conclusion that my present headgear was regrettably unphotogenic i took a taxi to st james street and invested in a bowler which clamped itself to the head like a vice but which caused henry when he saw it to give me a smile of genuine gratitude that evening i had forgotten the whole subject of hats and was concerned with a matter that interests me far more deeply blood i had soaked the rubber sponge that helps with the washing up and standing at the kitchen sink stabbed violently down into it with a table knife it produced as i had suspected a spray of water leaving small spots all over my shirt and waistcoat horace horace you look quite different hilda was looking at the evening paper in which there was a picture of pete delgardos heroic defender arriving at court i know what it is horace you went out and bought a new hat without me i stabbed again having resoaked the sponge a bowler daddy used to wear a bowler its an improvement hilda was positively purring at my dapper appearance in the paper little splashes all over the place i observed committing further mayhem on the sponge horace whatever are you doing to the washing up all over in little drops not one great stain little drops like a fine rain and plenty on the cuff your cuffs soaking oh why couldnt you roll up your sleeve i felt the crook of my arm and was delighted to discover that it was completely dry now i know why you didnt want to take me to the scales of justice annual ball hilda looked at the evening standard with less pleasure youre too grand now arent you rumpole new hat picture in the paper big case horace rumpole defender of the stepney road stabber big noise at the bar i suppose you didnt think id do you credit thats nonsense hilda i mopped up some of the mess round the sink and dried my hands then why i went and sat beside her and tried to comfort her with keats look were in the autumn of our years season of mists and mellow fruitfulness close bosomfriend of the maturing sun i really cant understand why i where are the songs of spring ay where are they think not on them thou hast thy music too but not jigging about like a couple of punk rockers at a dance i very much doubt if they have punk rockers at the savoy doesnt it occur to you rumpole we never go out im perfectly happy im not longing to go to the ball like bloody cinderella well lam i thought hilda was being most unreasonable and i decided to point out the fatal flaw in the entire scheme concerning the scales of justice ball hilda i cant dance you cant what dance i cant do it youre lying rumpole the accusation was so unexpected that i looked at her in a wild surmise and then she said would you mind casting your mind back to the ith of august what happened then you proposed to me rumpole as a matter of fact it was when you proposed i shouldnt expect you to remember of course the year i did the euston bank robbery led by your father led by daddy you were young rumpole comparatively young and where did you propose exactly cant you try and remember that as i have said i have no actual memory of proposing to hilda at all it seemed to me that i slid into the lifetime contract unconsciously as a weary man drifts off into sleep any words i felt sure were spoken by her i also had temporarily forgotten where the incident took place and hazarded a guess at a bus stop of course it wasnt at a bus stop its just that your father always seemed to be detaining me at bus stops i thought you might have been with him at the time you proposed to me in a tent hilda came to my aid at last there was a band and champagne and some sort of cold collation daddy had taken me to the inns of court ball to meet some of the bright young men in chambers he told me then youd been very helpful to him on blood groups it was the year before i did the penge bungalow murder i remembered vaguely hopeless on blood your father he could never bring himself to look at the photographs and we danced together we actually waltzed together thats simple thats just a matter of circling round and round none of your bloody jigging about concerned with it it was then that hilda stood up and took my breath away well we can waltz again rumpole youd better get into training for it i rang up marigold featherstone and i told her wed be delighted to accept the invitation she gave me a little smile of victory and i tell you what she didnt sound like an old boot at all i was speechless filled with mute resentment id been doublecrossed my toilette for the delgardo murder case went no further than the acquisition of a new hat as i sat in court listening to the evidence for the prosecution of bernard four eyes whelpton i was vaguely conscious of the collapsed state of the wig the traces of small cigar and breakfast egg on the waistcoat and the fact that the bands had lost their pristine crispness and were forever sagging to reveal the glitter of the brass collarstud i looked up and saw the judge staring at me with bleak disanoroval and felt desperately to ensure that the fly buttons were safely fastened fate span her bloody wheel and i had drawn mr justice prestcold frank prestcold who took such grave exception to my hat and who now looked without any apparent enthusiasm at the rest of my appearance well i couldnt help him i couldnt even hold up the bowler to prove id tried i did my best to ignore the judge and concentrate on the evidence mr hilary painswick qc the perfectly decent old darling who led for the prosecution was just concreting in four eyes story mr whelpton i take it you havent given this evidence in any spirit of enmity against the man in the dock the man in the dock looked as usual as if hed just been struck between the eyes with a heavy weight bernie whelpton smiled charmingly and said indiscreetly no im peteys friend we was at university together at which rumpole rose up like thunder and to prestcold js intense displeasure asked for the jury to be removed so that he could lodge an objection when the jury had gone out the judge forced himself to look at me what is the basis of your objection mr rumpole on the face of it the evidence that this gentleman was at university with your client seems fairly harmless this may come as a surprise to your lordship may it mr rumpole my client is not an old kings man he didnt meet mr four eyes whelpton at a may ball during eights week the university referred to is in fact parkhurst prison the judge applied his razorsharp mind and saw a way of overruling my objection mr rumpole i very much doubt whether the average juryman has your intimate knowledge of the argot of the underworld your lordship is too complimentary i gave him a bow and a brassy flash of the collarstud i think no harm has been done i appreciate your anxiety to keep your clients past record out of the case shall we have the jury back before the jury came back i got a note from leslie delgardo telline me as i knew verv well that wheloton had a conviction for perjury i ignored this information and did my best to make a friend of the little cockney who gazed at me through spectacles thick as ginger beer bottles mr whelpton when you saw my client peter delgardo kneeling beside tosher macbride did he have his arm round mr macbrides neck yes sir supporting his head from behind i suppose so rather in the attitude of a nurse or a doctor who was trying to bring help to the wounded man i didnt know your client had any medical qualifications mr justice prestcold was trying one of his glacial jokes i pretended i hadnt heard it and concentrated on bernie whelpton were you able to see peter delgardos hands when he was holding tosher yes anything in them was there not as i saw he wasnt holding this knife for instance i had the murder weapon on the desk in front of me and held it up for the jury to see i tell you i didnt see no knife i dont know whether my learned friend remembers hilary painswick uncoiled himself beside me the knife was found in the car exactly i smiled gratefully at painswick so my client stabbed tosher ran to his car dropped the murder weapon in by the drivers seat and then came back across the pavement to hold tosher in his arms and comfort his dying moments i turned back to the witness is that what youre saying he might have slipped the knife in his pocket mr rumpole prestcold j had something to communicate yes my lord this is not the time for arguing your case this is the time for asking questions if you think this point has any substance you will no doubt remind the jury of it when you come to make up your final address at some time in the no doubt distant future im grateful and no doubt your lordship will also remind the jury of it in your summing up should it slip my memory it really is such an unanswerable point for the defence i saw the prestcold mouth open for another piece of snappy repartee and forstalled him by rapidly restarting the crossexamination air whelpton you didnt see tosher stabbed i was in the old justice wasnt i you tell us and when you came out tosher might it not be more respectful to call that good man the deceased mr macbride the judge interrupted wearily if you like that good man mr macbride was bleeding in my clients arms that was the first i saw of him yes and when he saw you mr delgardo let go of tosher of that good man mr macbride ran to his car and got into it and then he drove away exactly you saw him get into his car how did he do it just turned the handle and pulled the door open so the car was unlocked i suppose it was i didnt really think you suppose the door was unlocked i looked at the judge who appeared to have gone into some sort of a trance dont go too fast mr whelpton my lord wants an opportunity to make a note at which the judge returned to earth and was forced to take up his pencil as he wrote leslie delgardo leaned forward from the seat behind me and said here mr rumpole what do you think youre doing having a bit of fun you dont grudge it to me do you the next item on the agenda was the officer in charge of the case a perfectly reasonable fellow with a grey suit who looked like the better type of bank manager detective inspector you photographed mr delgardos antique daimler when you got it back to the station yes the officer leafed through a bundle of photographs was it then exactly as you found it outside the old justice exactly unlocked with the drivers window open yes we found the car unlocked then it would have been easy for anyone to have thrown something in through the drivers window or even put something in through the door i dont follow you sir something i found my prop and held it up exhibit i a flick knife something like this knife could have been dropped into peter delgardos car in a matter of moments i saw the judge actually writing i suppose it could sir by the true murderer whoever it was when he was running away the usher was beside me handing me the fruit of mr justice prestcolds labours a note to counsel which read dear rumpole your bands are falling down and showing your collarstud no doubt you would wish to adjust accordingly what was this a murder trial or a bloody fashion parade i crumpled the note gave the bands a quick shove in a northerly direction and went back to work detective inspector weve heard tosher macbride described as a rent collector is there to be an attack on the dead mans character mr rumpole i dont know my lord i suppose there are charming rent collectors just as there are absolute darlings from the income tax laughter in court from which the judge remained aloof where did he collect rents business premises the officer was noncommittal what sort of business premises cafes my lord pubs minicab offices and if the rent wasnt paid do you know what remedies were taken i assume proceedings were taken in the county court the judge sounded totally bored by this line of crossexamination alas my lord some people have no legal training if the rents werent paid sometimes those minicab offices caught on fire didnt they detective inspector sometimes they did i told you he was a very fair officer to put it bluntly that good man tosher macbride was a collector for a protection racket well officer was he said prestcold more in sorrow than in anger yes my lord i think he was for the first time i felt i was forcing the judge to look in a different direction and see the case from a new angle i rubbed in the point and if hed been sticking to the money hed collected that might have provided a strong motive for murder by someone other than my client stronger than a few unkind words about an impediment in his speech mr rumpole isnt that a question for the jury i looked at the jury then they were all alive and even listening and i congratulated the old darling on the bench youre right it is my lord and far no one else in this court i thought it was effective perhaps too effective for leslie delgardo who stood up and left court with a clatter the swing doors banged to after him by precipitously leaving court leslie delgardo had missed the best turn on the bill my double act with mr entwhistle the forensic expert an old friend and a foeman worthy of my steel mr entwhistle as a scientific officer i think youve lived with bloodstains as long as i have almost the jury smiled they were warming to rumpole and you have all the clothes my client was wearing that night have you examined the pockets i have my lord entwhistle bowed to the judge over a heap of peteys clothing and there are no bloodstains in any of the pockets there are none so there can be no question of a bloodstained knife having been hidden in a pocket whilst my client cradled the deceased in his arms of course not entwhistle smiled discreetly you find that a funny suggestion yes i do the ideas ridiculous you may be interested to know that its on that ridiculous idea the prosecution are basing their case painswick was on his feet with a welljustified moan my lord yes that was a quite improper observation mr rumpole then i pass from it rapidly my lord no point in wasting time with him my business was with entwhistle had mr delgardo stabbed the deceased you would expect a spray of blood over a wide area of clothing you might have found that with small drops spattered from a forceful blow i should have expected so but you found nothing like it no and you might have expected blood near the area of the cuff of the coat or the shirt most probably in fact all we have is a smear or soaked patch in the crook of the arm mr entwhistle picked up the overcoat looked and of course admitted it yes totally consistent with my client having merely put an arm round the deceased when he lay bleeding on the pavement not inconsistent a double negative the last refuge of an expert witness who doesnt want to commit himself does not inconsistent translated into plain english mean consistent mr entwhistle i could have kissed old entwhistle on the rimless specs when he turned to the jury and said yes it does so when i got outside and saw leslie delgardo sitting on a bench chewing the end of a cigar i thought he would wish to congratulate me i didnt think of a gold watch or a crinkly fiver but at least a few warm words of encouragement so i was surprised when he said in a tone of deep hostility whatre you playing at air rumpole why didnt you use bernies conviction you really want to know other members of the family were thronging about us basil and a matronly person in a mink coat dabbing her eye makeup with a minute lace hanky we all want to know said basil all the family i know im only the boys mother sobbed the lady in mink dont underestimate yourself madam i reassured her youve bred three sons who have given employment to the legal profession then i started to explain point one i spent all this trial trying to keep your brothers record out if i put in the convictions of a prosecution witness the juryll get to know about peters stretch for unlawful wounding back in you want that we thought it was helpful basil grumbled did you i looked at him im sure you did well point two the perjury was forging a passport application ive already checked it and point three point three mr rumpole youre sacked leslies voice was high with anger i felt grateful we werent in a turning off stepney high street on a dark night may i ask why you got that judges back up proper hell do for petey good afternoon mr rumpole im taking you off the case i dont think you can do that hed started to walk away but now turned back with a look of extreme hostility oh dont you the only person who can take me off this case is my client mr peter delgardo come along nooks wed better go down to the cells your brother wants to sack me petey looked at me with his usual lack of understanding nooks acted as a smooth interpreter the position is mr leslie delgardo is a little perturbed at the course this case is taking mr leslie delgardo isnt my client i reminded peter he thinks weve got on the wrong side of the judge i was growing impatient would he like to point out to me strictly for my information the right side of mr justice prestcold what does that judge imagine he is court correspondent for the tailor and cutter i stamped out my small cigar look peter dear old sweetheart ive abandoned the judge hell sum up dead against you thats obvious so let the jury think hes nothing but a personal antipollution programme who shoves airwick up his nostrils every time he so much as smells a human being and we might have got somewhere mr leslie delgardo is definitely dissatisfied this puts me in a very embarrassing position nooks looked suitably embarrassed cheer up nooks i smiled at him your positions nothing like so embarrassing as peters then i concentrated on my client well whats it going to be do i go or stay peter began to stammer an answer it took a long time to come but when it did it meant that just one week later on the day of the scales of justice ball i was making a final speech to the jury in the case of the queen against delgardo i may say that i never saw leslie or basil or their dear old mum again members of the jury may i call your attention to a man we havent seen he isnt in the dock he has never gone into that witness box i dont know where he is now perhaps hes tasting the delights of the costa brava perhaps hes very near this court waiting for news ill call him mi x did mr x employ that good man tosher macbride to collect money in one of his protection rackets had tosher macbride betrayed his trust and was he to die for it so that rainy night outside the old justice pub in stepney mr x waited for tosher waited with this knife and when he saw his unfaithful servant come out of the shadows he stabbed not once not twice but you have heard the evidence three times in the neck the jury was listening enrapt to my final speech i was stabbing violently downwards with my prop whenprestcold cleared his throat and pointed to his own collar meaningfully no doubt my stud was winking at him malevolently so he said hm mr rumpole i ignored this no judge alive was going to spoil the climax of my speech and i could tell that the jury were flattered not to say delighted to hear me tell them of course you are the only judges of fact in this case but if you find peter delgardo guilty then mr x will smile and order up champagne because wherever he is he will know hes safe at last frank prestcold summed up as i knew he would dead against petey he called the prosecution evidence overwhelming and the jury listened politely they went out just after lunch and were still out at when i telephoned hilda and told her that id change in chambers and meet her at the savoy and i wanted it clearly understood that i wasnt dancing i was just saying this when the usher came out and told me that the jury were back with a verdict after it was all over i looked round in vain for nooks he had apparently gone to join the rest of the delgardos in the great unknown so i went down to say goodbye to peter in the cells he was sitting inert and staring into the middle distance cheer up peter i sat down beside him dont look so bloody miserable my god i dont know how youd take it if youd lost peter shook his head and then said something i didnt wholly understand i was meant to lose who meant you to the prosecution of course air justice prestcold undoubtedly fate destiny the spirit of the universe not as it turned out it was written in the stars not guilty of murder and is that the verdict of you all thats why they ch chose you i was meant to lose what the man said puzzled me i admit it i found enigmatic i saidi dont follow bloke in the cell while i was w w waiting used to be a mate of bernie foureyes he told me why me brothers chose you to defend me well i thought i knew why i had been chosen for this important case i stood up and paced the room no doubt i have a certain reputation around the temple although my crown may be a little tarnished done rather too much indecent assault lately he heard them round thep p paradise rooms talking about this old feller rumpole peter seemed to be pursuing another line of thought the penge bungalow murder is in notable british trials i may have become a bit of a household name at least in criminal circles they was looking for a barrister whod be sure to lose after this i suppose i may get back to better quality crime the full force of what peter had said struck me i looked at him and checked carefully what did you say they wanted me defended by someone they could c count on for a guilty verdict thats why they p p picked you for it it was appallingly what i thought hed said they wanted to fit me up with doing tosher peter delgardo went on remorsetessly let me get this clear your brothers selected me to nobble your defence thats it you w was to be the jockey eke that pulled me back how did they light on me exactly me rumpole of the bailey my entire life sherlock holmes stories law degree knockabout apprenticeship at bow street and hackney days of triumph in murder and forgery down to that days swayed jury and notable victory seemed to be blown away like autumn leaves by what he said then the words came quickly now tumbling out of him they heard of an old bloke got p past it down to little bits of cases round the m m magistrates courts bit of a muddler they heard with a funny old biokendown hat on him the hat again at least i had bought a bowler so they r reckoned you was just the bloke to lose this murder like and dear old nooks shady nooks did he help them to choose me i suspected it id dont know im n n not saying he didnt so thats my reputation i tried to take stock of the situation and failed abysmally i shouldntve told you he sounded genuinely apologetic get rumpole for the defence and be sure of a conviction perhaps its all lies was he trying to cheer me up he went on you hear lots of s s stories in the cells under the bailey and in the bar mess too they rubbish your reputation small cigar i found a packet and offered him one all right we lit up after all one had to think of the future so where does this leave you peter i asked him id say mr rumpole none too s safe what about you i blew out smoke wondering exactly what i had left perhaps not all that safe either i had brought my old dinner jacket up to chambers and i changed into it there i had a bottle of rum in the cupboard and i gave myself a strong drink out of a dusty glass as i shut the cupboard door i noticed my old hat it was on a shelf gathering dust and seemed to have about it a look of mild reproach i put it on and noticed how comfortably it fitted i dropped the new hard bowler into the wastepaper basket and went on to the savoy you look charming my dear hilda resplendent in a long dress her shoulders dusted with powder smiled delightedly at mrs marigold featherstone who was nibbling delicately at an afterdinner mint really rumpole hilda looked at me gently rebuking she she marigold was mystified but anxious to join in any joke that might be going oh she i said casually a woman of fabulous beauty written up by h rider haggard a waiter passed and i created a diversion by calling his attention to the fact that the tide had gone out in my glass around us prominent members of the legal profession pushed their bulky wives about the parquet like a number of freshfaced gardeners executing elaborate manoeuvres with wheelbarrows there were some young persons among them and i noticed erskinebrown jigging about in solitary rapture somewhere in the vicinity of miss phyllida trant she saw me and gave a quick smile and then she was off circling erskinebrown like an obedient planet which i didnt consider a fitting occupation for any girl of miss trants undoubted abilities your husbands had a good win guthrie featherstone was charting to hilda he hasnt had a good win guthrie she put the man right hes had a triumph entirely thanks to my old hat i raised my glass heres to it what little of what rumpole said made much sense to marigold my triumph indeed my great opportunity is to be attributed solely to my hat i explained to her but she couldnt agree nonsense what youre talking nonsense she explained to our hosts he does you know from time to time rumpole won because he knows so much about blood really featherstone looked at the dancers no doubt wondering how soon he could steer his beautiful wife off into the throng but hilda fixed him with her glittering eye and went on much like the ancient mariner you remember daddy of course he used to be your head of chambers daddy told me rumpole daddy told me in fact he told me that on the occasion of the inns of court summer ball which is practically the last dance we went to hilda i tried unsuccessfully to stem the flow no im going to say this horace dont interrupt horace rumpole daddy told me knows more about bloodstains than anyone weve got in chambers i noticed that marigold had gone a little pale do stop it hilda youre putting marigold off dont you find it marigold turned to me well sordid sometimes what crime dont you find it terribly sordid there was a silence the music had stopped and the legal fraternity on the floor clapped sporadically i saw erskinebrown take miss trams hand oh do be careful marigold i said dont knock it i think it must be sordid marigold patted her lips with her table napkin removing the last possible trace of afterdinner mint abolish crime i warned her and you abolish the very basis of our existence oh come now horace featherstone was smiling at me tolerantly hes right hilda told him rumpole knows about bloodstains abolish crime and we should all vanish i felt a rush of words to the head all the barristers and solicitors and dock officers and the dear old matron down the old bailey who gives aspirins away with sentences of life imprisonment thered be no judges no lord chancellor the commissioner of the metropolitan police would have to go out selling encyclopaedias i leant back grabbed the wine from the bucket and started to refill all our glasses why are we here whyve we got prawn cocktail and duck iorange and selections from dear old oklahoma all because a few villains down the east end are kind enough to keep us in a regular supply of crime a slightly hurt waiter took the bottle from me and continued my work dont you help them marigold looked at me doubtfully dont i what help them doing all these crimes after all you get them off today i said not without a certain pride today let me tell you marigold i was no help to them at all i showed themno gratitude you got him off what you got peter delgardo off just for one reason what was that he happened to be innocent come on horace how can you be sure of that featherstone was smiling tolerantly but i leant forward and gave him the truth of the matter you know its a terrifying thing my learned friend we go through all that mumbo jumbo we put on our wigs and gowns and mutter the ritual prayers my lord i humbly submit ladies and gentlemen of the jury you have listened with admirable patience abracadabra fee fo fi bloody fum and just when everyone thinks youre going to produce the most ludicrously faked bit of cheesecloth ectoplasm or a phoney rap on the table it comes clear as a bell quite unexpected the voice of truth i was vaguely aware of a worried figure in a dinner jacket coming towards us across the floor have you ever found that featherstone bloody scaring sometimes all the trouble we take to cloud the issues and divert the attention suddenly weve done it there it is naked and embarrassing the truth i looked up as the figure joined us it was my late instructing solicitor nooks shady nooks i greeted him but he seemed in no mood to notice me he pulled up a chair and sat down beside featherstone apparently it was on the nine oclock news theyve just arrested leslie delgardo charged him with the murder of tosher macbride ill want a con with you in the morning i was left out of this conversation but i didnt mind music started again playing a tune which i found vaguely familiar nooks was muttering on it seemed that the police now knew tosher worked for leslie and that some member of the rival watson family may have spotted him at the scene of the crime an extraordinary sensation overcame me something i hadnt felt for a long time which could only be described as happiness i dont know whether youll want to brief me for leslie nooks i raised a glass to old shady or would that be rather overegging the pudding and then an even more extraordinary sensation a totally irrational impulse for which i can find no logical explanation overcame me i put out a hand and touched she who must be obeyed on the powdered shoulder hilda oh yes rumpole it seemed i was interrupting some confidential chat with marigold what do you want now i honestly think i could find no coherent explanation i think i want to dance with you i suppose it was a waltz as i steered hilda out onto the great open spaces it seemed quite easy to go round and round vaguely in time to the music i heard a strange sound as if from a long way off ill have the last waltz with you two sleepy people together or words to that effect i was in fact singing singing and dancing to celebrate a great victory in a case i was never meant to win the end
