flappers and philosophers contents the offshore pirate the ice palace head and shoulders the cutglass bowl bernice bobs her hair benediction dalyrimple goes wrong the four fists flappers and philosophers the offshore pirate i this unlikely story begins on a sea that was a blue dream as colorful as bluesilk stockings and beneath a sky as blue as the irises of childrens eyes from the western half of the sky the sun was shying little golden disks at the sea if you gazed intently enough you could see them skip from wave tip to wave tip until they joined a broad collar of golden coin that was collecting half a mile out and would eventually be a dazzling sunset about halfway between the florida shore and the golden collar a white steamyacht very young and graceful was riding at anchor and under a blueandwhite awning aft a yellowhaired girl reclined in a wicker settee reading the revolt of the angels by anatole france she was about nineteen slender and supple with a spoiled alluring mouth and quick gray eyes full of a radiant curiosity her feet stockingless and adorned rather than clad in bluesatin slippers which swung nonchalantly from her toes were perched on the arm of a settee adjoining the one she occupied and as she read she intermittently regaled herself by a faint application to her tongue of a halflemon that she held in her hand the other half sucked dry lay on the deck at her feet and rocked very gently to and fro at the almost imperceptible motion of the tide the second halflemon was wellnigh pulpless and the golden collar had grown astonishing in width when suddenly the drowsy silence which enveloped the yacht was broken by the sound of heavy footsteps and an elderly man topped with orderly gray hair and clad in a whiteflannel suit appeared at the head of the companionway there he paused for a moment until his eyes became accustomed to the sun and then seeing the girl under the awning he uttered a long even grunt of disapproval if he had intended thereby to obtain a rise of any sort he was doomed to disappointment the girl calmly turned over two pages turned back one raised the lemon mechanically to tasting distance and then very faintly but quite unmistakably yawned ardita said the grayhaired man sternly ardita uttered a small sound indicating nothing ardita he repeated ardita ardita raised the lemon languidly allowing three words to slip out before it reached her tongue oh shut up ardita what will you listen to me or will i have to get a servant to hold you while i talk to you the lemon descended very slowly and scornfully put it in writing will you have the decency to close that abominable book and discard that damn lemon for two minutes oh cant you lemme alone for a second ardita i have just received a telephone message from the shore telephone she showed for the first time a faint interest yes it was do you mean to say she interrupted wonderingly at they let you run a wire out here yes and just now wont other boats bump into it no its run along the bottom five min well ill be darned gosh science is golden or something isnt it will you let me say what i started to shoot well it seems well i am up here he paused and swallowed several times distractedly oh yes young woman colonel moreland has called up again to ask me to be sure to bring you in to dinner his son toby has come all the way from new york to meet you and hes invited several other young people for the last time will you no said ardita shortly i wont i came along on this darn cruise with the one idea of going to palm beach and you knew it and i absolutely refuse to meet any darn old colonel or any darn young toby or any darn old young people or to set foot in any other darn old town in this crazy state so you either take me to palm beach or else shut up and go away very well this is the last straw in your infatuation for this man a man who is notorious for his excesses a man your father would not have allowed to so much as mention your name you have rejected the demimonde rather than the circles in which you have presumably grown up from now on i know interrupted ardita ironically from now on you go your way and i go mine ive heard that story before you know id like nothing better from now on he announced grandiloquently you are no niece of mine i ooooh the cry was wrung from ardita with the agony of a lost soul will you stop boring me will you go way will you jump overboard and drown do you want me to throw this book at you if you dare do any smack the revolt of the angels sailed through the air missed its target by the length of a short nose and bumped cheerfully down the companionway the grayhaired man made an instinctive step backward and then two cautious steps forward ardita jumped to her five feet four and stared at him defiantly her gray eyes blazing keep off how dare you he cried because i darn please youve grown unbearable your disposition youve made me that way no child ever has a bad disposition unless its her fancys fault whatever i am you did it muttering something under his breath her uncle turned and walking forward called in a loud voice for the launch then he returned to the awning where ardita had again seated herself and resumed her attention to the lemon i am going ashore he said slowly i will be out again at nine oclock tonight when i return we start back to new york wither i shall turn you over to your aunt for the rest of your natural or rather unnatural life he paused and looked at her and then all at once something in the utter childness of her beauty seemed to puncture his anger like an inflated tire and render him helpless uncertain utterly fatuous ardita he said not unkindly im no fool ive been round i know men and child confirmed libertines dont reform until theyre tired and then theyre not themselves theyre husks of themselves he looked at her as if expecting agreement but receiving no sight or sound of it he continued perhaps the man loves you thats possible hes loved many women and hell love many more less than a month ago one month ardita he was involved in a notorious affair with that redhaired woman mimi merril promised to give her the diamond bracelet that the czar of russia gave his mother you know you read the papers thrilling scandals by an anxious uncle yawned ardita have it filmed wicked clubman making eyes at virtuous flapper virtuous flapper conclusively vamped by his lurid past plans to meet him at palm beach foiled by anxious uncle will you tell me why the devil you want to marry him im sure i couldnt say said audits shortly maybe because hes the only man i know good or bad who has an imagination and the courage of his convictions maybe its to get away from the young fools that spend their vacuous hours pursuing me around the country but as for the famous russian bracelet you can set your mind at rest on that score hes going to give it to me at palm beach if youll show a little intelligence how about the redhaired woman he hasnt seen her for six months she said angrily dont you suppose i have enough pride to see to that dont you know by this time that i can do any darn thing with any darn man i want to she put her chin in the air like the statue of france aroused and then spoiled the pose somewhat by raising the lemon for action is it the russian bracelet that fascinates you no im merely trying to give you the sort of argument that would appeal to your intelligence and i wish youd go way she said her temper rising again you know i never change my mind youve been boring me for three days until im about to go crazy i wont go ashore wont do you hear wont very well he said and you wont go to palm beach either of all the selfish spoiled uncontrolled disagreeable impossible girl i have splush the halflemon caught him in the neck simultaneously came a hail from over the side the launch is ready mr farnam too full of words and rage to speak mr farnam cast one utterly condemning glance at his niece and turning ran swiftly down the ladder ii five oclock robed down from the sun and plumped soundlessly into the sea the golden collar widened into a glittering island and a faint breeze that had been playing with the edges of the awning and swaying one of the dangling blue slippers became suddenly freighted with song it was a chorus of men in close harmony and in perfect rhythm to an accompanying sound of oars dealing the blue writers ardita lifted her head and listened carrots and peas beans on their knees pigs in the seas lucky fellows blow us a breeze blow us a breeze blow us a breeze with your bellows arditas brow wrinkled in astonishment sitting very still she listened eagerly as the chorus took up a second verse onions and beans marshalls and deans goldbergs and greens and costellos blow us a breeze blow us a breeze blow us a breeze with your bellows with an exclamation she tossed her book to the desk where it sprawled at a straddle and hurried to the rail fifty feet away a large rowboat was approaching containing seven men six of them rowing and one standing up in the stern keeping time to their song with an orchestra leaders baton oysters and rocks sawdust and socks who could make clocks out of cellos the leaders eyes suddenly rested on ardita who was leaning over the rail spellbound with curiosity he made a quick movement with his baton and the singing instantly ceased she saw that he was the only white man in the boat the six rowers were negroes narcissus ahoy he called politely whats the idea of all the discord demanded ardita cheerfully is this the varsity crew from the county nut farm by this time the boat was scraping the side of the yacht and a great bulking negro in the bow turned round and grasped the ladder thereupon the leader left his position in the stern and before ardita had realized his intention he ran up the ladder and stood breathless before her on the deck the women and children will be spared he said briskly all crying babies will be immediately drowned and all males put in double irons digging her hands excitedly down into the pockets of her dress ardita stared at him speechless with astonishment he was a young man with a scornful mouth and the bright blue eyes of a healthy baby set in a dark sensitive face his hair was pitch black damp and curly the hair of a grecian statue gone brunette he was trimly built trimly dressed and graceful as an agile quarterback well ill be a son of a gun she said dazedly they eyed each other coolly do you surrender the ship is this an outburst of wit demanded ardita are you an idiot or just being initiated to some fraternity i asked you if you surrendered the ship i thought the country was dry said ardita disdainfully have you been drinking fingernail enamel you better get off this yacht what the young mans voice expressed incredulity get off the yacht you heard me he looked at her for a moment as if considering what she had said no said his scornful mouth slowly no i wont get off the yacht you can get off if you wish going to the rail be gave a curt command and immediately the crew of the rowboat scrambled up the ladder and ranged themselves in line before him a coalblack and burly darky at one end and a miniature mulatto of four feet nine at to other they seemed to be uniformly dressed in some sort of blue costume ornamented with dust mud and tatters over the shoulder of each was slung a small heavylooking white sack and under their arms they carried large black cases apparently containing musical instruments tenshun commanded the young man snapping his own heels together crisply right driss front step out here babe the smallest negro took a quick step forward and saluted take command go down below catch the crew and tie em up all except the engineer bring him up to me oh and pile those bags by the rail there yassuh babe saluted again and wheeling about motioned for the five others to gather about him then after a short whispered consultation they all filed noiselessly down the companionway now said the young man cheerfully to ardita who had witnessed this last scene in withering silence if you will swear on your honor as a flapper which probably isnt worth much that youll keep that spoiled little mouth of yours tight shut for fortyeight hours you can row yourself ashore in our rowboat otherwise what otherwise youre going to sea in a ship with a little sigh as for a crisis well passed the young man sank into the settee ardita had lately vacated and stretched his arms lazily the corners of his mouth relaxed appreciatively as he looked round at the rich striped awning the polished brass and the luxurious fittings of the deck his eye felt on the book and then on the exhausted lemon hm he said stonewall jackson claimed that lemonjuice cleared his head your head feel pretty clear ardita disdained to answer because inside of five minutes youll have to make a clear decision whether its go or stay he picked up the book and opened it curiously the revolt of the angels sounds pretty good french eh he stared at her with new interest you french no whats your name farnam farnam what ardita farnam well ardita no use standing up there and chewing out the insides of your mouth you ought to break those nervous habits while youre young come over here and sit down ardita took a carved jade case from her pocket extracted a cigarette and lit it with a conscious coolness though she knew her hand was trembling a little then she crossed over with her supple swinging walk and sitting down in the other settee blew a mouthful of smoke at the awning you cant get me off this yacht she raid steadily and you havent got very much sense if you think youll get far with it my unclell have wirelesses zigzagging all over this ocean by half past six hm she looked quickly at his face caught anxiety stamped there plainly in the faintest depression of the mouths corners its all the same to me she said shrugging her shoulders tisnt my yacht i dont mind going for a coupla hours cruise ill even lend you that book so youll have something to read on the revenue boat that takes you up to singsing he laughed scornfully if thats advice you neednt bother this is part of a plan arranged before i ever knew this yacht existed if it hadnt been this one itd have been the next one we passed anchored along the coast who are you demanded ardita suddenly and what are you youve decided not to go ashore i never even faintly considered it were generally known he said all seven of us as curtis carlyle and his six black buddies late of the winter garden and the midnight frolic youre singers we were until today at present due to those white bags you see there were fugitives from justice and if the reward offered for our capture hasnt by this time reached twenty thousand dollars i miss my guess whats in the bags asked ardita curiously well he said for the present well call it mud florida mud iii within ten minutes after curtis carlyles interview with a very frightened engineer the yacht narcissus was under way steaming south through a balmy tropical twilight the little mulatto babe who seems to have carlyles implicit confidence took full command of the situation mr farnams valet and the chef the only members of the crew on board except the engineer having shown fight were now reconsidering strapped securely to their bunks below trombone mose the biggest negro was set busy with a can of paint obliterating the name narcissus from the bow and substituting the name hula hula and the others congregated aft and became intently involved in a game of craps having given order for a meal to be prepared and served on deck at seventhirty carlyle rejoined ardita and sinking back into his settee half closed his eyes and fell into a state of profound abstraction ardita scrutinized him carefully and classed him immedialely as a romantic figure he gave the effect of towering selfconfidence erected on a slight foundation just under the surface of each of his decisions she discerned a hesitancy that was in decided contrast to the arrogant curl of his lips hes not like me she thought theres a difference somewhere being a supreme egotist ardita frequently thought about herself never having had her egotism disputed she did it entirely naturally and with no detraction from her unquestioned charm though she was nineteen she gave the effect of a highspirited precocious child and in the present glow of her youth and beauty all the men and women she had known were but driftwood on the ripples of her temperament she had met other egotists in fact she found that selfish people bored her rather less than unselfish people but as yet there had not been one she had not eventually defeated and brought to her feet but though she recognized an egotist in the settee she felt none of that usual shutting of doors in her mind which meant clearing ship for action on the contrary her instinct told her that this man was somehow completely pregnable and quite defenseless when ardita defied convention and of late it had been her chief amusement it was from an intense desire to be herself and she felt that this man on the contrary was preoccupied with his own defiance she was much more interested in him than she was in her own situation which affected her as the prospect of a matineй might affect a tenyearold child she had implicit confidence in her ability to take care of herself under any and all circumstances the night deepened a pale new moon smiled mistyeyed upon the sea and as the shore faded dimly out and dark clouds were blown like leaves along the far horizon a great haze of moonshine suddenly bathed the yacht and spread an avenue of glittering mail in her swift path from time to time there was the bright flare of a match as one of them lighted a cigarette but except for the low undertone of the throbbing engines and the even wash of the waves about the stern the yacht was quiet as a dream boat starbound through the heavens round them bowed the smell of the night sea bringing with it an infinite languor carlyle broke the silence at last lucky girl he sighed ive always wanted to be rich and buy all this beauty ardita yawned id rather be you she said frankly you would for about a day but you do seem to possess a lot of nerve for a flapper i wish you wouldnt call me that beg your pardon as to nerve she continued slowly its my one redeemiug feature im not afraid of anything in heaven or earth hm i am to be afraid said ardita a person has either to be very great and strong or else a coward im neither she paused for a moment and eagerness crept into her tone but i want to talk about you what on earth have you done and how did you do it why he demanded cynically going to write a movie about me go on she urged lie to me by the moonlight do a fabulous story a negro appeared switched on a string of small lights under the awning and began setting the wicker table for supper and while they ate cold sliced chicken salad artichokes and strawberry jam from the plentiful larder below carlyle began to talk hesitatingly at first but eagerly as he saw she was interested ardita scarcely touched her food as she watched his dark young face handsome ironic faintly ineffectual he began life as a poor kid in a tennessee town he said so poor that his people were the only white family in their street he never remembered any white children but there were inevitably a dozen pickaninnies streaming in his trail passionate admirers whom he kept in tow by the vividness of his imagination and the amount of trouble he was always getting them in and out of and it seemed that this association diverted a rather unusual musical gift into a strange channel there had been a colored woman named belle pope calhoun who played the piano at parties given for white children nice white children that would have passed curtis carlyle with a sniff but the ragged little poh white used to sit beside her piano by the hour and try to get in an alto with one of those kazoos that boys hum through before he was thirteen he was picking up a living teasing ragtime out of a battered violin in little cafйs round nashville eight years later the ragtime craze hit the country and he took six darkies on the orpheum circuit five of them were boys he had grown up with the other was the little mulatto babe divine who was a wharf nigger round new york and long before that a plantation hand in bermuda until he stuck an eightinch stiletto in his masters back almost before carlyle realized his good fortune he was on broadway with offers of engagements on all sides and more money than he had ever dreamed of it was about then that a change began in his whole attitude a rather curious embittering change it was when he realized that he was spending the golden years of his life gibbering round a stage with a lot of black men his act was good of its kind three trombones three saxaphones and carlyles flute and it was his own peculiar sense of rhythm that made all the difference but he began to grow strangely sensitive about it began to hate the thought of appearing dreaded it from day to day they were making money each contract he signed called for more but when he went to managers and told them that he wanted to separate from his sextet and go on as a regular pianist they laughed at him aud told him he was crazy it would he an artistic suicide he used to laugh afterward at the phrase artistic suicide they all used it half a dozen times they played at private dances at three thousand dollars a night and it seemed as if these crystallized all his distaste for his mode of livlihood they took place in clubs and houses that he couldnt have gone into in the daytime after all he was merely playing to rфle of the eternal monkey a sort of sublimated chorus man he was sick of the very smell of the theatre of powder and rouge and the chatter of the greenroom and the patronizing approval of the boxes he couldnt put his heart into it any more the idea of a slow approach to the luxury of liesure drove him wild he was of course progressing toward it but like a child eating his icecream so slowly that he couldnt taste it at all he wanted to have a lot of money and time and opportunity to read and play and the sort of men and women round him that he could never have the kind who if they thought of him at all would have considered him rather contemptible in short he wanted all those things which he was beginning to lump under the general head of aristocracy an aristocracy which it seemed almost any money could buy except money made as he was making it he was twentyfive then without family or education or any promise that he would succeed in a business career he began speculating wildly and within three weeks he had lost every cent he had saved then the war came he went to plattsburg and even there his profession followed him a brigadiergeneral called him up to headquarters and told him he could serve his country better as a band leader so he spent the war entertaining celebrities behind the line with a headquarters band it was not so bad except that when the infantry came limping back from the trenches he wanted to be one of them the sweat and mud they wore seemed only one of those ineffable symbols of aristocracy that were forever eluding him it was the private dances that did it after i came back from the war the old routine started we had an offer from a syndicate of florida hotels it was only a question of time then he broke off and ardita looked at him expectantly but he shook his head no he said im going to tell you about it im enjoying it too much and im afraid id lose a little of that enjoyment if i shared it with anyone else i want to hang on to those few breathless heroic moments when i stood out before them all and let them know i was more than a damn bobbing squawking clown from up forward came suddenly the low sound of singing the negroes had gathered together on the deck and their voices rose together in a haunting melody that soared in poignant harmonics toward the moon and ardita listens in enchantment oh down oh down mammy wanna take me down milky way oh down oh down pappy say tomorraaaah but mammy say today yes mammy say today carlyle sighed and was silent for a moment looking up at the gathered host of stars blinking like arclights in the warm sky the negroes song had died away to a plaintive humming and it seemed as if minute by minute the brightness and the great silence were increasing until he could almost hear the midnight toilet of the mermaids as they combed their silver dripping curls under the moon and gossiped to each other of the fine wrecks they lived on the green opalescent avenues below you see said carlyle softly this is the beauty i want beauty has got to be astonishing astounding its got to burst in on you like a dream like the exquisite eyes of a girl he turned to her but she was silent you see dont you anita i mean ardita again she made no answer she had been sound asleep for some time iv in the dense sunflooded noon of next day a spot in the sea before them resolved casually into a greenandgray islet apparently composed of a great granite cliff at its northern end which slanted south through a mile of vivid coppice and grass to a sandy beach melting lazily into the surf when ardita reading in her favorite seat came to the last page of the revolt of the angels and slamming the book shut looked up and saw it she gave a little cry of delight and called to carlyle who was standing moodily by the rail is this it is this where youre going carlyle shrugged his shoulders carelessly youve got me he raised his voice and called up to the acting skipper oh babe is this your island the mulattos miniature head appeared from round the corner of the deckhouse yassuh this yeahs it carlyle joined ardita looks sort of sporting doesnt it yes she agreed but it doesnt look big enough to be much of a hidingplace you still putting your faith in those wirelesses your uncle was going to have zigzagging round no said ardita frankly im all for you id really like to see you make a getaway he laughed youre our lady luck guess well have to keep you with us as a mascot for the present anyway you couldnt very well ask me to swim back she said coolly if you do im going to start writing dime novels founded on that interminable history of your life you gave me last night he flushed and stiffened slightly im very sorry i bored you oh you didnt until just at the end with some story about how furious you were because you couldnt dance with the ladies you played music for he rose angrily you have got a darn mean little tongue excuse me she said melting into laughter but im not used to having men regale me with the story of their life ambitions especially if theyve lived such deathly platonic lives why what do men usually regale you with oh they talk about me she yawned they tell me im the spirit of youth and beauty what do you tell them oh i agree quietly does every man you meet tell you he loves you ardita nodded why shouldnt he all life is just a progression toward and then a recession from one phrase i love you carlyle laughed and sat down thats very true thats thats not bad did you make that up yes or rather i found it out it doesnt mean anything especially its just clever its the sort of remark he said gravely thats typical of your class oh she interrupted impatiently dont start that lecture on aristocracy again i distrust people who can be intense at this hour in the morning its a mild form of insanity a sort of breakfastfood jag mornings the time to sleep swim and be careless ten minutes later they had swung round in a wide circle as if to approach the island from the north theres a trick somewhere commented ardita thoughtfully he cant mean just to anchor up against this cliff they were heading straight in now toward the solid rock which must have been well over a hundred feet tall and not until they were within fifty yards of it did ardita see their objective then she clapped her hands in delight there was a break in the cliff entirely hidden by a curious overlapping of rock and through this break the yacht entered and very slowly traversed a narrow channel of crystalclear water between high gray walls then they were riding at anchor in a miniature world of green and gold a gilded bay smooth as glass and set round with tiny palms the whole resembling the mirror lakes and twig trees that children set up in sand piles not so darned bad cried carlyle excitedly i guess that little coon knows his way round this corner of the atlantic his exuberance was contagious and ardita became quite jubilant its an absolutely surefire hidingplace lordy yes its the sort of island you read about the rowboat was lowered into the golden lake and they pulled to shore come on said carlyle as they landed in the slushy sand well go exploring the fringe of palms was in turn ringed in by a round mile of flat sandy country they followed it south and brushing through a farther rim of tropical vegetation came out on a pearlgray virgin beach where ardita kicked of her brown golf shoes she seemed to have permanently abandoned stockings and went wading then they sauntered back to the yacht where the indefatigable babe had luncheon ready for them he had posted a lookout on the high cliff to the north to watch the sea on both sides though he doubted if the entrance to the cliff was generally known he had never even seen a map on which the island was marked whats its name asked ardita the island i mean no name tall chuckled babe reckin she jus island ats all in the late afternoon they sat with their backs against great boulders on the highest part of the cliff and carlyle sketched for her his vague plans he was sure they were hot after him by this time the total proceeds of the coup he had pulled off and concerning which he still refused to enlighten her he estimated as just under a million dollars he counted on lying up here several weeks and then setting off southward keeping well outside the usual channels of travel rounding the horn and heading for callao in peru the details of coaling and provisioning he was leaving entirely to babe who it seemed had sailed these seas in every capacity from cabinboy aboard a coffee trader to virtual first mate on a brazillian pirate craft whose skipper had long since been hung if hed been white hed have been king of south america long ago said carlyle emphatically when it comes to intelligence he makes booker t washington look like a moron hes got the guile of every race and nationality whose blood is in his veins and thats half a dozen or im a liar he worships me because im the only man in the world who can play better ragtime than he can we used to sit together on the wharfs down on the new york waterfront he with a bassoon and me with an oboe and wed blend minor keys in african harmonics a thousand years old until the rats would crawl up the posts and sit round groaning and squeaking like dogs will in front of a phonograph ardita roared how you can tell em carlyle grinned i swear thats the gos what you going to do when you get to callao she interrupted take ship for india i want to be a rajah i mean it my idea is to go up into afghanistan somewhere buy up a palace and a reputation and then after about five years appear in england with a foreign accent and a mysterious past but india first do you know they say that all the gold in the world drifts very gradually back to india something fascinating about that to me and i want leisure to read an immense amount how about after that then he answered defiantly comes aristocracy laugh if you want to but at least youll have to admit that i know what i want which i imagine is more than you do on the contrary contradicted ardita reaching in her pocket for her cigarette case when i met you i was in the midst of a great uproar of all my friends and relatives because i did know what i wanted what was it a man he started you mean you were engaged after a fashion if you hadnt come aboard i had every intention of slipping ashore yesterday evening how long ago it seems and meeting him in palm beach hes waiting there for me with a bracelet that once belonged to catherine of russia now dont mutter anything about aristocracy she put in quickly i liked him simply because he had had an imagination and the utter courage of his convictions but your family disapproved eh what there is of it only a silly uncle and a sillier aunt it seems he got into some scandal with a redhaired woman name mimi something it was frightfully exaggerated he said and men dont lie to me and anyway i didnt care what hed done it was the future that counted and id see to that when a mans in love with me he doesnt care for other amusements i told him to drop her like a hot cake and he did i feel rather jealous said carlyle frowning and then he laughed i guess ill just keep you along with us until we get to callao then ill lend you enough money to get back to the states by that time youll have had a chance to think that gentleman over a little more dont talk to me like that fired up ardita i wont tolerate the parental attitude from anybody do you understand me he chuckled and then stopped rather abashed as her cold anger seemed to fold him about and chill him im sorry he offered uncertainly oh dont apologize i cant stand men who say im sorry in that manly reserved tone just shut up a pause ensued a pause which carlyle found rather awkward but which ardita seemed not to notice at all as she sat contentedly enjoying her cigarette and gazing out at the shining sea after a minute she crawled out on the rock and lay with her face over the edge looking down carlyle watching her reflected how it seemed impossible for her to assume an ungraceful attitude oh look she cried theres a lot of sort of ledges down there wide ones of all different heights well go swimming tonight she said excitedly by moonlight wouldnt you rather go in at the beach on the other end not a chance i like to dive you can use my uncles bathing suit only itll fit you like a gunny sack because hes a very flabby man ive got a onepiece thats shocked the natives all along the atlantic coast from biddeford pool to st augustine i suppose youre a shark yes im pretty good and i look cute too a sculptor up at rye last summer told me my calves are worth five hundred dollars there didnt seem to be any answer to this so carlyle was silent permitting himself only a discreet interior smile v when the night crept down in shadowy blue and silver they threaded the shimmering channel in the rowboat and tying it to a jutting rock began climbing the cliff together the first shelf was ten feet up wide and furnishing a natural diving platform there they sat down in the bright moonlight and watched the faint incessant surge of the waters almost stilled now as the tide set seaward are you happy he asked suddenly she nodded always happy near the sea you know she went on ive been thinking all day that you and i are somewhat alike were both rebels only for different reasons two years ago when i was just eighteen and you were twentyfive well we were both conventional successes i was an utterly devastating dйbutante and you were a prosperous musician just commissioned in the army gentleman by act of congress he put in ironically well at any rate we both fitted if our corners were not rubbed off they were at least pulled in but deep in us both was something that made us require more for happiness i didnt know what i wanted i went from man to man restless impatient month by month getting less acquiescent and more dissatisfied i used to sit sometimes chewing at the insides of my mouth and thinking i was going crazy i had a frightful sense of transiency i wanted things now now now here i was beautiful i am arent i yes agreed carlyle tentatively ardita rose suddenly wait a second i want to try this delightfullooking sea she walked to the end of the ledge and shot out over the sea doubling up in midair and then straightening out and entering to water straight as a blade in a perfect jackknife dive in a minute her voice floated up to him you see i used to read all day and most of the night i began to resent society come on up here he interrupted what on earth are you doing just floating round on my back ill be up in a minute let me tell you the only thing i enjoyed was shocking people wearing something quite impossible and quite charming to a fancydress party going round with the fastest men in new york and getting into some of the most hellish scrapes imaginable the sounds of splashing mingled with her words and then he heard her hurried breathing as she began climbing up side to the ledge go on in she called obediently he rose and dived when he emerged dripping and made the climb he found that she was no longer on the ledge but after a frightened he heard her light laughter from another shelf ten feet up there he joined her and they both sat quietly for a moment their arms clasped round their knees panting a little from the climb the family were wild she said suddenly they tried to marry me off and then when id begun to feel that after all life was scarcely worth living i found something her eyes went skyward exultantly i found something carlyle waited and her words came with a rush courage just that courage as a rule of life and something to cling to always i began to build up this enormous faith in myself i began to see that in all my idols in the past some manifestation of courage had unconsciously been the thing that attracted me i began separating courage from the other things of life all sorts of courage the beaten bloody prizefighter coming up for more i used to make men take me to prizefights the dйclassй woman sailing through a nest of cats and looking at them as if they were mud under her feet the liking what you like always the utter disregard for other peoples opinions just to live as i liked always and to die in my own way did you bring up the cigarettes he handed one over and held a match for her gently still ardita continued the men kept gathering old men and young men my mental and physical inferiors most of them but all intensely desiring to have me to own this rather magnificent proud tradition id built up round me do you see sort of you never were beaten and you never apologized never she sprang to the edge poised for a moment like a crucified figure against the sky then describing a dark parabola plunked without a slash between two silver ripples twenty feet below her voice floated up to him again and courage to me meant ploughing through that dull gray mist that comes down on life not only overriding people and circumstances but overriding the bleakness of living a sort of insistence on the value of life and the worth of transient things she was climbing up now and at her last words her head with the damp yellow hair slicked symmetrically back appeared on his level all very well objected carlyle you can call it courage but your courage is really built after all on a pride of birth you were bred to that defiant attitude on my gray days even courage is one of the things thats gray and lifeless she was sitting near the edge hugging her knees and gazing abstractedly at the white moon he was farther back crammed like a grotesque god into a niche in the rock i dont want to sound like pollyanna she began but you havent grasped me yet my courage is faith faith in the eternal resilience of me that joyll come back and hope and spontaneity and i feel that till it does ive got to keep my lips shut and my chin high and my eyes wide not necessarily any silly smiling oh ive been through hell without a whine quite often and the female hell is deadlier than the male but supposing suggested carlyle that before joy and hope and all that came back the curtain was drawn on you for good ardita rose and going to the wall climbed with some difficulty to the next ledge another ten or fifteen feet above why she called back then id have won he edged out till he could see her better not dive from there youll break your back he said quickly she laughed not i slowly she spread her arms and stood there swanlike radiating a pride in her young perfection that lit a warm glow in carlyles heart were going through the black air with our arms wide and our feet straight out behind like a dolphins tail and were going to think well never hit the silver down there till suddenly itll be all warm round us and full of little kissing caressing waves then she was in the air and carlyle involuntarily held his breath he had not realized that the dive was nearly forty feet it seemed an eternity before he heard the swift compact sound as she reached the sea and it was with his glad sigh of relief when her light watery laughter curled up the side of the cliff and into his anxious ears that he knew he loved her vi time having no axe to grind showered down upon them three days of afternoons when the sun cleared the porthole of arditas cabin an hour after dawn she rose cheerily donned her bathingsuit and went up on deck the negroes would leave their work when they saw her and crowd chuckling and chattering to the rail as she floated an agile minnow on and under the surface of the clear water again in the cool of the afternoon she would swim and loll and smoke with carlyle upon the cliff or else they would lie on their sides in the sands of the southern beach talking little but watching the day fade colorfully and tragically into the infinite langour of a tropical evening and with the long sunny hours arditas idea of the episode as incidental madcap a sprig of romance in a desert of reality gradually left her she dreaded the time when he would strike off southward she dreaded all the eventualities that presented themselves to her thoughts were suddenly troublesome and decisions odious had prayers found place in the pagan rituals of her soul she would have asked of life only to be unmolested for a while lazily acquiescent to the ready naпf flow of carlyles ideas his vivid boyish imagination and the vein of monomania that seemed to run crosswise through his temperament and colored his every action but this is not a story of two on an island nor concerned primarily with love bred of isolation it is merely the presentation of two personalities and its idyllic setting among the palms of the gulf stream is quite incidental most of us are content to exist and breed and fight for the right to do both and the dominant idea the foredoomed attest to control ones destiny is reserved for the fortunate or unfortunate few to me the interesting thing about ardita is the courage that will tarnish with her beauty and youth take me with you she said late one night as they sat lazily in the grass under the shadowy spreading palms the negroes had brought ashore their musical instruments and the sound of weird ragtime was drifting softly over on the warm breath of the night id love to reappear in ten years as a fabulously wealthy highcaste indian lady she continued carlyle looked at her quickly you can you know she laughed is it a proposal of marriage extra ardita farnam becomes pirates bride society girl kidnapped by ragtime bank robber it wasnt a bank what was it why wont you tell me i dont want to break down your illusions my dear man i have no illusions about you i mean your illusions about yourself she looked up in surprise about myself what on earth have i got to do with whatever stray felonies youve committed that remains to be seen she reached over and patted his hand dear mr curtis carlyle she said softly are you in love with me as if it mattered but it does because i think im in love with you he looked at her ironically thus swelling your january total to half a dozen he suggested suppose i call your bluff and ask you to come to india with me shall i he shrugged his shoulders we can get married in callao what sort of life can you offer me i dont mean that unkindly but seriously what would become of me if the people who want that twentythousanddollar reward ever catch up with you i thought you werent afraid i never am but i wont throw my life away just to show one man im not i wish youd been poor just a little poor girl dreaming over a fence in a warm cow country wouldnt it have been nice id have enjoyed astonishing you watching your eyes open on things if you only wanted things dont you see i know like girls who stare into the windows of jewelrystores yes and want the big oblong watch thats platinum and has diamonds all round the edge only youd decide it was too expensive and choose one of white gold for a hundred dollar then id say expensive i should say not and wed go into the store and pretty soon the platinum one would be gleaming on your wrist that sounds so nice and vulgar and fun doesnt it murmured ardita doesnt it cant you see us travelling round and spending money right and left and being worshipped by bellboys and waiters oh blessed are the simple rich for they inherit the earth i honestly wish we were that way i love you ardita he said gently her face lost its childish look for moment and became oddly grave i love to be with you she said more than with any man ive ever met and i like your looks and your dark old hair and the way you go over the side of the rail when we come ashore in fact curtis carlyle i like all the things you do when youre perfectly natural i think youve got nerve and you know how i feel about that sometimes when youre around ive been tempted to kiss you suddenly and tell you that you were just an idealistic boy with a lot of caste nonsense in his head perhaps if i were just a little bit older and a little more bored id go with you as it is i think ill go back and marry that other man over across the silver lake the figures of the negroes writhed and squirmed in the moonlight like acrobats who having been too long inactive must go through their tacks from sheer surplus energy in single file they marched weaving in concentric circles now with their heads thrown back now bent over their instruments like piping fauns and from trombone and saxaphone ceaselessly whined a blended melody sometimes riotous and jubilant sometimes haunting and plaintive as a deathdance from the congos heart lets dance cried ardita i cant sit still with that perfect jazz going on taking her hand he led her out into a broad stretch of hard sandy soil that the moon flooded with great splendor they floated out like drifting moths under the rich hazy light and as the fantastic symphony wept and exulted and wavered and despaired arditas last sense of reality dropped away and she abandoned her imagination to the dreamy summer scents of tropical flowers and the infinite starry spaces overhead feeling that if she opened her eyes it would be to find herself dancing with a ghost in a land created by her own fancy this is what i should call an exclusive private dance he whispered i feel quite mad but delightfully mad were enchanted the shades of unnumbered generations of cannibals are watching us from high up on the side of the cliff there and ill bet the cannibal women are saying that we dance too close and that it was immodest of me to come without my nosering they both laughed softly and then their laughter died as over across the lake they heard the trombones stop in the middle of a bar and the saxaphones give a startled moan and fade out whats the matter called carlyle after a moments silence they made out the dark figure of a man rounding the silver lake at a run as he came closer they saw it was babe in a state of unusual excitement he drew up before them and gasped out his news in a breath ship stanin off sho bout half a mile suh mose he uz on watch he say looks if shes done anchod a ship what kind of a ship demanded carlyle anxiously dismay was in his voice and arditas heart gave a sudden wrench as she saw his whole face suddenly droop he say he dont know suh are they landing a boat no suh well go up said carlyle they ascended the hill in silence arditas hand still resting in carlyles as it had when they finished dancing she felt it clinch nervously from time to time as though he were unaware of the contact but though he hurt her she made no attempt to remove it it seemed an hours climb before they reached the top and crept cautiously across the silhouetted plateau to the edge of the cliff after one short look carlyle involuntarily gave a little cry it was a revenue boat with sixinch guns mounted fore and aft they know he said with a short intake of breath they know they picked up the trail somewhere are you sure they know about the channel they may be only standing by to take a look at the island in the morning from where they are they couldnt see the opening in the cliff they could with fieldglasses he said hopelessly he looked at his wristwatch its nearly two now they wont do anything until dawn thats certain of course theres always the faint possibility that theyre waiting for some other ship to join or for a coaler i suppose we may as well stay right here the hour passed and they lay there side by side very silently their chins in their hands like dreaming children in back of them squatted the negroes patient resigned acquiescent announcing now and then with sonorous snores that not even the presence of danger could subdue their unconquerable african craving for sleep just before five oclock babe approached carlyle there were half a dozen rifles aboard the narcissus he said had it been decided to offer no resistance a pretty good fight might be made he thought if they worked out some plan carlyle laughed and shook his head that isnt a spic army out there babe thats a revenue boat itd be like a bow and arrow trying to fight a machinegun if you want to bury those bags somewhere and take a chance on recovering them later go on and do it but it wont work theyd dig this island over from one end to the other its a lost battle all round babe babe inclined his head silently and turned away and carlyles voice was husky as he turned to ardita theres the best friend i ever had hed die for me and be proud to if id let him youve given up ive no choice of course theres always one way out the sure way but that can wait i wouldnt miss my trial for anything itll be an interesting experiment in notoriety miss farnam testifies that the pirates attitude to her was at all times that of a gentleman dont she said im awfully sorry when the color faded from the sky and lustreless blue changed to leaden gray a commotion was visible on the ships deck and they made out a group of officers clad in white duck gathered near the rail they had fieldglasses in their hands and were attentively examining the islet its all up said carlyle grimly damn whispered ardita she felt tears gathering in her eyes well go back to the yacht he said i prefer that to being hunted out up here like a possum leaving the plateau they descended the hill and reaching the lake were rowed out to the yacht by the silent negroes then pale and weary they sank into the settees and waited half an hour later in the dim gray light the nose of the revenue boat appeared in the channel and stopped evidently fearing that the bay might be too shallow from the peaceful look of the yacht the man and the girl in the settees and the negroes lounging curiously against the rail they evidently judged that there would be no resistance for two boats were lowered casually over the side one containing an officer and six bluejackets and the other four rowers and in the stern two grayhaired men in yachting flannels ardita and carlyle stood up and half unconsciously started toward each other then he paused and putting his hand suddenly into his pocket he pulled out a round glittering object and held it out to her what is it she asked wonderingly im not positive but i think from the russian inscription inside that its your promised bracelet where where on earth it came out of one of those bags you see curtis carlyle and his six black buddies in the middle of their performance in the tearoom of the hotel at palm beach suddenly changed their instruments for automatics and held up the crowd i took this bracelet from a pretty overrouged woman with red hair ardita frowned and then smiled so thats what you did you have got nerve he bowed a wellknown bourgeois quality he said and then dawn slanted dynamically across the deck and flung the shadows reeling into gray corners the dew rose and turned to golden mist thin as a dream enveloping them until they seemed gossamer relics of the late night infinitely transient and already fading for a moment sea and sky were breathless and dawn held a pink hand over the young mouth of life then from out in the lake came the complaint of a rowboat and the swish of oars suddenly against the golden furnace low in the east their two graceful figures melted into one and he was kissing her spoiled young mouth its a sort of glory he murmured after a second she smiled up at him happy are you her sigh was a benediction an ecstatic surety that she was youth and beauty now as much as she would ever know for another instant life was radiant and time a phantom and their strength eternal then there was a bumping scraping sound as the rowboat scraped alongside up the ladder scrambled the two grayhaired men the officer and two of the sailors with their hands on their revolvers mr farnam folded his arms and stood looking at his niece so he said nodding his head slowly with a sigh her arms unwound from carlyles neck and her eyes transfigured and far away fell upon the boarding party her uncle saw her upper lip slowly swell into that arrogant pout he knew so well so he repeated savagely so this is your idea of of romance a runaway affair with a highseas pirate ardita glanced at him carelessly what an old fool you are she said quietly is that the best you can say for yourself no she said as if considering no theres something else theres that wellknown phrase with which i have ended most of our conversations for the past few years shut up and with that she turned included the two old men the officer and the two sailors in a curt glance of contempt and walked proudly down the companionway but had she waited an instant longer she would have heard a sound from her uncle quite unfamiliar in most of their interviews he gave vent to a wholehearted amused chuckle in which the second old man joined the latter turned briskly to carlyle who had been regarding this scene with an air of cryptic amusement well toby he said genially you incurable harebrained romantic chaser of rainbows did you find that she was the person you wanted carlyle smiled confidently why naturally he said ive been perfectly sure ever since i first heard tell of her wild career thatd why i had babe send up the rocket last night im glad you did said colonel moreland gravely weve been keeping pretty close to you in case you should have trouble with those six strange niggers and we hoped wed find you two in some such compromising position he sighed well set a crank to catch a crank your father and i sat up all night hoping for the best or perhaps its the worst lord knows youre welcome to her my boy shes run me crazy did you give her the russian bracelet my detective got from that mimi woman carlyle nodded sh he said shes coming on deck ardita appeared at the head of the companionway and gave a quick involuntary glance at carlyles wrists a puzzled look passed across her face back aft the negroes had begun to sing and the cool lake fresh with dawn echoed serenely to their low voices ardita said carlyle unsteadily she swayed a step toward him ardita he repeated breathlessly ive got to tell you the the truth it was all a plant ardita my name isnt carlyle its moreland toby moreland the story was invented ardita invented out of thin florida air she stared at him bewildered amazement disbelief and anger flowing in quick waves across her face the three men held their breaths moreland senior took a step toward her mr farnams mouth dropped a little open as he waited panicstricken for the expected crash but it did not come arditas face became suddenly radiant and with a little laugh she went swiftly to young moreland and looked up at him without a trace of wrath in her gray eyes will you swear she said quietly that it was entirely a product of your own brain i swear said young moreland eagerly she drew his head down and kissed him gently what an imagination she said softly and almost enviously i want you to lie to me just as sweetly as you know how for the rest of my life the negroes voices floated drowsily back mingled in an air that she had heard them singing before time is a thief gladness and grief cling to the leaf as it yellows what was in the bags she asked softly florida mud he answered that was one of the two true things i told you perhaps i can guess the other one she said and reaching up on her tiptoes she kissed him softly in the illustration the ice palace the sunlight dripped over the house like golden paint over an art jar and the freckling shadows here and there only intensified the rigor of the bath of light the butterworth and larkin houses flanking were entrenched behind great stodgy trees only the happer house took the full sun and all day long faced the dusty roadstreet with a tolerant kindly patience this was the city of tarleton in southernmost georgia september afternoon up in her bedroom window sally carrol happer rested her nineteenyearold chin on a fiftytwoyearold sill and watched clark darrows ancient ford turn the corner the car was hot being partly metallic it retained all the heat it absorbed or evolved and clark darrow sitting bolt upright at the wheel wore a pained strained expression as though he considered himself a spare part and rather likely to break he laboriously crossed two dust ruts the wheels squeaking indignantly at the encounter and then with a terrifying expression he gave the steeringgear a final wrench and deposited self and car approximately in front of the happer steps there was a heaving sound a deathrattle followed by a short silence and then the air was rent by a startling whistle sally carrol gazed down sleepily she started to yawn but finding this quite impossible unless she raised her chin from the windowsill changed her mind and continued silently to regard the car whose owner sat brilliantly if perfunctorily at attention as he waited for an answer to his signal after a moment the whistle once more split the dusty air good mawnin with difficulty clark twisted his tall body round and bent a distorted glance on the window taint mawnin sally carrol isnt it sure enough what you doin eatin n apple come on go swimmin want to reckon so how bout hurryin up sure enough sally carrol sighed voluminously and raised herself with profound inertia from the floor where she had been occupied in alternately destroyed parts of a green apple and painting paper dolls for her younger sister she approached a mirror regarded her expression with a pleased and pleasant languor dabbed two spots of rouge on her lips and a grain of powder on her nose and covered her bobbed corncolored hair with a roselittered sunbonnet then she kicked over the painting water said oh damn but let it lay and left the room how you clark she inquired a minute later as she slipped nimbly over the side of the car mighty fine sally carrol where we go swimmin out to walleys pool told marylyn wed call by an get her an joe ewing clark was dark and lean and when on foot was rather inclined to stoop his eyes were ominous and his expression somewhat petulant except when startlingly illuminated by one of his frequent smiles clark had a income just enough to keep himself in ease and his car in gasolene and he had spent the two years since he graduated from georgia tech in dozing round the lazy streets of his home town discussing how he could best invest his capital for an immediate fortune hanging round he found not at all difficult a crowd of little girls had grown up beautifully the amazing sally carrol foremost among them and they enjoyed being swum with and danced with and made love to in the flowerfilled summery evenings and they all liked clark immensely when feminine company palled there were half a dozen other youths who were always just about to do something and meanwhile were quite willing to join him in a few holes of golf or a game of billiards or the consumption of a quart of hard yella licker every once in a while one of these contemporaries made a farewell round of calls before going up to new york or philadelphia or pittsburgh to go into business but mostly they just stayed round in this languid paradise of dreamy skies and firefly evenings and noisy nigger street fairs and especially of gracious softvoiced girls who were brought up on memories instead of money the ford having been excited into a sort of restless resentful life clark and sally carrol rolled and rattled down valley avenue into jefferson street where the dust road became a pavement along opiate millicent place where there were half a dozen prosperous substantial mansions and on into the downtown section driving was perilous here for it was shopping time the population idled casually across the streets and a drove of lowmoaning oxen were being urged along in front of a placid streetcar even the shops seemed only yawning their doors and blinking their windows in the sunshine before retiring into a state of utter and finite coma sally carrol said clark suddenly it a fact that youre engaged she looked at him quickly whered you hear that sure enough you engaged ats a nice question girl told me you were engaged to a yankee you met up in asheville last summer sally carrol sighed never saw such an old town for rumors dont marry a yankee sally carrol we need you round here sally carrol was silent a moment clark she demanded suddenly who on earth shall i marry i offer my services honey you couldnt support a wife she answered cheerfully anyway i know you too well to fall in love with you at doesnt mean you ought to marry a yankee he persisted spose i love him he shook his head you couldnt hed be a lot different from us every way he broke off as he halted the car in front of a rambling dilapidated house marylyn wade and joe ewing appeared in the doorway lo sally carrol hi how youall sally carrol demanded marylyn as they started of again you engaged lawdy whered all this start cant i look at a man thout everybody in town engagin me to him clark stared straight in front of him at a bolt on the clattering windshield sally carrol he said with a curious intensity dont you like us what us down here why clark you know i do i adore all you boys then why you gettin engaged to a yankee clark i dont know im not sure what ill do but well i want to go places and see people i want my mind to grow i want to live where things happen on a big scale what you mean oh clark i love you and i love joe here and ben arrot and youall but youll youll well all be failures yes i dont mean only money failures but just sort of of ineffectual and sad and oh how can i tell you you mean because we stay here in tarleton yes clark and because you like it and never want to change things or think or go ahead he nodded and she reached over and pressed his hand clark she said softly i wouldnt change you for the world youre sweet the way you are the things thatll make you fail ill love always the living in the past the lazy days and nights you have and all your carelessness and generosity but youre goin away yes because i couldnt ever marry you youve a place in my heart no one else ever could have but tied down here id get restless id feel i was wastin myself theres two sides to me you see theres the sleepy old side you love an theres a sort of energy the feeling that makes me do wild things thats the part of me that may be useful somewhere thatll last when im not beautiful any more she broke of with characteristic suddenness and sighed oh sweet cooky as her mood changed half closing her eyes and tipping back her head till it rested on the seatback she let the savory breeze fan her eyes and ripple the fluffy curls of her bobbed hair they were in the country now hurrying between tangled growths of brightgreen coppice and grass and tall trees that sent sprays of foliage to hang a cool welcome over the road here and there they passed a battered negro cabin its oldest whitehaired inhabitant smoking a corncob pipe beside the door and half a dozen scantily clothed pickaninnies parading tattered dolls on the wildgrown grass in front farther out were lazy cottonfields where even the workers seemed intangible shadows lent by the sun to the earth not for toil but to while away some ageold tradition in the golden september fields and round the drowsy picturesqueness over the trees and shacks and muddy rivers flowed the heat never hostile only comforting like a great warm nourishing bosom for the infant earth sally carrol were here poor chiles soun asleep honey you dead at last outa sheer laziness water sally carrol cool water waitin for you her eyes opened sleepily hi she murmured smiling ii in november harry bellamy tall broad and brisk came down from his northern city to spend four days his intention was to settle a matter that had been hanging fire since he and sally carrol had met in asheville north carolina in midsummer the settlement took only a quiet afternoon and an evening in front of a glowing open fire for harry bellamy had everything she wanted and beside she loved him loved him with that side of her she kept especially for loving sally carrol had several rather clearly defined sides on his last afternoon they walked and she found their steps tending halfunconsciously toward one of her favorite haunts the cemetery when it came in sight graywhite and goldengreen under the cheerful late sun she paused irresolute by the iron gate are you mournful by nature harry she asked with a faint smile mournful not i then lets go in here it depresses some folks but i like it they passed through the gateway and followed a path that led through a wavy valley of graves dustygray and mouldy for the fifties quaintly carved with flowers and jars for the seventies ornate and hideous for the nineties with fat marble cherubs lying in sodden sleep on stone pillows and great impossible growths of nameless granite flowers occasionally they saw a kneeling figure with tributary flowers but over most of the graves lay silence and withered leaves with only the fragrance that their own shadowy memories could waken in living minds they reached the top of a hill where they were fronted by a tall round headstone freckled with dark spots of damp and half grown over with vines margery lee she read wasnt she nice she died when she was twentynine dear margery lee she added softly cant you see her harry yes sally carrol he felt a little hand insert itself into his she was dark i think and she always wore her hair with a ribbon in it and gorgeous hoopskirts of alice blue and old rose yes oh she was sweet harry and she was the sort of girl born to stand on a wide pillared porch and welcome folks in i think perhaps a lot of men went away to war meanin to come back to her but maybe none of em ever did he stooped down close to the stone hunting for any record of marriage theres nothing here to show of course not how could there be anything there better than just margery lee and that eloquent date she drew close to him and an unexpected lump came into his throat as her yellow hair brushed his cheek you see how she was dont you harry i see he agreed gently i see through your precious eyes youre beautiful now so i know she must have been silent and close they stood and he could feel her shoulders trembling a little an ambling breeze swept up the hill and stirred the brim of her floppidy hat lets go down there she was pointing to a flat stretch on the other side of the hill where along the green turf were a thousand grayishwhite crosses stretching in endless ordered rows like the stacked arms of a battalion those are the confederate dead said sally carrol simply they walked along and read the inscriptions always only a name and a date sometimes quite indecipherable the last row is the saddest see way over there every cross has just a date on it and the word unknown she looked at him and her eyes brimmed with tears i cant tell you how real it is to me darling if you dont know how you feel about it is beautiful to me no no its not me its them that old time that ive tried to have live in me these were just men unimportant evidently or they wouldnt have been unknown but they died for the most beautiful thing in the world the dead south you see she continued her voice still husky her eyes glistening with tears people have these dreams they fasten onto things and ive always grown up with that dream it was so easy because it was all dead and there werent any disillusions comin to me ive tried in a way to live up to those past standards of noblesse oblige theres just the last remnants of it you know like the roses of an old garden dying all round us streaks of strange courtliness and chivalry in some of these boys an stories i used to hear from a confederate soldier who lived next door and a few old darkies oh harry there was something there was something i couldnt ever make you understand but it was there i understand he assured her again quietly sally carol smiled and dried her eyes on the tip of a handkerchief protruding from his breast pocket you dont feel depressed do you lover even when i cry im happy here and i get a sort of strength from it hand in hand they turned and walked slowly away finding soft grass she drew him down to a seat beside her with their backs against the remnants of a low broken wall wish those three old women would clear out he complained i want to kiss you sally carrol me too they waited impatiently for the three bent figures to move off and then she kissed him until the sky seemed to fade out and all her smiles and tears to vanish in an ecstasy of eternal seconds afterward they walked slowly back together while on the corners twilight played at somnolent blackandwhite checkers with the end of day youll be up about midjanuary he said and youve got to stay a month at least itll be slick theres a winter carnival on and if youve never really seen snow itll be like fairyland to you therell be skating and skiing and tobogganing and sleighriding and all sorts of torchlight parades on snowshoes they havent had one for years so theyre gong to make it a knockout will i be cold harry she asked suddenly you certainly wont you may freeze your nose but you wont be shivery cold its hard and dry you know i guess im a summer child i dont like any cold ive ever seen she broke off and they were both silent for a minute sally carol he said very slowly what do you say to march i say i love you march march harry iii all night in the pullman it was very cold she rang for the porter to ask for another blanket and when he couldnt give her one she tried vainly by squeezing down into the bottom of her berth and doubling back the bedclothes to snatch a few hours sleep she wanted to look her best in the morning she rose at six and sliding uncomfortably into her clothes stumbled up to the diner for a cup of coffee the snow had filtered into the vestibules and covered the door with a slippery coating it was intriguing this cold it crept in everywhere her breath was quite visible and she blew into the air with a naпve enjoyment seated in the diner she stared out the window at white hills and valleys and scattered pines whose every branch was a green platter for a cold feast of snow sometimes a solitary farmhouse would fly by ugly and bleak and lone on the white waste and with each one she had an instant of chill compassion for the souls shut in there waiting for spring as she left the diner and swayed back into the pullman she experienced a surging rush of energy and wondered if she was feeling the bracing air of which harry had spoken this was the north the north her land now then blow ye winds heighho aroving i will go she chanted exultantly to herself whats at inquired the porter politely i said brush me off the long wires of the telegraph poles doubled two tracks ran up beside the train three four came a succession of whiteroofed houses a glimpse of a trolleycar with frosted windows streets more streets the city she stood for a dazed moment in the frosty station before she saw three furbundled figures descending upon her there she is oh sally carrol sally carrol dropped her bag hi a faintly familiar icycold face kissed her and then she was in a group of faces all apparently emitting great clouds of heavy smoke she was shaking hands there were gordon a short eager man of thirty who looked like an amateur knockedabout model for harry and his wife myra a listless lady with flaxen hair under a fur automobile cap almost immediately sally carrol thought of her as vaguely scandinavian a cheerful chauffeur adopted her bag and amid ricochets of halfphrases exclamations and perfunctory listless my dears from myra they swept each other from the station then they were in a sedan bound through a crooked succession of snowy streets where dozens of little boys were hitching sleds behind grocery wagons and automobiles oh cried sally carrol i want to do that can we harry thats for kids but we might it looks like such a circus she said regretfully home was a rambling frame house set on a white lap of snow and there she met a big grayhaired man of whom she approved and a lady who was like an egg and who kissed her these were harrys parents there was a breathless indescribable hour crammed full of selfsentences hot water bacon and eggs and confusion and after that she was alone with harry in the library asking him if she dared smoke it was a large room with a madonna over the fireplace and rows upon rows of books in covers of light gold and dark gold and shiny red all the chairs had little lace squares where ones head should rest the couch was just comfortable the books looked as if they had been read some and sally carrol had an instantaneous vision of the battered old library at home with her fathers huge medical books and the oilpaintings of her three greatuncles and the old couch that had been mended up for fortyfive years and was still luxurious to dream in this room struck her as being neither attractive nor particularly otherwise it was simply a room with a lot of fairly expensive things in it that all looked about fifteen years old what do you think of it up here demanded harry eagerly does it surprise you is it what you expected i mean you are harry she said quietly and reached out her arms to him but after a brief kiss he seemed to extort enthusiasm from her the town i mean do you like it can you feel the pep in the air oh harry she laughed youll have to give me time you cant just fling questions at me she puffed at her cigarette with a sigh of contentment one thing i want to ask you he began rather apologetically you southerners put quite an emphasis on family and all that not that it isnt quite all right but youll find it a little different here i mean youll notice a lot of things thatll seem to you sort of vulgar display at first sally carrol but just remember that this is a threegeneration town everybody has a father and about half of us have grandfathers back of that we dont go of course she murmured our grandfathers you see founded the place and a lot of them had to take some pretty queer jobs while they were doing the founding for instance theres one woman who at present is about the social model for the town well her father was the first public ash man things like that why said sally carol puzzled did you spose i was goin to make remarks about people not at all interrupted harry and im not apologizing for any one either its just that well a southern girl came up here last summer and said some unfortunate things and oh i just thought id tell you sally carrol felt suddenly indignant as though she had been unjustly spanked but harry evidently considered the subject closed for he went on with a great surge of enthusiasm its carnival time you know first in ten years and theres an ice palace theyre building new thats the first theyve had since eightyfive built out of blocks of the clearest ice they could find on a tremendous scale she rose and walking to the window pushed aside the heavy turkish portiиres and looked out oh she cried suddenly theres two little boys makin a snow man harry do you reckon i can go out an help em you dream come here and kiss me she left the window rather reluctantly i dont guess this is a very kissable climate is it i mean it makes you so you dont want to sit round doesnt it were not going to ive got a vacation for the first week youre here and theres a dinnerdance tonight oh harry she confessed subsiding in a heap half in his lap half in the pillows i sure do feel confused i havent got an idea whether ill like it or not an i dont know what people expect or anythin youll have to tell me honey ill tell you he said softly if youll just tell me youre glad to be here glad just awful glad she whispered insinuating herself into his arms in her own peculiar way where you are is home for me harry and as she said this she had the feeling for almost the first time in her life that she was acting a part that night amid the gleaming candles of a dinnerparty where the men seemed to do most of the talking while the girls sat in a haughty and expensive aloofness even harrys presence on her left failed to make her feel at home theyre a goodlooking crowd dont you think he demanded just look round theres spud hubbard tackle at princeton last year and junie morton he and the redhaired fellow next to him were both yale hockey captains junie was in my class why the best athletes in the world come from these states round here this is a mans country i tell you look at john j fishburn whos he asked sally carrol innocently dont you know ive heard the name greatest wheat man in the northwest and one of the greatest financiers in the country she turned suddenly to a voice on her right i guess they forget to introduce us my names roger patton my name is sally carrol happer she said graciously yes i know harry told me you were coming you a relative no im a professor oh she laughed at the university youre from the south arent you yes tarleton georgia she liked him immediately a reddishbrown mustache under watery blue eyes that had something in them that these other eyes lacked some quality of appreciation they exchanged stray sentences through dinner and she made up her mind to see him again after coffee she was introduced to numerous goodlooking young men who danced with conscious precision and seemed to take it for granted that she wanted to talk about nothing except harry heavens she thought they talk as if my being engaged made me older than they are as if id tell their mothers on them in the south an engaged girl even a young married woman expected the same amount of halfaffectionate badinage and flattery that would be accorded a dйbutante but here all that seemed banned one young man after getting well started on the subject of sally carrols eyes and how they had allured him ever since she entered the room went into a violent convulsion when he found she was visiting the bellamys was harrys fiancйe he seemed to feel as though he had made some risquй and inexcusable blunder became immediately formal and left her at the first opportunity she was rather glad when roger patton cut in on her and suggested that they sit out a while well he inquired blinking cheerily hows carmen from the south mighty fine hows hows dangerous dan mcgrew sorry but hes the only northerner i know much about he seemed to enjoy that of course he confessed as a professor of literature im not supposed to have read dangerous dan mcgrew are you a native no im a philadelphian imported from harvard to teach french but ive been here ten years nine years three hundred an sixtyfour days longer than me like it here uhhuh sure do really well why not dont i look as if i were havin a good time i saw you look out the window a minute ago and shiver just my imagination laughed sally carroll im used to havin everythin quiet outside an sometimes i look out an see a flurry of snow an its just as if somethin dead was movin he nodded appreciatively ever been north before spent two julys in asheville north carolina nicelooking crowd arent they suggested patton indicating the swirling floor sally carrol started this had been harrys remark sure are theyre canine what she flushed im sorry that sounded worse than i meant it you see i always think of people as feline or canine irrespective of sex which are you im feline so are you so are most southern men an most of these girls here whats harry harrys canine distinctly all the men ive tonight seem to be canine what does canine imply a certain conscious masculinity as opposed to subtlety reckon so i never analyzed it only i just look at people an say canine or feline right off its right absurd i guess not at all im interested i used to have a theory about these people i think theyre freezing up what well theyre growing like swedes ibsenesque you know very gradually getting gloomy and melancholy its these long winters ever read ibsen she shook her head well you find in his characters a certain brooding rigidity theyre righteous narrow and cheerless without infinite possibilities for great sorrow or joy without smiles or tears exactly thats my theory you see there are thousands of swedes up here they come i imagine because the climate is very much like their own and theres been a gradual mingling therere probably not half a dozen here tonight but weve had four swedish governors am i boring you im mighty interested your future sisterinlaw is half swedish personally i like her but my theory is that swedes react rather badly on us as a whole scandinavians you know have the largest suicide rate in the world why do you live here if its so depressing oh it doesnt get me im pretty well cloistered and i suppose books mean more than people to me anyway but writers all speak about the south being tragic you know spanish seсoritas black hair and daggers an haunting music he shook his head no the northern races are the tragic races they dont indulge in the cheering luxury of tears sally carrol thought of her graveyard she supposed that that was vaguely what she had meant when she said it didnt depress her the italians are about the gayest people in the world but its a dull subject he broke off anyway i want to tell you youre marrying a pretty fine man sally carrol was moved by an impulse of confidence i know im the sort of person who wants to be taken care of after a certain point and i feel sure i will be shall we dance you know he continued as they rose its encouraging to find a girl who knows what shes marrying for ninetenths of them think of it as a sort of walking into a movingpicture sunset she laughed and liked him immensely two hours later on the way home she nestled near harry in the back seat oh harry she whispered its so coold but its warm in here daring girl but outside its cold and oh that howling wind she buried her face deep in his fur coat and trembled involuntarily as his cold lips kissed the tip of her ear iv the first week of her visit passed in a whirl she had her promised tobogganride at the back of an automobile through a chill january twilight swathed in furs she put in a morning tobogganing on the countryclub hill even tried skiing to sail through the air for a glorious moment and then land in a tangled laughing bundle on a soft snowdrift she liked all the winter sports except an afternoon spent snowshoeing over a glaring plain under pale yellow sunshine but she soon realized that these things were for children that she was being humored and that the enjoyment round her was only a reflection of her own at first the bellamy family puzzled her the men were reliable and she liked them to mr bellamy especially with his irongray hair and energetic dignity she took an immediate fancy once she found that he was born in kentucky this made of him a link between the old life and the new but toward the women she felt a definite hostility myra her future sisterinlaw seemed the essence of spiritless conversationality her conversation was so utterly devoid of personality that sally carrol who came from a country where a certain amount of charm and assurance could be taken for granted in the women was inclined to despise her if those women arent beautiful she thought theyre nothing they just fade out when you look at them theyre glorified domestics men are the centre of every mixed group lastly there was mrs bellamy whom sally carrol detested the first days impression of an egg had been confirmed an egg with a cracked veiny voice and such an ungracious dumpiness of carriage that sally carrol felt that if she once fell she would surely scramble in addition mrs bellamy seemed to typify the town in being innately hostile to strangers she called sally carrol sally and could not be persuaded that the double name was anything more than a tedious ridiculous nickname to sally carrol this shortening of her name was presenting her to the public half clothed she loved sally carrol she loathed sally she knew also that harrys mother disapproved of her bobbed hair and she had never dared smoke downstairs after that first day when mrs bellamy had come into the library sniffing violently of all the men she met she preferred roger patton who was a frequent visitor at the house he never again alluded to the ibsenesque tendency of the populace but when he came in one day and found her curled upon the sofa bent over peer gynt he laughed and told her to forget what hed said that it was all rot they had been walking homeward between mounds of highpiled snow and under a sun which sally carrol scarcely recognized they passed a little girl done up in gray wool until she resembled a small teddy bear and sally carrol could not resist a gasp of maternal appreciation look harry what that little girl did you see her face yes why it was red as a little strawberry oh she was cute why your own face is almost as red as that already everybodys healthy here were out in the cold as soon as were old enough to walk wonderful climate she looked at him and had to agree he was mighty healthylooking so was his brother and she had noticed the new red in her own cheeks that very morning suddenly their glances were caught and held and they stared for a moment at the streetcorner ahead of them a man was standing there his knees bent his eyes gazing upward with a tense expression as though he were about to make a leap toward the chilly sky and then they both exploded into a shout of laughter for coming closer they discovered it had been a ludicrous momentary illusion produced by the extreme bagginess of the mans trousers reckon thats one on us she laughed he must be southerner judging by those trousers suggested harry mischievously why harry her surprised look must have irritated him those damn southerners sally carrols eyes flashed dont call em that im sorry dear said harry malignantly apologetic but you know what i think of them theyre sort of sort of degenerates not at all like the old southerners theyve lived so long down there with all the colored people that theyve gotten lazy and shiftless hush your mouth harry she cried angrily theyre not they may be lazy anybody would be in that climate but theyre my best friends an i dont want to hear em criticised in any such sweepin way some of em are the finest men in the world oh i know theyre all right when they come north to college but of all the hangdog illdressed slovenly lot i ever saw a bunch of smalltown southerners are the worst sally carrol was clinching her gloved hands and biting her lip furiously why continued harry if there was one in my class at new haven and we all thought that at last wed found the true type of southern aristocrat but it turned out that he wasnt an aristocrat at all just the son of a northern carpetbagger who owned about all the cotton round mobile a southerner wouldnt talk the way youre talking now she said evenly they havent the energy or the somethin else im sorry sally carrol but ive heard you say yourself that youd never marry thats quite different i told you i wouldnt want to tie my life to any of the boys that are round tarleton now but i never made any sweepin generalities they walked along in silence i probably spread it on a bit thick sally carrol im sorry she nodded but made no answer five minutes later as they stood in the hallway she suddenly threw her arms round him oh harry she cried her eyes brimming with tears lets get married next week im afraid of having fusses like that im afraid harry it wouldnt be that way if we were married but harry being in the wrong was still irritated thatd be idiotic we decided on march the tears in sally carrols eyes faded her expression hardened slightly very well i suppose i shouldnt have said that harry melted dear little nut he cried come and kiss me and lets forget that very night at the end of a vaudeville performance the orchestra played dixie and sally carrol felt something stronger and more enduring than her tears and smiles of the day brim up inside her she leaned forward gripping the arms of her chair until her face grew crimson sort of get you dear whispered harry but she did not hear him to the limited throb of the violins and the inspiring beat of the kettledrums her own old ghosts were marching by and on into the darkness and as fifes whistled and sighed in the low encore they seemed so nearly out of sight that she could have waved goodby away away away down south in dixie away away away down south in dixie v it was a particularly cold night a sudden thaw had nearly cleared the streets the day before but now they were traversed again with a powdery wraith of loose snow that travelled in wavy lines before the feet of the wind and filled the lower air with a fineparticled mist there was no sky only a dark ominous tent that draped in the tops of the streets and was in reality a vast approaching army of snowflakes while over it all chilling away the comfort from the brownandgreen glow of lighted windows and muffling the steady trot of the horse pulling their sleigh interminably washed the north wind it was a dismal town after all she though dismal sometimes at night it had seemed to her as though no one lived here they had all gone long ago leaving lighted houses to be covered in time by tombing heaps of sleet oh if there should be snow on her grave to be beneath great piles of it all winter long where even her headstone would be a light shadow against light shadows her grave a grave that should be flowerstrewn and washed with sun and rain she thought again of those isolated country houses that her train had passed and of the life there the long winter through the ceaseless glare through the windows the crust forming on the soft drifts of snow finally the slow cheerless melting and the harsh spring of which roger patton had told her her spring to lose it forever with its lilacs and the lazy sweetness it stirred in her heart she was laying away that spring afterward she would lay away that sweetness with a gradual insistence the storm broke sally carrol felt a film of flakes melt quickly on her eyelashes and harry reached over a furry arm and drew down her complicated flannel cap then the small flakes came in skirmishline and the horse bent his neck patiently as a transparency of white appeared momentarily on his coat oh hes cold harry she said quickly who the horse oh no he isnt he likes it after another ten minutes they turned a corner and came in sight of their destination on a tall hill outlined in vivid glaring green against the wintry sky stood the ice palace it was three stories in the air with battlements and embrasures and narrow icicled windows and the innumerable electric lights inside made a gorgeous transparency of the great central hall sally carrol clutched harrys hand under the fur robe its beautiful he cried excitedly my golly its beautiful isnt it they havent had one here since eightyfive somehow the notion of there not having been one since eightyfive oppressed her ice was a ghost and this mansion of it was surely peopled by those shades of the eighties with pale faces and blurred snowfilled hair come on dear said harry she followed him out of the sleigh and waited while he hitched the horse a party of four gordon myra roger patton and another girl drew up beside them with a mighty jingle of bells there were quite a crowd already bundled in fur or sheepskin shouting and calling to each other as they moved through the snow which was now so thick that people could scarcely be distinguished a few yards away its a hundred and seventy feet tall harry was saying to a muffled figure beside him as they trudged toward the entrance covers six thousand square yards she caught snatches of conversation one main hall walls twenty to forty inches thick and the ice cave has almost a mile of this canuck who built it they found their way inside and dazed by the magic of the great crystal walls sally carrol found herself repeating over and over two lines from kubla khan it was a miracle of rare device a sunny pleasuredome with caves of ice in the great glittering cavern with the dark shut out she took a seat on a wooded bench and the evenings oppression lifted harry was right it was beautiful and her gaze travelled the smooth surface of the walls the blocks for which had been selected for their purity and dearness to obtain this opalescent translucent effect look here we go oh boy cried harry a band in a far corner struck up hail hail the gangs all here which echoed over to them in wild muddled acoustics and then the lights suddenly went out silence seemed to flow down the icy sides and sweep over them sally carrol could still see her white breath in the darkness and a dim row of pale faces over on the other side the music eased to a sighing complaint and from outside drifted in the fullthroated remnant chant of the marching clubs it grew louder like some pжan of a viking tribe traversing an ancient wild it swelled they were coming nearer then a row of torches appeared and another and another and keeping time with their moccasined feet a long column of graymackinawed figures swept in snowshoes slung at their shoulders torches soaring and flickering as their voice rose along the great walls the gray column ended and another followed the light streaming luridly this time over red toboggan caps and flaming crimson mackinaws and as they entered they took up the refrain then came a long platoon of blue and white of green of white of brown and yellow those white ones are the wacouta club whispered harry eagerly those are the men youve met round at dances the volume of the voices grew the great cavern was a phantasmagoria of torches waving in great banks of fire of colors and the rhythm of softleather steps the leading column turned and halted platoon deploys in front of platoon until the whole procession made a solid flag of flame and then from thousands of voices burst a mighty shout that filled the air like a crash of thunder and sent the torches wavering it was magnificent it was tremendous to sally carol it was the north offering sacrifice on some mighty altar to the gray pagan god of snow as the shout died the band struck up again and there came more singing and then long reverberating cheers by each club she sat very quiet listening while the staccato cries rent the stillness and then she started for there was a volley of explosion and great clouds of smoke went up here and there through the cavern the flashlight photographers at work and the council was over with the band at their head the clubs formed in column once more took up their chant and began to march out come on shouted harry we want to see the labyrinths downstairs before they turn the lights off they all rose and started toward the chute harry and sally carrol in the lead her little mitten buried in his big fur gantlet at the bottom of the chute was a long empty room of ice with the ceiling so low that they had to stoop and their hands were parted before she realized what he intended harry harry had darted down one of the halfdozen glittering passages that opened into the room and was only a vague receding blot against the green shimmer harry she called come on he cried back she looked round the empty chamber the rest of the party had evidently decided to go home were already outside somewhere in the blundering snow she hesitated and then darted in after harry harry she shouted she had reached a turningpoint thirty feet down she heard a faint muffled answer far to the left and with a touch of panic fled toward it she passed another turning two more yawning alleys harry no answer she started to run straight forward and then turned like lightning and sped back the way she had come enveloped in a sudden icy terror she reached a turn was it here took the left and came to what should have been the outlet into the long low room but it was only another glittering passage with darkness at the end she called again but the walls gave back a flat lifeless echo with no reverberations retracing her steps she turned another corner this time following a wide passage it was like the green lane between the parted water of the red sea like a damp vault connecting empty tombs she slipped a little now as she walked for ice had formed on the bottom of her overshoes she had to run her gloves along the halfslippery halfsticky walls to keep her balance harry still no answer the sound she made bounced mockingly down to the end of the passage then on an instant the lights went out and she was in complete darkness she gave a small frightened cry and sank down into a cold little heap on the ice she felt her left knee do something as she fell but she scarcely noticed it as some deep terror far greater than any fear of being lost settled upon her she was alone with this presence that came out of the north the dreary loneliness that rose from icebound whalers in the arctic seas from smokeless trackless wastes where were strewn the whitened bones of adventure it was an icy breath of death it was rolling down low across the land to clutch at her with a furious despairing energy she rose again and started blindly down the darkness she must get out she might be lost in here for days freeze to death and lie embedded in the ice like corpses she had read of kept perfectly preserved until the melting of a glacier harry probably thought she had left with the others he had gone by now no one would know until next day she reached pitifully for the wall forty inches thick they had said forty inches thick on both sides of her along the walls she felt things creeping damp souls that haunted this palace this town this north oh send somebody send somebody she cried aloud clark darrow he would understand or joe ewing she couldnt be left here to wander forever to be frozen heart body and soul this her this sally carrol why she was a happy thing she was a happy little girl she liked warmth and summer and dixie these things were foreign foreign youre not crying something said aloud youll never cry any more your tears would just freeze all tears freeze up here she sprawled full length on the ice oh god she faltered a long single file of minutes went by and with a great weariness she felt her eyes dosing then some one seemed to sit down near her and take her face in warm soft hands she looked up gratefully why its margery lee she crooned softly to herself i knew youd come it really was margery lee and she was just as sally carrol had known she would be with a young white brow and wide welcoming eyes and a hoopskirt of some soft material that was quite comforting to rest on margery lee it was getting darker now and darker all those tombstones ought to be repainted sure enough only that would spoil em of course still you ought to be able to see em then after a succession of moments that went fast and then slow but seemed to be ultimately resolving themselves into a multitude of blurred rays converging toward a paleyellow sun she heard a great cracking noise break her newfound stillness it was the sun it was a light a torch and a torch beyond that and another one and voices a face took flesh below the torch heavy arms raised her and she felt something on her cheek it felt wet some one had seized her and was rubbing her face with snow how ridiculous with snow sally carrol sally carrol it was dangerous dan mcgrew and two other faces she didnt know child child weve been looking for you two hours harrys halfcrazy things came rushing back into place the singing the torches the great shout of the marching clubs she squirmed in pattons arms and gave a long low cry oh i want to get out of here im going back home take me home her voice rose to a scream that sent a chill to harrys heart as he came racing down the next passage tomorrow she cried with delirious unstrained passion tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow vi the wealth of golden sunlight poured a quite enervating yet oddly comforting heat over the house where day long it faced the dusty stretch of road two birds were making a great todo in a cool spot found among the branches of a tree next door and down the street a colored woman was announcing herself melodiously as a purveyor of strawberries it was april afternoon sally carrol happer resting her chin on her arm and her arm on an old windowseat gazed sleepily down over the spangled dust whence the heat waves were rising for the first time this spring she was watching a very ancient ford turn a perilous corner and rattle and groan to a jolting stop at the end of the walk see made no sound and in a minute a strident familiar whistle rent the air sally carrol smiled and blinked good mawnin a head appeared tortuously from under the cartop below taint mawnin sally carrol sure enough she said in affected surprise i guess maybe not what you doin eatin a green peach spect to die any minute clark twisted himself a last impossible notch to get a view of her face waters warm as a kettla steam sally carol wanta go swimmin hate to move sighed sally carol lazily but i reckon so head and shoulders in horace tarbox was thirteen years old in that year he took the examinations for entrance to princeton university and received the grade a excellent in cжsar cicero vergil xenophon homer algebra plane geometry solid geometry and chemistry two years later while george m cohan was composing over there horace was leading the sophomore class by several lengths and digging out theses on the syllogism as an obsolete scholastic form and during the battle of chвteauthierry he was sitting at his desk deciding whether or not to wait until his seventeenth birthday before beginning his series of essays on the pragmatic bias of the new realists after a while some newsboy told him that the war was over and he was glad because it meant that peat brothers publishers would get out their new edition of spinozas improvement of the understanding wars were all very well in their way made young men selfreliant or something but horace felt that he could never forgive the president for allowing a brass band to play under his window the night of the false armistice causing him to leave three important sentences out of his thesis on german idealism the next year he went up to yale to take his degree as master of arts he was seventeen then tall and slender with nearsighted gray eyes and an air of keeping himself utterly detached from the mere words he let drop i never feel as though im talking to him expostulated professor dillinger to a sympathetic colleague he makes me feel as though i were talking to his representative i always expect him to say well ill ask myself and find out and then just as nonchalantly as though horace tarbox had been mr beef the butcher or mr hat the haberdasher life reached in seized him handled him stretched him and unrolled him like a piece of irish lace on a saturdayafternoon bargaincounter to move in the literary fashion i should say that this was all because when way back in colonial days the hardy pioneers had come to a bald place in connecticut and asked of each other now what shall we build here the hardiest one among em had answered lets build a town where theatrical managers can try out musical comedies how afterward they founded yale college there to try the musical comedies on is a story every one knows at any rate one december home james opened at the shubert and all the students encored marcia meadow who sang a song about the blundering blimp in the first act and did a shaky shivery celebrated dance in the last marcia was nineteen she didnt have wings but audiences agreed generally that she didnt need them she was a blonde by natural pigment and she wore no paint on the streets at high noon outside of that she was no better than most women it was charlie moon who promised her five thousand pall malls if she would pay a call on horace tarbox prodigy extraordinary charlie was a senior in sheffield and he and horace were first cousins they liked and pitied each other horace had been particularly busy that night the failure of the frenchman laurier to appreciate the significance of the new realists was preying on his mind in fact his only reaction to a low clearcut rap at his study was to make him speculate as to whether any rap would have actual existence without an ear there to hear it he fancied he was verging more and more toward pragmatism but at that moment though he did not know it he was verging with astounding rapidity toward something quite different the rap sounded three seconds leaked by the rap sounded come in muttered horace automatically he heard the door open and then close but bent over his book in the big armchair before the fire he did not look up leave it on the bed in the other room he said absently leave what on the bed in the other room marcia meadow had to talk her songs but her speaking voice was like byplay on a harp the laundry i cant horace stirred impatiently in his chair why cant you why because i havent got it hm he replied testily suppose you go back and get it across the fire from horace was another easychair he was accustomed to change to it in the course of an evening by way of exercise and variety one chair he called berkeley the other he called hume he suddenly heard a sound as of a rustling diaphanous form sinking into hume he glanced up well said marcia with the sweet smile she used in act two oh so the duke liked my dancing well omar khayyam here i am beside you singing in the wilderness horace stared at her dazedly the momentary suspicion came to him that she existed there only as a phantom of his imagination women didnt come into mens rooms and sink into mens humes women brought laundry and took your seat in the streetcar and married you later on when you were old enough to know fetters this woman had clearly materialized out of hume the very froth of her brown gauzy dress was art emanation from humes leather arm there if he looked long enough he would see hume right through her and then be would be alone again in the room he passed his fist across his eyes he really must take up those trapeze exercises again for petes sake dont look so critical objected the emanation pleasantly i feel as if you were going to wish me away with that patent dome of yours and then there wouldnt be anything left of me except my shadow in your eyes horace coughed coughing was one of his two gestures when he talked you forgot he had a body at all it was like hearing a phonograph record by a singer who had been dead a long time what do you want he asked i want them letters whined marcia melodramatically them letters of mine you bought from my grandsire in horace considered i havent got your letters he said evenly i am only seventeen years old my father was not born until march you evidently have me confused with some one else youre only seventeen repeated march suspiciously only seventeen i knew a girl said marcia reminiscently who went on the tentwentythirty when she was sixteen she was so stuck on herself that she could never say sixteen without putting the only before it we got to calling her only jessie and shes just where she was when she started only worse only is a bad habit omar it sounds like an alibi my name is not omar i know agreed marcia nodding your names horace i just call you omar because you remind me of a smoked cigarette and i havent your letters i doubt if ive ever met your grandfather in fact i think it very improbable that you yourself were alive in marcia stared at him in wonder me why sure i was secondline stuff when the florodora sextette was still in the convent i was the original nurse to mrs sol smiths juliette why omar i was a canteen singer during the war of horaces mind made a sudden successful leap and he grinned did charlie moon put you up to this marcia regarded him inscrutably whos charlie moon small wide nostrils big ears she grew several inches and sniffed im not in the habit of noticing my friends nostrils then it was charlie marcia bit her lip and then yawned oh lets change the subject omar ill pull a snore in this chair in a minute yes replied horace gravely hume has often been considered soporific whos your friend and will he die then of a sudden horace tarbox rose slenderly and began to pace the room with his hands in his pockets this was his other gesture i dont care for this he said as if he were talking to himself at all not that i mind your being here i dont youre quite a pretty little thing but i dont like charlie moons sending you up here am i a laboratory experiment on which the janitors as well as the chemists can make experiments is my intellectual development humorous in any way do i look like the pictures of the little boston boy in the comic magazines has that callow ass moon with his eternal tales about his week in paris any right to no interrupted marcia emphatically and youre a sweet boy come here and kiss me horace stopped quickly in front of her why do you want me to kiss you he asked intently do you just go round kissing people why yes admitted marcia unruffled ats all life is just going round kissing people well replied horace emphatically i must say your ideas are horribly garbled in the first place life isnt just that and in the second place i wont kiss you it might get to be a habit and i cant get rid of habits this year ive got in the habit of lolling in bed until seventhirty marcia nodded understandingly do you ever have any fun she asked what do you mean by fun see here said marcia sternly i like you omar but i wish youd talk as if you had a line on what you were saying you sound as if you were gargling a lot of words in your mouth and lost a bet every time you spilled a few i asked you if you ever had any fun horace shook his head later perhaps he answered you see im a plan im an experiment i dont say that i dont get tired of it sometimes i do yet oh i cant explain but what you and charlie moon call fun wouldnt be fun to me please explain horace stared at her started to speak and then changing his mind resumed his walk after an unsuccessful attempt to determine whether or not he was looking at her marcia smiled at him please explain horace turned if i do will you promise to tell charlie moon that i wasnt in uhuh very well then heres my history i was a why child i wanted to see the wheels go round my father was a young economics professor at princeton he brought me up on the system of answering every question i asked him to the best of his ability my response to that gave him the idea of making an experiment in precocity to aid in the massacre i had ear trouble seven operations between the age of nine and twelve of course this kept me apart from other boys and made me ripe for forcing anyway while my generation was laboring through uncle remus i was honestly enjoying catullus in the original i passed off my college examinations when i was thirteen because i couldnt help it my chief associates were professors and i took a tremendous pride in knowing that i had a fine intelligence for though i was unusually gifted i was not abnormal in other ways when i was sixteen i got tired of being a freak i decided that some one had made a bad mistake still as id gone that far i concluded to finish it up by taking my degree of master of arts my chief interest in life is the study of modern philosophy i am a realist of the school of anton laurier with bergsonian trimmings and ill be eighteen years old in two months thats all whew exclaimed marcia thats enough you do a neat job with the parts of speech satisfied no you havent kissed me its not in my programme demurred horace understand that i dont pretend to be above physical things they have their place but oh dont be so darned reasonable i cant help it i hate these slotmachine people i assure you i began horace oh shut up my own rationality i didnt say anything about your nationality youre amuricun arnt you yes well thats ok with me i got a notion i want to see you do something that isnt in your highbrow programme i want to see if a whatchcallem with brazilian trimmings that thing you said you were can be a little human horace shook his head again i wont kiss you my life is blighted muttered marcia tragically im a beaten woman ill go through life without ever having a kiss with brazilian trimmings she sighed anyways omar will you come and see my show what show im a wicked actress from home james light opera yes at a stretch one of the characters is a brazilian riceplanter that might interest you i saw the bohemian girl once reflected horace aloud i enjoyed it to some extent then youll come well im im oh i know youve got to run down to brazil for the weekend not at all id be delighted to come marcia clapped her hands goodyforyou ill mail you a ticket thursday night why i good thursday night it is she stood up and walking close to him laid both hands on his shoulders i like you omar im sorry i tried to kid you i thought youd be sort of frozen but youre a nice boy he eyed her sardonically im several thousand generations older than you are you carry your age well they shook hands gravely my names marcia meadow she said emphatically member it marcia meadow and i wont tell charlie moon you were in an instant later as she was skimming down the last flight of stairs three at a time she heard a voice call over the upper banister oh say she stopped and looked up made out a vague form leaning over oh say called the prodigy again can you hear me heres your connection omar i hope i havent given you the impression that i consider kissing intrinsically irrational impression why you didnt even give me the kiss never fret so long two doors near her opened curiously at the sound of a feminine voice a tentative cough sounded from above gathering her skirts marcia dived wildly down the last flight and was swallowed up in the murky connecticut air outside upstairs horace paced the floor of his study from time to time he glanced toward berkeley waiting there in suave darkred reputability an open book lying suggestively on his cushions and then he found that his circuit of the floor was bringing him each time nearer to hume there was something about hume that was strangely and inexpressibly different the diaphanous form still seemed hovering near and had horace sat there he would have felt as if he were sitting on a ladys lap and though horace couldnt have named the quality of difference there was such a quality quite intangible to the speculative mind but real nevertheless hume was radiating something that in all the two hundred years of his influence he had never radiated before hume was radiating attar of roses ii on thursday night horace tarbox sat in an aisle seat in the fifth row and witnessed home james oddly enough he found that he was enjoying himself the cynical students near him were annoyed at his audible appreciation of timehonored jokes in the hammerstein tradition but horace was waiting with anxiety for marcia meadow singing her song about a jazzbound blundering blimp when she did appear radiant under a floppity flowerfaced hat a warm glow settled over him and when the song was over he did not join in the storm of applause he felt somewhat numb in the intermission after the second act an usher materialized beside him demanded to know if he were mr tarbox and then handed him a note written in a round adolescent band horace read it in some confusion while the usher lingered with withering patience in the aisle dear mar after the show i always grow an awful hunger if you want to satisfy it for me in the taft grill just communicate your answer to the bigtimber guide that brought this and oblige your friend marcia meadow tell her he coughed tell her that it will be quite all right ill meet her in front of the theatre the bigtimber guide smiled arrogantly i giss she meant for you to come roun t the stage door where where is it ouside tunayulef down ee alley what ouside turn to y left down ee alley the arrogant person withdrew a freshman behind horace snickered then half an hour later sitting in the taft grill opposite the hair that was yellow by natural pigment the prodigy was saying an odd thing do you have to do that dance in the last act he was asking earnestly i mean would they dismiss you if you refused to do it marcia grinned its fun to do it i like to do it and then horace came out with a faux pas i should think youd detest it he remarked succinctly the people behind me were making remarks about your bosom marcia blushed fiery red i cant help that she said quickly the dance to me is only a sort of acrobatic stunt lord its hard enough to do i rub liniment into my shoulders for an hour every night do you have fun while youre on the stage uhhuh sure i got in the habit of having people look at me omar and i like it hm horace sank into a brownish study hows the brazilian trimmings hm repeated horace and then after a pause where does the play go from here new york for how long all depends winter maybe oh coming up to lay eyes on me omar or arent you intrested not as nice here is it as it was up in your room i wish we was there now i feel idiotic in this place confessed horace looking round him nervously too bad we got along pretty well at this he looked suddenly so melancholy that she changed her tone and reaching over patted his hand ever take an actress out to supper before no said horace miserably and i never will again i dont know why i came tonight here under all these lights and with all these people laughing and chattering i feel completely out of my sphere i dont know what to talk to you about well talk about me we talked about you last time very well well my name really is meadow but my first name isnt marcia its veronica im nineteen question how did the girl make her leap to the footlights answer she was born in passaic new jersey and up to a year ago she got the right to breathe by pushing nabiscoes in marcels tearoom in trenton she started going with a guy named robbins a singer in the trent house cabaret and he got her to try a song and dance with him one evening in a month we were filling the supperroom every night then we went to new york with meetmyfriend letters thick as a pile of napkins in two days we landed a job at divinerries and i learned to shimmy from a kid at the palais royal we stayed at divinerries six months until one night peter boyce wendell the columnist ate his milktoast there next morning a poem about marvellous marcia came out in his newspaper and within two days i had three vaudeville offers and a chance at the midnight frolic i wrote wendell a thankyou letter and he printed it in his column said that the style was like carlyles only more rugged and that i ought to quit dancing and do north american literature this got me a coupla more vaudeville offers and a chance as an ingйnue in a regular show i took it and here i am omar when she finished they sat for a moment in silence she draping the last skeins of a welsh rabbit on her fork and waiting for him to speak lets get out of here he said suddenly marcias eyes hardened whats the idea am i making you sick no but i dont like it here i dont like to be sitting here with you without another word marcia signalled for the waiter whats the check she demanded briskly my part the rabbit and the ginger ale horace watched blankly as the waiter figured it see here he began i intended to pay for yours too youre my guest with a halfsigh marcia rose from the table and walked from the room horace his face a document in bewilderment laid a bill down and followed her out up the stairs and into the lobby he overtook her in front of the elevator and they faced each other see here he repeated youre my guest have i said something to offend you after an instant of wonder marcias eyes softened youre a rude fella she said slowly dont you know youre rude i cant help it said horace with a directness she found quite disarming you know i like you you said you didnt like being with me i didnt like it why not fire blazed suddenly from the gray forests of his eyes because i didnt ive formed the habit of liking you ive been thinking of nothing much else for two days well if you wait a minute he interrupted ive got something to say its this in six weeks ill be eighteen years old when im eighteen years old im coming up to new york to see you is there some place in new york where we can go and not have a lot of people in the room sure smiled marcia you can come up to my partment sleep on the couch if you want to i cant sleep on couches he said shortly but i want to talk to you why sure repeated marcia in my partment in his excitement horace put his hands in his pockets all right just so i can see you alone i want to talk to you as we talked up in my room honey boy cried marcia laughing is it that you want to kiss me yes horace almost shouted ill kiss you if you want me to the elevator man was looking at them reproachfully marcia edged toward the grated door ill drop you a postcard she said horaces eyes were quite wild send me a postcard ill come up any time after january first ill be eighteen then and as she stepped into the elevator he coughed enigmatically yet with a vague challenge at the calling and walked quickly away iii he was there again she saw him when she took her first glance at the restless manhattan audience down in the front row with his head bent a bit forward and his gray eyes fixed on her and she knew that to him they were alone together in a world where the highrouged row of ballet faces and the massed whines of the violins were as imperceivable as powder on a marble venus an instinctive defiance rose within her silly boy she said to herself hurriedly and she didnt take her encore what do they expect for a hundred a week perpetual motion she grumbled to herself in the wings whats the trouble marcia guy i dont like down in front during the last act as she waited for her specialty she had an odd attack of stage fright she had never sent horace the promised postcard last night she had pretended not to see him had hurried from the theatre immediately after her dance to pass a sleepless night in her apartment thinking as she had so often in the last month of his pale rather intent face his slim boyish fore the merciless unworldly abstraction that made him charming to her and now that he had come she felt vaguely sorry as though an unwonted responsibility was being forced on her infant prodigy she said aloud what demanded the negro comedian standing beside her nothing just talking about myself on the stage she felt better this was her dance and she always felt that the way she did it wasnt suggestive any more than to some men every pretty girl is suggestive she made it a stunt uptown downtown jelly on a spoon after sundown shiver by the moon he was not watching her now she saw that clearly he was looking very deliberately at a castle on the back drop wearing that expression he had worn in the taft grill a wave of exasperation swept over her he was criticising her thats the vibration that thrills me funny how affection fills me uptown downtown unconquerable revulsion seized her she was suddenly and horribly conscious of her audience as she had never been since her first appearance was that a leer on a pallid face in the front row a droop of disgust on one young girls mouth these shoulders of hers these shoulders shaking were they hers were they real surely shoulders werent made for this then youll see at a glance ill need some funeral ushers with st vitus dance at the end of the world ill the bassoon and two cellos crashed into a final chord she paused and poised a moment on her toes with every muscle tense her young face looking out dully at the audience in what one young girl afterward called such a curious puzzled look and then without bowing rushed from the stage into the dressingroom she sped kicked out of one dress and into another and caught a taxi outside her apartment was very warm small it was with a row of professional pictures and sets of kipling and o henry which she had bought once from a blueeyed agent and read occasionally and there were several chairs which matched but were none of them comfortable and a pinkshaded lamp with blackbirds painted on it and an atmosphere of other stifled pink throughout there were nice things in it nice things unrelentingly hostile to each other offspring of a vicarious impatient taste acting in stray moments the worst was typified by a great picture framed in oak bark of passaic as seen from the erie railroad altogether a frantic oddly extravagant oddly penurious attempt to make a cheerful room marcia knew it was a failure into this room came the prodigy and took her two hands awkwardly i followed you this time he said oh i want you to marry me he said her arms went out to him she kissed his mouth with a sort of passionate wholesomeness there i love you he said she kissed him again and then with a little sigh flung herself into an armchair and half lay there shaken with absurd laughter why you infant prodigy she cried very well call me that if you want to i once told you that i was ten thousand years older than you i am she laughed again i dont like to be disapproved of no ones ever going to disapprove of you again omar she asked why do you want to marry me the prodigy rose and put his hands in his pockets because i love you marcia meadow and then she stopped calling him omar dear boy she said you know i sort of love you theres something about you i cant tell what that just puts my heart through the wringer every time im round you but honey she paused but what but lots of things but youre only just eighteen and im nearly twenty nonsense he interrupted put it this way that im in my nineteenth year and youre nineteen that makes us pretty close without counting that other ten thousand years i mentioned marcia laughed but there are some more buts your people my people exclaimed the prodigy ferociously my people tried to make a monstrosity out of me his face grew quite crimson at the enormity of what he was going to say my people can go way back and sit down my heavens cried marcia in alarm all that on tacks i suppose tacks yes he agreed wildly on anything the more i think of how they allowed me to become a little driedup mummy what makes you thank youre that asked marcia quietly me yes every person ive met on the streets since i met you has made me jealous because they knew what love was before i did i used to call it the sex impulse heavens theres more buts said marcia what are they how could we live ill make a living youre in college do you think i care anything about taking a master of arts degree you want to be master of me hey yes what i mean no marcia laughed and crossing swiftly over sat in his lap he put his arm round her wildly and implanted the vestige of a kiss somewhere near her neck theres something white about you mused marcia but it doesnt sound very logical oh dont be so darned reasonable i cant help it said marcia i hate these slotmachine people but we oh shut up and as marcia couldnt talk through her ears she had to iv horace and marcia were married early in february the sensation in academic circles both at yale and princeton was tremendous horace tarbox who at fourteen had been played up in the sunday magazines sections of metropolitan newspapers was throwing over his career his chance of being a world authority on american philosophy by marrying a chorus girl they made marcia a chorus girl but like all modern stories it was a fourandahalfday wonder they took a flat in harlem after two weeks search during which his idea of the value of academic knowledge faded unmercifully horace took a position as clerk with a south american export company some one had told him that exporting was the coming thing marcia was to stay in her show for a few months anyway until he got on his feet he was getting a hundred and twentyfive to start with and though of course they told him it was only a question of months until he would be earning double that marcia refused even to consider giving up the hundred and fifty a week that she was getting at the time well call ourselves head and shoulders dear she said softly and the shouldersll have to keep shaking a little longer until the old head gets started i hate it he objected gloomily well she replied emphatically your salary wouldnt keep us in a tenement dont think i want to be public i dont i want to be yours but id be a halfwit to sit in one room and count the sunflowers on the wallpaper while i waited for you when you pull down three hundred a month ill quit and much as it hurt his pride horace had to admit that hers was the wiser course march mellowed into april may read a gorgeous riot act to the parks and waters of manhatten and they were very happy horace who had no habits whatsoever he had never had time to form any proved the most adaptable of husbands and as marcia entirely lacked opinions on the subjects that engrossed him there were very few jottings and bumping their minds moved in different spheres marcia acted as practical factotum and horace lived either in his old world of abstract ideas or in a sort of triumphantly earthy worship and adoration of his wife she was a continual source of astonishment to him the freshness and originality of her mind her dynamic clearheaded energy and her unfailing good humor and marcias coworkers in the nineoclock show whither she had transferred her talents were impressed with her tremendous pride in her husbands mental powers horace they knew only as a very slim tightlipped and immaturelooking young man who waited every night to take her home horace said marcia one evening when she met him as usual at eleven you looked like a ghost standing there against the street lights you losing weight he shook his head vaguely i dont know they raised me to a hundred and thirtyfive dollars today and i dont care said marcia severely youre killing yourself working at night you read those big books on economy economics corrected horace well you read em every night long after im asleep and youre getting all stooped over like you were before we were married but marcia ive got to no you havent dear i guess im running this shop for the present and i wont let my fella ruin his health and eyes you got to get some exercise i do every morning i oh i know but those dumbbells of yours wouldnt give a consumptive two degrees of fever i mean real exercise youve got to join a gymnasium member you told me you were such a trick gymnast once that they tried to get you out for the team in college and they couldnt because you had a standing date with herb spencer i used to enjoy it mused horace but it would take up too much time now all right said marcia ill make a bargain with you you join a gym and ill read one of those books from the brown row of em pepys diary why that ought to be enjoyable hes very light not for me he isnt itll be like digesting plate glass but you been telling me how much itd broaden my lookout well you go to a gym three nights a week and ill take one big dose of sammy horace hesitated well come on now you do some giant swings for me and ill chase some culture for you so horace finally consented and all through a baking summer he spent three and sometimes four evenings a week experimenting on the trapeze in skippers gymnasium and in august he admitted to marcia that it made him capable of more mental work during the day mens sana in corpore sano he said dont believe in it replied marcia i tried one of those patent medicines once and theyre all bunk you stick to gymnastics one night in early september while he was going through one of his contortions on the rings in the nearly deserted room he was addressed by a meditative fat man whom he had noticed watching him for several nights say lad do that stunt you were doin last night horace grinned at him from his perch i invented it he said i got the idea from the fourth proposition of euclid what circus he with hes dead well he must of broke his neck doin that stunt i set here last night thinkin sure you was goin to break yours like this said horace and swinging onto the trapeze he did his stunt dont it kill your neck an shoulder muscles it did at first but inside of a week i wrote the quod erat demonstrandum on it hm horace swung idly on the trapeze ever think of takin it up professionally asked the fat man not i good money in it if youre willin to do stunts like at an can get away with it heres another chirped horace eagerly and the fat mans mouth dropped suddenly agape as he watched this pinkjerseyed prometheus again defy the gods and isaac newton the night following this encounter horace got home from work to find a rather pale marcia stretched out on the sofa waiting for him i fainted twice today she began without preliminaries what yep you see babys due in four months now doctor says i ought to have quit dancing two weeks ago horace sat down and thought it over im glad of course he said pensively i mean glad that were going to have a baby but this means a lot of expense ive got two hundred and fifty in the bank said marcia hopefully and two weeks pay coming horace computed quickly inducing my salary thatll give us nearly fourteen hundred for the next six months marcia looked blue that all course i can get a job singing somewhere this month and i can go to work again in march of course nothing said horace gruffly youll stay right here lets see now therell be doctors bills and a nurse besides the maid weve got to have some more money well said marcia wearily i dont know where its coming from its up to the old head now shoulders is out of business horace rose and pulled on his coat where are you going ive got an idea he answered ill be right back ten minutes later as he headed down the street toward skippers gymnasium he felt a placid wonder quite unmixed with humor at what he was going to do how he would have gaped at himself a year before how every one would have gaped but when you opened your door at the rap of life you let in many things the gymnasium was brightly lit and when his eyes became accustomed to the glare he found the meditative fat man seated on a pile of canvas mats smoking a big cigar say began horace directly were you in earnest last night when you said i could make money on my trapeze stunts why yes said the fat man in surprise well ive been thinking it over and i believe id like to try it i could work at night and on saturday afternoons and regularly if the pay is high enough the fat men looked at his watch well he said charlie paulsons the man to see hell book you inside of four days once he sees you work out he wont be in now but ill get hold of him for tomorrow night the fat man was as good as his word charlie paulson arrived next night and put in a wondrous hour watching the prodigy swap through the air in amazing parabolas and on the night following he brought two age men with him who looked as though they had been born smoking black cigars and talking about money in low passionate voices then on the succeeding saturday horace tarboxs torso made its first professional appearance in a gymnastic exhibition at the coleman street gardens but though the audience numbered nearly five thousand people horace felt no nervousness from his childhood he had read papers to audiences learned that trick of detaching himself marcia he said cheerfully later that same night i think were out of the woods paulson thinks he can get me an opening at the hippodrome and that means an allwinter engagement the hippodrome you know is a big yes i believe ive heard of it interrupted marcia but i want to know about this stunt youre doing it isnt any spectacular suicide is it its nothing said horace quietly but if you can think of an nicer way of a man killing himself than taking a risk for you why thats the way i want to die marcia reached up and wound both arms tightly round his neck kiss me she whispered and call me dear heart i love to hear you say dear heart and bring me a book to read tomorrow no more sam pepys but something trick and trashy ive been wild for something to do all day i felt like writing letters but i didnt have anybody to write to write to me said horace ill read them i wish i could breathed marcia if i knew words enough i could write you the longest loveletter in the world and never get tired but after two more months marcia grew very tired indeed and for a row of nights it was a very anxious wearylooking young athlete who walked out before the hippodrome crowd then there were two days when his place was taken by a young man who wore pale blue instead of white and got very little applause but after the two days horace appeared again and those who sat close to the stage remarked an expression of beatific happiness on that young acrobats face even when he was twisting breathlessly in the air an the middle of his amazing and original shoulder swing after that performance he laughed at the elevator man and dashed up the stairs to the flat five steps at a time and then tiptoed very carefully into a quiet room marcia he whispered hello she smiled up at him wanly horace theres something i want you to do look in my top bureau drawer and youll find a big stack of paper its a book sort of horace i wrote it down in these last three months while ive been laid up i wish youd take it to that peter boyce wendell who put my letter in his paper he could tell you whether itd be a good book i wrote it just the way i talk just the way i wrote that letter to him its just a story about a lot of things that happened to me will you take it to him horace yes darling he leaned over the bed until his head was beside her on the pillow and began stroking back her yellow hair dearest marcia he said softly no she murmured call me what i told you to call me dear heart he whispered passionately dearest heart whatll we call her they rested a minute in happy drowsy content while horace considered well call her marcia hume tarbox he said at length why the hume because hes the fellow who first introduced us that so she murmured sleepily surprised i thought his name was moon her eyes dosed and after a moment the slow lengthening surge of the bedclothes over her breast showed that she was asleep horace tiptoed over to the bureau and opening the top drawer found a heap of closely scrawled leadsmeared pages he looked at the first sheet sandra pepys syncopated by marcia tarbox he smiled so samuel pepys had made an impression on her after all he turned a page and began to read his smile deepened he read on half an hour passed and he became aware that marcia had waked and was watching him from the bed honey came in a whisper what marcia do you like it horace coughed i seem to be reading on its bright take it to peter boyce wendell tell him you got the highest marks in princeton once and that you ought to know when a books good tell him this ones a world beater all right marcia horace said gently her eyes closed again and horace crossing over kissed her forehead stood there for a moment with a look of tender pity then he left the room all that night the sprawly writing on the pages the constant mistakes in spelling and grammar and the weird punctuation danced before his eyes he woke several times in the night each time full of a welling chaotic sympathy for this desire of marcias soul to express itself in words to him there was something infinitely pathetic about it and for the first time in months he began to turn over in his mind his own halfforgotten dreams he had meant to write a series of books to popularize the new realism as schopenhauer had popularized pessimism and william james pragmatism but life hadnt come that way life took hold of people and forced them into flying rings he laughed to think of that rap at his door the diaphanous shadow in hume marcias threatened kiss and its still me he said aloud in wonder as he lay awake in the darkness im the man who sat in berkeley with temerity to wonder if that rap would have had actual existence had my ear not been there to hear it im still that man i could be electrocuted for the crimes he committed poor gauzy souls trying to express ourselves in something tangible marcia with her written book i with my unwritten ones trying to choose our mediums and then taking what we get and being glad v sandra pepys syncopated with an introduction by peter boyce wendell the columnist appeared serially in jordans magazine and came out in book form in march from its first published instalment it attracted attention far and wide a trite enough subject a girl from a small new jersey town coming to new york to go on the stage treated simply with a peculiar vividness of phrasing and a haunting undertone of sadness in the very inadequacy of its vocabulary it made an irresistible appeal peter boyce wendell who happened at that time to be advocating the enrichment of the american language by the immediate adoption of expressive vernacular words stood as its sponsor and thundered his indorsement over the placid bromides of the conventional reviewers marcia received three hundred dollars an instalment for the serial publication which came at an opportune time for though horaces monthly salary at the hippodrome was now more than marcias had ever been young marcia was emitting shrill cries which they interpreted as a demand for country air so early april found them installed in a bungalow in westchester county with a place for a lawn a place for a garage and a place for everything including a soundproof impregnable study in which marcia faithfully promised mr jordan she would shut herself up when her daughters demands began to be abated and compose immortally illiterate literature its not half bad thought horace one night as he was on his way from the station to his house he was considering several prospects that had opened up a four months vaudeville offer in five figures a chance to go back to princeton in charge of all gymnasium work odd he had once intended to go back there in charge of all philosophic work and now he had not even been stirred by the arrival in new york of anton laurier his old idol the gravel crunched raucously under his heel he saw the lights of his sittingroom gleaming and noticed a big car standing in the drive probably mr jordan again come to persuade marcia to settle down to work she had heard the sound of his approach and her form was silhouetted against the lighted door as she came out to meet him theres some frenchman here she whispered nervously i cant pronounce his name but he sounds awful deep youll have to jaw with him what frenchman you cant prove it by me he drove up an hour ago with mr jordan and said he wanted to meet sandra pepys and all that sort of thing two men rose from chairs as they went inside hello tarbox said jordan ive just been bringing together two celebrities ive brought msieur laurier out with me msieur laurier let me present mr tarbox mrs tarboxs husband not anton laurier exclaimed horace but yes i must come i have to come i have read the book of madame and i have been charmed he fumbled in his pocket ah i have read of you too in this newspaper which i read today it has your name he finally produced a clipping from a magazine read it he said eagerly it has about you too horaces eye skipped down the page a distinct contribution to american dialect literature it said no attempt at literary tone the book derives its very quality from this fact as did huckleberry finn horaces eyes caught a passage lower down he became suddenly aghast read on hurriedly marcia tarboxs connection with the stage is not only as a spectator but as the wife of a performer she was married last year to horace tarbox who every evening delights the children at the hippodrome with his wondrous flying performance it is said that the young couple have dubbed themselves head and shoulders referring doubtless to the fact that mrs tarbox supplies the literary and mental qualities while the supple and agile shoulder of her husband contribute their share to the family fortunes mrs tarbox seems to merit that muchabused title prodigy only twenty horace stopped reading and with a very odd expression in his eyes gazed intently at anton laurier i want to advise you he began hoarsely what about raps dont answer them let them alone have a padded door the cutglass bowl there was a rough stone age and a smooth stone age and a bronze age and many years afterward a cutglass age in the cutglass age when young ladies had persuaded young men with long curly mustaches to marry them they sat down several months afterward and wrote thankyou notes for all sorts of cutglass presents punchbowls fingerbowls dinnerglasses wineglasses icecream dishes bonbon dishes decanters and vases for though cut glass was nothing new in the nineties it was then especially busy reflecting the dazzling light of fashion from the back bay to the fastnesses of the middle west after the wedding the punchbowls were arranged in the sideboard with the big bowl in the centre the glasses were set up in the chinacloset the candlesticks were put at both ends of things and then the struggle for existence began the bonbon dish lost its little handle and became a pintray upstairs a promenading cat knocked the little bowl off the sideboard and the hired girl chipped the middlesized one with the sugardish then the wineglasses succumbed to leg fractures and even the dinnerglasses disappeared one by one like the ten little niggers the last one ending up scarred and maimed as a toothbrush holder among other shabby genteels on the bathroom shelf but by the time all this had happened the cutglass age was over anyway it was well past its first glory on the day the curious mrs roger fairboalt came to see the beautiful mrs harold piper my dear said the curious mrs roger fairboalt i love your house i think its quite artistic im so glad said the beautiful mrs harold piper lights appearing in her young dark eyes and you must come often im almost always alone in the afternoon mrs fairboalt would have liked to remark that she didnt believe this at all and couldnt see how shed be expected to it was all over town that mr freddy gedney had been dropping in on mrs piper five afternoons a week for the past six months mrs fairboalt was at that ripe age where she distrusted all beautiful women i love the diningroom most she said all that marvellous china and that huge cutglass bowl mrs piper laughed so prettily that mrs fairboalts lingering reservations about the freddy gedney story quite vanished oh that big bowl mrs pipers mouth forming the words was a vivid rose petal theres a story about that bowl oh you remember young carleton canby well he was very attentive at one time and the night i told him i was going to marry harold seven years ago in ninetytwo he drew himself way up and said evylyn im going to give a present thats as hard as you are and as beautiful and as empty and as easy to see through he frightened me a little his eyes were so black i thought he was going to deed me a haunted house or something that would explode when you opened it that bowl came and of course its beautiful its diameter or circumference or something is two and a half feet or perhaps its three and a half anyway the sideboard is really too small for it it sticks way out my dear wasnt that odd and he left town about then didnt he mrs fairboalt was scribbling italicized notes on her memory hard beautiful empty and easy to see through yes he went west or south or somewhere answered mrs piper radiating that divine vagueness that helps to lift beauty out of time mrs fairboalt drew on her gloves approving the effect of largeness given by the open sweep from the spacious musicroom through the library disclosing a part of the diningroom beyond it was really the nicest smaller house in town and mrs piper had talked of moving to a larger one on devereaux avenue harold piper must be coining money as she turned into the sidewalk under the gathering autumn dusk she assumed that disapproving faintly unpleasant expression that almost all successful women of forty wear on the street if i were harold piper she thought id spend a little less time on business and a little more time at home some friend should speak to him but if mrs fairboalt had considered it a successful afternoon she would have named it a triumph had she waited two minutes longer for while she was still a black receding figure a hundred yards down the street a very goodlooking distraught young man turned up the walk to the piper house mrs piper answered the doorbell herself and with a rather dismayed expression led him quickly into the library i had to see you he began wildly your note played the devil with me did harold frighten you into this she shook her head im through fred she said slowly and her lips had never looked to him so much like tearings from a rose he came home last night sick with it jessie pipers sense of duty was to much for her so she went down to his office and told him he was hurt and oh i cant help seeing it his way fred he says weve been club gossip all summer and he didnt know it and now he understands snatches of conversation hes caught and veiled hints people have dropped about me hes mighty angry fred and he loves me and i love him rather gedney nodded slowly and half closed his eyes yes he said yes my troubles like yours i can see other peoples points of view too plainly his gray eyes met her dark ones frankly the blessed things over my god evylyn ive been sitting down at the office all day looking at the outside of your letter and looking at it and looking at it youve got to go fred she said steadily and the slight emphasis of hurry in her voice was a new thrust for him i gave him my word of honor i wouldnt see you i know just how far i can go with harold and being here with you this evening is one of the things i cant do they were still standing and as she spoke she made a little movement toward the door gedney looked at her miserably trying here at the end to treasure up a last picture of her and then suddenly both of them were stiffened into marble at the sound of steps on the walk outside instantly her arm reached out grasping the lapel of his coat half urged half swung him through the big door into the dark diningroom ill make him go upstairs she whispered close to his ear dont move till you hear him on the stairs then go out the front way then he was alone listening as she greeted her husband in the hall harold piper was thirtysix nine years older than his wife he was handsome with marginal notes these being eyes that were too close together and a certain woodenness when his face was in repose his attitude toward this gedney matter was typical of all his attitudes he had told evylyn that he considered the subject closed and would never reproach her nor allude to it in any form and he told himself that this was rather a big way of looking at it that she was not a little impressed yet like all men who are preoccupied with their own broadness he was exceptionally narrow he greeted evylyn with emphasized cordiality this evening youll have to hurry and dress harold she said eagerly were going to the bronsons he nodded it doesnt take me long to dress dear and his words trailing off he walked on into the library evylyns heart clattered loudly harold she began with a little catch in her voice and followed him in he was lighting a cigarette youll have to hurry harold she finished standing in the doorway why he asked a trifle impatiently youre not dressed yourself yet evie he stretched out in a morris chair and unfolded a newspaper with a sinking sensation evylyn saw that this meant at least ten minutes and gedney was standing breathless in the next room supposing harold decided that before be went upstairs he wanted a drink from the decanter on the sideboard then it occurred to her to forestall this contingency by bringing him the decanter and a glass she dreaded calling his attention to the diningroom in any way but she couldnt risk the other chance but at the same moment harold rose and throwing his paper down came toward her evie dear he said bending and putting his arms about her i hope youre not thinking about last night she moved close to him trembling i know he continued it was just an imprudent friendship on your part we all make mistakes evylyn hardly heard him she was wondering if by sheer clinging to him she could draw him out and up the stairs she thought of playing sick asking to be carried up unfortunately she knew he would lay her on the couch and bring her whiskey suddenly her nervous tension moved up a last impossible notch she had heard a very faint but quite unmistakable creak from the floor of the dining room fred was trying to get out the back way then her heart took a flying leap as a hollow ringing note like a gong echoed and reechoed through the house gedneys arm had struck the big cutglass bowl whats that cried harold whos there she clung to him but he broke away and the room seemed to crash about her ears she heard the pantrydoor swing open a scuffle the rattle of a tin pan and in wild despair she rushed into the kitchen and pulled up the gas her husbands arm slowly unwound from gedneys neck and he stood there very still first in amazement then with pain dawning in his face my golly he said in bewilderment and then repeated my golly he turned as if to jump again at gedney stopped his muscles visibly relaxed and he gave a bitter little laugh you people you people evylyns arms were around him and her eyes were pleading with him frantically but he pushed her away and sank dazed into a kitchen chair his face like porcelain youve been doing things to me evylyn why you little devil you little devil she had never felt so sorry for him she had never loved him so much it wasnt her fault said gedney rather humbly i just came but piper shook his head and his expression when he stared up was as if some physical accident had jarred his mind into a temporary inability to function his eyes grown suddenly pitiful struck a deep unsounded chord in evylyn and simultaneously a furious anger surged in her she felt her eyelids burning she stamped her foot violently her hands scurried nervously over the table as if searching for a weapon and then she flung herself wildly at gedney get out she screamed dark eves blazing little fists beating helplessly on his outstretched arm you did this get out of here get out get out get out ii concerning mrs harold piper at thirtyfive opinion was divided women said she was still handsome men said she was pretty no longer and this was probably because the qualities in her beauty that women had feared and men had followed had vanished her eyes were still as large and as dark and as sad but the mystery had departed their sadness was no longer eternal only human and she had developed a habit when she was startled or annoyed of twitching her brows together and blinking several times her mouth also had lost the red had receded and the faint downturning of its corners when she smiled that had added to the sadness of the eyes and been vaguely mocking and beautiful was quite gone when she smiled now the corners of her lips turned up back in the days when she revelled in her own beauty evylyn had enjoyed that smile of hers she had accentuated it when she stopped accentuating it it faded out and the last of her mystery with it evylyn had ceased accentuating her smile within a month after the freddy gedney affair externally things had gone an very much as they had before but in those few minutes during which she had discovered how much she loved her husband evylyn had realized how indelibly she had hurt him for a month she struggled against aching silences wild reproaches and accusations she pled with him made quiet pitiful little love to him and he laughed at her bitterly and then she too slipped gradually into silence and a shadowy impenetrable barrier dropped between them the surge of love that had risen in her she lavished on donald her little boy realizing him almost wonderingly as a part of her life the next year a piling up of mutual interests and responsibilities and some stray flicker from the past brought husband and wife together again but after a rather pathetic flood of passion evylyn realized that her great opportunity was gone there simply wasnt anything left she might have been youth and love for both but that time of silence had slowly dried up the springs of affection and her own desire to drink again of them was dead she began for the first time to seek women friends to prefer books she had read before to sew a little where she could watch her two children to whom she was devoted she worried about little things if she saw crumbs on the dinnertable her mind drifted off the conversation she was receding gradually into middle age her thirtyfifth birthday had been an exceptionally busy one for they were entertaining on short notice that night as she stood in her bedroom window in the late afternoon she discovered that she was quite tired ten years before she would have lain down and slept but now she had a feeling that things needed watching maids were cleaning downstairs bricаbrac was all over the floor and there were sure to be grocerymen that had to be talked to imperatively and then there was a letter to write donald who was fourteen and in his first year away at school she had nearly decided to lie down nevertheless when she heard a sudden familiar signal from little julie downstairs she compressed her lips her brows twitched together and she blinked julie she called ahhhow prolonged julie plaintively then the voice of hilda the second maid floated up the stairs she cut herself a little mis piper evylyn flew to her sewingbasket rummaged until she found a torn handkerchief and hurried downstairs in a moment julie was crying in her arms as she searched for the cut faint disparaging evidences of which appeared on julies dress my thuumb explained julie ohhhh turts it was the bowl here the he one said hilda apologetically it was waitin on the floor while i polished the sideboard and julie come along an went to foolin with it she yust scratch herself evylyn frowned heavily at hilda and twisting julie decisively in her lap began tearing strips of the handkerchief now lets see it dear julie held it up and evelyn pounced there julie surveyed her swathed thumb doubtfully she crooked it it waggled a pleased interested look appeared in her tearstained face she sniffled and waggled it again you precious cried evylyn and kissed her but before she left the room she levelled another frown at hilda careless servants all that way nowadays if she could get a good irishwoman but you couldnt any more and these swedes at five oclock harold arrived and coming up to her room threatened in a suspiciously jovial tone to kiss her thirtyfive times for her birthday evylyn resisted youve been drinking she said shortly and then added qualitatively a little you know i loathe the smell of it evie he said after a pause seating himself in a chair by the window i can tell you something now i guess youve known things havent beep going quite right downtown she was standing at the window combing her hair but at these words she turned and looked at him how do you mean youve always said there was room for more than one wholesale hardware house in town her voice expressed some alarm there was said harold significantly but this clarence ahearn is a smart man i was surprised when you said he was coming to dinner evie he went on with another slap at his knee after january first the clarence ahearn company becomes the ahearn piper company and piper brothers as a company ceases to exist evylyn was startled the sound of his name in second place was somehow hostile to her still he appeared jubilant i dont understand harold well evie ahearn has been fooling around with marx if those two had combined wed have been the little fellow struggling along picking up smaller orders hanging back on risks its a question of capital evie and ahearn and marx would have had the business just like ahearn and piper is going to now he paused and coughed and a little cloud of whiskey floated up to her nostrils tell you the truth evie ive suspected that ahearns wife had something to do with it ambitious little lady im told guess she knew the marxes couldnt help her much here is she common asked evie never met her im sure but i dont doubt it clarence ahearns names been up at the country club five months no action taken he waved his hand disparagingly ahearn and i had lunch together today and just about clinched it so i thought itd be nice to have him and his wife up tonight just have nine mostly family after all its a big thing for me and of course well have to see something of them evie yes said evie thoughtfully i suppose we will evylyn was not disturbed over the social end of it but the idea of piper brothers becoming the ahearn piper company startled her it seemed like going down in the world half an hour later as she began to dress for dinner she heard his voice from downstairs oh evie come down she went out into the hall and called over the banister what is it i want you to help me make some of that punch before dinner hurriedly rehooking her dress she descended the stairs and found him grouping the essentials on the diningroom table she went to the sideboard and lifting one of the bowls carried it over oh no he protested lets use the big one therell be ahearn and his wife and you and i and milton thats five and tom and jessie thats seven and your sister and joe ambler thats nine you dont know how quick that stuff goes when you make it well use this bowl she insisted itll hold plenty you know how tom is tom lowrie husband to jessie harolds first cousin was rather inclined to finish anything in a liquid way that he began harold shook his head dont be foolish that one holds only about three quarts and theres nine of us and the servantsll want some and it isnt strong punch its so much more cheerful to have a lot evie we dont have to drink all of it i say the small one again he shook his head obstinately no be reasonable i am reasonable she said shortly i dont want any drunken men in the house who said you did then use the small bowl now evie he grasped the smaller bowl to lift it back instantly her hands were on it holding it down there was a momentary struggle and then with a little exasperated grunt he raised his side slipped it from her fingers and carried it to the sideboard she looked at him and tried to make her expression contemptuous but he only laughed acknowledging her defeat but disclaiming all future interest in the punch she left the room iii at seventhirty her cheeks glowing and her highpiled hair gleaming with a suspicion of brilliantine evylyn descended the stairs mrs ahearn a little woman concealing a slight nervousness under red hair and an extreme empire gown greeted her volubly evelyn disliked her on the spot but the husband she rather approved of he had keen blue eyes and a natural gift of pleasing people that might have made him socially had he not so obviously committed the blunder of marrying too early in his career im glad to know pipers wife he said simply it looks as though your husband and i are going to see a lot of each other in the future she bowed smiled graciously and turned to greet the others milton piper harolds quiet unassertive younger brother the two lowries jessie and tom irene her own unmarried sister and finally joe ambler a confirmed bachelor and irenes perennial beau harold led the way into dinner were having a punch evening he announced jovially evylyn saw that he had already sampled his concoction so there wont be any cocktails except the punch its m wifes greatest achievement mrs ahearn shell give you the recipe if you want it but owing to a slight he caught his wifes eye and paused to a slight indisposition im responsible for this batch heres how all through dinner there was punch and evylyn noticing that ahearn and milton piper and all the women were shaking their heads negatively at the maid knew she bad been right about the bowl it was still half full she resolved to caution harold directly afterward but when the women left the table mrs ahearn cornered her and she found herself talking cities and dressmakers with a polite show of interest weve moved around a lot chattered mrs ahearn her red head nodding violently oh yes weve never stayed so long in a town before but i do hope were here for good i like it here dont you well you see ive always lived here so naturally oh thats true said mrs ahearn and laughed clarence always used to tell me he had to have a wife he could come home to and say well were going to chicago tomorrow to live so pack up i got so i never expected to live anywhere she laughed her little laugh again evylyn suspected that it was her society laugh your husband is a very able man i imagine oh yes mrs ahearn assured her eagerly hes brainy clarence is ideas and enthusiasm you know finds out what he wants and then goes and gets it evylyn nodded she was wondering if the men were still drinking punch back in the diningroom mrs ahearns history kept unfolding jerkily but evylyn had ceased to listen the first odor of massed cigars began to drift in it wasnt really a large house she reflected on an evening like this the library sometimes grew blue with smoke and next day one had to leave the windows open for hours to air the heavy staleness out of the curtains perhaps this partnership might she began to speculate on a new house mrs ahearns voice drifted in on her i really would like the recipe if you have it written down somewhere then there was a sound of chairs in the diningroom and the men strolled in evylyn saw at once that her worst fears were realized harolds face was flushed and his words ran together at the ends of sentences while tom lowrie lurched when he walked and narrowly missed irenes lap when he tried to sink onto the couch beside her he sat there blinking dazedly at the company evylyn found herself blinking back at him but she saw no humor in it joe ambler was smiling contentedly and purring on his cigar only ahearn and milton piper seemed unaffected its a pretty fine town ahearn said ambler youll find that ive found it so said ahearn pleasantly you find it more ahearn said harold nodding emphatically f ive anthin do th it he soared into a eulogy of the city and evylyn wondered uncomfortably if it bored every one as it bored her apparently not they were all listening attentively evylyn broke in at the first gap whereve you been living mr ahearn she asked interestedly then she remembered that mrs ahearn had told her but it didnt matter harold mustnt talk so much he was such an ass when hed been drinking but he plopped directly back in tell you ahearn firs you wanna get a house up here on the hill get stearne house or ridgeway house wanna have it so people say theres ahearn house solid you know thas effec it gives evylyn flushed this didnt sound right at all still ahearn didnt seem to notice anything amiss only nodded gravely have you been looking but her words trailed off unheard as harolds voice boomed on get house thas start then you get know people snobbish town first toward outsider but not long after know you people like you he indicated ahearn and his wife with a sweeping gesture all right cordial as anthin once get by first barrerbarbarrer he swallowed and then said barrier repeated it masterfully evylyn looked appealingly at her brotherinlaw but before he could intercede a thick mumble had come crowding out of tom lowrie hindered by the dead cigar which he gripped firmly with his teeth huma uma ho huma ahdy um what demanded harold earnestly resignedly and with difficulty tom removed the cigar that is he removed part of it and then blew the remainder with a whut sound across the room where it landed liquidly and limply in mrs ahearns lap beg pardon he mumbled and rose with the vague intention of going after it miltons hand on his coat collapsed him in time and mrs ahearn not ungracefully flounced the tobacco from her skirt to the floor never once looking at it i was sayin continued tom thickly fore at happened he waved his hand apologetically toward mrs ahearn i was sayin i heard all truth that country club matter milton leaned and whispered something to him lemme lone he said petulantly know what im doin ats what they came for evylyn sat there in a panic trying to make her mouth form words she saw her sisters sardonic expression and mrs ahearns face turning a vivid red ahearn was looking down at his watchchain fingering it i heard whos been keepin y out an hes not a bit bettern you i can fix whole damn thing up wouldve before but i didnt know you harol tol me you felt bad about the thing milton piper rose suddenly and awkwardly to his feet in a second every one was standing tensely and milton was saying something very hurriedly about having to go early and the ahearns were listening with eager intentness then mrs ahearn swallowed and turned with a forced smile toward jessie evylyn saw tom lurch forward and put his hand on ahearns shoulder and suddenly she was listening to a new anxious voice at her elbow and turning found hilda the second maid please mis piper i tank yulie got her hand poisoned its all swole up and her cheeks is hot and shes moanin an groanin julie is evylyn asked sharply the party suddenly receded she turned quickly sought with her eyes for mrs ahearn slipped toward her if youll excuse me mrs she had momentarily forgotten the name but she went right on my little girls been taken sick ill be down when i can she turned and ran quickly up the stairs retaining a confused picture of rays of cigar smoke and a loud discussion in the centre of the room that seemed to be developing into an argument switching on the light in the nursery she found julie tossing feverishly and giving out odd little cries she put her hand against the cheeks they were burning with an exclamation she followed the arm down under the cover until she found the hand hilda was right the whole thumb was swollen to the wrist and in the centre was a little inflamed sore bloodpoisoning her mind cried in terror the bandage had come off the cut and shed gotten something in it shed cut it at three oclock it was now nearly eleven eight hours bloodpoisoning couldnt possibly develop so soon she rushed to the phone doctor martin across the street was out doctor foulke their family physician didnt answer she racked her brains and in desperation called her throat specialist and bit her lip furiously while he looked up the numbers of two physicians during that interminable moment she thought she heard loud voices downstairs but she seemed to be in another world now after fifteen minutes she located a physician who sounded angry and sulky at being called out of bed she ran back to the nursery and looking at the hand found it was somewhat more swollen oh god she cried and kneeling beside the bed began smoothing back julies hair over and over with a vague idea of getting some hot water she rose and stared toward the door but the lace of her dress caught in the bedrail and she fell forward on her hands and knees she struggled up and jerked frantically at the lace the bed moved and julie groaned then more quietly but with suddenly fumbling fingers she found the pleat in front tore the whole pannier completely off and rushed from the room out in the hall she heard a single loud insistent voice but as she reached the head of the stairs it ceased and an outer door banged the musicroom came into view only harold and milton were there the former leaning against a chair his face very pale his collar open and his mouth moving loosely whats the matter milton looked at her anxiously there was a little trouble then harold saw her and straightening up with an effort began to speak sult mown cousin mown house god damn common nouveau rish sult mown cousin tom had trouble with ahearn and harold interfered said milton my lord milton cried evylyn couldnt you have done something i tried i julies sick she interrupted shes poisoned herself get him to bed if you can harold looked up julie sick paying no attention evylyn brushed by through the diningroom catching sight with a burst of horror of the big punchbowl still on the table the liquid from melted ice in its bottom she heard steps on the front stairs it was milton helping harold up and then a mumble why julies arigh dont let him go into the nursery she shouted the hours blurred into a nightmare the doctor arrived just before midnight and within a halfhour had lanced the wound he left at two after giving her the addresses of two nurses to call up and promising to return at half past six it was bloodpoisoning at four leaving hilda by the bedside she went to her room and slipping with a shudder out of her evening dress kicked it into a corner she put on a house dress and returned to the nursery while hilda went to make coffee not until noon could she bring herself to look into harolds room but when she did it was to find him awake and staring very miserably at the ceiling he turned bloodshot hollow eyes upon her for a minute she hated him couldnt speak a husky voice came from the bed what time is it noon i made a damn fool it doesnt matter she said sharply julies got bloodpoisoning they may she choked over the words they think shell have to lose her hand what she cut herself on that that bowl last night oh what does it matter see cried shes got bloodpoisoning cant you hear he looked at her bewildered sat halfway up in bed ill get dressed he said her anger subsided and a great wave of weariness and pity for him rolled over her after all it was his trouble too yes she answered listlessly i suppose youd better iv if evylyns beauty had hesitated an her early thirties it came to an abrupt decision just afterward and completely left her a tentative outlay of wrinkles on her face suddenly deepened and flesh collected rapidly on her legs and hips and arms her mannerism of drawing her brows together had become an expression it was habitual when she was reading or speaking and even while she slept she was fortysix as in most families whose fortunes have gone down rather than up she and harold had drifted into a colorless antagonism in repose they looked at each other with the toleration they might have felt for broken old chairs evylyn worried a little when he was sick and did her best to be cheerful under the wearying depression of living with a disappointed man family bridge was over for the evening and she sighed with relief she had made more mistakes than usual this evening and she didnt care irene shouldnt have made that remark about the infantry being particularly dangerous there had been no letter for three weeks now and while this was nothing out of the ordinary it never failed to make her nervous naturally she hadnt known how many clubs were out harold had gone upstairs so she stepped out on the porch for a breath of fresh air there was a bright glamour of moonlight diffusing on the sidewalks and lawns and with a little half yawn half laugh she remembered one long moonlight affair of her youth it was astonishing to think that life had once been the sum of her current loveaffairs it was now the sum of her current problems there was the problem of julie julie was thirteen and lately she was growing more and more sensitive about her deformity and preferred to stay always in her room reading a few years before she had been frightened at the idea of going to school and evylyn could not bring herself to send her so she grew up in her mothers shadow a pitiful little figure with the artificial hand that she made no attempt to use but kept forlornly in her pocket lately she had been taking lessons in using it because evylyn had feared she would cease to lift the arm altogether but after the lessons unless she made a move with it in listless obedience to her mother the little hand would creep back to the pocket of her dress for a while her dresses were made without pockets but julie had moped around the house so miserably at a loss all one month that evylyn weakened and never tried the experiment again the problem of donald had been different from the start she had attempted vainly to keep him near her as she had tried to teach julie to lean less on her lately the problem of donald had been snatched out of her hands his division had been abroad for three months she yawned again life was a thing for youth what a happy youth she must have had she remembered her pony bijou and the trip to europe with her mother when she was eighteen very very complicated she said aloud and severely to the moon and stepping inside was about to close the door when she heard a noise in the library and started it was martha the middleaged servant they kept only one now why martha she said in surprise martha turned quickly oh i thought you was upstairs i was jist is anything the matter martha hesitated no i she stood there fidgeting it was a letter mrs piper that i put somewhere a letter your own letter asked evylyn no it was to you twas this afternoon mrs piper in the last mail the postman give it to me and then the back doorbell rang i had it in my hand so i must have stuck it somewhere i thought id just slip in now and find it what sort of a letter from mr donald no it was an advertisement maybe or a business letter it was a long narrow one i remember they began a search through the musicroom looking on trays and mantelpieces and then through the library feeling on the tops of rows of books martha paused in despair i cant think where i went straight to the kitchen the diningroom maybe she started hopefully for the diningroom but turned suddenly at the sound of a gasp behind her evylyn had sat down heavily in a morris chair her brows drawn very close together eyes blanking furiously are you sick for a minute there was no answer evylyn sat there very still and martha could see the very quick rise and fall of her bosom are you sick she repeated no said evylyn slowly but i know where the letter is go way martha i know wonderingly martha withdrew and still evylyn sat there only the muscles around her eyes moving contracting and relaxing and contracting again she knew now where the letter was she knew as well as if she had put it there herself and she felt instinctively and unquestionably what the letter was it was long and narrow like an advertisement but up in the corner in large letters it said war department and in smaller letters below official business she knew it lay there in the big bowl with her name in ink on the outside and her souls death within rising uncertainly she walked toward the diningroom feeling her way along the bookcases and through the doorway after a moment she found the light and switched it on there was the bowl reflecting the electric light in crimson squares edged with black and yellow squares edged with blue ponderous and glittering grotesquely and triumphantly ominous she took a step forward and paused again another step and she would see over the top and into the inside another step and she would see an edge of white another step her hands fell on the rough cold surface in a moment she was tearing it open fumbling with an obstinate fold holding it before her while the typewritten page glared out and struck at her then it fluttered like a bird to the floor the house that had seemed whirring buzzing a moment since was suddenly very quiet a breath of air crept in through the open front door carrying the noise of a passing motor she heard faint sounds from upstairs and then a grinding racket in the pipe behind the bookcasesher husband turning of a watertap and in that instant it was as if this were not after all donalds hour except in so far as he was a marker in the insidious contest that had gone on in sudden surges and long listless interludes between evylyn and this cold malignant thing of beauty a gift of enmity from a man whose face she had long since forgotten with its massive brooding passivity it lay there in the centre of her house as it had lain for years throwing out the icelike beams of a thousand eyes perverse glitterings merging each into each never aging never changing evylyn sat down on the edge of the table and stared at it fascinated it seemed to be smiling now a very cruel smile as if to say you see this time i didnt have to hurt you directly i didnt bother you know it was i who took your son away you know how cold i am and how hard and how beautiful because once you were just as cold and hard and beautiful the bowl seemed suddenly to turn itself over and then to distend and swell until it became a great canopy that glittered and trembled over the room over the house and as the walls melted slowly into mist evylyn saw that it was still moving out out and far away from her shutting off far horizons and suns and moons and stars except as inky blots seen faintly through it and under it walked all the people and the light that came through to them was refracted and twisted until shadow seamed light and light seemed shadow until the whole panoply of the world became changed and distorted under the twinkling heaven of the bowl then there came a faraway booming voice like a low clear bell it came from the centre of the bowl and down the great sides to the ground and then bounced toward her eagerly you see i am fate it shouted and stronger than your puny plans and i am howthingsturnout and i am different from your little dreams and i am the flight of time and the end of beauty and unfulfilled desire all the accidents and imperceptions and the little minutes that shape the crucial hours are mine i am the exception that proves no rules the limits of your control the condiment in the dish of life the booming sound stopped the echoes rolled away over the wide land to the edge of the bowl that bounded the world and up the great sides and back to the centre where they hummed for a moment and died then the great walls began slowly to bear down upon her growing smaller and smaller coming closer and closer as if to crush her and as she clinched her hands and waited for the swift bruise of the cold glass the bowl gave a sudden wrench and turned over and lay there on the sideboard shining and inscrutable reflecting in a hundred prisms myriad manycolored glints and gleams and crossings and interlaces of light the cold wind blew in again through to front door and with a desperate frantic energy evylyn stretched both her arms around the bowl she must be quick she must be strong she tightened her arms until they ached tauted the thin strips of muscle under her soft flesh and with a mighty effort raised it and held it she felt the wind blow cold on her back where her dress had come apart from the strain of her effort and as she felt it she turned toward it and staggered under the great weight out through the library and on toward the front door she must be quick she must be strong the blood in her arms throbbed dully and her knees kept giving way under her but the feel of the cool glass was good out the front door she tottered and over to the stone steps and there summoning every fibre of her soul and body for a last effort swung herself half around for a second as she tried to loose her hold her numb fingers clung to the rough surface and in that second she slipped and losing balance toppled forward with a despairing cry her arms still around the bowl down over the way lights went on far down the block the crash was heard and pedestrians rushed up wonderingly upstairs a tired man awoke from the edge of sleep and a little girl whimpered in a haunted doze and all over the moonlit sidewalk around the still black form hundreds of prisms and cubes and splinters of glass reflected the light in little gleams of blue and black edged with yellow and yellow and crimson edged with black bernice bobs her hair after dark on saturday night one could stand on the first tee of the golfcourse and see the countryclub windows as a yellow expanse over a very black and wavy ocean the waves of this ocean so to speak were the heads of many curious caddies a few of the more ingenious chauffeurs the golf professionals deaf sister and there were usually several stray diffident waves who might have rolled inside had they so desired this was the gallery the balcony was inside it consisted of the circle of wicker chairs that lined the wall of the combination clubroom and ballroom at these saturdaynight dances it was largely feminine a great babel of middleaged ladies with sharp eyes and icy hearts behind lorgnettes and large bosoms the main function of the balcony was critical it occasionally showed grudging admiration but never approval for it is well known among ladies over thirtyfive that when the younger set dance in the summertime it is with the very worst intentions in the world and if they are not bombarded with stony eyes stray couples will dance weird barbaric interludes in the corners and the more popular more dangerous girls will sometimes be kissed in the parked limousines of unsuspecting dowagers but after all this critical circle is not close enough to the stage to see the actors faces and catch the subtler byplay it can only frown and lean ask questions and make satisfactory deductions from its set of postulates such as the one which states that every young man with a large income leads the life of a hunted partridge it never really appreciates the drama of the shifting semicruel world of adolescence no boxes orchestracircle principals and chorus be represented by the medley of faces and voices that sway to the plaintive african rhythm of dyers dance orchestra from sixteenyearold otis ormonde who has two more years at hill school to g reece stoddard over whose bureau at home hangs a harvard law diploma from little madeleine hogue whose hair still feels strange and uncomfortable on top of her head to bessie macrae who has been the life of the party a little too long more than ten years the medley is not only the centre of the stage but contains the only people capable of getting an unobstructed view of it with a flourish and a bang the music stops the couples exchange artificial effortless smiles facetiously repeat ladedada dumdum and then the clatter of young feminine voices soars over the burst of clapping a few disappointed stags caught in midfloor as they bad been about to cut in subsided listlessly back to the walls because this was not like the riotous christmas dances these summer hops were considered just pleasantly warm and exciting where even the younger marrieds rose and performed ancient waltzes and terrifying fox trots to the tolerant amusement of their younger brothers and sisters warren mcintyre who casually attended yale being one of the unfortunate stags felt in his dinnercoat pocket for a cigarette and strolled out onto the wide semidark veranda where couples were scattered at tables filling the lanternhung night with vague words and hazy laughter he nodded here and there at the less absorbed and as he passed each couple some halfforgotten fragment of a story played in his mind for it was not a large city and every one was whos who to every one elses past there for example were jim strain and ethel demorest who had been privately engaged for three years every one knew that as soon as jim managed to hold a job for more than two months she would marry him yet how bored they both looked and how wearily ethel regarded jim sometimes as if she wondered why she had trained the vines of her affection on such a windshaken poplar warren was nineteen and rather pitying with those of his friends who hadnt gone east to college but like most boys he bragged tremendously about the girls of his city when he was away from it there was genevieve ormonde who regularly made the rounds of dances houseparties and football games at princeton yale williams and cornell there was blackeyed roberta dillon who was quite as famous to her own generation as hiram johnson or ty cobb and of course there was marjorie harvey who besides having a fairylike face and a dazzling bewildering tongue was already justly celebrated for having turned five cartwheels in succession during the last pumpandslipper dance at new haven warren who had grown up across the street from marjorie had long been crazy about her sometimes she seemed to reciprocate his feeling with a faint gratitude but she had tried him by her infallible test and informed him gravely that she did not love him her test was that when she was away from him she forgot him and had affairs with other boys warren found this discouraging especially as marjorie had been making little trips all summer and for the first two or three days after each arrival home he saw great heaps of mail on the harveys hall table addressed to her in various masculine handwritings to make matters worse all during the month of august she had been visited by her cousin bernice from eau claire and it seemed impossible to see her alone it was always necessary to hunt round and find some one to take care of bernice as august waned this was becoming more and more difficult much as warren worshipped marjorie he had to admit that cousin bernice was sorta dopeless she was pretty with dark hair and high color but she was no fun on a party every saturday night he danced a long arduous duty dance with her to please marjorie but he had never been anything but bored in her company warren a soft voice at his elbow broke in upon his thoughts and he turned to see marjorie flushed and radiant as usual she laid a hand on his shoulder and a glow settled almost imperceptibly over him warren she whispered do something for me dance with bernice shes been stuck with little otis ormonde for almost an hour warrens glow faded why sure he answered halfheartedly you dont mind do you ill see that you dont get stuck sall right marjorie smiled that smile that was thanks enough youre an angel and im obliged loads with a sigh the angel glanced round the veranda but bernice and otis were not in sight he wandered back inside and there in front of the womens dressingroom he found otis in the centre of a group of young men who were convulsed with laughter otis was brandishing a piece of timber he had picked up and discoursing volubly shes gone in to fix her hair he announced wildly im waiting to dance another hour with her their laughter was renewed why dont some of you cut in cried otis resentfully she likes more variety why otis suggested a friend youve just barely got used to her why the twobyfour otis inquired warren smiling the twobyfour oh this this is a club when she comes out ill hit her on the head and knock her in again warren collapsed on a settee and howled with glee never mind otis he articulated finally im relieving you this time otis simulated a sudden fainting attack and handed the stick to warren if you need it old man he said hoarsely no matter how beautiful or brilliant a girl may be the reputation of not being frequently cut in on makes her position at a dance unfortunate perhaps boys prefer her company to that of the butterflies with whom they dance a dozen times an but youth in this jazznourished generation is temperamentally restless and the idea of foxtrotting more than one full fox trot with the same girl is distasteful not to say odious when it comes to several dances and the intermissions between she can be quite sure that a young man once relieved will never tread on her wayward toes again warren danced the next full dance with bernice and finally thankful for the intermission he led her to a table on the veranda there was a moments silence while she did unimpressive things with her fan its hotter here than in eau claire she said warren stifled a sigh and nodded it might be for all he knew or cared he wondered idly whether she was a poor conversationalist because she got no attention or got no attention because she was a poor conversationalist you going to be here much longer he asked and then turned rather red she might suspect his reasons for asking another week she answered and stared at him as if to lunge at his next remark when it left his lips warren fidgeted then with a sudden charitable impulse he decided to try part of his line on her he turned and looked at her eyes youve got an awfully kissable mouth he began quietly this was a remark that he sometimes made to girls at college proms when they were talking in just such half dark as this bernice distinctly jumped she turned an ungraceful red and became clumsy with her fan no one had ever made such a remark to her before fresh the word had slipped out before she realized it and she bit her lip too late she decided to be amused and offered him a flustered smile warren was annoyed though not accustomed to have that remark taken seriously still it usually provoked a laugh or a paragraph of sentimental banter and he hated to be called fresh except in a joking way his charitable impulse died and he switched the topic jim strain and ethel demorest sitting out as usual he commented this was more in bernices line but a faint regret mingled with her relief as the subject changed men did not talk to her about kissable mouths but she knew that they talked in some such way to other girls oh yes she said and laughed i hear theyve been mooning around for years without a red penny isnt it silly warrens disgust increased jim strain was a close friend of his brothers and anyway he considered it bad form to sneer at people for not having money but bernice had had no intention of sneering she was merely nervous ii when marjorie and bernice reached home at half after midnight they said good night at the top of the stairs though cousins they were not intimates as a matter of fact marjorie had no female intimates she considered girls stupid bernice on the contrary all through this parentarranged visit had rather longed to exchange those confidences flavored with giggles and tears that she considered an indispensable factor in all feminine intercourse but in this respect she found marjorie rather cold felt somehow the same difficulty in talking to her that she had in talking to men marjorie never giggled was never frightened seldom embarrassed and in fact had very few of the qualities which bernice considered appropriately and blessedly feminine as bernice busied herself with toothbrush and paste this night she wondered for the hundredth time why she never had any attention when she was away from home that her family were the wealthiest in eau claire that her mother entertained tremendously gave little diners for her daughter before all dances and bought her a car of her own to drive round in never occurred to her as factors in her hometown social success like most girls she had been brought up on the warm milk prepared by annie fellows johnston and on novels in which the female was beloved because of certain mysterious womanly qualities always mentioned but never displayed bernice felt a vague pain that she was not at present engaged in being popular she did not know that had it not been for marjories campaigning she would have danced the entire evening with one man but she knew that even in eau claire other girls with less position and less pulchritude were given a much bigger rush she attributed this to something subtly unscrupulous in those girls it had never worried her and if it had her mother would have assured her that the other girls cheapened themselves and that men really respected girls like bernice she turned out the light in her bathroom and on an impulse decided to go in and chat for a moment with her aunt josephine whose light was still on her soft slippers bore her noiselessly down the carpeted hall but hearing voices inside she stopped near the partly openers door then she caught her own name and without any definite intention of eavesdropping lingered and the thread of the conversation going on inside pierced her consciousness sharply as if it had been drawn through with a needle shes absolutely hopeless it was marjories voice oh i know what youre going to say so many people have told you how pretty and sweet she is and how she can cook what of it she has a bum time men dont like her whats a little cheap popularity mrs harvey sounded annoyed its everything when youre eighteen said marjorie emphatically ive done my best ive been polite and ive made men dance with her but they just wont stand being bored when i think of that gorgeous coloring wasted on such a ninny and think what martha carey could do with it oh theres no courtesy these days mrs harveys voice implied that modern situations were too much for her when she was a girl all young ladies who belonged to nice families had glorious times well said marjorie no girl can permanently bolster up a lameduck visitor because these days its every girl for herself ive even tried to drop hints about clothes and things and shes been furious given me the funniest looks shes sensitive enough to know shes not getting away with much but ill bet she consoles herself by thinking that shes very virtuous and that im too gay and fickle and will come to a bad end all unpopular girls think that way sour grapes sarah hopkins refers to genevieve and roberta and me as gardenia girls ill bet shed give ten years of her life and her european education to be a gardenia girl and have three or four men in love with her and be cut in on every few feet at dances it seems to me interrupted mrs harvey rather wearily that you ought to be able to do something for bernice i know shes not very vivacious marjorie groaned vivacious good grief ive never heard her say anything to a boy except that its hot or the floors crowded or that shes going to school in new york next year sometimes she asks them what kind of car they have and tells them the kind she has thrilling there was a short silence and then mrs harvey took up her refrain all i know is that other girls not half so sweet and attractive get partners martha carey for instance is stout and loud and her mother is distinctly common roberta dillon is so thin this year that she looks as though arizona were the place for her shes dancing herself to death but mother objected marjorie impatiently martha is cheerful and awfully witty and an awfully slick girl and robertas a marvellous dancer shes been popular for ages mrs harvey yawned i think its that crazy indian blood in bernice continued marjorie maybe shes a reversion to type indian women all just sat round and never said anything go to bed you silly child laughed mrs harvey i wouldnt have told you that if id thought you were going to remember it and i think most of your ideas are perfectly idiotic she finished sleepily there was another silence while marjorie considered whether or not convincing her mother was worth the trouble people over forty can seldom be permanently convinced of anything at eighteen our convictions are hills from which we look at fortyfive they are caves in which we hide having decided this marjorie said good night when she came out into the hall it was quite empty iii while marjorie was breakfasting late next day bernice came into the room with a rather formal good morning sat down opposite stared intently over and slightly moistened her lips whats on your mind inquired marjorie rather puzzled bernice paused before she threw her handgrenade i heard what you said about me to your mother last night marjorie was startled but she showed only a faintly heightened color and her voice was quite even when she spoke where were you in the hall i didnt mean to listen at first after an involuntary look of contempt marjorie dropped her eyes and became very interested in balancing a stray cornflake on her finger i guess id better go back to eau claire if im such a nuisance bernices lower lip was trembling violently and she continued on a wavering note ive tried to be nice and and ive been first neglected and then insulted no one ever visited me and got such treatment marjorie was silent but im in the way i see im a drag on you your friends dont like me she paused and then remembered another one of her grievances of course i was furious last week when you tried to hint to me that that dress was unbecoming dont you think i know how to dress myself no murmured less than halfaloud what i didnt hint anything said marjorie succinctly i said as i remember that it was better to wear a becoming dress three times straight than to alternate it with two frights do you think that was a very nice thing to say i wasnt trying to be nice then after a pause when do you want to go bernice drew in her breath sharply oh it was a little halfcry marjorie looked up in surprise didnt you say you were going yes but oh you were only bluffing they stared at each other across the breakfasttable for a moment misty waves were passing before bernices eyes while marjories face wore that rather hard expression that she used when slightly intoxicated undergraduates were making love to her so you were bluffing she repeated as if it were what she might have expected bernice admitted it by bursting into tears marjories eyes showed boredom youre my cousin sobbed bernice im vvvisiting you i was to stay a month and if i go home my mother will know and shell wahwonder marjorie waited until the shower of broken words collapsed into little sniffles ill give you my months allowance she said coldly and you can spend this last week anywhere you want theres a very nice hotel bernices sobs rose to a flute note and rising of a sudden she fled from the room an hour later while marjorie was in the library absorbed in composing one of those noncommittal marvelously elusive letters that only a young girl can write bernice reappeared very redeyed and consciously calm she cast no glance at marjorie but took a book at random from the shelf and sat down as if to read marjorie seemed absorbed in her letter and continued writing when the clock showed noon bernice closed her book with a snap i suppose id better get my railroad ticket this was not the beginning of the speech she had rehearsed upstairs but as marjorie was not getting her cues wasnt urging her to be reasonable its an a mistake it was the best opening she could muster just wait till i finish this letter said marjorie without looking round i want to get it off in the next mail after another minute during which her pen scratched busily she turned round and relaxed with an air of at your service again bernice had to speak do you want me to go home well said marjorie considering i suppose if youre not having a good time youd better go no use being miserable dont you think common kindness oh please dont quote little women cried marjorie impatiently thats out of style you think so heavens yes what modern girl could live like those inane females they were the models for our mothers marjorie laughed yes they were not besides our mothers were all very well in their way but they know very little about their daughters problems bernice drew herself up please dont talk about my mother marjorie laughed i dont think i mentioned her bernice felt that she was being led away from her subject do you think youve treated me very well ive done my best youre rather hard material to work with the lids of bernices eyes reddened i think youre hard and selfish and you havent a feminine quality in you oh my lord cried marjorie in desperation you little nut girls like you are responsible for all the tiresome colorless marriages all those ghastly inefficiencies that pass as feminine qualities what a blow it must be when a man with imagination marries the beautiful bundle of clothes that hes been building ideals round and finds that shes just a weak whining cowardly mass of affectations bernices mouth had slipped half open the womanly woman continued marjorie her whole early life is occupied in whining criticisms of girls like me who really do have a good time bernices jaw descended farther as marjories voice rose theres some excuse for an ugly girl whining if id been irretrievably ugly id never have forgiven my parents for bringing me into the world but youre starting life without any handicap marjories little fist clinched if you expect me to weep with you youll be disappointed go or stay just as you like and picking up her letters she left the room bernice claimed a headache and failed to appear at luncheon they had a matinйe date for the afternoon but the headache persisting marjorie made explanation to a not very downcast boy but when she returned late in the afternoon she found bernice with a strangely set face waiting for her in her bedroom ive decided began bernice without preliminaries that maybe youre right about things possibly not but if youll tell me why your friends arent arent interested in me ill see if i can do what you want me to marjorie was at the mirror shaking down her hair do you mean it yes without reservations will you do exactly what i say well i well nothing will you do exactly as i say if theyre sensible things theyre not youre no case for sensible things are you going to make to recommend yes everything if i tell you to take boxinglessons youll have to do it write home and tell your mother youre going to stay another two weeks if youll tell me all right ill just give you a few examples now first you have no ease of manner why because youre never sure about your personal appearance when a girl feels that shes perfectly groomed and dressed she can forget that part of her thats charm the more parts of yourself you can afford to forget the more charm you have dont i look all right no for instance you never take care of your eyebrows theyre black and lustrous but by leaving them straggly theyre a blemish theyd be beautiful if youd take care of them in onetenth the time you take doing nothing youre going to brush them so that theyll grow straight bernice raised the brows in question do you mean to say that men notice eyebrows yes subconsciously and when you go home you ought to have your teeth straightened a little its almost imperceptible still but i thought interrupted bernice in bewilderment that you despised little dainty feminine things like that i hate dainty minds answered marjorie but a girl has to be dainty in person if she looks like a million dollars she can talk about russia pingpong or the league of nations and get away with it what else oh im just beginning theres your dancing dont i dance all right no you dont you lean on a man yes you do ever so slightly i noticed it when we were dancing together yesterday and you dance standing up straight instead of bending over a little probably some old lady on the sideline once told you that you looked so dignified that way but except with a very small girl its much harder on the man and hes the one that counts go on bernices brain was reeling well youve got to learn to be nice to men who are sad birds you look as if youd been insulted whenever youre thrown with any except the most popular boys why bernice im cut in on every few feet and who does most of it why those very sad birds no girl can afford to neglect them theyre the big part of any crowd young boys too shy to talk are the very best conversational practice clumsy boys are the best dancing practice if you can follow them and yet look graceful you can follow a baby tank across a barbwire skyscraper bernice sighed profoundly but marjorie was not through if you go to a dance and really amuse say three sad birds that dance with you if you talk so well to them that they forget theyre stuck with you youve done something theyll come back next time and gradually so many sad birds will dance with you that the attractive boys will see theres no danger of being stuck then theyll dance with you yes agreed bernice faintly i think i begin to see and finally concluded marjorie poise and charm will just come youll wake up some morning knowing youve attained it and men will know it too bernice rose its been awfully kind of you but nobodys ever talked to me like this before and i feel sort of startled marjorie made no answer but gazed pensively at her own image in the mirror youre a peach to help me continued bernice still marjorie did not answer and bernice thought she had seemed too grateful i know you dont like sentiment she said timidly marjorie turned to her quickly oh i wasnt thinking about that i was considering whether we hadnt better bob your hair bernice collapsed backward upon the bed iv on the following wednesday evening there was a dinnerdance at the country club when the guests strolled in bernice found her placecard with a slight feeling of irritation though at her right sat g reece stoddard a most desirable and distinguished young bachelor the allimportant left held only charley paulson charley lacked height beauty and social shrewdness and in her new enlightenment bernice decided that his only qualification to be her partner was that he had never been stuck with her but this feeling of irritation left with the last of the soupplates and marjories specific instruction came to her swallowing her pride she turned to charley paulson and plunged do you think i ought to bob my hair mr charley paulson charley looked up in surprise why because im considering it its such a sure and easy way of attracting attention charley smiled pleasantly he could not know this had been rehearsed he replied that he didnt know much about bobbed hair but bernice was there to tell him i want to be a society vampire you see she announced coolly and went on to inform him that bobbed hair was the necessary prelude she added that she wanted to ask his advice because she had heard he was so critical about girls charley who knew as much about the psychology of women as he did of the mental states of buddhist contemplatives felt vaguely flattered so ive decided she continued her voice rising slightly that early next week im going down to the sevier hotel barbershop sit in the first chair and get my hair bobbed she faltered noticing that the people near her had paused in their conversation and were listening but after a confused second marjories coaching told and she finished her paragraph to the vicinity at large of course im charging admission but if youll all come down and encourage me ill issue passes for the inside seats there was a ripple of appreciative laughter and under cover of it g reece stoddard leaned over quickly and said close to her ear ill take a box right now she met his eyes and smiled as if he had said something surprisingly brilliant do you believe in bobbed hair asked g reece in the same undertone i think its unmoral affirmed bernice gravely but of course youve either got to amuse people or feed em or shock em marjorie had culled this from oscar wilde it was greeted with a ripple of laughter from the men and a series of quick intent looks from the girls and then as though she had said nothing of wit or moment bernice turned again to charley and spoke confidentially in his ear i want to ask you your opinion of several people i imagine youre a wonderful judge of character charley thrilled faintly paid her a subtle compliment by overturning her water two hours later while warren mcintyre was standing passively in the stag line abstractedly watching the dancers and wondering whither and with whom marjorie had disappeared an unrelated perception began to creep slowly upon him a perception that bernice cousin to marjorie had been cut in on several times in the past five minutes he closed his eyes opened them and looked again several minutes back she had been dancing with a visiting boy a matter easily accounted for a visiting boy would know no better but now she was dancing with some one else and there was charley paulson headed for her with enthusiastic determination in his eye funny charley seldom danced with more than three girls an evening warren was distinctly surprised when the exchange having been effected the man relieved proved to be none ether than g reece stoddard himself and g reece seemed not at all jubilant at being relieved next time bernice danced near warren regarded her intently yes she was pretty distinctly pretty and tonight her face seemed really vivacious she had that look that no woman however histrionically proficient can successfully counterfeit she looked as if she were having a good time he liked the way she had her hair arranged wondered if it was brilliantine that made it glisten so and that dress was becoming a dark red that set off her shadowy eyes and high coloring he remembered that he had thought her pretty when she first came to town before he had realized that she was dull too bad she was dull dull girls unbearable certainly pretty though his thoughts zigzagged back to marjorie this disappearance would be like other disappearances when she reappeared he would demand where she had been would be told emphatically that it was none of his business what a pity she was so sure of him she basked in the knowledge that no other girl in town interested him she defied him to fall in love with genevieve or roberta warren sighed the way to marjories affections was a labyrinth indeed he looked up bernice was again dancing with the visiting boy half unconsciously he took a step out from the stag line in her direction and hesitated then he said to himself that it was charity he walked toward her collided suddenly with g reece stoddard pardon me said warren but g reece had not stopped to apologize he had again cut in on bernice that night at one oclock marjorie with one hand on the electriclight switch in the hall turned to take a last look at bernices sparkling eyes so it worked oh marjorie yes cried bernice i saw you were having a gay time i did the only trouble was that about midnight i ran short of talk i had to repeat myself with different men of course i hope they wont compare notes men dont said marjorie yawning and it wouldnt matter if they did theyd think you were even trickier she snapped out the light and as they started up the stairs bernice grasped the banister thankfully for the first time in her life she had been danced tired you see said marjorie it the top of the stairs one man sees another man cut in and he thinks there must be something there well well fix up some new stuff tomorrow good night good night as bernice took down her hair she passed the evening before her in review she had followed instructions exactly even when charley paulson cut in for the eighth time she had simulated delight and had apparently been both interested and flattered she had not talked about the weather or eau claire or automobiles or her school but had confined her conversation to me you and us but a few minutes before she fell asleep a rebellious thought was churning drowsily in her brain after all it was she who had done it marjorie to be sure had given her her conversation but then marjorie got much of her conversation out of things she read bernice had bought the red dress though she had never valued it highly before marjorie dug it out of her trunk and her own voice had said the words her own lips had smiled her own feet had danced marjorie nice girl vain though nice evening nice boys like warren warren warren whats his name warren she fell asleep v to bernice the next week was a revelation with the feeling that people really enjoyed looking at her and listening to her came the foundation of selfconfidence of course there were numerous mistakes at first she did not know for instance that draycott deyo was studying for the ministry she was unaware that he had cut in on her because he thought she was a quiet reserved girl had she known these things she would not have treated him to the line which began hello shell shock and continued with the bathtub story it takes a frightful lot of energy to fix my hair in the summer theres so much of it so i always fix it first and powder my face and put on my hat then i get into the bathtub and dress afterward dont you think thats the best plan though draycott deyo was in the throes of difficulties concerning baptism by immersion and might possibly have seen a connection it must be admitted that he did not he considered feminine bathing an immoral subject and gave her some of his ideas on the depravity of modern society but to offset that unfortunate occurrence bernice had several signal successes to her credit little otis ormonde pleaded off from a trip east and elected instead to follow her with a puppylike devotion to the amusement of his crowd and to the irritation of g reece stoddard several of whose afternoon calls otis completely ruined by the disgusting tenderness of the glances he bent on bernice he even told her the story of the twobyfour and the dressingroom to show her how frightfully mistaken he and every one else had been in their first judgment of her bernice laughed off that incident with a slight sinking sensation of all bernices conversation perhaps the best known and most universally approved was the line about the bobbing of her hair oh bernice when you goin to get the hair bobbed day after tomorrow maybe she would reply laughing will you come and see me because im counting on you you know will we you know but you better hurry up bernice whose tonsorial intentions were strictly dishonorable would laugh again pretty soon now youd be surprised but perhaps the most significant symbol of her success was the gray car of the hypercritical warren mcintyre parked daily in front of the harvey house at first the parlormaid was distinctly startled when he asked for bernice instead of marjorie after a week of it she told the cook that miss bernice had gotta holda miss marjories best fella and miss bernice had perhaps it began with warrens desire to rouse jealousy in marjorie perhaps it was the familiar though unrecognized strain of marjorie in bernices conversation perhaps it was both of these and something of sincere attraction besides but somehow the collective mind of the younger set knew within a week that marjories most reliable beau had made an amazing faceabout and was giving an indisputable rush to marjories guest the question of the moment was how marjorie would take it warren called bernice on the phone twice a day sent her notes and they were frequently seen together in his roadster obviously engrossed in one of those tense significant conversations as to whether or not he was sincere marjorie on being twitted only laughed she said she was mighty glad that warren had at last found some one who appreciated him so the younger set laughed too and guessed that marjorie didnt care and let it go at that one afternoon when there were only three days left of her visit bernice was waiting in the hall for warren with whom she was going to a bridge party she was in rather a blissful mood and when marjorie also bound for the party appeared beside her and began casually to adjust her hat in the mirror bernice was utterly unprepared for anything in the nature of a clash marjorie did her work very coldly and succinctly in three sentences you may as well get warren out of your head she said coldly what bernice was utterly astounded you may as well stop making a fool of yourself over warren mcintyre he doesnt care a snap of his fingers about you for a tense moment they regarded each other marjorie scornful aloof bernice astounded halfangry halfafraid then two cars drove up in front of the house and there was a riotous honking both of them gasped faintly turned and side by side hurried out all through the bridge party bernice strove in vain to master a rising uneasiness she had offended marjorie the sphinx of sphinxes with the most wholesome and innocent intentions in the world she had stolen marjories property she felt suddenly and horribly guilty after the bridge game when they sat in an informal circle and the conversation became general the storm gradually broke little otis ormonde inadvertently precipitated it when you going back to kindergarten otis some one had asked me day bernice gets her hair bobbed then your educations over said marjorie quickly thats only a bluff of hers i should think youd have realized that a fact demanded otis giving bernice a reproachful glance bernices ears burned as she tried to think up an effectual comeback in the face of this direct attack her imagination was paralyzed theres a lot of bluffs in the world continued marjorie quite pleasantly i should think youd be young enough to know that otis well said otis maybe so but gee with a line like bernices really yawned marjorie whats her latest bon mot no one seemed to know in fact bernice having trifled with her muses beau had said nothing memorable of late was that really all a line asked roberta curiously bernice hesitated she felt that wit in some form was demanded of her but under her cousins suddenly frigid eyes she was completely incapacitated i dont know she stalled splush said marjorie admit it bernice saw that warrens eyes had left a ukulele he had been tinkering with and were fixed on her questioningly oh i dont know she repeated steadily her cheeks were glowing splush remarked marjorie again come through bernice urged otis tell her where to get off bernice looked round again she seemed unable to get away from warrens eyes i like bobbed hair she said hurriedly as if he had asked her a question and i intend to bob mine when demanded marjorie any time no time like the present suggested roberta otis jumped to his feet good stuff he cried well have a summer bobbing party sevier hotel barbershop i think you said in an instant all were on their feet bernices heart throbbed violently what she gasped out of the group came marjories voice very clear and contemptuous dont worry shell back out come on bernice cried otis starting toward the door four eyes warrens and marjories stared at her challenged her defied her for another second she wavered wildly all right she said swiftly i dont care if i do an eternity of minutes later riding downtown through the late afternoon beside warren the others following in robertas car close behind bernice had all the sensations of marie antoinette bound for the guillotine in a tumbrel vaguely she wondered why she did not cry out that it was all a mistake it was all she could do to keep from clutching her hair with both bands to protect it from the suddenly hostile world yet she did neither even the thought of her mother was no deterrent now this was the test supreme of her sportsmanship her right to walk unchallenged in the starry heaven of popular girls warren was moodily silent and when they came to the hotel he drew up at the curb and nodded to bernice to precede him out robertas car emptied a laughing crowd into the shop which presented two bold plateglass windows to the street bernice stood on the curb and looked at the sign sevier barbershop it was a guillotine indeed and the hangman was the first barber who attired in a white coat and smoking a cigarette leaned nonchalantly against the first chair he must have heard of her he must have been waiting all week smoking eternal cigarettes beside that portentous toooftenmentioned first chair would they blindfold her no but they would tie a white cloth round her neck lest any of her blood nonsense hair should get on her clothes all right bernice said warren quickly with her chin in the air she crossed the sidewalk pushed open the swinging screendoor and giving not a glance to the uproarious riotous row that occupied the waiting bench went up to the fat barber i want you to bob my hair the first barbers mouth slid somewhat open his cigarette dropped to the floor huh my hair bob it refusing further preliminaries bernice took her seat on high a man in the chair next to her turned on his side and gave her a glance half lather half amazement one barber started and spoiled little willy schunemans monthly haircut mr oreilly in the last chair grunted and swore musically in ancient gaelic as a razor bit into his cheek two bootblacks became wideeyed and rushed for her feet no bernice didnt care for a shine outside a passerby stopped and stared a couple joined him half a dozen small boys nose sprang into life flattened against the glass and snatches of conversation borne on the summer breeze drifted in through the screendoor lookada long hair on a kid whered yuh get at stuff ats a bearded lady he just finished shavin but bernice saw nothing heard nothing her only living sense told her that this man in the white coat had removed one tortoiseshell comb and then another that his fingers were fumbling clumsily with unfamiliar hairpins that this hair this wonderful hair of hers was going she would never again feel its long voluptuous pull as it hung in a darkbrown glory down her back for a second she was near breaking down and then the picture before her swam mechanically into her vision marjories mouth curling in a faint ironic smile as if to say give up and get down you tried to buck me and i called your bluff you see you havent got a prayer and some last energy rose up in bernice for she clinched her hands under the white cloth and there was a curious narrowing of her eyes that marjorie remarked on to some one long afterward twenty minutes later the barber swung her round to face the mirror and she flinched at the full extent of the damage that had been wrought her hair was not curls and now it lay in lank lifeless blocks on both sides of her suddenly pale face it was ugly as sin she had known it would be ugly as sin her faces chief charm had been a madonnalike simplicity now that was gone and she was well frightfully mediocre not stagy only ridiculous like a greenwich villager who had left her spectacles at home as she climbed down from the chair she tried to smile failed miserably she saw two of the girls exchange glances noticed marjories mouth curved in attenuated mockery and that warrens eyes were suddenly very cold you see her words fell into an awkward pause ive done it yes youve done it admitted warren do you like it there was a halfhearted sure from two or three voices another awkward pause and then marjorie turned swiftly and with serpentlike intensity to warren would you mind running me down to the cleaners she asked ive simply got to get a dress there before supper robertas driving right home and she can take the others warren stared abstractedly at some infinite speck out the window then for an instant his eyes rested coldly on bernice before they turned to marjorie be glad to he said slowly vi bernice did not fully realize the outrageous trap that had been set for her until she met her aunts amazed glance just before dinner why bernice ive bobbed it aunt josephine why child do you like it why bernice i suppose ive shocked you no but whatll mrs deyo think tomorrow night bernice you should have waited until after the deyos dance you should have waited if you wanted to do that it was sudden aunt josephine anyway why does it matter to mrs deyo particularly why child cried mrs harvey in her paper on the foibles of the younger generation that she read at the last meeting of the thursday club she devoted fifteen minutes to bobbed hair its her pet abomination and the dance is for you and marjorie im sorry oh bernice whatll your mother say shell think i let you do it im sorry dinner was an agony she had made a hasty attempt with a curlingiron and burned her finger and much hair she could see that her aunt was both worried and grieved and her uncle kept saying well ill be darned over and over in a hurt and faintly hostile torte and marjorie sat very quietly intrenched behind a faint smile a faintly mocking smile somehow she got through the evening three boys called marjorie disappeared with one of them and bernice made a listless unsuccessful attempt to entertain the two others sighed thankfully as she climbed the stairs to her room at half past ten what a day when she had undressed for the night the door opened and marjorie came in bernice she said im awfully sorry about the deyo dance ill give you my word of honor id forgotten all about it sall right said bernice shortly standing before the mirror she passed her comb slowly through her short hair ill take you downtown tomorrow continued marjorie and the hairdresserll fix it so youll look slick i didnt imagine youd go through with it im really mighty sorry oh sall right still its your last night so i suppose it wont matter much then bernice winced as marjorie tossed her own hair over her shoulders and began to twist it slowly into two long blond braids until in her creamcolored negligйe she looked like a delicate painting of some saxon princess fascinated bernice watched the braids grow heavy and luxurious they were moving under the supple fingers like restive snakes and to bernice remained this relic and the curlingiron and a tomorrow full of eyes she could see g reece stoddard who liked her assuming his harvard manner and telling his dinner partner that bernice shouldnt have been allowed to go to the movies so much she could see draycott deyo exchanging glances with his mother and then being conscientiously charitable to her but then perhaps by tomorrow mrs deyo would have heard the news would send round an icy little note requesting that she fail to appear and behind her back they would all laugh and know that marjorie had made a fool of her that her chance at beauty had been sacrificed to the jealous whim of a selfish girl she sat down suddenly before the mirror biting the inside of her cheek i like it she said with an effort i think itll be becoming marjorie smiled it looks all right for heavens sake dont let it worry you i wont good night bernice but as the door closed something snapped within bernice she sprang dynamically to her feet clinching her hands then swiftly and noiseless crossed over to her bed and from underneath it dragged out her suitcase into it she tossed toilet articles and a change of clothing then she turned to her trunk and quickly dumped in two drawerfulls of lingerie and stammer dresses she moved quietly but deadly efficiency and in threequarters of an hour her trunk was locked and strapped and she was fully dressed in a becoming new travelling suit that marjorie had helped her pick out sitting down at her desk she wrote a short note to mrs harvey in which she briefly outlined her reasons for going she sealed it addressed it and laid it on her pillow she glanced at her watch the train left at one and she knew that if she walked down to the marborough hotel two blocks away she could easily get a taxicab suddenly she drew in her breath sharply and an expression flashed into her eyes that a practiced character reader might have connected vaguely with the set look she had worn in the barbers chair somehow a development of it it was quite a new look for bernice and it carried consequences she went stealthily to the bureau picked up an article that lay there and turning out all the lights stood quietly until her eyes became accustomed to the darkness softly she pushed open the door to marjories room she heard the quiet even breathing of an untroubled conscience asleep she was by the bedside now very deliberate and calm she acted swiftly bending over she found one of the braids of marjories hair followed it up with her hand to the point nearest the head and then holding it a little slack so that the sleeper would feel no pull she reached down with the shears and severed it with the pigtail in her hand she held her breath marjorie had muttered something in her sleep bernice deftly amputated the other braid paused for an instant and then flitted swiftly and silently back to her own room downstairs she opened the big front door closed it carefully behind her and feeling oddly happy and exuberant stepped off the porch into the moonlight swinging her heavy grip like a shoppingbag after a minutes brisk walk she discovered that her left hand still held the two blond braids she laughed unexpectedly had to shut her mouth hard to keep from emitting an absolute peal she was passing warrens house now and on the impulse she set down her baggage and swinging the braids like piece of rope flung them at the wooden porch where they landed with a slight thud she laughed again no longer restraining herself huh she giggled wildly scalp the selfish thing then picking up her staircase she set off at a halfrun down the moonlit street benediction the baltimore station was hot and crowded so lois was forced to stand by the telegraph desk for interminable sticky seconds while a clerk with big front teeth counted and recounted a large ladys day message to determine whether it contained the innocuous fortynine words or the fatal fiftyone lois waiting decided she wasnt quite sure of the address so she took the letter out of her bag and ran over it again darling it began i understand and im happier than life ever meant me to be if i could give you the things youve always been in tune with but i cant lois we cant marry and we cant lose each other and let all this glorious love end in nothing until your letter came dear id been sitting here in the half dark and thinking where i could go and ever forget you abroad perhaps to drift through italy or spain and dream away the pain of having lost you where the crumbling ruins of older mellower civilizations would mirror only the desolation of my heart and then your letter came sweetest bravest girl if youll wire me ill meet you in wilmington till then ill be here just waiting and hoping for every long dream of you to come true howard she had read the letter so many times that she knew it word by word yet it still startled her in it she found many faint reflections of the man who wrote it the mingled sweetness and sadness in his dark eyes the furtive restless excitement she felt sometimes when he talked to her his dreamy sensuousness that lulled her mind to sleep lois was nineteen and very romantic and curious and courageous the large lady and the clerk having compromised on fifty words lois took a blank and wrote her telegram and there were no overtones to the finality of her decision its just destiny she thought its just the way things work out in this damn world if cowardice is all thats been holding me back there wont be any more holding back so well just let things take their course and never be sorry the clerk scanned her telegram arrived baltimore today spend day with my brother meet me wilmington three pm wednesday love lois fiftyfour cents said the clerk admiringly and never be sorry thought lois and never be sorry ii trees filtering light onto dapple grass trees like tall languid ladies with feather fans coquetting airily with the ugly roof of the monastery trees like butlers bending courteously over placid walks and paths trees trees over the hills on either side and scattering out in clumps and lines and woods all through eastern maryland delicate lace on the hems of many yellow fields dark opaque backgrounds for flowered bushes or wild climbing garden some of the trees were very gay and young but the monastery trees were older than the monastery which by true monastic standards wasnt very old at all and as a matter of fact it wasnt technically called a monastery but only a seminary nevertheless it shall be a monastery here despite its victorian architecture or its edward vii additions or even its woodrow wilsonian patented lastacentury roofing out behind was the farm where half a dozen lay brothers were sweating lustily as they moved with deadly efficiency around the vegetablegardens to the left behind a row of elms was an informal baseball diamond where three novices were being batted out by a fourth amid great chasings and puffings and blowings and in front as a great mellow bell boomed the halfhour a swarm of black human leaves were blown over the checkerboard of paths under the courteous trees some of these black leaves were very old with cheeks furrowed like the first ripples of a splashed pool then there was a scattering of middleaged leaves whose forms when viewed in profile in their revealing gowns were beginning to be faintly unsymmetrical these carried thick volumes of thomas aquinas and henry james and cardinal mercier and immanuel kant and many bulging notebooks filled with lecture data but most numerous were the young leaves blond boys of nineteen with very stern conscientious expressions men in the late twenties with a keen selfassurance from having taught out in the world for five years several hundreds of them from city and town and country in maryland and pennsylvania and virginia and west virginia and delaware there were many americans and some irish and some tough irish and a few french and several italians and poles and they walked informally arm in arm with each other in twos and threes or in long rows almost universally distinguished by the straight mouth and the considerable chin for this was the society of jesus founded in spain five hundred years before by a toughminded soldier who trained men to hold a breach or a salon preach a sermon or write a treaty and do it and not argue lois got out of a bus into the sunshine down by the outer gate she was nineteen with yellow hair and eyes that people were tactful enough not to call green when men of talent saw her in a streetcar they often furtively produced little stubpencils and backs of envelopes and tried to sum up that profile or the thing that the eyebrows did to her eyes later they looked at their results and usually tore them up with wondering sighs though lois was very jauntily attired in an expensively appropriate travelling affair she did not linger to pat out the dust which covered her clothes but started up the central walk with curious glances at either side her face was very eager and expectant yet she hadnt at all that glorified expression that girls wear when they arrive for a senior prom at princeton or new haven still as there were no senior proms here perhaps it didnt matter she was wondering what he would look like whether shed possibly know him from his picture in the picture which hung over her mothers bureau at home he seemed very young and hollowcheeked and rather pitiful with only a welldeveloped mouth and all illfitting probationers gown to show that he had already made a momentous decision about his life of course he had been only nineteen then and now he was thirtysix didnt look like that at all in recent snapshots he was much broader and his hair had grown a little thin but the impression of her brother she had always retained was that of the big picture and so she had always been a little sorry for him what a life for a man seventeen years of preparation and he wasnt even a priest yet wouldnt be for another year lois had an idea that this was all going to be rather solemn if she let it be but she was going to give her very best imitation of undiluted sunshine the imitation she could give even when her head was splitting or when her mother had a nervous breakdown or when she was particularly romantic and curious and courageous this brother of hers undoubtedly needed cheering up and he was going to be cheered up whether he liked it or not as she drew near the great homely front door she saw a man break suddenly away from a group and pulling up the skirts of his gown run toward her he was smiling she noticed and he looked very big and and reliable she stopped and waited knew that her heart was beating unusually fast lois he cried and in a second she was in his arms she was suddenly trembling lois he cried again why this is wonderful i cant tell you lois how much ive looked forward to this why lois youre beautiful lois gasped his voice though restrained was vibrant with energy and that odd sort of enveloping personality she had thought that she only of the family possessed im mighty glad too kieth she flushed but not unhappily at this first use of his name lois lois lois he repeated in wonder child well go in here a minute because i want you to meet the rector and then well walk around i have a thousand things to talk to you about his voice became graver hows mother she looked at him for a moment and then said something that she had not intended to say at all the very sort of thing she had resolved to avoid oh kieth shes shes getting worse all the time every way he nodded slowly as if he understood nervous well you can tell me about that later now she was in a small study with a large desk saying something to a little jovial whitehaired priest who retained her hand for some seconds so this is lois he said it as if he had heard of her for years he entreated her to sit down two other priests arrived enthusiastically and shook hands with her and addressed her as kieths little sister which she found she didnt mind a bit how assured they seemed she had expected a certain shyness reserve at least there were several jokes unintelligible to her which seemed to delight every one and the little father rector referred to the trio of them as dim old monks which she appreciated because of course they werent monks at all she had a lightning impression that they were especially fond of kieth the father rector had called him kieth and one of the others had kept a hand on his shoulder all through the conversation then she was shaking hands again and promising to come back a little later for some icecream and smiling and smiling and being rather absurdly happy she told herself that it was because kieth was so delighted in showing her off then she and kieth were strolling along a path arm in arm and he was informing her what an absolute jewel the father rector was lois he broken off suddenly i want to tell you before we go any farther how much it means to me to have you come up here i think it was mighty sweet of you i know what a gay time youve been having lois gasped she was not prepared for this at first when she had conceived the plan of taking the hot journey down to baltimore staying the night with a friend and then coming out to see her brother she had felt rather consciously virtuous hoped he wouldnt be priggish or resentful about her not having come before but walking here with him under the trees seemed such a little thing and surprisingly a happy thing why kieth she said quickly you know i couldnt have waited a day longer i saw you when i was five but of course i didnt remember and how could i have gone on without practically ever having seen my only brother it was mighty sweet of you lois he repeated lois blushed he did have personality i want you to tell me all about yourself he said after a pause of course i have a general idea what you and mother did in europe those fourteen years and then we were all so worried lois when you had pneumonia and couldnt come down with mother lets see that was two years ago and then well ive seen your name in the papers but its all been so unsatisfactory i havent known you lois she found herself analyzing his personality as she analyzed the personality of every man she met she wondered if the effect of of intimacy that he gave was bred by his constant repetition of her name he said it as if he loved the word as if it had an inherent meaning to him then you were at school he continued yes at farmington mother wanted me to go to a convent but i didnt want to she cast a side glance at him to see if he would resent this but he only nodded slowly had enough convents abroad eh yes and kieth convents are different there anyway here even in the nicest ones there are so many common girls he nodded again yes he agreed i suppose there are and i know how you feel about it it grated on me here at first lois though i wouldnt say that to any one but you were rather sensitive you and i to things like this you mean the men here yes some of them of course were fine the sort of men id always been thrown with but there were others a man named regan for instance i hated the fellow and now hes about the best friend i have a wonderful character lois youll meet him later sort of man youd like to have with you in a fight lois was thinking that kieth was the sort of man shed like to have with her in a fight how did you how did you first happen to do it she asked rather shyly to come here i mean of course mother told me the story about the pullman car oh that he looked rather annoyed tell me that id like to hear you tell it oh its nothing except what you probably know it was evening and id been riding all day and thinking about about a hundred things lois and then suddenly i had a sense that some one was sitting across from me felt that hed been there for some time and had a vague idea that he was another traveller all at once he leaned over toward me and i heard a voice say i want you to be a priest thats what i want well i jumped up and cried out oh my god not that made an idiot of myself before about twenty people you see there wasnt any one sitting there at all a week after that i went to the jesuit college in philadelphia and crawled up the last flight of stairs to the rectors office on my hands and knees there was another silence and lois saw that her brothers eyes wore a faraway look that he was staring unseeingly out over the sunny fields she was stirred by the modulations of his voice and the sudden silence that seemed to flow about him when he finished speaking she noticed now that his eyes were of the same fibre as hers with the green left out and that his mouth was much gentler really than in the picture or was it that the face had grown up to it lately he was getting a little bald just on top of his head she wondered if that was from wearing a hat so much it seemed awful for a man to grow bald and no one to care about it were you pious when you were young kieth she asked you know what i mean were you religious if you dont mind these personal questions yes he said with his eyes still far away and she felt that his intense abstraction was as much a part of his personality as his attention yes i suppose i was when i was sober lois thrilled slightly did you drink he nodded i was on the way to making a bad hash of things he smiled and turning his gray eyes on her changed the subject child tell me about mother i know its been awfully hard for you there lately i know youve had to sacrifice a lot and put up with a great deal and i want you to know how fine of you i think it is i feel lois that youre sort of taking the place of both of us there lois thought quickly how little she had sacrificed how lately she had constantly avoided her nervous halfinvalid mother youth shouldnt be sacrificed to age kieth she said steadily i know he sighed and you oughtnt to have the weight on your shoulders child i wish i were there to help you she saw how quickly he had turned her remark and instantly she knew what this quality was that he gave off he was sweet her thoughts went of on a sidetrack and then she broke the silence with an odd remark sweetness is hard she said suddenly what nothing she denied in confusion i didnt mean to speak aloud i was thinking of something of a conversation with a man named freddy kebble maury kebbles brother yes she said rather surprised to think of him having known maury kebble still there was nothing strange about it well he and i were talking about sweetness a few weeks ago oh i dont know i said that a man named howard that a man i knew was sweet and he didnt agree with me and we began talking about what sweetness in a man was he kept telling me i meant a sort of soppy softness but i knew i didnt yet i didnt know exactly how to put it i see now i meant just the opposite i suppose real sweetness is a sort of hardness and strength kieth nodded i see what you mean ive known old priests who had it im talking about young men she said rather defiantly they had reached the now deserted baseball diamond and pointing her to a wooden bench he sprawled full length on the grass are these young men happy here kieth dont they look happy lois i suppose so but those young ones those two we just passed have they are they are they signed up he laughed no but they will be next month permanently yes unless they break down mentally or physically of course in a discipline like ours a lot drop out but those boys are they giving up fine chances outside like you did he nodded some of them but kieth they dont know what theyre doing they havent had any experience of what theyre missing no i suppose not it doesnt seem fair life has just sort of scared them at first do they all come in so young no some of them have knocked around led pretty wild lives regan for instance i should think that sort would be better she said meditatively men that had seen life no said kieth earnestly im not sure that knocking about gives a man the sort of experience he can communicate to others some of the broadest men ive known have been absolutely rigid about themselves and reformed libertines are a notoriously intolerant class dont you thank so lois she nodded still meditative and he continued it seems to me that when one weak reason goes to another it isnt help they want its a sort of companionship in guilt lois after you were born when mother began to get nervous she used to go and weep with a certain mrs comstock lord it used to make me shiver she said it comforted her poor old mother no i dont think that to help others youve got to show yourself at all real help comes from a stronger person whom you respect and their sympathy is all the bigger because its impersonal but people want human sympathy objected lois they want to feel the other persons been tempted lois in their hearts they want to feel that the other persons been weak thats what they mean by human here in this old monkery lois he continued with a smile they try to get all that selfpity and pride in our own wills out of us right at the first they put us to scrubbing floors and other things its like that idea of saving your life by losing it you see we sort of feel that the less human a man is in your sense of human the better servant he can be to humanity we carry it out to the end too when one of us dies his family cant even have him then hes buried here under plain wooden cross with a thousand others his tone changed suddenly and he looked at her with a great brightness in his gray eyes but way back in a mans heart there are some things he cant get rid of an one of them is that im awfully in love with my little sister with a sudden impulse she knelt beside him in the grass and leaning over kissed his forehead youre hard kieth she said and i love you for it and youre sweet iii back in the receptionroom lois met a halfdozen more of kieths particular friends there was a young man named jarvis rather pale and delicatelooking who she knew must be a grandson of old mrs jarvis at home and she mentally compared this ascetic with a brace of his riotous uncles and there was regan with a scarred face and piercing intent eyes that followed her about the room and often rested on kieth with something very like worship she knew then what kieth had meant about a good man to have with you in a fight hes the missionary type she thought vaguely china or something i want kieths sister to show us what the shimmy is demanded one young man with a broad grin lois laughed im afraid the father rector would send me shimmying out the gate besides im not an expert im sure it wouldnt be best for jimmys soul anyway said kieth solemnly hes inclined to brood about things like shimmys they were just starting to do the maxixe wasnt it jimmy when he became a monk and it haunted him his whole first year youd see him when he was peeling potatoes putting his arm around the bucket and making irreligious motions with his feet there was a general laugh in which lois joined an old lady who comes here to mass sent kieth this icecream whispered jarvis under cover of the laugh because shed heard you were coming its pretty good isnt it there were tears trembling in lois eyes iv then half an hour later over in the chapel things suddenly went all wrong it was several years since lois had been at benediction and at first she was thrilled by the gleaming monstrance with its central spot of white the air rich and heavy with incense and the sun shining through the stainedglass window of st francis xavier overhead and falling in warm red tracery on the cassock of the man in front of her but at the first notes of the o salutaris hostia a heavy weight seemed to descend upon her soul kieth was on her right and young jarvis on her left and she stole uneasy glance at both of them whats the matter with me she thought impatiently she looked again was there a certain coldness in both their profiles that she had not noticed before a pallor about the mouth and a curious set expression in their eyes she shivered slightly they were like dead men she felt her soul recede suddenly from kieths this was her brother this this unnatural person she caught herself in the act of a little laugh what is the matter with me she passed her hand over her eyes and the weight increased the incense sickened her and a stray ragged note from one of the tenors in the choir grated on her ear like the shriek of a slatepencil she fidgeted and raising her hand to her hair touched her forehead found moisture on it its hot in here hot as the deuce again she repressed a faint laugh and then in an instant the weight on her heart suddenly diffused into cold fear it was that candle on the altar it was all wrong wrong why didnt somebody see it there was something in it there was something coming out of it taking form and shape above it she tried to fight down her rising panic told herself it was the wick if the wick wasnt straight candles did something but they didnt do this with incalculable rapidity a force was gathering within her a tremendous assimilative force drawing from every sense every corner of her brain and as it surged up inside her she felt an enormous terrified repulsion she drew her arms in close to her side away from kieth and jarvis something in that candle she was leaning forward in another moment she felt she would go forward toward it didnt any one see it anyone ugh she felt a space beside her and something told her that jarvis had gasped and sat down very suddenly then she was kneeling and as the flaming monstrance slowly left the altar in the hands of the priest she heard a great rushing noise in her ears the crash of the bells was like hammerblows and then in a moment that seemed eternal a great torrent rolled over her heart there was a shouting there and a lashing as of waves she was calling felt herself calling for kieth her lips mouthing the words that would not come kieth oh my god kieth suddenly she became aware of a new presence something external in front of her consummated and expressed in warm red tracery then she knew it was the window of st francis xavier her mind gripped at it clung to it finally and she felt herself calling again endlessly impotently kieth kieth then out of a great stillness came a voice blessed be god with a gradual rumble sounded the response rolling heavily through the chapel blessed be god the words sang instantly in her heart the incense lay mystically and sweetly peaceful upon the air and the candle on the altar went out blessed be his holy name blessed be his holy name everything blurred into a swinging mist with a sound halfgasp halfcry she rocked on her feet and reeled backward into kieths suddenly outstretched arms v lie still child she closed her eyes again she was on the grass outside pillowed on kieths arm and regan was dabbing her head with a cold towel im all right she said quietly i know but just lie still a minute longer it was too hot in there jarvis felt it too she laughed as regan again touched her gingerly with the towel im all right she repeated but though a warm peace was falling her mind and heart she felt oddly broken and chastened as if some one had held her stripped soul up and laughed vi half an hour later she walked leaning on kieths arm down the long central path toward the gate its been such a short afternoon he sighed and im so sorry you were sick lois kieth im feeling fine now really i wish you wouldnt worry poor old child i didnt realize that benedictiond be a long service for you after your hot trip out here and all she laughed cheerfully i guess the truth is im not much used to benediction mass is the limit of my religious exertions she paused and then continued quickly i dont want to shock you kieth but i cant tell you how how inconvenient being a catholic is it really doesnt seem to apply any more as far as morals go some of the wildest boys i know are catholics and the brightest boys i mean the ones who think and read a lot dont seem to believe in much of anything any more tell me about it the bus wont be here for another halfhour they sat down on a bench by the path for instance gerald carter hes published a novel he absolutely roars when people mention immortality and then howa well another man ive known well lately who was phi beta kappa at harvard says that no intelligent person can believe in supernatural christianity he says christ was a great socialist though am i shocking you she broke off suddenly kieth smiled you cant shock a monk hes a professional shockabsorber well she continued thats about all it seems so so narrow church schools for instance theres more freedom about things that catholic people cant see like birth control kieth winced almost imperceptibly but lois saw it oh she said quickly everybody talks about everything now its probably better that way oh yes much better well thats all kieth i just wanted to tell you why im a little lukewarm at present im not shocked lois i understand better than you think we all go through those times but i know itll come out all right child theres that gift of faith that we have you and i thatll carry us past the bad spots he rose as he spoke and they started again down the path i want you to pray for me sometimes lois i think your prayers would be about what i need because weve come very close in these few hours i think her eyes were suddenly shining oh we have we have she cried i feel closer to you now than to any one in the world he stopped suddenly and indicated the side of the path we might just a minute it was a pietа a lifesize statue of the blessed virgin set within a semicircle of rocks feeling a little selfconscious she dropped on her knees beside him and made an unsuccessful attempt at prayer she was only half through when he rose he took her arm again i wanted to thank her for letting as have this day together he said simply lois felt a sudden lump in her throat and she wanted to say something that would tell him how much it had meant to her too but she found no words ill always remember this he continued his voice trembling a little this summer day with you its been just what i expected youre just what i expected lois im awfully glad keith you see when you were little they kept sending me snapshots of you first as a baby and then as a child in socks playing on the beach with a pail and shovel and then suddenly as a wistful little girl with wondering pure eyes and i used to build dreams about you a man has to have something living to cling to i think lois it was your little white soul i tried to keep near me even when life was at its loudest and every intellectual idea of god seemed the sheerest mockery and desire and love and a million things came up to me and said look here at me see im life youre turning your back on it all the way through that shadow lois i could always see your baby soul flitting on ahead of me very frail and clear and wonderful lois was crying softly they had reached the gate and she rested her elbow on it and dabbed furiously at her eyes and then later child when you were sick i knelt all one night and asked god to spare you for me for i knew then that i wanted more he had taught me to want more i wanted to know you moved and breathed in the same world with me i saw you growing up that white innocence of yours changing to a flame and burning to give light to other weaker souls and then i wanted some day to take your children on my knee and hear them call the crabbed old monk uncle kieth he seemed to be laughing now as he talked oh lois lois i was asking god for more then i wanted the letters youd write me and the place id have at your table i wanted an awful lot lois dear youve got me kieth she sobbed you know it say you know it oh im acting like a baby but i didnt think youd be this way and i oh kieth kieth he took her hand and patted it softly heres the bus youll come again wont you she put her hands on his cheeks add drawing his head down pressed her tearwet face against his oh kieth brother some day ill tell you something he helped her in saw her take down her handkerchief and smile bravely at him as the driver kicked his whip and the bus rolled off then a thick cloud of dust rose around it and she was gone for a few minutes he stood there on the road his hand on the gatepost his lips half parted in a smile lois he said aloud in a sort of wonder lois lois later some probationers passing noticed him kneeling before the pietа and coming back after a time found him still there and he was there until twilight came down and the courteous trees grew garrulous overhead and the crickets took up their burden of song in the dusky grass vii the first clerk in the telegraph booth in the baltimore station whistled through his buck teeth at the second clerk smatter see that girl no the pretty one with the big black dots on her veil too late shes gone you missed somepn what about her nothing cept shes damn goodlooking came in here yesterday and sent a wire to some guy to meet her somewhere then a minute ago she came in with a telegram all written out and was standin there goin to give it to me when she changed her mind or somepn and all of a sudden tore it up hm the first clerk came around tile counter and picking up the two pieces of paper from the floor put them together idly the second clerk read them over his shoulder and subconsciously counted the words as he read there were just thirteen this is in the way of a permanent goodbye i should suggest italy lois tore it up eh said the second clerk dalyrimple goes wrong in the millennium an educational genius will write a book to be given to every young man on the date of his disillusion this work will have the flavor of montaignes essays and samuel butlers notebooks and a little of tolstoi and marcus aurelius it will be neither cheerful nor pleasant but will contain numerous passages of striking humor since firstclass minds never believe anything very strongly until theyve experienced it its value will be purely relative all people over thirty will refer to it as depressing this prelude belongs to the story of a young man who lived as you and i do before the book ii the generation which numbered bryan dalyrimple drifted out of adolescence to a mighty fanfare of trumpets bryan played the star in an affair which included a lewis gun and a nineday romp behind the retreating german lines so luck triumphant or sentiment rampant awarded him a row of medals and on his arrival in the states he was told that he was second in importance only to general pershing and sergeant york this was a lot of fun the governor of his state a stray congressman and a citizens committee gave him enormous smiles and by god sirs on the dock at hoboken there were newspaper reporters and photographers who said would you mind and if you could just and back in his home town there were old ladies the rims of whose eyes grew red as they talked to him and girls who hadnt remembered him so well since his fathers business went blah in nineteentwelve but when the shouting died he realized that for a month he had been the house guest of the mayor that he had only fourteen dollars in the world and that the name that will live forever in the annals and legends of this state was already living there very quietly and obscurely one morning he lay late in bed and just outside his door he heard the upstairs maid talking to the cook the upstairs maid said that mrs hawkins the mayors wife had been trying for a week to hint dalyrimple out of the house he left at eleven oclock in intolerable confusion asking that his trunk be sent to mrs beebes boardinghouse dalyrimple was twentythree and he had never worked his father had given him two years at the state university and passed away about the time of his sons nineday romp leaving behind him some midvictorian furniture and a thin packet of folded paper that turned out to be grocery bills young dalyrimple had very keen gray eyes a mind that delighted the army psychological examiners a trick of having read it whatever it was some time before and a cool hand in a hot situation but these things did not save him a final unresigned sigh when he realized that he had to go to work right away it was early afternoon when he walked into the office of theron g macy who owned the largest wholesale grocery house in town plump prosperous wearing a pleasant but quite unhumorous smile theron g macy greeted him warmly well how do bryan whats on your mind to dalyrimple straining with his admission his own words when they came sounded like an arab beggars whine for alms why this question of a job this question of a job seemed somehow more clothed than just a job a job an almost imperceptible breeze blew across mr macys expression you see mr macy continued dalyrimple i feel im wasting time i want to get started at something i had several chances about a month ago but they all seem to have gone lets see interrupted mr macy what were they well just at the first the governor said something about a vacancy on his staff i was sort of counting on that for a while but i hear hes given it to allen gregg you know son of g p gregg he sort of forgot what he said to me just talking i guess you ought to push those things then there was that engineering expedition but they decided theyd have to have a man who knew hydraulics so they couldnt use me unless i paid my own way you had just a year at the university two but i didnt take any science or mathematics well the day the battalion paraded mr peter jordan said something about a vacancy in his store i went around there today and i found he meant a sort of floorwalker and then you said something one day he paused and waited for the older man to take him up but noting only a minute wince continued about a position so i thought id come and see you there was a position confessed mr macy reluctantly but since then weve filled it he cleared his throat again youve waited quite a while yes i suppose i did everybody told me there was no hurry and id had these various offers mr macy delivered a paragraph on presentday opportunities which dalyrimples mind completely skipped have you had any business experience i worked on a ranch two summers as a rider oh well mr macy disparaged this neatly and then continued what do you think youre worth i dont know well bryan i tell you im willing to strain a point and give you a chance dalyrimple nodded your salary wont be much youll start by learning the stock then youll come in the office for a while then youll go on the road when could you begin how about tomorrow all right report to mr hanson in the stockroom hell start you off he continued to regard dalyrimple steadily until the latter realizing that the interview was over rose awkwardly well mr macy im certainly much obliged thats all right glad to help you bryan after an irresolute moment dalyrimple found himself in the hall his forehead was covered with perspiration and the room had not been hot why the devil did i thank the son of a gun he muttered iii next morning mr hanson informed him coldly of the necessity of punching the timeclock at seven every morning and delivered him for instruction into the hands of a fellow worker one charley moore charley was twentysix with that faint musk of weakness hanging about him that is often mistaken for the scent of evil it took no psychological examiner to decide that he had drifted into indulgence and laziness as casually as he had drifted into life and was to drift out he was pale and his clothes stank of smoke he enjoyed burlesque shows billiards and robert service and was always looking back upon his last intrigue or forward to his next one in his youth his taste had run to loud ties but now it seemed to have faded like his vitality and was expressed in palelilac fourinhands and indeterminate gray collars charley was listlessly struggling that losing struggle against mental moral and physical anжmia that takes place ceaselessly on the lower fringe of the middle classes the first morning he stretched himself on a row of cereal cartons and carefully went over the limitations of the theron g macy company its a piker organization my gosh lookit what they give me im quittin in a coupla months hell me stay with this bunch the charley moores are always going to change jobs next month they do once or twice in their careers after which they sit around comparing their last job with the present one to the infinite disparagement of the latter what do you get asked dalyrimple curiously me i get sixty this rather defiantly did you start at sixty me no i started at thirtyfive he told me hed put me on the road after i learned the stock thats what he tells em all how longve you been here asked dalyrimple with a sinking sensation me four years my last year too you bet your boots dalyrimple rather resented the presence of the store detective as he resented the timeclock and he came into contact with him almost immediately through the rule against smoking this rule was a thorn in his side he was accustomed to his three or four cigarettes in a morning and after three days without it he followed charley moore by a circuitous route up a flight of back stairs to a little balcony where they indulged in peace but this was not for long one day in his second week the detective met him in a nook of the stairs on his descent and told him sternly that next time hed be reported to mr macy dalyrimple felt like an errant schoolboy unpleasant facts came to his knowledge there were cavedwellers in the basement who had worked there for ten or fifteen years at sixty dollars a month rolling barrels and carrying boxes through damp cementwalled corridors lost in that echoing halfdarkness between seven and fivethirty and like himself compelled several times a month to work until nine at night at the end of a month he stood in line and received forty dollars he pawned a cigarettecase and a pair of fieldglasses and managed to live to eat sleep and smoke it was however a narrow scrape as the ways and means of economy were a closed book to him and the second month brought no increase he voiced his alarm if youve got a drag with old macy maybe hell raise you was charleys disheartening reply but he didnt raise me till id been here nearly two years ive got to live said dalyrimple simply i could get more pay as a laborer on the railroad but golly i want to feel im where theres a chance to get ahead charles shook his head sceptically and mr macys answer next day was equally unsatisfactory dalyrimple had gone to the office just before closing time mr macy id like to speak to you why yes the unhumorous smile appeared the voice vas faintly resentful i want to speak to you in regard to more salary mr macy nodded well he said doubtfully i dont know exactly what youre doing ill speak to mr hanson he knew exactly what dalyrimple was doing and dalyrimple knew he knew im in the stockroom and sir while im here id like to ask you how much longer ill have to stay there why im not sure exactly of course it takes some time to learn the stock you told me two months when i started yes well ill speak to mr hanson dalyrimple paused irresolute thank you sir two days later he again appeared in the office with the result of a count that had been asked for by mr hesse the bookkeeper mr hesse was engaged and dalyrimple waiting began idly fingering in a ledger on the stenographers desk half unconsciously he turned a page he caught sight of his name it was a salary list dalyrimple demming donahoe everett his eyes stopped everett so tom everett macys weakchinned nephew had started at sixty and in three weeks he had been out of the packingroom and into the office so that was it he was to sit and see man after man pushed over him sons cousins sons of friends irrespective of their capabilities while he was cast for a pawn with going on the road dangled before his eyes put of with the stock remark ill see ill look into it at forty perhaps he would be a bookkeeper like old hesse tired listless hesse with a dull routine for his stint and a dull background of boardinghouse conversation this was a moment when a genii should have pressed into his hand the book for disillusioned young men but the book has not been written a great protest swelling into revolt surged up in him ideas half forgotten chaoticly perceived and assimilated filled his mind get on that was the rule of life and that was all how he did it didnt matter but to be hesse or charley moore i wont he cried aloud the bookkeeper and the stenographers looked up in surprise what for a second dalyrimple stared then walked up to the desk heres that data he said brusquely i cant wait any longer mr hesses face expressed surprise it didnt matter what he did just so he got out of this rut in a dream he stepped from the elevator into the stockroom and walking to an unused aisle sat down on a box covering his face with his hands his brain was whirring with the frightful jar of discovering a platitude for himself ive got to get out of this he said aloud and then repeated ive got to get out and he didnt mean only out of macys wholesale house when he left at fivethirty it was pouring rain but he struck off in the opposite direction from his boardinghouse feeling in the first cool moisture that oozed soggily through his old suit an odd exultation and freshness he wanted a world that was like walking through rain even though he could not see far ahead of him but fate had put him in the world of mr macys fetid storerooms and corridors at first merely the overwhelming need of change took him then halfplans began to formulate in his imagination ill go east to a big city meet people bigger people people wholl help me interesting work somewhere my god there must be with sickening truth it occurred to him that his facility for meeting people was limited of all places it was here in his own town that he should be known was known famous before the water of oblivion had rolled over him you had to cut corners that was all pull relationship wealthy marriages for several miles the continued reiteration of this preoccupied him and then he perceived that the rain had become thicker and more opaque in the heavy gray of twilight and that the houses were falling away the district of full blocks then of big houses then of scattering little ones passed and great sweeps of misty country opened out on both sides it was hard walking here the sidewalk had given place to a dirt road streaked with furious brown rivulets that splashed and squashed around his shoes cutting corners the words began to fall apart forming curious phrasings little illuminated pieces of themselves they resolved into sentences each of which had a strangely familiar ring cutting corners meant rejecting the old childhood principles that success came from faithfulness to duty that evil was necessarily punished or virtue necessarily rewarded that honest poverty was happier than corrupt riches it meant being hard this phrase appealed to him and he repeated it over and over it had to do somehow with mr macy and charley moore the attitudes the methods of each of them he stopped and felt his clothes he was drenched to the skin he looked about him and selecting a place in the fence where a tree sheltered it perched himself there in my credulous years he thought they told me that evil was a sort of dirty hue just as definite as a soiled collar but it seems to me that evil is only a manner of hard luck or heredityandenvironment or being found out it hides in the vacillations of dubs like charley moore as certainly as it does in the intolerance of macy and if it ever gets much more tangible it becomes merely an arbitrary label to paste on the unpleasant things in other peoples lives in fact he concluded it isnt worth worrying over whats evil and what isnt good and evil arent any standard to me and they can be a devil of a bad hindrance when i want something when i want something bad enough common sense tells me to go and take it and not get caught and then suddenly dalyrimple knew what he wanted first he wanted fifteen dollars to pay his overdue board bill with a furious energy he jumped from the fence whipped off his coat and from its black lining cut with his knife a piece about five inches square he made two holes near its edge and then fixed it on his face pulling his hat down to hold it in place it flapped grotesquely and then dampened and clung clung to his forehead and cheeks now the twilight had merged to dripping dusk black as pitch he began to walk quickly back toward town not waiting to remove the mask but watching the road with difficulty through the jagged eyeholes he was not conscious of any nervousness the only tension was caused by a desire to do the thing as soon as possible he reached the first sidewalk continued on until he saw a hedge far from any lamppost and turned in behind it within a minute he heard several series of footsteps he waited it was a woman and he held his breath until she passed and then a man a laborer the next passer he felt would be what he wanted the laborers footfalls died far up the drenched street other steps grew nears grew suddenly louder dalyrimple braced himself put up your hands the man stopped uttered an absurd little grunt and thrust pudgy arms skyward dalyrimple went through the waistcoat now you shrimp he said setting his hand suggestively to his own hip pocket you run and stamp loud if i hear your feet stop ill put a shot after you then he stood there in sudden uncontrollable laughter as audibly frightened footsteps scurried away into the night after a moment he thrust the roll of bills into his pocket snatched of his mask and running quickly across the street darted down an alley iv yet however dalyrimple justified himself intellectually he had many bad moments in the weeks immediately following his decision the tremendous pressure of sentiment and inherited ambition kept raising riot with his attitude he felt morally lonely the noon after his first venture he ate in a little lunchroom with charley moore and watching him unspread the paper waited for a remark about the holdup of the day before but either the holdup was not mentioned or charley wasnt interested he turned listlessly to the sporting sheet read doctor cranes crop of seasoned bromides took in an editorial on ambition with his mouth slightly ajar and then skipped to mutt and jeff poor charley with his faint aura of evil and his mind that refused to focus playing a lifeless solitaire with castoff mischief yet charley belonged on the other side of the fence in him could be stirred up all the flamings and denunciations of righteousness he would weep at a stage heroines lost virtue he could become lofty and contemptuous at the idea of dishonor on my side thought dalyrimple there arent any restingplaces a man whos a strong criminal is after the weak criminals as well so its all guerilla warfare over here what will it all do to me he thoughts with a persistent weariness will it take the color out of life with the honor will it scatter my courage and dull my mind despiritualize me completely does it mean eventual barrenness eventual remorse failure with a great surge of anger he would fling his mind upon the barrier and stand there with the flashing bayonet of his pride other men who broke the laws of justice and charity lied to all the world he at any rate would not lie to himself he was more than byronic now not the spiritual rebel don juan not the philosophical rebel faust but a new psychological rebel of his own century defying the sentimental a priori forms of his own mind happiness was what he wanted a slowly rising scale of gratifications of the normal appetites and he had a strong conviction that the materials if not the inspiration of happiness could be bought with money v the night came that drew him out upon his second venture and as he walked the dark street he felt in himself a great resemblance to a cat a certain supple swinging litheness his muscles were rippling smoothly and sleekly under his spare healthy flesh he had an absurd desire to bound along the street to run dodging among trees to tarn cartwheels over soft grass it was not crisp but in the air lay a faint suggestion of acerbity inspirational rather than chilling the moon is down i have not heard the clock he laughed in delight at the line which an early memory had endowed with a hushed awesome beauty he passed a man and then another a quarter of mile afterward he was on philmore street now and it was very dark he blessed the city council for not having put in new lampposts as a recent budget had recommended here was the redbrick sterner residence which marked the beginning of the avenue here was the jordon house the eisenhaurs the dents the markhams the frasers the hawkins where he had been a guest the willoughbys the everetts colonial and ornate the little cottage where lived the watts old maids between the imposing fronts of the macys and the krupstadts the craigs ah there he paused wavered violently far up the street was a blot a man walking possibly a policeman after an eternal second be found himself following the vague ragged shadow of a lamppost across a lawn running bent very low then he was standing tense without breath or need of it in the shadow of his limestone prey interminably he listened a mile off a cat howled a hundred yards away another took up the hymn in a demoniacal snarl and he felt his heart dip and swoop acting as shockabsorber for his mind there were other sounds the faintest fragment of song far away strident gossiping laughter from a back porch diagonally across the alley and crickets crickets singing in the patched patterned moonlit grass of the yard within the house there seemed to lie an ominous silence he was glad he did not know who lived here his slight shiver hardened to steel the steel softened and his nerves became pliable as leather gripping his hands he gratefully found them supple and taking out knife and pliers he went to work on the screen so sure was he that he was unobserved that from the diningroom where in a minute he found himself he leaned out and carefully pulled the screen up into position balancing it so it would neither fall by chance nor be a serious obstacle to a sudden exit then he put the open knife in his coat pocket took out his pocketflash and tiptoed around the room there was nothing here he could use the diningroom had never been included in his plans for the town was too small to permit disposing of silver as a matter of fact his plans were of the vaguest he had found that with a mind like his lucrative in intelligence intuition and lightning decision it was best to have but the skeleton of a campaign the machinegun episode had taught him that and he was afraid that a method preconceived would give him two points of view in a crisis and two points of view meant wavering he stumbled slightly on a chair held his breath listened went on found the hall found the stairs started up the seventh stair creaked at his step the ninth the fourteenth he was counting them automatically at the third creak he paused again for over a minute and in that minute he felt more alone than he had ever felt before between the lines on patrol even when alone he had had behind him the moral support of half a billion people now he was alone pitted against that same moral pressure a bandit he had never felt this fear yet he had never felt this exultation the stairs came to an end a doorway approached he went in and listened to regular breathing his feet were economical of steps and his body swayed sometimes at stretching as he felt over the bureau pocketing all articles which held promise he could not have enumerated them ten seconds afterward he felt on a chair for possible trousers found soft garments womens lingerie the corners of his mouth smiled mechanically another room the same breathing enlivened by one ghastly snort that sent his heart again on its tour of his breast round object watch chain roll of bills stickpins two rings he remembered that he had got rings from the other bureau he started out winced as a faint glow flashed in front of him facing him god it was the glow of his own wristwatch on his outstretched arm down the stairs he skipped two crumbing steps but found another he was all right now practically safe as he neared the bottom he felt a slight boredom he reached the diningroom considered the silver again decided against it back in his room at the boardinghouse he examined the additions to his personal property sixtyfive dollars in bills a platinum ring with three medium diamonds worth probably about seven hundred dollars diamonds were going up a cheap goldplated ring with the initials o s and the date inside probably a classring from school worth a few dollars unsalable a redcloth case containing a set of false teeth a silver watch a gold chain worth more than the watch an empty ringbox a little ivory chinese god probably a desk ornament a dollar and sixtytwo cents an small change he put the money under his pillow and the other things in the toe of an infantry boot stuffing a stocking in on top of them then for two hours his mind raced like a highpower engine here and there through his life past and future through fear and laughter with a vague inopportune wish that he were married he fell into a deep sleep about half past five vi though the newspaper account of the burglary failed to mention the false teeth they worried him considerably the picture of a human waking in the cool dawn and groping for them in vain of a soft toothless breakfast of a strange hollow lisping voice calling the police station of weary dispirited visits to the dentist roused a great fatherly pity in him trying to ascertain whether they belonged to a man or a woman he took them carefully out of the case and held them up near his mouth he moved his own jaws experimentally he measured with his fingers but he failed to decide they might belong either to a largemouthed woman or a smallmouthed man on a warm impulse he wrapped them in brown paper from the bottom of his army trunk and printed false teeth on the package in clumsy pencil letters then the next night he walked down philmore street and shied the package onto the lawn so that it would be near the door next day the paper announced that the police had a clew they knew that the burglar was in town however they didnt mention what the clew was vii at the end of a month burglar bill of the silver district was the nursegirls standby for frightening children five burglaries were attributed to him but though dalyrimple had only committed three he considered that majority had it and appropriated the title to himself he had once been seen a large bloated creature with the meanest face you ever laid eyes on mrs henry coleman awaking at two oclock at the beam of an electric torch flashed in her eye could not have been expected to recognize bryan dalyrimple at whom she had waved flags last fourth of july and whom she had described as not at all the daredevil type do you think when dalyrimple kept his imagination at white heat he managed to glorify his own attitude his emancipation from petty scruples and remorses but let him once allow his thought to rove unarmored great unexpected horrors and depressions would overtake him then for reassurance he had to go back to think out the whole thing over again he found that it was on the whole better to give up considering himself as a rebel it was more consoling to think of every one else as a fool his attitude toward mr macy underwent a change he no longer felt a dim animosity and inferiority in his presence as his fourth month in the store ended he found himself regarding his employer in a manner that was almost fraternal he had a vague but very assured conviction that mr macys innermost soul would have abetted and approved he no longer worried about his future he had the intention of accumulating several thousand dollars and then clearing out going east back to france down to south america half a dozen times in the last two months he had been about to stop work but a fear of attracting attention to his being in funds prevented him so he worked on no longer in listlessness but with contemptuous amusement viii then with astounding suddenness something happened that changed his plans and put an end to his burglaries mr macy sent for him one afternoon and with a great show of jovial mystery asked him if he had an engagement that night if he hadnt would he please call on mr alfred j fraser at eight oclock dalyrimples wonder was mingled with uncertainty he debated with himself whether it were not his cue to take the first train out of town but an hours consideration decided him that his fears were unfounded and at eight oclock he arrived at the big fraser house in philmore avenue mr fraser was commonly supposed to be the biggest political influence in the city his brother was senator fraser his soninlaw was congressman demming and his influence though not wielded in such a way as to make him an objectionable boss was strong nevertheless he had a great huge face deepset eyes and a barndoor of an upper lip the melange approaching a worthy climax if a long professional jaw during his conversation with dalyrimple his expression kept starting toward a smile reached a cheerful optimism and then receded back to imperturbability how do you do sir he laid holding out his hand sit down i suppose youre wondering why i wanted you sit down dalyrimple sat down mr dalyrimple how old are you im twentythree youre young but that doesnt mean youre foolish mr dalyrimple what ive got to say wont take long im going to make you a proposition to begin at the beginning ive been watching you ever since last fourth of july when you made that speech in response to the lovingcup dalyrimple murmured disparagingly but fraser waved him to silence it was a speech ive remembered it was a brainy speech straight from the shoulder and it got to everybody in that crowd i know ive watched crowds for years he cleared his throat as if tempted to digress on his knowledge of crowds then continued but mr dalyrimple ive seen too many young men who promised brilliantly go to pieces fail through want of steadiness too many highpower ideas and not enough willingness to work so i waited i wanted to see what youd do i wanted to see if youd go to work and if youd stick to what you started dalyrimple felt a glow settle over him so continued fraser when theron macy told me youd started down at his place i kept watching you and i followed your record through him the first month i was afraid for awhile he told me you were getting restless too good for your job hinting around for a raise dalyrimple started but he said after that you evidently made up your mind to shut up and stick to it thats the stuff i like in a young man thats the stuff that wins out and dont think i dont understand i know how much harder it was for you after all that silly flattery a lot of old women had been giving you i know what a fight it must have been dalyrimples face was burning brightly it felt young and strangely ingenuous dalyrimple youve got brains and youve got the stuff in you and thats what i want im going to put you into the state senate the what the state senate we want a young man who has got brains but is solid and not a loafer and when i say state senate i dont stop there were up against it here dalyrimple weve got to get some young men into politics you know the old blood thats been running on the party ticket year in and year out dalyrimple licked his lips youll run me for the state senate ill put you in the state senate mr frasers expression had now reached the point nearest a smile and dalyrimple in a happy frivolity felt himself urging it mentally on but it stopped locked and slid from him the barndoor and the jaw were separated by a line strait as a nail dalyrimple remembered with an effort that it was a mouth and talked to it but im through he said my notorietys dead people are fed up with me those things answered mr fraser are mechanical linotype is a resuscitator of reputations wait till you see the herald beginning next week that is if youre with us that is and his voice hardened slightly if you havent got too many ideas yourself about how things ought to be run no said dalyrimple looking him frankly in the eye youll have to give me a lot of advice at first very well ill take care of your reputation then just keep yourself on the right side of the fence dalyrimple started at this repetition of a phrase he had thought of so much lately there was a sudden ring at the doorbell thats macy now observed fraser rising ill go let him in the servants have gone to bed he left dalyrimple there in a dream the world was opening up suddenly the state senate the united states senate so life was this after all cutting corners common sense that was the rule no more foolish risks now unless necessity called but it was being hard that counted never to let remorse or selfreproach lose him a nights sleep let his life be a sword of courage there was no payment all that was drivel drivel he sprang to his feet with clinched hands in a sort of triumph well bryan said mr macy stepping through the portiиres the two older men smiled their halfsmiles at him well bryan said mr macy again dalyrimple smiled also how do mr macy he wondered if some telepathy between them had made this new appreciation possible some invisible realization mr macy held out his hand im glad were to be associated in this scheme ive been for you all along especially lately im glad were to be on the same side of the fence i want to thank you sir said dalyrimple simply he felt a whimsical moisture gathering back of his eyes the four fists at the present time no one i know has the slightest desire to hit samuel meredith possibly this is because a man over fifty is liable to be rather severely cracked at the impact of a hostile fist but for my part i am inclined to think that all his hitable qualities have quite vanished but it is certain that at various times in his life hitable qualities were in his face as surely as kissable qualities have ever lurked in a girls lips im sure every one has met a man like that been casually introduced even made a friend of him yet felt he was the sort who aroused passionate dislike expressed by some in the involuntary clinching of fists and in others by mutterings about takin a poke and landin a swift smash in ee eye in the juxtaposition of samuel merediths features this quality was so strong that it influenced his entire life what was it not the shape certainly for he was a pleasantlooking man from earliest youth broadbowed with gray eyes that were frank and friendly yet ive heard him tell a room full of reporters angling for a success story that hed be ashamed to tell them the truth that they wouldnt believe it that it wasnt one story but four that the public would not want to read about a man who had been walloped into prominence it all started at phillips andover academy when he was fourteen he had been brought up on a diet of caviar and bellboys legs in half the capitals of europe and it was pure luck that his mother had nervous prostration and had to delegate his education to less tender less biassed hands at andover he was given a roommate named gilly hood gilly was thirteen undersized and rather the school pet from the september day when mr merediths valet stowed samuels clothing in the best bureau and asked on departing hif there was hanything helse master samuel gilly cried out that the faculty had played him false he felt like an irate frog in whose bowl has been put goldfish good gosh he complained to his sympathetic contemporaries hes a damn stuckup willie he said are the crowd here gentlemen and i said no theyre boys and he said age didnt matter and i said who said it did let him get fresh with me the ole pieface for three weeks gilly endured in silence young samuels comments on the clothes and habits of gillys personal friends endured french phrases in conversation endured a hundred halffeminine meannesses that show what a nervous mother can do to a boy if she keeps close enough to him then a storm broke in the aquarium samuel was out a crowd had gathered to hear gilly be wrathful about his roommates latest sins he said oh i dont like the windows open at night he said except only a little bit complained gilly dont let him boss you boss me you bet he wont i open those windows i guess but the darn fool wont take turns shuttin em in the morning make him gilly why dont you im going to gilly nodded his head in fierce agreement dont you worry he neednt think im any ole butler les see you make him at this point the darn fool entered in person and included the crowd in one of his irritating smiles two boys said lo merdith the others gave him a chilly glance and went on talking to gilly but samuel seemed unsatisfied would you mind not sitting on my bed he suggested politely to two of gillys particulars who were perched very much at ease huh my bed cant you understand english this was adding insult to injury there were several comments on the beds sanitary condition and the evidence within it of animal life smatter with your old bed demanded gilly truculently the beds all right but gilly interrupted this sentence by rising and walking up to samuel he paused several inches away and eyed him fiercely you an your crazy ole bed he began you an your crazy go to it gilly murmured some one show the darn fool samuel returned the gaze coolly well he said finally its my bed he got no further for gilly hauled of and hit him succinctly in the nose yea gilly show the big bully just let him touch you hell see the group closed in on them and for the first time in his life samuel realized the insuperable inconvenience of being passionately detested he gazed around helplessly at the glowering violently hostile faces he towered a head taller than his roommate so if he hit back hed be called a bully and have half a dozen more fights on his hands within five minutes yet if he didnt he was a coward for a moment he stood there facing gillys blazing eyes and then with a sudden choking sound he forced his way through the ring and rushed from the room the month following bracketed the thirty most miserable days of his life every waking moment he was under the lashing tongues of his contemporaries his habits and mannerisms became butts for intolerable witticisms and of course the sensitiveness of adolescence was a further thorn he considered that he was a natural pariah that the unpopularity at school would follow him through life when he went home for the christmas holidays he was so despondent that his father sent him to a nerve specialist when he returned to andover he arranged to arrive late so that he could be alone in the bus during the drive from station to school of course when he had learned to keep his mouth shut every one promptly forgot all about him the next autumn with his realization that consideration for others was the discreet attitude he made good use of the clean start given him by the shortness of boyhood memory by the beginning of his senior year samuel meredith was one of the bestliked boys of his class and no one was any stronger for him than his first friend and constant companion gilly hood ii samuel became the sort of college student who in the early nineties drove tandems and coaches and tallyhos between princeton and yale and new york city to show that they appreciated the social importance of football games he believed passionately in good form his choosing of gloves his tying of ties his holding of reins were imitated by impressionable freshmen outside of his own set he was considered rather a snob but as his set was the set it never worried him he played football in the autumn drank highballs in the winter and rowed in the spring samuel despised all those who were merely sportsmen without being gentlemen or merely gentlemen without being sportsmen he live in new york and often brought home several of his friends for the weekend those were the days of the horsecar and in case of a crush it was of course the proper thing for any one of samuels set to rise and deliver his seat to a standing lady with a formal bow one night in samuels junior year he boarded a car with two of his intimates there were three vacant seats when samuel sat down he noticed a heavyeyed laboring man sitting next to him who smelt objectionably of garlic sagged slightly against samuel and spreading a little as a tired man will took up quite too much room the car had gone several blocks when it stopped for a quartet of young girls and of course the three men of the world sprang to their feet and proffered their seats with due observance of form unfortunately the laborer being unacquainted with the code of neckties and tallyhos failed to follow their example and one young lady was left at an embarrassed stance fourteen eyes glared reproachfully at the barbarian seven lips curled slightly but the object of scorn stared stolidly into the foreground in sturdy unconsciousness of his despicable conduct samuel was the most violently affected he was humiliated that any male should so conduct himself he spoke aloud theres a lady standing he said sternly that should have been quite enough but the object of scorn only looked up blankly the standing girl tittered and exchanged nervous glances with her companions but samuel was aroused theres a lady standing he repeated rather raspingly the man seemed to comprehend i pay my fare he said quietly samuel turned red and his hands clinched but the conductor was looking their way so at a warning nod from his friends he subsided into sullen gloom they reached their destination and left the car but so did the laborer who followed them swinging his little pail seeing his chance samuel no longer resisted his aristocratic inclination he turned around and launching a fullfeatured dimenovel sneer made a loud remark about the right of the lower animals to ride with human beings in a halfsecond the workman had dropped his pail and let fly at him unprepared samuel took the blow neatly on the jaw and sprawled full length into the cobblestone gutter dont laugh at me cried his assailant i been workin all day im tired as hell as he spoke the sudden anger died out of his eyes and the mask of weariness dropped again over his face he turned and picked up his pail samuels friends took a quick step in his direction wait samuel had risen slowly and was motioning back some time somewhere he had been struck like that before then he remembered gilly hood in the silence as he dusted himself off the whole scene in the room at andover was before his eyes and he knew intuitively that he had been wrong again this mans strength his rest was the protection of his family he had more use for his seat in the streetcar than any young girl its all right said samuel gruffly dont touch him ive been a damn fool of course it took more than an hour or a week for samuel to rearrange his ideas on the essential importance of good form at first he simply admitted that his wrongness had made him powerless as it had made him powerless against gilly but eventually his mistake about the workman influenced his entire attitude snobbishness is after all merely good breeding grown dictatorial so samuels code remained but the necessity of imposing it upon others had faded out in a certain gutter within that year his class had somehow stopped referring to him as a snob iii after a few years samuels university decided that it had shone long enough in the reflected glory of his neckties so they declaimed to him in latin charged him ten dollars for the paper which proved him irretrievably educated and sent him into the turmoil with much selfconfidence a few friends and the proper assortment of harmless bad habits his family had by that time started back to shirtsleeves through a sudden decline in the sugarmarket and it had already unbuttoned its vest so to speak when samuel went to work his mind was that exquisite tabula rasa that a university education sometimes leaves but he had both energy and influence so he used his former ability as a dodging halfback in twisting through wall street crowds as runner for a bank his diversion was women there were half a dozen two or three dйbutantes an actress in a minor way a grasswidow and one sentimental little brunette who was married and lived in a little house in jersey city they had met on a ferryboat samuel was crossing from new york on business he bad been working several years by this time and he helped her look for a package that she had dropped in the crush do you come over often he inquired casually just to shop she said shyly she had great brown eyes and the pathetic kind of little mouth ive only been married three months and we find it cheaper to live over here does he does your husband like your being alone like this she laughed a cheery young laugh oh dear me no we were to meet for dinner but i must have misunderstood the place hell be awfully worried well said samuel disapprovingly he ought to be if youll allow me ill see you home she accepted his offer thankfully so they took the cablecar together when they walked up the path to her little house they saw a light there her husband had arrived before her hes frightfully jealous she announced laughingly apologetic very well answered samuel rather stiffly id better leave you here she thanked him and waving a good night he left her that would have been quite all if they hadnt met on fifth avenue one morning a week later she started and blushed and seemed so glad to see him that they chatted like old friends she was going to her dressmakers eat lunch alone at taines shop all afternoon and meet her husband on the ferry at five samuel told her that her husband was a very lucky man she blushed again and scurried off samuel whistled all the way back to his office but about twelve oclock he began to see that pathetic appealing little mouth everywhere and those brown eyes he fidgeted when he looked at the clock he thought of the grill downstairs where he lunched and the heavy male conversation thereof and opposed to that picture appeared another a little table at taines with the brown eyes and the mouth a few feet away a few minutes before twelvethirty he dashed on his hat and rushed for the cablecar she was quite surprised to see him why hello she said samuel could tell that she was just pleasantly frightened i thought we might lunch together its so dull eating with a lot of men she hesitated why i suppose theres no harm in it how could there be it occurred to her that her husband should have taken lunch with her but he was generally so hurried at noon she told samuel all about him he was a little smaller than samuel but oh much betterlooking he was a bookkeeper and not making a lot of money but they were very happy and expected to be rich within three or four years samuels grasswidow had been in a quarrelsome mood for three or four weeks and through contrast he took an accentuated pleasure in this meeting so fresh was she and earnest and faintly adventurous her name was marjorie they made another engagement in fact for a month they lunched together two or three times a week when she was sure that her husband would work late samuel took her over to new jersey on the ferry leaving her always on the tiny front porch after she had gone in and lit the gas to use the security of his masculine presence outside this grew to be a ceremony and it annoyed him whenever the comfortable glow fell out through the front windows that was his congй yet he never suggested coming in and marjorie didnt invite him then when samuel and marjorie had reached a stage in which they sometimes touched each others arms gently just to show that they were very good friends marjorie and her husband had one of those ultrasensitive supercritical quarrels that couples never indulge in unless they care a great deal about each other it started with a cold muttonchop or a leak in the gasjet and one day samuel found her in taines with dark shadows under her brown eyes and a terrifying pout by this time samuel thought he was in love with marjorie so he played up the quarrel for all it was worth he was her best friend and patted her hand and leaned down close to her brown curls while she whispered in little sobs what her husband had said that morning and he was a little more than her best friend when he took her over to the ferry in a hansom marjorie he said gently when he left her as usual on the porch if at any time you want to call on me remember that i am always waiting always waiting she nodded gravely and put both her hands in his i know she said i know youre my friend my best friend then she ran into the house and he watched there until the gas went on for the next week samuel was in a nervous turmoil some persistently rational strain warned him that at bottom he and marjorie had little in common but in such cases there is usually so much mud in the water that one can seldom see to the bottom every dream and desire told him that he loved marjorie wanted her had to have her the quarrel developed marjories husband took to staying in new york until late at night came home several times disagreeably overstimulated and made her generally miserable they must have had too much pride to talk it out for marjories husband was after all pretty decent so it drifted on from one misunderstanding to another marjorie kept coming more and more to samuel when a woman can accept masculine sympathy at is much more satisfactory to her than crying to another girl but marjorie didnt realize how much she had begun to rely on him how much he was part of her little cosmos one night instead of turning away when marjorie went in and lit the gas samuel went in too and they sat together on the sofa in the little parlor he was very happy he envied their home and he felt that the man who neglected such a possession out of stubborn pride was a fool and unworthy of his wife but when he kissed marjorie for the first time she cried softly and told him to go he sailed home on the wings of desperate excitement quite resolved to fan this spark of romance no matter how big the blaze or who was burned at the time he considered that his thoughts were unselfishly of her in a later perspective he knew that she had meant no more than the white screen in a motion picture it was just samuel blind desirous next day at taines when they met for lunch samuel dropped all pretense and made frank love to her he had no plans no definite intentions except to kiss her lips again to hold her in his arms and feel that she was very little and pathetic and lovable he took her home and this time they kissed until both their hearts beat high words and phrases formed on his lips and then suddenly there were steps on the porch a hand tried the outside door marjorie turned deadwhite wait she whispered to samuel in a frightened voice but in angry impatience at the interruption he walked to the front door and threw it open every one has seen such scenes on the stage seen them so often that when they actually happen people behave very much like actors samuel felt that he was playing a part and the lines came quite naturally he announced that all had a right to lead their own lives and looked at marjories husband menacingly as if daring him to doubt it marjories husband spoke of the sanctity of the home forgetting that it hadnt seemed very holy to him lately samuel continued along the line of the right to happiness marjories husband mentioned firearms and the divorce court then suddenly he stopped and scrutinized both of them marjorie in pitiful collapse on the sofa samuel haranguing the furniture in a consciously heroic pose go upstairs marjorie he said in a different tone stay where you are samuel countered quickly marjorie rose wavered and sat down rose again and moved hesitatingly toward the stairs come outside said her husband to samuel i want to talk to you samuel glanced at marjorie tried to get some message from her eyes then he shut his lips and went out there was a bright moon and when marjories husband came down the steps samuel could see plainly that he was suffering but he felt no pity for him they stood and looked at each other a few feet apart and the husband cleared his throat as though it were a bit husky thats my wife he said quietly and then a wild anger surged up inside him damn you he cried and hit samuel in the face with all his strength in that second as samuel slumped to the ground it flashed to him that he had been hit like that twice before and simultaneously the incident altered like a dream he felt suddenly awake mechanically he sprang to his feet and squared off the other man was waiting fists up a yard away but samuel knew that though physically he had him by several inches and many pounds he wouldnt hit him the situation had miraculously and entirely changed a moment before samuel had seemed to himself heroic now he seemed the cad the outsider and marjories husband silhouetted against the lights of the little house the eternal heroic figure the defender of his home there was a pause and then samuel turned quickly away and went down the path for the last time iv of course after the third blow samuel put in several weeks at conscientious introspection the blow years before at andover had landed on his personal unpleasantness the workman of his college days had jarred the snobbishness out of his system and marjories husband had given a severe jolt to his greedy selfishness it threw women out of his ken until a year later when he met his future wife for the only sort of woman worth while seemed to be the one who could be protected as marjories husband had protected her samuel could not imagine his grasswidow mrs de ferriac causing any very righteous blows on her own account his early thirties found him well on his feet he was associated with old peter carhart who was in those days a national figure carharts physique was like a rough model for a statue of hercules and his record was just as solid a pile made for the pure joy of it without cheap extortion or shady scandal he had been a great friend of samuels father but he watched the son for six years before taking him into his own office heaven knows how many things he controlled at that time mines railroads banks whole cities samuel was very close to him knew his likes and dislikes his prejudices weaknesses and many strengths one day carhart sent for samuel and closing the door of his inner office offered him a chair and a cigar everything k samuel he asked why yes ive been afraid youre getting a bit stale stale samuel was puzzled youve done no work outside the office for nearly ten years but ive had vacations in the adiron carhart waved this aside i mean outside work seeing the things move that weve always pulled the strings of here no admitted samuel i havent so he said abruptly im going to give you an outside job thatll take about a month samuel didnt argue he rather liked the idea and he made up his mind that whatever it was he would put it through just as carhart wanted it that was his employers greatest hobby and the men around him were as dumb under direct orders as infantry subalterns youll go to san antonio and see hamil continued carhart hes got a job on hand and he wants a man to take charge hamil was in charge of the carhart interests in the southwest a man who had grown up in the shadow of his employer and with whom though they had never met samuel had had much official correspondence when do i leave youd better go tomorrow answered carhart glancing at the calendar thats the st of may ill expect your report here on the st of june next morning samuel left for chicago and two days later he was facing hamil across a table in the office of the merchants trust in san antonio it didnt take long to get the gist of the thing it was a big deal in oil which concerned the buying up of seventeen huge adjoining ranches this buying up had to be done in one week and it was a pure squeeze forces had been set in motion that put the seventeen owners between the devil and the deep sea and samuels part was simply to handle the matter from a little village near pueblo with tact and efficiency the right man could bring it off without any friction for it was merely a question of sitting at the wheel and keeping a firm hold hamil with an astuteness many times valuable to his chief had arranged a situation that would give a much greater clear gain than any dealing in the open market samuel shook hands with hamil arranged to return in two weeks and left for san felipe new mexico it occurred to him of course that carhart was trying him out hamils report on his handling of this might be a factor in something big for him but even without that he would have done his best to put the thing through ten years in new york hadnt made him sentimental and he was quite accustomed to finish everything he began and a little bit more all went well at first there was no enthusiasm but each one of the seventeen ranchers concerned knew samuels business knew what he had behind him and that they had as little chance of holding out as flies on a windowpane some of them were resigned some of them cared like the devil but theyd talked it over argued it with lawyers and couldnt see any possible loophole five of the ranches had oil the other twelve were part of the chance but quite as necessary to hamils purpose in any event samuel soon saw that the real leader was an early settler named mcintyre a man of perhaps fifty grayhaired cleanshaven bronzed by forty new mexico summers and with those clear steady eye that texas and new mexico weather are apt to give his ranch had not as yet shown oil but it was in the pool and if any man hated to lose his land mcintyre did every one had rather looked to him at first to avert the big calamity and he had hunted all over the territory for the legal means with which to do it but he had failed and he knew it he avoided samuel assiduously but samuel was sure that when the day came for the signatures he would appear it came a baking may day with hot wave rising off the parched land as far as eyes could see and as samuel sat stewing in his little improvised office a few chairs a bench and a wooden table he was glad the thing was almost over he wanted to get back east the worst way and join his wife and children for a week at the seashore the meeting was set for four oclock and he was rather surprised at threethirty when the door opened and mcintyre came in samuel could not help respecting the mans attitude and feeling a bit sorry for him mcintyre seemed closely related to the prairies and samuel had the little flicker of envy that city people feel toward men who live in the open afternoon said mcintyre standing in the open doorway with his feet apart and his hands on his hips hello mr mcintyre samuel rose but omitted the formality of offering his hand he imagined the rancher cordially loathed him and he hardly blamed him mcintyre came in and sat down leisurely you got us he said suddenly this didnt seem to require any answer when i heard carhart was back of this he continued i gave up mr carhart is began samuel but mcintyre waved him silent dont talk about the dirty sneakthief mr mcintyre said samuel briskly if this halfhour is to be devoted to that sort of talk oh dry up young man mcintyre interrupted you cant abuse a man whod do a thing like this samuel made no answer its simply a dirty filch there just are skunks like him too big to handle youre being paid liberally offered samuel shut up roared mcintyre suddenly i want the privilege of talking he walked to the door and looked out across the land the sunny steaming pasturage that began almost at his feet and ended with the graygreen of the distant mountains when he turned around his mouth was trembling do you fellows love wall street he said hoarsely or wherever you do your dirty scheming he paused i suppose you do no critter gets so low that he doesnt sort of love the place hes worked where hes sweated out the best hes had in him samuel watched him awkwardly mcintyre wiped his forehead with a huge blue handkerchief and continued i reckon this rotten old devil had to have another million i reckon were just a few of the poor hes blotted out to buy a couple more carriages or something he waved his hand toward the door i built a house out there when i was seventeen with these two hands i took a wife there at twentyone added two wings and with four mangy steers i started out forty summers ive saw the sun come up over those mountains and drop down red as blood in the evening before the heat drifted off and the stars came out i been happy in that house my boy was born there and he died there late one spring in the hottest part of an afternoon like this then the wife and i lived there alone like wed lived before and sort of tried to have a home after all not a real home but nigh it cause the boy always seemed around close somehow and we expected a lot of nights to see him runnin up the path to supper his voice was shaking so he could hardly speak and he turned again to the door his gray eyes contracted thats my land out there he said stretching out his arm my land by god its all i got in the world and ever wanted he dashed his sleeve across his face and his tone changed as he turned slowly and faced samuel but i suppose its got to go when they want it its got to go samuel had to talk he felt that in a minute more he would lose his head so he began as levelvoiced as he could in the sort of tone he saved for disagreeable duties its business mr mcintyre he said its inside the law perhaps we couldnt have bought out two or three of you at any price but most of you did have a price progress demands some things never had he felt so inadequate and it was with the greatest relief that he heard hoofbeats a few hundred yards away but at his words the grief in mcintyres eyes had changed to fury you and your dirty gang of crooks be cried not one of you has got an honest love for anything on gods earth youre a herd of moneyswine samuel rose and mcintyre took a step toward him you longwinded dude you got our land take that for peter carhart he swung from the shoulder quick as lightning and down went samuel in a heap dimly he heard steps in the doorway and knew that some one was holding mcintyre but there was no need the rancher had sunk down in his chair and dropped his head in his hands samuels brain was whirring he realized that the fourth fist had hit him and a great flood of emotion cried out that the law that had inexorably ruled his life was in motion again in a halfdaze he got up and strode from the room the next ten minutes were perhaps the hardest of his life people talk of the courage of convictions but in actual life a mans duty to his family may make a rigid corpse seem a selfish indulgence of his own righteousness samuel thought mostly of his family yet he never really wavered that jolt had brought him to when he came back in the room there were a log of worried faces waiting for him but he didnt waste any time explaining gentlemen he said mr mcintyre has been kind enough to convince me that in this matter you are absolutely right and the peter carhart interests absolutely wrong as far as i am concerned you can keep your ranches to the rest of your days he pushed his way through an astounded gathering and within a halfhour he had sent two telegrams that staggered the operator into complete unfitness for business one was to hamil in san antonio one was to peter carhart in new york samuel didnt sleep much that night he knew that for the first time in his business career he had made a dismal miserable failure but some instinct in him stronger than will deeper than training had forced him to do what would probably end his ambitions and his happiness but it was done and it never occurred to him that he could have acted otherwise next morning two telegrams were waiting for him the first was from hamil it contained three words you blamed idiot the second was from new york deal off come to new york immediately carhart within a week things had happened hamil quarrelled furiously and violently defended his scheme he was summoned to new york and spent a bad halfhour on the carpet in peter carharts office he broke with the carhart interests in july and in august samuel meredith at thirtyfive years old was to all intents made carharts partner the fourth fist had done its work i suppose that theres a caddish streak in every man that runs crosswise across his character and disposition and general outlook with some men its secret and we never know its there until they strike us in the dark one night but samuels showed when it was in action and the sight of it made people see red he was rather lucky in that because every time his little devil came up it met a reception that sent it scurrying down below in a sickly feeble condition it was the same devil the same streak that made him order gillys friends off the bed that made him go inside marjories house if you could run your hand along samuel merediths jaw youd feel a lump he admits hes never been sure which fist left it there but he wouldnt lose it for anything he says theres no cad like an old cad and that sometimes just before making a decision its a great help to stroke his chin the reporters call it a nervous characteristic but its not that its so he can feel again the gorgeous clarity the lightning sanity of those four fists
