 dandelion wine for walter i bradbury neither uncle nor cousin but most decidedly editor and friend just this side of byzantium an introduction this book like most of my books and stories was a surprise i began to learn the nature of such surprises thank god when i was fairly young as a writer before that like every beginner i thought you could beat pummel and thrash an idea into existence under such treatment of course any decent idea folds up its paws turns on its back fixes its eyes on eternity and dies it was with great relief then that in my early twenties i floundered into a wordassociation process in which i simply got out of bed each morning walked to my desk and put down any word or series of words that happened along in my head i would then take arms against the word or for it and bring on an assortment of characters to weigh the word and show me its meaning in my own life an hour or two hours later to my amazement a new story would be finished and done the surprise was total and lovely i soon found that i would have to work this way for the rest of my life first i rummaged my mind for words that could describe my personal nightmares fears of night and time from my childhood and shaped stories from these then i took a long look at the green apple trees and the old house i was born in and the house next door where lived my grandparents and all the lawns of the summers i grew up in and i began to try words for all that what you have here in this book then is a gathering of dandelions from all those years the wine metaphor which appears again and again in these pages is wonderfully apt i was gathering images all of my life storing them away and forgetting them somehow i had to send myself back with words as catalysts to open the memories out and see what they had to offer so from the age of twentyfour to thirtysix hardly a day passed when i didnt stroll myself across a recollection of my grandparents northern illinois grass hoping to come across some old halfburnt firecracker a rusted toy or a fragment of letter written to myself in some young year hoping to contact the older person i became to remind him of his past his life his people his joys and his drenching sorrows it became a game that i took to with immense gusto to see how much i could remember about dandelions themselves or picking wild grapes with my father and brother rediscovering the mosquitobreeding ground rain barrel by the side bay window or searching out the smell of the goldfuzzed bees that hung around our back porch grape arbor bees do have a smell you know and if they dont they should for their feet are dusted with spices from a million flowers and then i wanted to call back what the ravine was like especially on those nights when walking home late across town after seeing lon chaneys delicious fright the phantom of the opera my brother skip would run ahead and hide under the ravinecreek bridge like the lonely one and leap out and grab me shrieking so i ran fell and ran again gibbering all the way home that was great stuff along the way i came upon and collided through wordassociation with old and true friendships i borrowed my friend john huff from my childhood in arizona and shipped him east to green town so that i could say goodbye to him properly along the way i sat me down to breakfasts lunches and dinners with the long dead and much loved for i was a boy who did indeed love his parents and grandparents and his brother even when that brother ditched him along the way i found myself in the basement working the winepress for my father or on the front porch independence night helping my uncle bion load and fire his homemade brass cannon thus i fell into surprise no one told me to surprise myself i might add i came on the old and best ways of writing through ignorance and experiment and was startled when truths leaped out of bushes like quail before gunshot i blundered into creativity as blindly as any child learning to walk and see i learned to let my senses and my past tell me all that was somehow true so i turned myself into a boy running to bring a dipper of clear rainwater out of that barrel by the side of the house and of course the more water you dip out the more flows in the flow has never ceased once i learned to keep going back and back again to those times i had plenty of memories and sense impressions to play with not work with no play with dandelion wine is nothing if it is not the boyhidintheman playing in the fields of the lord on the green grass of other augusts in the midst of starting to grow up grow old and sense darkness waiting under the trees to seed the blood i was amused and somewhat astonished at a critic a few years back who wrote an article analyzing dandelion wine plus the more realistic works of sinclair lewis wondering how i could have been born and raised in waukegan which i renamed green town for my novel and not noticed how ugly the harbor was and how depressing the coal docks and railyards down below the town but of course i had noticed them and genetic enchanter that i was was fascinated by their beauty trains and boxcars and the smell of coal and fire are not ugly to children ugliness is a concept that we happen on later and become selfconscious about counting boxcars is a prime activity of boys their elders fret and fume and jeer at the train that holds them up but boys happily count and cry the names of the cars as they pass from far places and again that supposedly ugly railyard was where carnivals and circuses arrived with elephants who washed the brick pavements with mighty steaming acid waters at five in the dark morning as for the coal from the docks i went down in my basement every autumn to await the arrival of the truck and its metal chute which clanged down and released a ton of beauteous meteors that fell out of far space into my cellar and threatened to bury me beneath dark treasures in other words if your boy is a poet horse manure can only mean flowers to him which is of course what horse manure has always been about perhaps a new poem of mine will explain more than this introduction about the germination of all the summers of my life into one book heres the start of the poem byzantium i come not from but from another time and place whose race was simple tried and true as boy i dropped me forth in illinois a name with neither love nor grace was waukegan there i came from and not good friends byzantium the poem continues describing my lifelong relationship to my birthplace and yet in looking back i see from topmost part of farthest tree a land as bright beloved and blue as any yeats found to be true waukegan visited by me often since is neither homelier nor more beautiful than any other small midwestern town much of it is green the trees do touch in the middle of streets the street in front of my old home is still paved with red bricks in what way then was the town special why i was born there it was my life i had to write of it as i saw fit so we grew up with mythic dead to spoon upon midwestern bread and spread old gods bright marmalade to slake in peanutbutter shade pretending there beneath our sky that it was aphrodites thigh while by the porchrail calm and bold his words pure wisdom stare pure gold my grandfather a myth indeed did all of plato supersede while grandmama in rockingchair sewed up the raveled sleeve of care crocheted cool snowflakes rare and bright to winter us on summer night and uncles gathered with their smokes emitted wisdoms masked as jokes and aunts as wise as delphic maids dispensed prophetic lemonades to boys knelt there as acolytes to grecian porch on summer nights then went to bed there to repent the evils of the innocent the gnatsins sizzling in their ears said through the nights and through the years not illinois nor waukegan but blither sky and blither sun though mediocre all our fates and mayor not as bright as yeats yet still we knew ourselves the sum byzantium byzantium waukegangreen townbyzantium green town did exist then yes and again yes was there a real boy named john huff there was and that was truly his name but he didnt go away from me i went away from him but happy ending he is still alive fortytwo years later and remembers our love was there a lonely one there was and that was his name and he moved around at night in my home town when i was six years old and he frightened everyone and was never captured most importantly did the big house itself with grandpa and grandma and the boarders and uncles and aunts in it exist i have already answered that is the ravine real and deep and dark at night it was it is i took my daughters there a few years back fearful that the ravine might have gone shallow with time i am relieved and happy to report that the ravine is deeper darker and more mysterious than ever i would not even now go home through there after seeing the phantom of the opera so there you have it waukegan was green town was byzantium with all the happiness that that means with all the sadness that these names imply the people there were gods and midgets and knew themselves mortal and so the midgets walked tall so as not to embarrass the gods and the gods crouched so as to make the small ones feel at home and after all isnt that what life is all about the ability to go around back and come up inside other peoples heads to look out at the damned fool miracle and say oh so thats how you see it well now i must remember that here is my celebration then of death as well as life dark as well as light old as well as young smart and dumb combined sheer joy as well as complete terror written by a boy who once hung upside down in trees dressed in his bat costume with candy fangs in his mouth who finally fell out of the trees when he was twelve and went and found a toydial typewriter and wrote his first novel a final memory fire balloons you rarely see them these days though in some countries i hear they are still made and filled with warm breath from a small straw fire hung beneath but in illinois we still had them and one of the last memories i have of my grandfather is the last hour of a fourth of july night fortyeight years ago when grandpa and i walked out on the lawn and lit a small fire and filled the pearshaped redwhiteandbluestriped paper balloon with hot air and held the flickering brightangel presence in our hands a final moment in front of a porch lined with uncles and aunts and cousins and mothers and fathers and then very softly let the thing that was life and light and mystery go out of our fingers up on the summer air and away over the beginningtosleep houses among the stars as fragile as wondrous as vulnerable as lovely as life itself i see my grandfather there looking up at that strange drifting light thinking his own still thoughts i see me my eyes filled with tears because it was all over the night was done i knew there would never be another night like this no one said anything we all just looked up at the sky and we breathed out and in and we all thought the same things but nobody said someone finally had to say though didnt they and that one is me the wine still waits in the cellars below my beloved family still sits on the porch in the dark the fire balloon still drifts and burns in the night sky of an as yet unburied summer why and how because i say it is so ray bradbury summer dandelion wine it was a quiet morning the town covered over with darkness and at ease in bed summer gathered in the weather the wind had the proper touch the breathing of the world was long and warm and slow you had only to rise lean from your window and know that this indeed was the first real time of freedom and living this was the first morning of summer douglas spaulding twelve freshly wakened let summer idle him on its earlymorning stream lying in his thirdstory cupola bedroom he felt the tall power it gave him riding high in the june wind the grandest tower in town at night when the trees washed together he flashed his gaze like a beacon from this lighthouse in all directions over swarming seas of elm and oak and maple now boy whispered douglas a whole summer ahead to cross off the calendar day by day like the goddess siva in the travel books he saw his hands jump everywhere pluck sour apples peaches and midnight plums he would be clothed in trees and bushes and rivers he would freeze gladly in the hoarfrosted icehouse door he would bake happily with ten thousand chickens in grandmas kitchen but nowa familiar task awaited him one night each week he was allowed to leave his father his mother and his younger brother tom asleep in their small house next door and run here up the dark spiral stairs to his grandparents cupola and in this sorcerers tower sleep with thunders and visions to wake before the crystal jingle of milk bottles and perform his ritual magic he stood at the open window in the dark took a deep breath and exhaled the street lights like candles on a black cake went out he exhaled again and again and the stars began to vanish douglas smiled he pointed a finger there and there now over here and here yellow squares were cut in the dim morning earth as house lights winked slowly on a sprinkle of windows came suddenly alight miles off in dawn country everyone yawn everyone up the great house stirred below grandpa get your teeth from the water glass he waited a decent interval grandma and greatgrandma fry hot cakes the warm scent of fried batter rose in the drafty halls to stir the boarders the aunts the uncles the visiting cousins in their rooms street where all the old people live wake up miss helen loomis colonel freeleigh miss bentley cough get up take pills move around mr jonas hitch up your horse get your junk wagon out and around the bleak mansions across the town ravine opened baleful dragon eyes soon in the morning avenues below two old women would glide their electric green machine waving at all the dogs mr tridden run to the carbarn soon scattering hot blue sparks above it the town trolley would sail the rivering brick streets ready john huff charlie woodman whispered douglas to the street of children ready to baseballs sponged deep in wet lawns to rope swings hung empty in trees mom dad tom wake up clock alarms tinkled faintly the courthouse clock boomed birds leaped from trees like a net thrown by his hand singing douglas conducting an orchestra pointed to the eastern sky the sun began to rise he folded his arms and smiled a magicians smile yes sir he thought everyone jumps everyone runs when i yell itll be a fine season he gave the town a last snap of his fingers doors slammed open people stepped out summer began crossing the lawn that morning douglas spaulding broke a spider web with his face a single invisible line on the air touched his brow and snapped without a sound so with the subtlest of incidents he knew that this day was going to be different it would be different also because as his father explained driving douglas and his tenyearold brother tom out of town toward the country there were some days compounded completely of odor nothing but the world blowing in one nostril and out the other and some days he went on were days of hearing every trump and trill of the universe some days were good for tasting and some for touching and some days were good for all the senses at once this day now he nodded smelled as if a great and nameless orchard had grown up overnight beyond the hills to fill the entire visible land with its warm freshness the air felt like rain but there were no clouds momentarily a stranger might laugh off in the woods but there was silence douglas watched the traveling land he smelled no orchards and sensed no rain for without apple trees or clouds he knew neither could exist and as for that stranger laughing deep in the woods yet the fact remaineddouglas shiveredthis without reason was a special day the car stopped at the very center of the quiet forest all right boys behave they had been jostling elbows yes sir they climbed out carrying the blue tin pails away from the lonely dirt road into the smell of fallen rain look for bees said father bees hang around grapes like boys around kitchens doug douglas looked up suddenly youre off a million miles said father look alive walk with us yes sir and they walked through the forest father very tall douglas moving in his shadow and tom very small trotting in his brothers shade they came to a little rise and looked ahead here here did they see father pointed here was where the big summerquiet winds lived and passed in the green depths like ghost whales unseen douglas looked quickly saw nothing and felt put upon by his father who like grandpa lived on riddles butbut stilldouglas paused and listened yes somethings going to happen he thought i know it heres maidenhair fern dad walked the tin pail belling in his fist feel this he scuffed the earth a million years of good rich leafmold laid down think of the autumns that got by to make this boy i walk like an indian said tom not a sound douglas felt but did not feel the deep loam listening watchful were surrounded he thought itll happen what he stopped come out wherever you are whatever you are he cried silently tom and dad strolled on the hushed earth ahead finest lace there is said dad quietly and he was gesturing up through the trees above to show them how it was woven across the sky or how the sky was woven into the trees he wasnt sure which but there it was he smiled and the weaving went on green and blue if you watched and saw the forest shift its humming loom dad stood comfortably saying this and that the words easy in his mouth he made it easier by laughing at his own declarations just so often he liked to listen to the silence he said if silence could be listened to for he went on in that silence you could hear wildflower pollen sifting down the beefried air by god the beefried air listen the waterfall of birdsong beyond those trees now thought douglas here it comes running i dont see it running almost on me fox grapes said father were in luck look here dont douglas gasped but tom and dad bent down to shove their hands deep in rattling bush the spell was shattered the terrible prowler the magnificent runner the leaper the shaker of souls vanished douglas lost and empty fell to his knees he saw his fingers sink through green shadow and come forth stained with such color that it seemed he had somehow cut the forest and delved his hand in the open wound lunch time boys with buckets half burdened with fox grapes and wild strawberries followed by bees which were no more no less said father the world humming under its breath they sat on a greenmossed log chewing sandwiches and trying to listen to the forest the same way father did douglas felt dad watching him quietly amused dad started to say something that had crossed his mind but instead tried another bite of sandwich and mused over it sandwich outdoors isnt a sandwich anymore tastes different than indoors notice got more spice tastes like mint and pinesap does wonders for the appetite douglass tongue hesitated on the texture of bread and deviled ham nonoit was just a sandwich tom chewed and nodded know just what you mean dad it almost happened thought douglas whatever it was it was big my gosh it was big something scared it off where is it now back of that bush no behind me no herealmost herehe kneeded his stomach secretly if i wait itll come back it wont hurt somehow i know its not here to hurt me what then what what you know how many baseball games we played this year last year year before said tom apropos of nothing douglas watched toms quickly moving lips wrote it down one thousand five hundred sixtyeight games how many times i brushed my teeth in ten years six thousand washing my hands fifteen thousand slept four thousand someodd times not counting naps ate six hundred peaches eight hundred apples pears two hundred im not hot for pears name a thing i got the statistics runs to the billion millions things i done add em up in ten years now thought douglas its coming close again why tom talking but why tom tom chatting along mouth crammed with sandwich dad there alert as a mountain cat on the log and tom letting the words rise like quick soda bubbles in his mouth books i read four hundred matinees i seen forty buck joneses thirty jack hoxies fortyfive tom mixes thirtynine hoot gibsons one hundred and ninetytwo single and separate felixthecat cartoons ten douglas fairbankses eight repeats on lon chaney in the phantom of the opera four milton sillses and one adolph menjou thing about love where i spent ninety hours in the theater toilet waiting for the mush to be over so i could see the cat and the canary or the bat where everybody held onto everybody else and screamed for two hours without letting go during that time i figure four hundred lollipops three hundred tootsie rolls seven hundred icecream cones tom rolled quietly along his way for another five minutes and then dad said how many berries you picked so far tom two hundred fiftysix on the nose said tom instantly dad laughed and lunch was over and they moved again into the shadows to find fox grapes and the tiny wild strawberries bent down all three of them hands coming and going the pails getting heavy and douglas holding his breath thinking yes yes its near again breathing on my neck almost dont look work just pick fill up the pail if you look youll scare it off dont lose it this time but how do you bring it around here where you can see it stare it right in the eye how how got a snowflake in a matchbox said tom smiling at the wineglove on his hand shut up douglas wanted to yell but no the yell would scare the echoes and run the thing away and wait the more tom talked the closer the great thing came it wasnt scared of tom tom drew it with his breath tom was part of it last february said tom and chuckled held a matchbox up in a snowstorm let one old snowflake fall in shut it up ran inside the house stashed it in the icebox close very close douglas stared at toms flickering lips he wanted to jump around for he felt a vast tidal wave lift up behind the forest in an instant it would smash down crush them forever yes sir mused tom picking grapes im the only guy in all illinois whos got a snowflake in summer precious as diamonds by gosh tomorrow ill open it doug you can look too any other day douglas might have snorted struck out denied it all but now with the great thing rushing near falling down in the clear air above him he could only nod eyes shut tom puzzled stopped picking berries and turned to stare over at his brother douglas hunched over was an ideal target tom leaped yelling landed they fell thrashed and rolled no douglas squeezed his mind shut no but suddenlyyes its all right yes the tangle the contact of bodies the falling tumble had not scared off the tidal sea that crashed now flooding and washing them along the shore of grass deep through the forest knuckles struck his mouth he tasted rusty warm blood grabbed tom hard held him tight and so in silence they lay hearts churning nostrils hissing and at last slowly afraid he would find nothing douglas opened one eye and everything absolutely everything was there the world like a great iris of an even more gigantic eye which has also just opened and stretched out to encompass everything stared back at him and he knew what it was that had leaped upon him to stay and would not run away now im alive he thought his fingers trembled bright with blood like the bits of a strange flag now found and before unseen and him wondering what country and what allegiance he owed to it holding tom but not knowing him there he touched his free hand to that blood as if it could be peeled away held up turned over then he let go of tom and lay on his back with his hand up in the sky and he was a head from which his eyes peered like sentinels through the portcullis of a strange castle out along a bridge his arm to those fingers where the bright pennant of blood quivered in the light you all right doug asked tom his voice was at the bottom of a green moss well somewhere underwater secret removed the grass whispered under his body he put his arm down feeling the sheath of fuzz on it and far away below his toes creaking in his shoes the wind sighed over his shelled ears the world slipped bright over the glassy round of his eyeballs like images sparked in a crystal sphere flowers were sun and fiery spots of sky strewn through the woodland birds flickered like skipped stones across the vast inverted pond of heaven his breath raked over his teeth going in ice coming out fire insects shocked the air with electric clearness ten thousand individual hairs grew a millionth of an inch on his head he heard the twin hearts beating in each ear the third heart beating in his throat the two hearts throbbing his wrists the real heart pounding his chest the million pores on his body opened im really alive he thought i never knew it before or if i did i dont remember he yelled it loud but silent a dozen times think of it think of it twelve years old and only now now discovering this rare timepiece this clock goldbright and guaranteed to run threescore and ten left under a tree and found while wrestling doug you okay douglas yelled grabbed tom and rolled doug youre crazy crazy they spilled downhill the sun in their mouths in their eyes like shattered lemon glass gasping like trout thrown out on a bank laughing till they cried doug youre not mad no no no no no douglas eyes shut saw spotted leopards pad in the dark tom then quieter tomdoes everyone in the worldknow hes alive sure heck yes the leopards trotted soundlessly off through darker lands where eyeballs could not turn to follow i hope they do whispered douglas oh i sure hope they know douglas opened his eyes dad was standing high above him there in the greenleaved sky laughing hands on hips their eyes met douglas quickened dad knows he thought it was all planned he brought us here on purpose so this could happen to me hes in on it he knows it all and now he knows that i know a hand came down and seized him through the air swayed on his feet with tom and dad still bruised and rumpled puzzled and awed douglas held his strangeboned elbows tenderly and licked the fine cut lip with satisfaction then he looked at dad and tom ill carry all the pails he said this once let me haul everything they handed over the pails with quizzical smiles he stood swaying slightly the forest collected fullweighted and heavy with syrup clenched hard in his downslung hands i want to feel all there is to feel he thought let me feel tired now let me feel tired i mustnt forget im alive i know im alive t mustnt forget it tonight or tomorrow or the day after that the bees followed and the smell of fox grapes and yellow summer followed as he walked heavyladen and half drunk his fingers wonderously callused arms numb feet stumbling so his father caught his shoulder no mumbled douglas im all right im fine it took half an hour for the sense of the grass the roots the stones the bark of the messy log to fade from where they had patterned his arms and legs and back while he pondered this let it slip slide dissolve away his brother and his quiet father followed behind allowing him to pathfind the forest alone out toward that incredible highway which would take them back to the town the town then later in the day and yet another harvest grandfather stood on the wide front porch like a captain surveying the vast unmotioned calms of a season dead ahead he questioned the wind and the untouchable sky and the lawn on which stood douglas and tom to question only him grandpa are they ready now grandfather pinched his chin five hundred a thousand two thousand easy yes yes a good supply pick em easy pick em all a dime for every sack delivered to the press hey the boys bent smiling they picked the golden flowers the flowers that flooded the world dripped off lawns onto brick streets tapped softly at crystal cellar windows and agitated themselves so that on all sides lay the dazzle and glitter of molten sun every year said grandfather they run amuck i let them pride of lions in the yard stare and they burn a hole in your retina a common flower a weed that no one sees yes but for us a noble thing the dandelion so plucked carefully in sacks the dandelions were carried below the cellar dark glowed with their arrival the wine press stood open cold a rush of flowers warmed it the press replaced its screw rotated twirled by grandfather squeezed gently on the crop there so the golden tide the essence of this fine fair month ran then gushed from the spout below to be crocked skimmed of ferment and bottled in clean ketchup shakers then ranked in sparkling rows in cellar gloom dandelion wine the words were summer on the tongue the wine was summer caught and stoppered and now that douglas knew he really knew he was alive and moved turning through the world to touch and see it all it was only right and proper that some of his new knowledge some of this special vintage day would be sealed away for opening on a january day with snow falling fast and the sun unseen for weeks or months and perhaps some of the miracle by then forgotten and in need of renewal since this was going to be a summer of unguessed wonders he wanted it all salvaged and labeled so that any time he wished he might tiptoe down in this dank twilight and reach up his fingertips and there row upon row with the soft gleam of flowers opened at morning with the light of this june sun glowing through a faint skin of dust would stand the dandelion wine peer through it at the wintry daythe snow melted to grass the trees were reinhabitated with bird leaf and blossoms like a continent of butterflies breathing on the wind and peering through color sky from iron to blue hold summer in your hand pour summer in a glass a tiny glass of course the smallest tingling sip for children change the season in your veins by raising glass to lip and tilting summer in ready now the rain barrel nothing else in the world would do but the pure waters which had been summoned from the lakes far away and the sweet fields of grassy dew on early morning lifted to the open sky carried in laundered clusters nine hundred miles brushed with wind electrified with high voltage and condensed upon cool air this water falling raining gathered yet more of the heavens in its crystals taking something of the east wind and the west wind and the north wind and the south the water made rain and the rain within this hour of rituals would be well on its way to wine douglas ran with the dipper he plunged it deep in the rain barrel here we go the water was silk in the cup clear faintly blue silk it softened the lip and the throat and the heart if drunk this water must be carried in dipper and bucket to the cellar there to be leavened in freshets in mountain streams upon the dandelion harvest even grandma when snow was whirling fast dizzying the world blinding windows stealing breath from gasping mouths even grandma one day in february would vanish to the cellar above in the vast house there would be coughings sneezings wheezings and groans childish fevers throats raw as butchers meat noses like bottled cherries the stealthy microbe everywhere then rising from the cellar like a june goddess grandma would come something hidden but obvious under her knitted shawl this carried to every miserable room upstairsanddown would be dispensed with aroma and clarity into neat glasses to be swigged neatly the medicines of another time the balm of sun and idle august afternoons the faintly heard sounds of ice wagons passing on brick avenues the rush of silver skyrockets and the fountaining of lawn mowers moving through ant countries all these all these in a glass yes even grandma drawn to the cellar of winter for a june adventure might stand alone and quietly in secret conclave with her own soul and spirit as did grandfather and father and uncle pert or some of the boarders communing with a last touch of a calendar long departed with the picnics and the warm rains and the smell of fields of wheat and new popcorn and bending hay even grandma repeating and repeating the fine and golden words even as they were said now in this moment when the flowers were dropped into the press as they would be repeated every winter for all the white winters in time saying them over and over on the lips like a smile like a sudden patch of sunlight in the dark dandelion wine dandelion wine dandelion wine you did not hear them coming you hardly heard them go the grass bent down sprang up again they passed like cloud shadows downhillthe boys of summer running douglas left behind was lost panting he stopped by the rim of the ravine at the edge of the softly blowing abyss here ears pricked like a deer he snuffed a danger that was old a billion years ago here the town divided fell away in halves here civilization ceased here was only growing earth and a million deaths and rebirths every hour and here the paths made or yet unmade that told of the need of boys traveling always traveling to be men douglas turned this path led in a great dusty snake to the ice house where winter lived on the yellow days this path raced for the blastfurnace sands of the lake shore in july this to trees where boys might grow like sour and stillgreen crab apples hid among leaves this to peach orchard grape arbor watermelons lying like tortoiseshell cats slumbered by sun that path abandoned but wildly swiveling to school this straight as an arrow to saturday cowboy matinees and this by the creek waters to wilderness beyond town douglas squinted who could say where town or wideness began who could say which owned what and what owned which there was always and forever that indefinable place where the two struggled and one of them won for a season to possess a certain avenue a deli a glen a tree a bush the thin lapping of the great continental sea of grass and flower starting far out in lonely farm country moved inward with the thrust of seasons each night the wilderness the meadows the far country flowed downcreek through ravine and welled up in town with a smell of grass and water and the town was disinhabited and dead and gone back to earth and each morning a little more of the ravine edged up into town threatening to swamp garages like leaking rowboats devour ancient cars which had been left to the flaking mercies of rain and therefore rust hey hey john huff and charlie woodman ran through the mystery of ravine and town and time hey douglas moved slowly down the path the ravine was indeed the place where you came to look at the two things of life the ways of man and the ways of the natural world the town was after all only a large ship filled with constantly moving survivors bailing out the grass chipping away the rust now and again a lifeboat a shanty kin to the mother ship lost out to the quiet storm of seasons sank down in silent waves of termite and ant into swallowing ravine to feel the flicker of grasshoppers rattling like dry paper in hot weeds become soundproofed with spider dust and finally in avalanche of shingle and tar collapse like kindling shrines into a bonfire which thunderstorms ignited with blue lightning while flashphotographing the triumph of the wilderness it was this then the mystery of man seizing from the land and the land seizing back year after year that drew douglas knowing the towns never really won they merely existed in calm peril fully accoutered with lawn mower bug spray and hedge shears swimming steadily as long as civilization said to swim but each house ready to sink in green tides buried forever when the last man ceased and his trowels and mowers shattered to cereal flakes of rust the town the wideness the houses the ravine douglas blinked back and forth but how to relate the two make sense of the interchange when his eyes moved down to the ground the first rite of summer the dandelion picking the starting of the wine was over now the second rite waited for him to make the motions but he stood very still dougcome ondoug the running boys faded im alive said douglas but whats the use theyre more alive than me how come how come and standing alone he knew the answer staring down at his motionless feet late that night going home from the show with his mother and father and his brother tom douglas saw the tennis shoes in the bright store window he glanced quickly away but his ankles were seized his feet suspended then rushed the earth spun the shop awnings slammed their canvas wings overhead with the thrust of his body running his mother and father and brother walked quietly on both sides of him douglas walked backward watching the tennis shoes in the midnight window left behind it was a nice movie said mother douglas murmured it was it was june and long past time for buying the special shoes that were quiet as a summer rain falling on the walks june and the earth full of raw power and everything everywhere in motion the grass was still pouring in from the country surrounding the sidewalks stranding the houses any moment the town would capsize go down and leave not a stir in the clover and weeds and here douglas stood trapped on the dead cement and the redbrick streets hardly able to move dad he blurted it out back there in that window those creamsponge para litefoot shoes his father didnt even turn suppose you tell me why you need a new pair of sneakers can you do that well it was because they felt the way it feels every summer when you take off your shoes for the first time and run in the grass they felt like it feels sticking your feet out of the hot covers in wintertime to let the cold wind from the open window blow on them suddenly and you let them stay out a long time until you pull them back in under the covers again to feel them like packed snow the tennis shoes felt like it always feels the first time every year wading in the slow waters of the creek and seeing your feet below half an inch further downstream with refraction than the real part of you above water dad said douglas its hard to explain somehow the people who made tennis shoes knew what boys needed and wanted they put marshmallows and coiled springs in the soles and they wove the rest out of grasses bleached and fired in the wilderness somewhere deep in the soft loam of the shoes the thin hard sinews of the buck deer were hidden the people that made the shoes must have watched a lot of winds blow the trees and a lot of rivers going down to the lakes whatever it was it was in the shoes and it was summer douglas tried to get all this in words yes said father but whats wrong with last years sneakers why cant you dig them out of the closet well he felt sorry for boys who lived in california where they wore tennis shoes all year and never knew what it was to get winter off your feet peel off the iron leather shoes all full of snow and rain and run barefoot for a day and then lace on the first new tennis shoes of the season which was better than barefoot the magic was always in the new pair of shoes the magic might die by the first of september but now in late june there was still plenty of magic and shoes like these could jump you over trees and rivers and houses and if you wanted they could jump you over fences and sidewalks and dogs dont you see said douglas i just cant use last years pair for last years pair were dead inside they had been fine when he started them out last year but by the end of summer every year you always found out you always knew you couldnt really jump over rivers and trees and houses in them and they were dead but this was a new year and he felt that this time with this new pair of shoes he could do anything anything at all they walked up on the steps to their house save your money said dad in five or six weeks summerll be over lights out with tom asleep douglas lay watching his feet far away down there at the end of the bed in the moonlight free of the heavy iron shoes the big chunks of winter fallen away from them reasons ive got to think of reasons for the shoes well as anyone knew the hills around town were wild with friends putting cows to riot playing barometer to the atmospheric changes taking sun peeling like calendars each day to take more sun to catch those friends you must run much faster than foxes or squirrels as for the town it steamed with enemies grown irritable with heat so remembering every winter argument and insult find friends ditch enemies that was the creamsponge para litefoot motto does the world run too fast want to catch up want to be alert stay alert litefoot then litefoot he held his coin bank up and heard the faint small tinkling the airy weight of money there whatever you want he thought you got to make your own way during the night now lets find that path through the forest downtown the store lights went out one by one a wind blew in the window it was like a river going downstream and his feet wanting to go with it in his dreams he heard a rabbit running running running in the deep warm grass old mr sanderson moved through his shoe store as the proprietor of a pet shop must move through his shop where are kenneled animals from everywhere in the world touching each one briefly along the way mr sanderson brushed his hands over the shoes in the window and some of them were like cats to him and some were like dogs he touched each pair with concern adjusting laces fixing tongues then he stood in the exact center of the carpet and looked around nodding there was a sound of growing thunder one moment the door to sandersons shoe emporium was empty the next douglas spaulding stood clumsily there staring down at his leather shoes as if these heavy things could not be pulled up out of the cement the thunder had stopped when his shoes stopped now with painful slowness daring to look only at the money in his cupped hand douglas moved out of the bright sunlight of saturday noon he made careful stacks of nickels dimes and quarters on the counter like someone playing chess and worried if the next move carried him out into sun or deep into shadow dont say a word said mr sanderson douglas froze first i know just what you want to buy said mr sanderson second i see you every afternoon at my window you think i dont see youre wrong third to give it its full name you want the royal crown creamsponge para litefoot tennis shoes like menthol on your feet fourth you want credit no cried douglas breathing hard as if hed run all night in his dreams i got something better than credit to offer he gasped before i tell mr sanderson you got to do me one small favor can you remember when was the last time you yourself wore a pair of litefoot sneakers sir mr sandersons face darkened oh ten twenty say thirty years ago why mr sanderson dont you think you owe it to your customers sir to at least try the tennis shoes you sell for just one minute so you know how they feel people forget if they dont keep testing things united cigar store man smokes cigars dont he candystore man samples his own stuff i should think so you may have noticed said the old man im wearing shoes but not sneakers sir how you going to sell sneakers unless you can rave about them and how you going to rave about them unless you know them mr sanderson backed off a little distance from the boys fever one hand to his chin well mr sanderson said douglas you sell me something and ill sell you something just as valuable is it absolutely necessary to the sale that i put on a pair of the sneakers boy said the old man i sure wish you could sir the old man sighed a minute later seated panting quietly he laced the tennis shoes to his long narrow feet they looked detached and alien down there next to the dark cuffs of his business suit mr sanderson stood up how do they feel asked the boy how do they feel he asks they feel fine he started to sit down please douglas held out his hand mr sanderson now could you kind of rock back and forth a little sponge around bounce kind of while i tell you the rest its this i give you my money you give me the shoes i owe you a dollar but mr sanderson butsoon as i get those shoes on you know what happens what bang i deliver your packages pick up packages bring you coffee bum your trash run to the post office telegraph office library youll see twelve of me in and out in and out every minute feel those shoes mr sanderson feel how fast theyd take me all those springs inside feel all the running inside feel how they kind of grab hold and cant let you alone and dont like you just standing there feel how quick id be doing the things youd rather not bother with you stay in the nice cool store while im jumping all around town but its not me really its the shoes theyre going like mad down alleys cutting corners and back there they go mr sanderson stood amazed with the rush of words when the words got going the flow carried him he began to sink deep in the shoes to flex his toes limber his arches test his ankles he rocked softly secretly back and forth in a small breeze from the open door the tennis shoes silently hushed themselves deep in the carpet sank as in a jungle grass in loam and resilient clay he gave one solemn bounce of his heels in the yeasty dough in the yielding and welcoming earth emotions hurried over his face as if many colored lights had been switched on and off his mouth hung slightly open slowly he gentled and rocked himself to a halt and the boys voice faded and they stood there looking at each other in a tremendous and natural silence a few people drifted by on the sidewalk outside in the hot sun still the man and boy stood there the boy glowing the man with revelation in his face boy said the old man at last in five years how would you like a job selling shoes in this emporium gosh thanks mr sanderson but i dont know what im going to be yet anything you want to be son said the old man youll be no one will ever stop you the old man walked lightly across the store to the wall of ten thousand boxes came back with some shoes for the boy and wrote up a list on some paper while the boy was lacing the shoes on his feet and then standing there waiting the old man held out his list a dozen things you got to do for me this afternoon finish them were even stephen and youre fired thanks mr sanderson douglas bounded away stop cried the old man douglas pulled up and turned mr sanderson leaned forward how do they feel the boy looked down at his feet deep in the rivers in the fields of wheat in the wind that already was rushing him out of the town he looked up at the old man his eyes burning his mouth moving but no sound came out antelopes said the old man looking from the boys face to his shoes gazelles the boy thought about it hesitated and nodded a quick nod almost immediately he vanished he just spun about with a whisper and went off the door stood empty the sound of the tennis shoes faded in the jungle heat mr sanderson stood in the sunblazed door listening from a long time ago when he dreamed as a boy he remembered the sound beautiful creatures leaping under the sky gone through brush under trees away and only the soft echo of their running left behind antelopes said mr sanderson gazelles he bent to pick up the boys abandoned winter shoes heavy with forgotten rains and longmelted snows moving out of the blazing sun walking softly lightly slowly he headed back toward civilization he brought out a yellow nickel tablet he brought out a yellow ticonderoga pencil he opened the tablet he licked the pencil tom he said you and your statistics gave me an idea im going to do the same keep track of things for instance you realize that every summer we do things over and over we did the whole darn summer before like what doug like making dandelion wine like buying these new tennis shoes like shooting off the first firecracker of the year like making lemonade like getting slivers in our feet like picking wild fox grapes every year the same things same way no change no difference thats one half of summer tom whats the other half things we do for the first time ever like eating olives bigger than that like finding out maybe that grandpa or dad dont know everything in the world they know every dam thing there is to know and dont you forget it tom dont argue i already got it written down under discoveries and revelations they dont know everything but its no crime that i discovered too what other new crazy stuff you got in there im alive heck thats old thinking about it noticing it is new you do things and dont watch then all of a sudden you look and see what youre doing and its the first time really im going to divide the summer up in two parts first part of this tablet is titled rites and ceremonies the first root beer pop of the year the first time running barefoot in the grass of the year first time almost drowning in the lake of the year first watermelon first mosquito first harvest of dandelions those are the things we do over and over and over and never think now here in back like i said is discoveries and revelations or maybe illuminations thats a swell word or intuitions okay in other words you do an old familiar thing like bottling dandelion wine and you put that under rites and ceremonies and then you think about it and what you think crazy or not you put under discoveries and revelations heres what i got on the wine every rime you bottle it you got a whole chunk of put away safe how you like that tom i got lost a mile back somewhere let me show you another up front under ceremonies i got first argument and licking of summer by dad morning of june th in back under revelations i got the reason why grownups and kids fight is because they belong to separate races look at them different from us look at us different from them separate races and never the twain shall meet put that in your pipe and smoke it tom cross the lawn under the seas of shade tom followed them slowly why we dont get along with mom or dad trouble trouble from sunrise to supper boy youre a genius any time this next three months you see something done over and over tell me think about it and tell me that come labor day well add up the summer and see what we got i got a statistic for you right now grab your pencil doug there are five billion trees in the world i looked it up under every tree is a shadow right so then what makes night ill tell you shadows crawling out from under five billion trees think of it shadows running around in the air muddying the waters you might say if only we could figure a way to keep those dam five billion shadows under those trees we could stay up half the night doug because thered be no night there you are something old something new thats old and new all right douglas licked the yellow ticonderoga pencil whose name he dearly loved say it again shadows are under five billion trees yes summer was rituals each with its natural time and place the ritual of lemonade or icetea making the ritual of wine shoes or no shoes and at last swiftly following the others with quiet dignity the ritual of the frontporch swing on the third day of summer in the late afternoon grandfather reappeared from the front door to gaze serenely at the two empty eye rings in the ceiling of the porch moving to the geraniumpotlined rail like ahab surveying the mild mild day and mildlooking sky he wet his finger to test the wind and shucked his coat to see how shirt sleeves felt in the westering hours he acknowledged the salutes of other captains on yet other flowered porches out themselves to discern the gentle ground swell of weather oblivious to their wives chirping or snapping like fuzzball hand dogs hidden behind black porch screens all right douglas lets set it up in the garage they found dusted and carried forth the howdah as it were for the quiet summernight festivals the swing chair which grandpa chained to the porchceiling eyelets douglas being lighter was first to sit in the swing then after a moment grandfather gingerly settled his pontifical weight beside the boy thus they sat smiling at each other nodding as they swung silently back and forth back and forth ten minutes later grandma appeared with water buckets and brooms to wash down and sweep off the porch other chairs rockers and straightbacks were summoned from the house always like to start sitting early in the season said grandpa before the mosquitoes thicken about seven oclock you could hear the chairs scraping back from the tables someone experimenting with a yellowtoothed piano if you stood outside the diningroom window and listened matches being struck the first dishes bubbling in the suds and tinkling on the wall racks somewhere faintly a phonograph playing and then as the evening changed the hour at house after house on the twilight streets under the immense oaks and elms on shady porches people would begin to appear like those figures who tell good or bad weather in rainorshine clocks uncle bert perhaps grandfather then father and some of the cousins the men all coming out first into the syrupy evening blowing smoke leaving the womens voices behind in the coolingwarm kitchen to set their universe aright then the first male voices under the porch brim the feet up the boys fringed on the worn steps or wooden rails where sometime during the evening something a boy or a geranium pot would fall off at last like ghosts hovering momentarily behind the door screen grandma greatgrandma and mother would appear and the men would shift move and offer seats the women carried varieties of fans with them folded newspapers bamboo whisks or perfumed kerchiefs to start the air moving about their faces as they talked what they talked of all evening long no one remembered next day it wasnt important to anyone what the adults talked about it was only important that the sounds came and went over the delicate ferns that bordered the porch on three sides it was only important that the darkness filled the town like black water being poured over the houses and that the cigars glowed and that the conversations went on and on the female gossip moved out disturbing the first mosquitoes so they danced in frenzies on the air the male voices invaded the old house timbers if you closed your eyes and put your head down against the floor boards you could hear the mens voices rumbling like a distant political earthquake constant unceasing rising or falling a pitch douglas sprawled back on the dry porch planks completely contented and reassured by these voices which would speak on through eternity flow in a stream of murmurings over his body over his closed eyelids into his drowsy ears for all time the rocking chairs sounded like crickets the crickets sounded like rocking chairs and the mosscovered rain barrel by the diningroom window produced another generation of mosquitoes to provide a topic of conversation through endless summers ahead sitting on the summernight porch was so good so easy and so reassuring that it could never be done away with these were rituals that were right and lasting the lighting of pipes the pale hands that moved knitting needles in the dimness the eating of foilwrapped chilled eskimo pies the coming and going of all the people for at some time or other during the evening everyone visited here the neighbors down the way the people across the street miss fern and miss roberta humming by in their electric runabout giving tom or douglas a ride around the block and then coming up to sit down and fan away the fever in their cheeks or mr jonas the junkman having left his horse and wagon hidden in the alley and ripe t bursting with words would come up the steps looking as fresh as if his talk had never been said before and somehow it never had and last of all the children who had been off squinting their way through a last hideandseek or kickthecan panting glowing would sickle quietly back like boomerangs along the soundless lawn to sink beneath the talking talking talking of the porch voices which would weigh and gentle them down oh the luxury of lying in the fern night and the grass night and the night of susurrant slumbrous voices weaving the dark together the grownups had forgotten he was there so still so quiet douglas lay noting the plans they were making for his and their own futures and the voices chanted drifted in moonlit clouds of cigarette smoke while the moths like late appleblossoms come alive tapped faintly about the far street lights and the voices moved on into the coming years in front of the united cigar store this evening the men were gathered to burn dirigibles sink battleships blow up dynamite works and all in all savor the very bacteria in their porcelain mouths that would someday stop them cold clouds of annihilation loomed and blew away in their cigar smoke about a nervous figure who could be seen dimly listening to the sound of shovels and spades and the intonations of ashes to ashes dust to dust this figure was that of leo auffmann the town jeweler who widening his large liquiddark eyes at last threw up his childlike hands and cried out in dismay stop in gods name get out of that graveyard lee how right you are said grandfather spaulding passing on his nightly stroll with his grandsons douglas and tom but lee only you can shut these doomtalkers up invent something that will make the future brighter well rounded infinitely joyous youve invented bicycles fixed the pennyarcade contraptions been our town movie projectionist havent you sure said douglas invent us a happiness machine the men laughed dont said leo auffmann how have we used machines so far to make people cry yes every time man and the machine look like they will get on all rightboom someone adds a cog airplanes drop bombs on us cars run us off cliffs so is the boy wrong to ask no no his voice faded as leo auffmann moved to the curb to touch his bicycle as if it were an animal what can i lose he murmured a little skin off my fingers a few pounds of metal some sleep ill do it so help me lee said grandfather we didnt mean but leo auffmann was gone pedaling off through the warm summer evening his voice drifting back ill do it you know said tom in awe i bet he will watching him cycle the brick streets of evening you could see that leo auffmann was a man who coasted along enjoying the way the thistles ticked in the hot grass when the wind blew like a furnace or the way the electric power lines sizzled on the rainwet poles he was a man who did not suffer but pleasured in sleepless nights of brooding on the great clock of the universe running down or winding itself up who could tell but many nights listening he decided first one way and then the other the shocks of life he thought biking along what were they getting born growing up growing old dying not much to do about the first butthe other three the wheels of his happiness machine spun whirling golden light spokes along the ceiling of his head a machine now to help boys change from peach fuzz to briar bramble girls from toadstool to nectarine and in the years when your shadow leaned clear across the land as you lay abed nights with your heartbeat mounting to the billions his invention must let a man drowse easy in the falling leaves like the boys in autumn who comfortably strewn in the dry stacks are content to be a part of the death of the world papa his six children saul marshall joseph rebecca ruth naomi all ages from five to fifteen came rushing across the lawn to take his bike each touching him at once we waited we got ice cream moving toward the porch he could feel his wifes smile there in the dark five minutes passed in comfortable eating silence then holding a spoonful of mooncolored ice cream up as if it were the whole secret of the universe to be tasted carefully he said lena what would you think if i tried to invent a happiness machine somethings wrong she asked quickly grandfather walked douglas and tom home halfway there charlie woodman and john huff and some other boys rushed by like a swarm of meteors their gravity so huge they pulled douglas away from grandfather and tom and swept him off toward the ravine dont get lost son i wont i wont the boys plunged into darkness tom and grandfather walked the rest of the way in silence except when they turned in at home and tom said boy a happiness machinehot diggety dont hold your breath said grandpa the courthouse clock struck eight the courthouse clock struck nine and it was getting late and it was really night on this small street in a small town in a big state on a large continent on a planet earth hurtling down the pit of space toward nowhere or somewhere and tom feeling every mile of the long drop he sat by the frontdoor screen looking out at that rushing blackness that looked very innocent as if it was holding still only when you closed your eyes and lay down could you feel the world spinning under your bed and hollowing your ears with a black sea that came in and broke on cliffs that werent there there was a smell of rain mother was ironing and sprinkling water from a corked ketchup bottle over the crackling dry clothes behind tom one store was still open about a block awaymrs singers finally just before it was time for mrs singer to close her store mother relented and told tom run get a pint of ice cream and be sure she packs it tight he asked if he could get a scoop of chocolate on top because he didnt like vanilla and mother agreed he clutched the money and ran barefooted over the warm evening cement sidewalk under the apple and oak trees toward the store the town was so quiet and far off you could hear only the crickets sounding in the spaces beyond the hot indigo trees that hold back the stars his bare feet slapped the pavement he crossed the street and found mrs singer moving ponderously about her store singing yiddish melodies pint ice cream she said chocolate on top yes he watched her fumble the metal top off the icecream freezer and manipulate the scoop packing the cardboard pint chockfull with chocolate on top yes he gave the money received the chill icy pack and rubbing it across his brow and cheek laughing thumped barefootedly homeward behind him the lights of the lonely little store blinked out and there was only a street light shimmering on the corner and the whole city seemed to be going to sleep opening the screen door he found mom still ironing she looked hot and irritated but she smiled just the same when will dad be home from lodge meeting he asked about eleven or eleventhirty mother replied she took the ice cream to the kitchen divided it giving him his special portion of chocolate she dished out some for herself and the rest was put away for douglas and your father when they come they sat enjoying the ice cream wrapped at the core of the deep quiet summer night his mother and himself and the night all around their small house on the small street he licked each spoonful of ice cream thoroughly before digging for another and mom put her ironing board away and the hot iron in its open case cooling and she sat in the armchair by the phonograph eating her dessert and saying my land it was a hot day today earth soaks up all the heat and lets it out at night itll be soggy sleeping they both sat listening to the night pressed down by every window and door and complete silence because the radio needed a new battery and they had played all the knickerbocker quartet records and al jolson and two black crows records to exhaustion so tom just sat on the hardwood floor and looked out into the dark dark dark pressing his nose against the screen until the flesh of its tip was molded into small dark squares i wonder where doug is its almost ninethirty hell be here tom said knowing very well that douglas would be he followed mom out to wash the dishes each sound each rattle of spoon or dish was amplified in the baked evening silently they went to the living room removed the couch cushions and together yanked it open and extended it down into the double bed it secretly was mother made the bed punching pillows neatly to flump them up for their heads then as he was unbuttoning his shirt she said wait awhile tom why because i say so you look funny mom mom sat down a moment then stood up went to the door and called he listened to her calling and calling douglas douglas oh doug douglasssssss over and over her calling floated out into the summer warm dark and never came back the echoes paid no attention douglas douglas douglas douglas and as he sat on the floor a coldness that was not ice cream and not winter and not part of summers heat went through tom he noticed moms eyes sliding blinking the way she stood undecided and was nervous all of these things she opened the screen door stepping out into the night she walked down the steps and down the front sidewalk under the lilac bush he listened to her moving feet she called again silence she called twice more tom sat in the room any moment now douglas would answer from down the long long narrow street all right mom all right mother hey but he didnt answer and for two minutes tom sat looking at the madeup bed the silent radio the silent phonograph at the chandelier with the crystal bobbins gleaming quietly at the rug with the scarlet and purple curlicues on it he stubbed his toe on the bed purposely to see if it hurt it did whining the screen door opened and mother said come on tom well take a walk where to just down the block come on he took her hand together they walked down st james street underfoot the concrete was still warm and the crickets were sounding louder against the darkening dark they reached a corner turned and walked toward the west ravine off somewhere a car floated by flashing its lights in the distance there was such a complete lack of life light and activity here and there back off from where they were walking faint squares of light glowed where people were still up but most of the houses darkened were sleeping already and there were a few lightless places where the occupants of a dwelling sat talking low night talk on their front porches you heard a porch swing squeaking as you walked by i wish your father was home said mother her large hand squeezed around his small one just waitll i get that boy the lonely ones around again killing people no ones safe anymore you never know when the lonely onell turn up or where so help me when doug gets homeill spank him within an inch of his life now they had walked another block and were standing by the holy black silhouette of the german baptist church at the corner of chapel street and glen rock in back of the church a hundred yards away the ravine began he could smell it it had a darksewer rottenfoliage thickgreen odor it was a wide ravine that cut and twisted across towna jungle by day a place to let alone at night mother often declared he should have felt encouraged by the nearness of the german baptist church but he was not because the building was not illumined was cold and useless as a pile of ruins on the ravine edge he was only ten years old he knew little of death fear or dread death was the waxen effigy in the coffin when he was six and greatgrandfather passed away looking like a great fallen vulture in his casket silent withdrawn no more to tell him how to be a good boy no more to comment succinctly on politics death was his little sister one morning when he awoke at the age of seven looked into her crib and saw her staring up at him with a blind blue fixed and frozen stare until the men came with a small wicker basket to take her away death was when he stood by her high chair four weeks later and suddenly realized shed never be in it again laughing and crying and making him jealous of her because she was born that was death and death was the lonely one unseen walking and standing behind trees waiting in the country to come in once or twice a year to this town to these streets to these many places where there was little light to kill one two three women in the past three years that was death but this was more than death this summer night deep down under the stars was all things you would ever feel or see or hear in your life drowning you all at once leaving the sidewalk they walked along a trodden pebbled weedfringed path while the crickets rose in a loud full drumming chorus he followed obediently behind brave fine tall motherdefender of the universe together then they approached reached and paused at the very end of civilization the ravine here and now down in that pit of jungled blackness were suddenly all the things he would never know or understand all the things without names lived in the huddled tree shadow in the odor of decay he realized he and his mother were alone her hand trembled he felt the tremble why but she was bigger stronger more intelligent than himself wasnt she did she too feel that intangible menace that groping out of darkness that crouching malignancy down below was there then no strength in growing up no solace in being an adult no sanctuary in life no fleshly citadel strong enough to withstand the scrabbling assault of midnights doubts flushed him ice cream lived again in his throat stomach spine and limbs he was instantly cold as a wind out of december gone he realized that all men were like this that each person was to himself one alone one oneness a unit in a society but always afraid like here standing if he should scream if he should holler for help would it matter blackness could come swiftly swallowing in one titanically freezing moment all would be concluded long before dawn long before police with flashlights might probe the dark disturbed pathway long before men with trembling brains could rustle down the pebbles to his help even if they were within five hundred yards of him now and help certainly was in three seconds a dark tide could rise to take all ten years from him and the essential impact of lifes loneliness crushed his beginningtotremble body mother was alone too she could not look to the sanctity of marriage the protection of her familys love she could not look to the united states constitution or the city police she could not look anywhere in this very instant save into her heart and there she would find nothing but uncontrollable repugnance and a will to fear in this instant it was an individual problem seeking an individual solution he must accept being alone and work on from there he swallowed hard clung to her oh lord dont let her die please he thought dont do anything to us father will be coming home from lodge meeting in an hour and if the house is empty mother advanced down the path into the primeval jungle his voice trembled mom dougs all right dougs all right hes all right dougs all right mothers voice was strained high he always comes through here i tell him not to but those darned kids they come through here anyway some night hell come through and never come out again never come out again that could mean anything tramps criminals darkness accident most of all death alone in the universe there were a million small towns like this all over the world each as dark as lonely each as removed as full of shuddering and wonder the reedy playing of minorkey violins was the small towns music with no lights but many shadows oh the vast swelling loneliness of them the secret damp ravines of them life was a horror lived in them at night when at all sides sanity marriage children happiness were threatened by an ogre called death mother raised her voice into the dark doug douglas suddenly both of them realized something was wrong the crickets had stopped chirping silence was complete never in his life a silence like this one one so utterly complete why should the crickets cease why what reason theyd never stopped ever before not ever unless unless something was going to happen it was as if the whole ravine was tensing bunching together its black fibers drawing in power from sleeping countrysides all about for miles and miles from dewsodden forest and dells and rolling hills where dogs tilted heads to moons from all around the great silence was sucked into one center and they were the core of it in ten seconds now something would happen something would happen the crickets kept their truce the stars were so low he could almost brush the tinsel there were swarms of them hot and sharp growing growing the silence growing growing the tenseness oh it was so dark so far away from everything oh god and then way way off across the ravine okay mom coming mother and again hi mom coming mom and then the quick scuttering of tennis shoes padding down through the pit of the ravine as three kids came dashing giggling his brother douglas chuck woodman and john huff running giggling the stars sucked up like the stung antennae of ten million snails the crickets sang the darkness pulled back startled shocked angry pulled back losing its appetite at being so rudely interrupted as it prepared to feed as the dark retreated like a wave on the shore three children piled out of it laughing hi mom hi tom hey it smelled like douglas all right sweat and grass and the odor of trees and branches and the creek about him young man youre going to get a licking declared mother she put away her fear instantly tom knew she would never tell anyone of it ever it would be in her heart though for all time as it was in his heart for all time they walked home to bed in the late summer night he was glad douglas was alive very glad for a moment there he had thought far off in the dim moonlit country over a viaduct and down a valley a train rushed along whistling like a lost metal thing nameless and running tom went to bed shivering beside his brother listening to that train whistle and thinking of a cousin who lived way out in the country where that train ran now a cousin who died of pneumonia late at night years and years ago he smelled the sweat of doug beside him it was magic tom stopped trembling only two things i know for sure doug he whispered what nighttimes awful darkis one whats the other the ravine at night dont belong in mr auffmanns happiness machine if he ever builds it douglas considered this awhile you can say that again they stopped talking listening suddenly they heard footsteps coming down the street under the trees outside the house now on the sidewalk from her bed mother called quietly thats your father it was late at night on the bent parch leo auffmann wrote a list he could not see in the dark exclaiming ah or thats another when he hit upon a fine component then the frontdoor screen made a moth sound tapping lena he whispered she sat down next to him on the swing in her nightgown not slim the way girls get when they are not loved at seventeen not fat the way women get when they are not loved at fifty but absolutely right a roundness a firmness the way women are at any age he thought when there is no question she was miraculous her body like his was always thinking for her but in a different way shaping the children or moving ahead of him into any room to change the atmosphere there to fit any particular mood he was in there seemed no long periods of thought for her thinking and doing moved from her head to her hand and back in a natural and gentle circuiting he could not and cared not to blueprint that machine she said at last we dont need it no he said but sometimes you got to build for others i been figuring what to put in motion pictures radios stereoscopic viewers all those in one place so any man can run his hand over it and smile and say yes sir thats happiness yes he thought to make a contraption that in spite of wet feet sinus trouble rumpled beds and those threeinthemorning hours when monsters ate your soul would manufacture happiness like that magic salt mill that thrown in the ocean made salt forever and turned the sea to brine who wouldnt sweat his soul out through his pores to invent a machine like that he asked the world he asked the town he asked his wife in the porch swing beside him lenas uneasy silence was an opinion silent now too head back he listened to the elm leaves above hissing in the wind dont forget he told himself that sound too must be in the machine a minute later the porch swing the porch stood empty in the dark grandfather smiled in his sleep feeling the smile and wondering why it was there he awoke he lay quietly listening and the smile was explained for he heard a sound which was far more important than birds or the rustle of new leaves once each year he woke this way and lay waiting for the sound which meant that summer had officially begun and it began on a morning such as this when a boarder a nephew a cousin a son or a grandson came out on the lawn below and moved in consecutively smaller quadrangles north and east and south and west with a clatter of rotating metal through the sweet summer grass clover blossoms the few unharvested dandelion fires ante sticks pebbles remnants of last years july fourth squibs and punks but predominantly clear green a fount leaped up from the chattering mower a cool soft fount grandfather imagined it tickling his legs spraying his warm face filling his nostrils with the timeless scent of a new season begun with the promise that yes well all live another twelve months god bless the lawn mower he thought who was the fool who made january first new years day no they should set a man to watch the grasses across a million illinois ohio and iowa lawns and on that morning when it was long enough for cutting instead of rachets and hems and yelling there should be a great swelling symphony of lawn mowers reaping fresh grass upon the prairie lands instead of confetti and serpentine people should throw grass spray at each other on the one day each year that really represents beginning he snorted at his own lengthy discussion of the affair went to the window and leaned out into the mellow sun shine and sure enough there was a boarder a young newspaperman named forrester just finishing a row morning mr spaulding give em hell bill cried grandpa heartily and soon downstairs eating grandmas breakfast with the window open so the rattling buzz of the lawn mower lolled about his eating it gives you confidence grandpa said that lawn mower listen to it wont be using the lawn mower much longer grandma set down a stack of wheat cakes they got a new kind of grass bill forresters putting in this morning never needs cutting dont know what they call it but it just grows so long and no longer grandpa stared at the woman youre finding a poor way to joke with me go look for yourself lands sake said grandma it was bill forresters idea the new grass is waiting in little flats by the side of the house you just dig small holes here and there and put the new grass in spots by the end of the year the new grass kills off the old and you sell your lawn mower grandpa was up from his chair through the hall and out the front door in ten seconds bill forrester left his machine and came over smiling squinting in the sun thats right he said bought the grass yesterday thought while im on vacation id just plant it for you why wasnt i consulted about this its my lawn cried grandfather thought youd appreciate it mr spaulding well i dont think i do appreciate it lets see this confounded grass of yours they stood by the little square pads of new grass grandpa toed at it with one end of his shoe suspiciously looks like plain old grass to me you sure some horse trader didnt catch you early in the morning when you werent fully awake ive seen the stuff growing in california only so high and no higher if it survives our climate itll save us getting out here next year once a week to keep the darned stuff trimmed thats the trouble with your generation said grandpa bill im ashamed of you you a newspaperman all the things in life that were put here to savor you eliminate save time save work you say he nudged the grass trays disrespectfully bill when youre my age youll find out its the little savors and little things that count more than big ones a walk on a spring morning is better than an eightymile ride in a hoppedup car you know why because its full of flavors full of a lot of things growing youve time to seek and find i knowyoure after the broad effect now and i suppose thats fit and proper but for a young man working on a newspaper you got to look for grapes as well as watermelons you greatly admire skeletons and i like fingerprints well and good right now such things are bothersome to you and i wonder if it isnt because youve never learned to use them if you had your way youd pass a law to abolish all the little jobs the little things but then youd leave yourselves nothing to do between the big jobs and youd have a devil of a time thinking up things to do so you wouldnt go crazy instead of that why not let nature show you a few things cutting grass and pulling weeds can be a way of life son bill forrester was smiling quietly at him i know said grandpa i talk too much theres no one id rather hear lecture continued then lilacs on a bush are better than orchids and dandelions and devil grass are better why because they bend you over and turn you away from all the people and the town for a little while and sweat you and get you down where you remember you got a nose again and when youre all to yourself that way youre really yourself for a little while you get to thinking things through alone gardening is the handiest excuse for being a philosopher nobody guesses nobody accuses nobody knows but there you are plate in the peonies socrates forcegrowing his own hemlock a man toting a sack of blood manure across his lawn is kin to atlas letting the world spin easy on his shoulder as samuel spaulding esquire once saiddig in the earth delve in the soul spin those mower blades bill and walk in the spray of the fountain of youth end of lecture besides a mess of dandelion greens is good eating once in a while how many years since you had dandelion greens for supper sir we wont go into that bill kicked one of the grass flats slightly and nodded about this grass now i didnt finish telling it grows so close its guaranteed to kill off clover and dandelions great god in heaven that means no dandelion wine next year that means no bees crossing our lot youre out of your mind son look here how much did all this cost you a dollar a flat i bought ten flats as a surprise grandpa reached into his pocket took out the old deepmouthed purse unclasped the silver clasp and removed from it three fivedollar bills bill youve just made a great profit of five dollars on this transaction i want you to deliver this load of unromantic grass into the ravine the garbage dumpanywherebut i ask you in a civil and humble voice not to plant it in my yard your motives are above reproach but my motives i feel because im approaching my tenderest years must be considered first yes sir bill pocketed the bills reluctantly bill you just plant this new grass some other year the day after i die bill youre free to tear up the whole damn lawn think you can wait another five years or so for an old orator to kick off i know dam well i can wait bill said theres a thing about the lawn mower i cant even tell you but to me its the most beautiful sound in the world the freshest sound of the season the sound of summer and id miss it fearfully if it wasnt there and id miss the smell of cut grass bill bent to pick up a flat here i go to the ravine youre a good understanding young man and will make a brilliant and sensitive reporter said grandfather helping him this i predict the morning passed noon came on grandpa retired after lunch read a little whittier and slept well on through the day when he awoke at three the sun was streaming through the windows bright and fresh he lay in bed and was startled to hear the old the familiar the memorable sound why he said someones using the lawn mower but the lawn was just cut this morning he listened again and yes there it was the endless droning chatter up and down up and down he leaned out the window and gaped why its bill bill forrester you there has the sun got you youre cutting the lawn again bill looked up smiled a white smile and waved i know i think i missed a few spots and while grandpa lay in bed for the next five minutes smiling and at ease bill forrester cut the lawn north then west then south and finally in a great green spraying fountain toward the east on sunday morning leo auffmann moved slowly through his garage expecting some wood a curl of wire a hammer or wrench to leap up crying start here but nothing leaped nothing cried for a beginning should a happiness machine he wondered be something you can carry in your pocket or he went on should it be something that carries you in its pocket one thing i absolutely know he said aloud it should be bright he set a can of orange paint in the center of the workbench picked up a dictionary and wandered into the house lena he glanced at the dictionary are you pleased contented joyful delighted do you feel lucky fortunate are things clever and fitting successful and suitable for you lena stopped slicing vegetables and closed her eyes read me the list again please she said he shut the book what have i done you got to stop and think an hour before you can tell me all i ask is a simple yes or no youre not contented delighted joyful cows are contented babies and old people in second childhood are delighted god help them she said as for joyful lee look how i laugh scrubbing out the sink he peered closely at her and his face relaxed lena its true a man doesnt appreciate next month maybe well get away im not complaining she cried im not the one comes in with a list sayingstick out your tongue lee do you ask what makes your heart beat all night no next will you ask whats marriage who knows lee dont ask a man who thinks like that how it runs how things work falls off the trapeze in the circus chokes wondering how the muscles work in the throat eat sleep breathe lee and stop staring at me like im something new in the house lena auffmann froze she sniffed the air oh my god look what you done she yanked the oven door open a great cloud of smoke poured through the kitchen happiness she wailed and for the first time in six months we have a fight happiness and for the first time in twenty years its not bread its charcoal for supper when the smoke cleared leo auffmann was gone the fearful clangor the collision of man and inspiration the flinging about of metal lumber hammer nails t square screwdriver continued for many days on occasion defeated leo auffmann loitered out through the streets nervous apprehensive jerking his head at the slightest sound of distant laughter listened to childrens jokes watching what made them smile at night he sat on neighbors crowded porches listening to the old folks weigh and balance life and at each explosion of merriment leo auffmann quickened like a general who has seen the forces of darkness routed and whose strategy has been reaffirmed on his way home he felt triumphant until he was in his garage with the dead tools and the inanimate lumber then his bright face fell away in a pale funk and to cover his sense of failure he banged and crashed the parts of his machine about as if they really did make sense at last it began to shape itself and at the end of the ten days and nights trembling with fatigue selfdedicated half starved fumbling and looking as if he had been riven by lightning leo auffmann wandered into his house the children who had been screaming horribly at each other fell silent as if the red death had entered at the chiming of the clock the happiness machine husked leo auffmann is ready lee auffmann said his wife has lost fifteen pounds he hasnt talked to his children in two weeks they are nervous they fight listen his wife is nervous shes gained ten pounds shell need new clothes look surethe machine is ready but happy who can say lee leave off with the clock youre building youll never find a cuckoo big enough to go in it man was not made to tamper with such things its not against god no but it sure looks like its against leo auffmann another week of this and well bury him in his machine but leo auffmann was too busy noticing that the room was falling swiftly up how interesting he thought lying on the floor darkness closed in a great wink on him as someone screamed something about that happiness machine three times the first thing he noticed the next morning was dozens of birds fluttering around in the air stirring up ripples like colored stones thrown into an incredibly clear stream gonging the tin roof of the garage softly a pack of multibred dogs pawfooted one by one into the yard to peer and whine gently through the garage door four boys two girls and some men hesitated in the driveway and then edged along under the cherry trees leo auffmann listening knew what it was that had reached out and called them all into the yard the sound of the happiness machine it was the sort of sound that might be heard coming from a giants kitchen on a summer day there were all kinds of hummings low and high steady and then changing incredible foods were being baked there by a host of whirring golden bees as big as teacups the giantess herself humming contentedly under her breath might glide to the door as vast as all summer her face a huge peachcolored moon gazing calmly out upon smiling dogs cornhaired boys and flourhaired old men wait said leo auffmann out loud i didnt turn the machine on this morning saul saul standing in the yard below looked up saul did you turn it on you told me to warm it up half an hour ago all right saul i forgot im not awake he fell back in bed his wife bringing his breakfast up paused by the window looking down at the garage tell me she said quietly if that machine is like you say has it got an answer to making babies in it somewhere can that machine make seventyyearold people twenty also how does death look when you hide in there with all that happiness hide if you died from overwork what should i do today climb in that big box down there and be happy also tell me lee how is our life you know how our house is seven in the morning breakfast the kids all of you gone by eight thirty and its just me and washing and me and cooking and socks to be darned weeds to be dug or i run to the store or polish silver whos complaining im just reminding you how the house is put together lee whats in it so now answer how do you get all those things i said in one machine thats not how its built im sorry i got no time to look then and she kissed his cheek and went from the room and he lay smelling the wind that blew from the hidden machine below rich with the odor of those roasted chestnuts that sold in the autumn streets of a paris he had never known a cat moved unseen among the hypnotized dogs and boys to purr against the garage door in the sound of snowwaves crumbling down a faraway and rhythmically breathing shore tomorrow thought leo auffmann well try the machine all of us together late that night he awoke and knew something had wakened him far away in another room he heard someone crying saul he whispered getting out of bed in his room saul wept his head buried in his pillow nono he sobbed over over saul you had a nightmare tell me about it son but the boy only wept and sitting there on the boys bed leo auffmann suddenly thought to look out the window below the garage doors stood open he felt the hairs rise along the back of his neck when saul slept again uneasily whimpering his father went downstairs and out to the garage where not breathing he put his hand out in the cool night the happiness machines metal was too hot to touch so he thought saul was here tonight why was saul unhappy in need of the machine no happy but wanting to hold onto happiness always could you blame a boy wise enough to know his position who tried to keep it that way no and yet above quite suddenly something white was exhaled from sauls window leo auffmanns heart thundered then he realized the window curtain had blown out into the open night but it had seemed as intimate and shimmering a thing as a boys soul escaping his room and leo auffmann had flung up his hands as if to thwart it push it back into the sleeping house cold shivering he moved back into the house and up to sauls room where he seized the blowing curtain in and locked the window tight so the pale thing could not escape again then he sat on the bed and put his hand on sauls back a tale of two cities mine the old curiosity shop ha thats leo auffmanns all right great expectations that used to be mine but let great expectations be his now whats this asked leo auffmann entering this said his wife is sorting out the community property when a father scares his son at night its time to chop everything in half out of the way mr bleak house old curiosity shop in all these books no mad scientist lives like leo auffmann none youre leaving and you havent even tried the machine he protested try it once youll unpack youll stay tom swift and his electric annihilatorwhose is that she asked must i guess snorting she gave tom swift to leo auffmann very late in the day all the books dishes clothes linens had been stacked one here one there four here four there ten here ten there lena auffmann dizzy with counting had to sit down all right she gasped before i go lee prove you dont give nightmares to innocent sons silently leo auffmann led his wife into the twilight she stood before the eightfoottall orangecolored box thats happiness she said which button do i press to be overjoyed grateful contented and muchobliged the children had gathered now mama said saul dont i got to know what im yelling about saul she got in the machine sat down and looked out at her husband shaking her head its not me needs this its you a nervous wreck shouting please he said youll see he shut the door press the button he shouted in at his unseen wife there was a click the machine shivered quietly like a huge dog dreaming in its sleep papa said saul worried listen said leo auffmann at first there was nothing but the tremor of the machines own secretly moving cogs and wheels is mama all right asked naomi all right shes fine there now there and inside the machine lena auffmann could be heard saying oh and then again ah in a startled voice look at that said his hidden wife paris and later london there goes rome the pyramids the sphinx the sphinx you hear children leo auffmann whispered and laughed perfume cried lena auffmann surprised somewhere a phonograph played the blue danube faintly music im dancing only thinks shes dancing the father confided to the world amazing said the unseen woman leo auffmann blushed what an understanding wife and then inside the happiness machine lena auffmann began to weep the inventors smile faded shes crying said naomi she cant be she is said saul she simply cant be crying leo auffmann blinking pressed his ear to the machine butyeslike a baby he could only open the door wait there his wife sat tears rolling down her cheeks let me finish she cried some more leo auffmann turned off the machine stunned oh its the saddest thing in the world she wailed i feel awful terrible she climbed out through the door first there was paris whats wrong with paris i never even thought of being in paris in my life but now you got me thinking paris so suddenly i want to be in paris and i know im not its almost as good this machine no sitting in there i knew i thought its not real stop crying mama she looked at him with great dark wet eyes you had me dancing we havent danced in twenty years ill take you dancing tomorrow night no no its not important it shouldnt be important but your machine says its important so i believe itll be all right lee after i cry some more what else what else the machine says youre young im not it lies that sadness machine sad in what way his wife was quieter now lee the mistake you made is you forgot some hour some day we all got to climb out of that thing and go back to dirty dishes and the beds not made while youre in that thing sure a sunset lasts forever almost the air smells good the temperature is fine all the things you want to last last but outside the children wait on lunch the clothes need buttons and then lets be frank lee how long can you look at a sunset who wants a sunset to last who wants perfect temperature who wants air smelling good always so after awhile who would notice better for a minute or two a sunset after that lets have something else people are like that lee how could you forget did i sunsets we always liked because they only happen once and go away but lena thats sad no if the sunset stayed and we got bored that would be a real sadness so two things you did you should never have you made quick things go slow and stay around you brought things faraway to our backyard where they dont belong where they just tell you no youll never travel lena auffmann paris youll never see pome youll never visit but i always knew that so why tell me better to forget and make do lee make do eh leo auffmann leaned against the machine for support he snatched his burned hand away surprised so now what lena he said its not for me to say i know only so long as this thing is here ill want to come out or saul will want to come out like he did last night and against our judgment sit in it and look at all those places so far away and every time we will cry and be no fit family for you i dont understand he said how i could be so wrong just let me check to see what you say is true he sat down inside the machine you wont go away his wife nodded well wait lee he shut the door in the warm darkness he hesitated pressed the button and was just relaxing back in color and music when he heard someone screaming fire papa the machines on fire someone hammered the door he leaped up bumped his head and fell as the door gave way and the boys dragged him out behind him he heard a muffled explosion the entire family was running now leo auffmann turned and gasped saul call the fire department lena auffmann caught saul as he ran saul she said wait there was a gush of flame another muffled explosion when the machine was burning very well indeed lena auffmann nodded all right saul she said run call the fire department everybody who was anybody came to the fire there was grandpa spaulding and douglas and tom and most of the boarders and some of the old men from across the ravine and all the children from six blocks around and leo auffmanns children stood out front proud of how fine the flames looked jumping from the garage roof grandfather spaulding studied the smoke ball in the sky and said quietly lee was that it your happiness machine some year said leo auffmann ill figure it and tell you lena auffmann standing in the dark now watched as the firemen ran in and out of the yard the garage roaring settled upon itself leo she said it wont take a year to figure look around think keep quiet a little bit then come tell me ill be in the house putting books back on shelves and clothes back in closets fixing supper suppers late look how dark come children help mama when the firemen and the neighbors were gone leo auffmann was left with grandfather spaulding and douglas and tom brooding over the smoldering ruin he stirred his foot in the wet ashes and slowly said what he had to say the first thing you learn in life is youre a fool the last thing you learn in life is youre the same fool in one hour ive done a lot of thinking i thought leo auffmann is blindyou want to see the real happiness machine the one they patented a couple thousand years ago it still runs not good all the time no but it runs its been here all along but the fire said douglas sure the fire the garage but like lena said it dont take a year to figure what burned in the garage dont count they followed him up the frontporch steps here whispered leo auffmann the front window quiet and youll see it hesitantly grandfather douglas and tom peered through the large windowpane and there in small warm pools of lamplight you could see what leo auffmann wanted you to see there sat saul and marshall playing chess at the coffee table in the dining room rebecca was laying out the silver naomi was cutting paperdoll dresses ruth was painting water colors joseph was running his electric train through the kitchen door lena auffmann was sliding a pot roast from the steaming oven every hand every head every mouth made a big or little motion you could hear their faraway voices under glass you could hear someone singing in a high sweet voice you could smell bread baking too and you knew it was real bread that would soon be covered with real butter everything was there and it was working grandfather douglas and tom turned to look at leo auffmann who gazed serenely through the window the pink light on his cheeks sure he murmured there it is and he watched with nowgentle sorrow and nowquick delight and at last quiet acceptance as all the bits and pieces of this house mixed stirred settled poised and ran steadily again the happiness machine he said the happiness machine a moment later he was gone inside grandfather douglas and tom saw him tinkering making a minor adjustment here eliminate friction there busy among all those warm wonderful infinitely delicate forever mysterious and evermoving parts then smiling they went down the steps into the fresh summer night twice a year they brought the big flapping rugs oui into the yard and laid them where they looked out of place and uninhabited on the lawn then grandma and mother came from the house with what looked to be the back rungs of those beautiful looped wire chairs downtown in the sodafountain place these great wire wands were handed around so they stood douglas tom grandma greatgrandma and mother poised like a collection of witches and familiars over the duty pattens of old armenia then at a signal from greatgrandma a blink of the eyes or a gumming of the lips the flails were raised the harping wires banged down again and again upon the rugs take that and that said greatgrandma get the flies boys kill the cooties oh you said grandma to her mother they all laughed the dust storm puffed up about them their laughing became choked showers of lint tides of sand golden flakes of pipe tobacco fluttered shivered on the exploded and reexploded air pausing the boys saw the tread of their shoes and the older peoples shoes pressed a billion times in the warp and woof of this rug now to be smoothed clean as the tide of their beating swept again and again along the oriental shore theres where your husband spilled that coffee grandma gave the rug a blow heres where you dropped the cream greatgrandma whacked up a great twister of dust look at the scuff marks boys boys doublegrandma heres the ink from your pen pshaw mine was purple ink thats common blue bang look at the path worn from the hall door here to the kitchen door food thats what brings the lions to the water hole lets shift it put it back the other way around better yet lock the men out of the house make them leave their shoes outside the door bang bang they hung the rugs on the wash line now to finish the job tom looked at the intricate scrolls and loops the flowers the mysterious figures the shuttling patterns tom dont stand there strike boy its fun seeing things said tom douglas glanced up suspiciously what do you see the whole dam town people houses heres our house bang our street bang that black part theres the ravine bang theres school bang this funny cartoon heres you doug bang heres greatgrandma grandma mom bang how many years this rug been down fifteen fifteen years of people stomping across it i see every shoe print gasped tom land boy you got a tongue said greatgrandma i see all the things happened in that house in all those years right here bang all the past sure but i can see the future too just squinch up my eyes and peek around at the patterns there to see where well be walking running around tomorrow douglas stopped swinging the beater what else you see in the rug threads mostly said greatgrandma not much left but the underskin see how the manufacturer wove the thing right said tom mysteriously threads one way threads another i see it all dire fiends deadly sinners theres bad weather theres good picnics banquets strawberry festivals he tapped the beater from place to place portentously thats some boardinghouse you got me running said grandma glowing with exertion its all there fuzzylike hold your head on one side doug get one eye almost shut its better at night of course inside the rug on the floor lamplight and all then you get shadows all shapes light and dark and watch the threads running off feel the nap run your hand around on the fur smells just like a desert i bet all hot and sandy like inside a mummy case maybe look that red spot thats the happiness machine burning up catsup from somebodys sandwich no doubt said mom no happiness machine said douglas and was sad to see it burning there he had been counting on leo auffmann to keep things in order keep everybody smiling keep the small gyroscope he often felt inside himself tilting toward the sun every time the earth tilted toward outer space and darkness but no there was auffmanns folly ashes and cinders bang bang douglas struck look theres the green electric runabout miss fern miss roberta said tom honk honk bang they all laughed theres your lifestrings doug running along in knots too many sour apples pickles at bedtime which one where cried douglas peering this one one year from now this one two years from now and this one three four five years from now bang the wire beater hissed like a snake in the blind sky and one to grow on said tom he hit the rug so hard all the dust of five thousand centuries jumped from the shocked texture paused on the air a terrible moment and even as douglas stood eyes squinted to see the warp the woof the shivering pattern the armenian avalanche of dust roared soundless upon over down and around burying him forever before their eyes how it began with the children old mrs bentley never knew she often saw them like moths and monkeys at the grocers among the cabbages and hung bananas and she smiled at them and they smiled back mrs bentley watched them making footprints in winter snow filling their lungs with autumn smoke shaking down blizzards of spring appleblossoms but felt no fear of them as for herself her house was in extreme good order everything set to its station the floors briskly swept the foods neatly tinned the hatpins thrust through cushions and the drawers of her bedroom bureaus crisply filled with the paraphernalia of years mrs bentley was a saver she saved tickets old theater programs bits of lace scarves rail transfers all the tags and tokens of existence ive a stack of records she often said heres caruso that was in in new york i was sixty and john was still alive heres tune moon i think right after john died that was the huge regret of her life in a way the one thing she had most enjoyed touching and listening to and looking at she hadnt saved john was far out in the meadow country dated and boxed and hidden under grasses and nothing remained of him but his high silk hat and his cane and his good suit in the closet so much of the rest of him had been devoured by moths but what she could keep she had kept her pinkflowered dresses crushed among moth balls in vast black trunks and cutglass dishes from her childhoodshe had brought them all when she moved to this town five years ago her husband had owned rental property in a number of towns and like a yellow ivory chess piece she had moved and sold one after another until now she was here in a strange town left with only the trunks and furniture dark and ugly crouched about her like the creatures of a primordial zoo the thing about the children happened in the middle of summer mrs bentley coming out to water the ivy upon her front porch saw two coolcolored sprawling girls and a small boy lying on her lawn enjoying the immense prickling of the grass at the very moment mrs bentley was smiling down upon them with her yellow mask face around a corner like an elfin band came an icecream wagon it jingled out icy melodies as crisp and rimmed as crystal wineglasses tapped by an expert summoning all the children sat up turning their heads like sunflowers after the sun mrs bentley called would you like some here the icecream wagon stopped and she exchanged money for pieces of the original ice age the children thanked her with snow in their mouths their eyes darting from her buttonedup shoes to her white hair dont you want a bite said the boy no child im old enough and cold enough the hottest day wont thaw me laughed mrs bentley they carried the miniature glaciers up and sat three in a row on the shady porch glider im alice shes jane and thats tom spaulding how nice and im mrs bentley they called me helen they stared at her dont you believe they called me helen said the old lady i didnt know old ladies had first names said tom blinking mrs bentley laughed dryly you never hear them used he means said jane my dear when you are as old as i they wont call you jane either old age is dreadfully formal its always mrs young people dont like to call you helen it seems much too flip how old are you asked alice i remember the pterodactyl mrs bentley smiled no but how old seventytwo they gave their cold sweets an extra long suck deliberating thats old said tom i dont feel any different now than when i was your age said the old lady our age yes once i was a pretty little girl just like you jane and you alice they did not speak whats the matter nothing jane got up oh you dont have to go so soon i hope you havent finished eating is something the matter my mother says it isnt nice to fib said jane of course it isnt its very bad agreed mrs bentley and not to listen to fibs who was fibbing to you jane jane looked at her and then glanced nervously away you were i mrs bentley laughed and put her withered claw to her small bosom about what about your age about being a little girl mrs bentley stiffened but i was many years ago a little girl just like you come on alice tom just a moment said mrs bentley dont you believe me i dont know said jane no but how ridiculous its perfectly obvious everyone was young once not you whispered jane eyes down almost to herself her empty ice stick had fallen in a vanilla puddle on the porch floor but of course i was eight nine ten years old like all of you the two girls gave a short quicklysealedup laugh mrs bentleys eyes glittered well i cant waste a morning arguing with tenyearolds needless to say i was ten myself once and just as silly the two girls laughed tom looked uneasy youre joking with us giggled jane you werent really ten ever were you mrs bentley you run on home the woman cried suddenly for she could not stand their eyes i wont have you laughing and your names not really helen of course its helen goodbye said the two girls giggling away across the lawn under the seas of shade tom followed them slowly thanks for the ice cream once i played hopscotch mrs bentley cried after them but they were gone mrs bentley spent the rest of the day slamming teakettles about loudly preparing a meager lunch and from time to time going to the front door hoping to catch those insolent fiends on their laughing excursions through the late day but if they had appeared what could she say to them why should she worry about them the idea said mrs bentley to her dainty roseclustered teacup no one ever doubted i was a girl before what a silly horrible thing to do i dont mind being oldnot reallybut i do resent having my childhood taken away from me she could see the children racing off under the cavernous trees with her youth in their frosty fingers invisible as air after supper for no reason at all with a senseless certainty of motion she watched her own hands like a pair of ghostly gloves at a seance gather together certain items in a perfumed kerchief then she went to her front porch and stood there stiffly for half an hour as suddenly as night birds the children flew by and mrs bentleys voice brought them to a fluttering rest yes mrs bentley come up on this porch she commanded them and the girls climbed the steps tom trailing after yes mrs bentley they thumped the mrs like a bass piano chord extra heavily as if that were her first name ive some treasures to show you she opened the perfumed kerchief and peered into it as if she herself might be surprised she drew forth a hair comb very small and delicate its rim twinkling with rhinestones i wore this when i was nine she said jane turned it in her hand and said how nice lets see cried alice and here is a tiny ring i wore when i was eight said mrs bentley it doesnt fit my finger now you look through it and see the tower of pisa ready to fall lets see it lean the girls passed it back and forth between them until tome fitted it to her hand why its just my size she exclaimed and the comb fits my head gasped alice mrs bentley produced some jackstones here she said i once played with these she threw them they made a constellation on the porch and here in triumph she flashed her trump card a postal picture of herself when she was seven years old in a dress like a yellow butterfly with her golden curls and blown blueglass eyes and angelic pouting lips whos this little girl asked jane its me the two girls held onto it but it doesnt look like you said jane simply anybody could get a picture like this somewhere they looked at her for a long moment any more pictures mrs bentley asked alice of you later you got a picture of you at fifteen and one at twenty and one at forty and fifty the girls chortled i dont have to show you anything said mrs bentley then we dont have to believe you replied jane but this picture proves i was young thats some other little girl like us you borrowed it i was married wheres mr bentley hes been gone a long time if he were here hed tell you how young and pretty i was when i was twentytwo but hes not here and he cant tell so what does that prove i have a marriage certificate you could have borrowed that too only way ill believe you were ever youngjane shut her eyes to emphasize how sure she was of herselfis if you have someone say they saw you when you were ten thousands of people saw me but theyre dead you little foolor ill in other towns i dont know a soul here just moved here a few years ago so no one saw me young well there you are jane blinked at her companions nobody saw her listen mrs bentley seized the girls wrist you must take these things on faith someday youll be as old as i people will say the same oh no theyll say those vultures were never hummingbirds those owls were never orioles those parrots were never bluebirds one day youll be like me no we wont said the girls will we they asked one another wait and see said mrs bentley and to herself she thought oh god children are children old women are old women and nothing in between they cant imagine a change they cant see your mother she said to jane havent you noticed over the years the change no said jane shes always the same and that was true you lived with people every day and they never altered a degree it was only when people had been off on a long trip for years that they shocked you and she felt like a woman who has been on a roaring black train for seventytwo years landing at last upon the rail platform and everyone crying helen bentley is that you i guess we better go home said jane thanks for the ring it just fits me thanks for the comb its fine thanks for the picture of the little girl come backyou cant have those mrs bentley shouted as they raced down the steps theyre mine dont said tom following the girls give them back no she stole them they belonged to some other little girl she stole them thanks cried alice so no matter how she called after them the girls were gone like moths through darkness im sorry said tom on the lawn looking up at mrs bentley he went away they took my ring and my comb and my picture thought mrs bentley trembling there on the steps oh im empty empty its part of my life she lay awake for many hours into the night among her trunks and trinkets she glanced over at the neat stacks of materials and toys and opera plumes and said aloud does it really belong to me or was it the elaborate trick of an old lady convincing herself that she had a past after all once a time was over it was done you were always in the present she may have been a girl once but was not now her childhood was gone and nothing could fetch it back a night wind blew in the room the white curtain fluttered against a dark cane which had leaned against the wall near the other bricabrac for many years the cane trembled and fell out into a patch of moonlight with a soft thud its gold ferule glittered it was her husbands opera cane it seemed as if he were pointing it at her as he often had using his soft sad reasonable voice when they upon rare occasions disagreed those children are right he would have said they stole nothing from you my dear these things dont belong to you here you now they belonged to her that other you so long ago oh thought mrs bentley and then as though an ancient phonograph record had been set hissing under a steel needle she remembered a conversation she had once had with mr bentleymr bentley so prim a pink carnation in his whiskbroomed lapel saying my dear you never will understand time will you youre always trying to be the things you were instead of the person you are tonight why do you save those ticket stubs and theater programs theyll only hurt you later throw them away my dear but mrs bentley had stubbornly kept them it wont work mr bentley continued sipping his tea no matter how hard you try to be what you once were you can only be what you are here and now time hypnotizes when youre nine you think youve always been nine years old and will always be when youre thirty it seems youve always been balanced there on that bright rim of middle life and then when you turn seventy you are always and forever seventy youre in the present youre trapped in a young now or an old now but there is no other now to be seen it had been one of the few but gentle disputes of their quiet marriage he had never approved of her bricabrackery be what you are bury what you are not he had said ticket stubs are trickery saving things is a magic trick with mirrors if he were alive tonight what would he say youre saving cocoons thats what hed say corsets in a way you can never fit again so why save them you cant really prove you were ever young pictures no they lie youre not the picture affidavits no my dear youre not the dates or the ink or the paper youre not these trunks of junk and dust youre only you here nowthe present you mrs bentley nodded at the memory breathing easier yes i see i see the goldferuled cane lay silently on the moonlit rug in the morning she said to it i will do something final about this and settle down to being only me and nobody else from any other year yes thats what ill do she slept the morning was bright and green and there at her door bumping softly on the screen were the two girls got any more to give us mrs bentley more of the little girls things she led them down the hall to the library take this she gave jane the dress in which she had played the mandarins daughter at fifteen and this and this a kaleidoscope a magnifying glass pick anything you want said mrs bentley books skates dolls everythingtheyre yours ours only yours and will you help me with a little work in the next hour im building a big fire in my back yard im emptying the trunks throwing out this trash for the trashman it doesnt belong to me nothing ever belongs to anybody well help they said mrs bentley led the procession to the back yard arms full a box of matches in her hand so the rest of the summer you could see the two little girls and tom like wrens on a wire on mrs bentleys front porch waiting and when the silvery chimes of the icicle man were heard the front door opened mrs bentley floated out with her hand deep down the gullet of her silvermouthed purse and for half an hour you could see them there on the porch the children and the old lady putting coldness into warmness eating chocolate icicles laughing at last they were good friends how old are you mrs bentley seventytwo how old were you fifty years ago seventytwo you werent ever young were you and never wore ribbons or dresses like these no have you got a first name my name is mrs bentley and youve always lived in this one house always and never were pretty never never in a million trillion years the two girls would bend toward the old lady and wait in the pressed silence of four oclock on a summer afternoon never said mrs bentley in a million trillion years you got the nickel tablet ready doug sure doug licked his pencil good what you got in there so far all the ceremonies july fourth and all that dandelionwine making and junk like bringing out the porch swing huh

this he leaned over and whispered in his brothers ear douglas wrote it they both looked at it ill be darned said douglas i never thought of that thats brilliant its true old people never were children and its kind of sad said tom sitting still theres nothing we can do to help them seems like the town is full of machines said douglas running mr auffmann and his happiness machine miss fern and miss roberta and their green machine now charlie what you handing me a time machine panted charlie woodman pacing him mothers scouts injuns honor travels in the past and future john huff asked easily circling them only in the past but you cant have everything here we are charlie woodman pulled up at a hedge douglas peered in at the old house heck thats colonel freeleighs place cant be no time machine in there hes no inventor and if he was wed known about an important thing like a time machine years ago charlie and john tiptoed up the frontporch steps douglas snorted and shook his head staying at the bottom of the steps okay douglas said charlie be a knucklehead sure colonel freeleigh didnt invent this time machine but hes got a proprietary interest in it and its been here all the time we were too darned dumb to notice so long douglas spaulding to you charlie took johns elbow as though he was escorting a lady opened the frontporch screen and went in the screen door did not slam douglas had caught the screen and was following silently charlie walked across the enclosed porch knocked and opened the inside door they all peered down a long dark hall toward a room that was lit like an undersea grotto soft green dim and watery colonel freeleigh silence he dont hear so good whispered charlie but he told me to just come on in and yell colonel the only answer was the dust sifting down and around the spiral stairwell from above then there was a faint stir in that undersea chamber at the far end of the hall they moved carefully along and peered into room which contained but two pieces of furniturean old man and a chair they resembled each other both so thin you could see just how they had been put together ball and socket sinew and joint the rest of the room was raw floor boards naked walls and ceiling and vast quantities of silent air he looks dead whispered douglas no hes just thinking up new places to travel to said charlie very proud and quiet colonel one of the pieces of brown furniture moved and it was the colonel blinking around focusing and smiling a wild and toothless smile charlie colonel doug and john here came to welcome boys sit down sit down the boys sat uneasily on the floor but wheres the said douglas charlie jabbed his ribs quickly wheres the what asked colonel freeleigh wheres the point in us talking he means charlie grimaced at douglas then smiled at the old man we got nothing to say colonel you say something beware charlie old men only lie in wait for people to ask them to talk then they rattle on like a rusty elevator wheezing up a shaft ching ling soo suggested charlie casually eh said the colonel boston charlie prompted boston the colonel frowned why ching ling soo of course yes sir colonel let me see now the colonels voice murmured it drifted away on serene lake waters let me see the boys waited colonel freeleigh closed his eyes october first a calm cool fine autumn night the boston variety theatre yes there it is full house all waiting orchestra fanfare curtain ching ling soo the great oriental magician there he is on stage and there i am front row center the bullet trick he cries volunteers the man next to me goes up examine the rifle says ching mark the bullet says he now fire this marked bullet from this rifle using my face for a target and says ching at the far end of the stage i will catch the bullet in my teeth colonel freeleigh took a deep breath and paused douglas was staring at him half puzzled half in awe john huff and charlie were completely lost now the old man went on his head and body frozen only his lips moving ready aim fire cries ching ling soo bang the rifle cracks bang ching ling soo shrieks he staggers he falls his face all red pandemonium audience on its feet something wrong with the rifle dead someone says and theyre right dead horrible horrible ill always remember his face a mask of red the curtain coming down fast and the women weeping boston variety theatre poor man colonel freeleigh slowly opened his eyes boy colonel said charlie that was fine now how about pawnee bill pawnee bill and the time you was on the prairie way back in pawnee bill the colonel moved into darkness eighteen seventyfiveyes me and pawnee bill on a little rise in the middle of the prairie waiting shh says pawnee bill listen the prairie like a big stage all set for the storm to come thunder soft thunder again not so soft and across that prairie as far as the eye could see this big ominous yellowdark cloud full of black lightning somehow sunk to earth fifty miles wide fifty miles long a mile high and no more than an inch off the ground lord i cried lordfrom up on my hilllord the earth pounded like a mad heart boys a heart gone to panic my bones shook fit to break the earth shook ratatat ratatat boom rumble thats a rare word rumble oh how that mighty storm rumbled along down up and over the rises and all you could see was the cloud and nothing inside thats them cried pawnee bill and the cloud was dust not vapors or rain no but prairie dust flung up from the tinderdry grass like fine corn meal like pollen all blazed with sunlight now for the sun had come out i shouted again why because in all that hellfire filtering dust now a veil moved aside and i saw them i swear it the grand army of the ancient prairie the bison the buffalo the colonel let the silence build then broke it again heads like giant negroes fists bodies like locomotives twenty fifty two hundred thousand iron missiles shot out of the west gone off the track and flailing cinders their eyes like blazing coals rumbling toward oblivion i saw that the dust rose up and for a little while showed me that sea of humps of dolloping manes black shaggy waves rising fallingshoot says pawnee bill shoot and i cock and aim shoot he says and i stand there feeling like gods right hand looking at the great vision of strength and violence going by going by midnight at noon like a glinty funeral train all black and long and sad and forever and you dont fire at a funeral train now do you boys do you all i wanted then was for the dust to sink again and cover the black shapes of doom which pummeled and jostled on in great burdensome commotions and boys the dust came down the cloud hid the million feet that were drumming up the thunder and dusting out the storm i heard pawnee bill curse and hit my arm but i was glad i hadnt touched that cloud or the power within that cloud with so much as a pellet of lead i just wanted to stand watching time bundle by in great trundlings all hid by the storm the bison made and carried with them toward eternity an hour three hours six it took for the storm to pass on away over the horizon toward less kind men than me pawnee bill was gone i stood alone stone deaf i walked all numb through a town a hundred miles south and heard not the voices of men and was satisfied not to hear for a little while i wanted to remember the thunder i hear it still on summer afternoons like this when the rain shapes over the lake a fearsome wondrous soundone i wish you might have heard the dim light filtered through colonel freeleighs nose which was large and like white porcelain which cupped a very thin and tepid orange tea indeed is he asleep asked douglas at last no said charlie just recharging his batteries colonel freeleigh breathed swiftly softly as if hed run a long way at last he opened his eyes yes sir said charlie in admiration hello charlie the colonel smiled at the boys puzzledly thats doug and thats john said charlie howdedo boys the boys said hello but said douglas where is the my gosh youre dumb charlie jabbed douglas in the arm he turned to the colonel you were saying sir was i murmured the old man the civil war suggested john huff quietly does he remember that do i remember said the colonel oh i do i do his voice trembled as he shut up his eyes again everything exceptwhich side i fought on the color of your uniform charlie began colors begin to run on you whispered the colonel its gotten hazy i see soldiers with me but a long time ago stopped seeing color in their coats or caps i was born in illinois raised in virginia married in new york built a house in tennessee and now very late here i am good lord back in green town so you see why the colors run and blend but you remember which side of hills you fought on charlie did not raise his voice did the sun rise on your left or right did you march toward canada or mexico seems some mornings the sun rose on my good right hand some mornings over my left shoulder we marched all directions its most seventy years since you forget suns and mornings that long past you remember winning dont you a battle won somewhere no said the old man deep under i dont remember anyone winning anywhere any time wars never a winning thing charlie you just lose all the time and the one who loses last asks for terms all i remember is a lot of losing and sadness and nothing good but the end of it the end of it charles that was a winning all to itself having nothing to do with guns but i dont suppose thats the kind of victory you boys mean for me to talk on antietam said john huff ask about antietam i was there the boys eyes grew bright bull run ask him bull run i was there softly what about shiloh theres never been a year in my life i havent thought what a lovely name and what a shame to see it only on battle records shiloh then fort sumter i saw the first puffs of powder smoke a dreaming voice so many things come back oh so many things t remember songs aus quiet along the potomac tonight where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming their tents in the rays of the clear autumn moon or the light of the watchfire are gleaming remember remember au quiet along the potomac tonight no sound save the rush of the river while soft falls the dew on the face of the deadthe pickets off duty forever after the surrender mr lincoln on the white house balcony asked the band to play look away look away look away dixie land and then there was the boston lady who one night wrote a song will last a thousand years mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored late nights i feel my mouth move singing back in another time ye cavaliers of dixie who guard the southern shores when the boys come home in triumph brother with the laurels they shall gain so many songs sung on both sides blowing north blowing south on the night winds we are coming father abraham three hundred thousand more tenting tonight tenting tonight tenting on the old camp ground hurrah hurrah we bring the jubilee hurrah hurrah the flag that makes us free the old mans voice faded the boys sat for a long while without moving then charlie turned and looked at douglas and said well is he or isnt he douglas breathed twice and said he sure is the colonel opened his eyes i sure am what he asked a time machine murmured douglas a time machine the colonel looked at the boys for a full five seconds now it was his voice that was full of awe is that what you boys call me yes sir colonel yes sir the colonel sat slowly back in his chair and looked at the boys and looked at his hands and then looked at the blank wall beyond them steadily charlie arose well i guess we better go so long and thanks colonel what oh so long boys douglas and john and charlie went on tiptoe out the door colonel freeleigh though they crossed his line of vision did not see them go in the street the boys were startled when someone shouted from a firstfloor window above hey they looked up yes sir colonel the colonel leaned out waving one arm i thought about what you said boys yes sir andyoure right why didnt i think of it before a time machine by god a time machine yes sir so long boys come aboard any time at the end of the street they turned again and the colonel was still waving they waved back feeling warm and good then went on chugachug said john i can travel twelve years into the past whamchugding yeah said charlie looking back at that quiet house but you cant go a hundred years no mused john i cant go a hundred years thats really traveling thats really some machine they walked for a full minute in silence looking at their feet they came to a fence last one over this fence said douglas is a girl all the way home they called douglas dora long after midnight tom woke to find douglas scribbling rapidly in the nickel tablet by flashlight doug whats up up everythings up im counting my blessings tom look here the happiness machine didnt work out did it but who cares i got the whole year lined up anyway need r to run anywhere on the main streets i got the green town trolley to look around and spy on the world from need to run anywhere off the main streets i knock on miss fern and i miss robertas door and they charge up the batteries on their electric runabout and we go sailing down the sidewalks need to run down alleys and over fences to see that part of green town you only see around back and behind and creep up on and i got my brandnew sneakers sneakers runabout i trolley im set but even better tom even better listen if i want to go where no one else can go because theyre not smart enough to even think of it if i want to charge back to and then transfer to and transfer again crosstown to i just hop on the old colonel freeleigh express im writing it down here this way maybe old people were never children like we claim with mrs bentley but big or little some of them were standing around at appomattox the summer of they got indian vision and can sight back further than you and me will ever sight ahead that sounds swell doug what does it mean douglas went on writing it means you and me aint got half the chance to be fartravelers they have if were lucky well hit forty fortyfive fifty thats just a jog around the block to them its when you hit ninety ninetyfive a hundred that youre fartraveling like heck the flashlight went out they lay there in the moonlight tom whispered douglas i got to travel all those ways see what i can see but most of all i got to visit colonel freeleigh once twice three times a week hes better than all the other machines he talks you listen and the more he talks the more he gets you to peering around and noticing things he tells you youre riding on a very special train by gosh and sure enough its hue hes been down the track and knows and now here we come you and me along the same track but further on and so much looking and snuffing and handling things to do you need old colonel freeleigh to shove and say look alive so you remember every second every darn thing there is to remember so when kids come around when youre real old you can do for them what the colonel once did for you thats the way it is tom i got to spend a lot of time visiting him and listening so i can go fartraveling with him as often as he can tom was silent a moment then he looked over at douglas there in the dark fartraveling you make that up maybe yes and maybe no fartraveling whispered tom only one thing im sure of said douglas closing his eyes it sure sounds lonely bang a door slammed in an attic dust jumped off bureaus and bookcases two old women collapsed against the attic door each scrabbling to lock it tight tight a thousand pigeons seemed to have leaped off the roof right over their heads they bent as if burdened ducked under the drum of beating wings then they stopped their mouths surprised what they heard was only the pure sound of panic their hearts in their chests above the uproar they tried to make themselves heard whatve we done poor mister quartermain we mustve killed him and someone mustve seen and followed us look miss fern and miss roberta peered from the cobwebbed attic window below as if no great tragedy had occurred the oaks and elms continued to grow in fresh sunlight a boy strolled by on the sidewalk turned strolled by again looking up in the attic the old women peered at each other as if trying to see their faces in a running stream the police but no one hammered the downstairs door and cried in the name of the law whos that boy down there douglas douglas spaulding lord hes come to ask for a ride in our green machine he doesnt know our pride has ruined us pride and that electrical contraption that terrible salesman from gumport falls its his fault him and his talking talking talking like soft rain on a summer roof suddenly it was another day another noon they sat with white fans and dishes of cool trembling lime jello on their arbored porch out of the blinding glare out of the yellow sun glittering splendid as a princes coach the green machine it glided it whispered an ocean breeze delicate as maple leaves fresher than creek water it purred with the majesty of cats prowling the noontide in the machine his panama hat afloat in vaseline above his ears the salesman from gumport falls the machine with a rubber tread soft shrewd whipped up their scalded white sidewalk whirred to the lowest porch step twirled stopped the salesman leaped out blocked off the sun with his panama in this small shadow his smile flashed the name is william tara and this he pinched a bulb a seal barked is the hem he lifted black satin cushions storage batteries a smell of lightning blew on the hot air steering lever foot rest overhead parasol here in tote is the green machine in the dark attic the ladies shuddered remembering eyes shut why didnt we stab him with our darning needles shh listen someone knocked on the front door downstairs after a time the knocking stopped they saw a woman cross the yard and enter the house next door only lavinia nebbs come with an empty cup to borrow sugar i guess hold me im afraid they shut their eyes the memoryplay began again an old straw hat on an iron trunk was suddenly flourished it seemed by the man from gumport falls thanks i will have some iced tea you could hear the cool liquid shock his stomach in the silence then he turned his gaze upon the old ladies like a doctor with a small light looking into their eyes and nostrils and mouths ladies i know youre both vigorous you look it eighty yearshe snapped his fingersmean nothing to you but there are times mind when youre so busy busy you need a friend indeed a friend in need and that is the twoseater green machine he fixed his bright stuffedfox greenglasseyed gaze upon that wonderful merchandise it stood smelling new in the hot sunlight waiting for them a parlor chair comfortably put to wheels quiet as a swans feather they felt him breathe softly in their faces listen they listened the storage batteries are fully charged and ready now listen not a tremor not a sound electric ladies you recharge it every night in your garage it couldntthat is the younger sister gulped some iced tea it couldnt electrocute us accidently perish the thought he vaulted to the machine again his teeth like those you saw in dental windows alone grimacing at you as you passed by late at night tea parties he waltzed the runabout in a circle bridge clubs soirees galas luncheons birthday gatherings d a r breakfasts he purred away as if running off forever he returned in a rubbertired hush gold star mother suppers he sat primly corseted by his supple characterization of a woman easy steering silent elegant arrivals and departures no license needed on hot daystake the breeze ahhe glided by the porch head back eyes closed deliciously hair tousling in the wind thus cleanly sliced through he trudged reverently up the porch stairs hat in hand turning to gaze at the trial model as at the altar of a familiar church ladies he said softly twentyfive dollars down ten dollars a month for two years fern was first down the steps onto the double seat she sat apprehensively her hand itched she raised it she dared tweak the rubber bulb horn a seal barked roberta on the porch screamed hilariously and leaned over the railing the salesman joined their hilarity he escorted the older sister down the steps roaring at the same time taking out his pen and searching in his straw hat for some piece of paper or other and so we bought it remembered miss roberta in the attic horrified at their nerve we shouldve been warned always did think it looked like a little car off the carnival roller coaster well said fern defensively my hips bothered me for years and you always get tired walking it seemed so refined so regal like in the old days when women wore hoop skirts they sailed the green machine sailed so quietly like an excursion boat wonderfully easy to steer a baton handle you twitched with your hand so oh that glorious and enchanted first weekthe magical afternoons of golden light humming through the shady town on a dreaming timeless river seated stiffly smiling at passing acquaintances sedately purring out their wrinkled claws at every turn squeezing a hoarse cry from the black rubber horn at intersections sometimes letting douglas or tom spaulding or any of the other boys who trotted chatting alongside hitch a little ride fifteen slow and pleasurable miles an hour top speed they came and went through the summer sunlight and shadow their faces freckled and stained by passing trees going and coming like an ancient wheeled vision and then whispered fern this afternoon oh this afternoon it was an accident but we ran away and thats criminal this noon the smell of the leather cushions under their bodies the gray perfume smell of their own sachets trailing back as they moved in their silent green machine through the small languorous town it happened quickly rolling soft onto the sidewalk at noon because the streets were blistering and fiery and the only shade was under the lawn trees they had glided to a blind comer bulbing their throaty horn suddenly like a jackinthebox mister quartermain had tottered from nowhere look out screamed miss fern look out screamed miss roberta look out cried mister quartermain the two women grabbed each other instead of the steering stick there was a terrible thud the green machine sailed on in the hot daylight under the shady chestnut trees past the ripening apple trees looking back only once the two old ladies eyes filled with faded horror the old man lay on the sidewalk silent and here we are mourned miss fern in the darkening attic oh why didnt we stop why did we run away shh they both listened the rapping downstairs came again when it stopped they saw a boy cross the lawn in the dim light just douglas spaulding come for a ride again they both sighed the hours passed the sun was going down weve been up here all afternoon said roberta tiredly we cant stay in the attic three weeks hiding till everybody forgets wed starve whatll we do then do you think anyone saw and followed us they looked at each other no nobody saw the town was silent all the tiny houses putting on lights there was a smell of watered grass and cooking suppers from below time to put on the meat said miss fern frankll be coming home in ten minutes do we dare go down frankd call the police if he found the house empty thatd make things worse the sun went swiftly now they were only two moving things in the musty blackness do you wondered miss fern think hes dead mister quartermain a pause yes roberta hesitated well check the evening paper they opened the attic door and looked carefully at the steps leading down oh if frank hears about this hell take our green machine away from us and its so lovely and nice riding and getting the cool wind and seeing the town we wont tell him wont we they helped each other down the creaking stairs to the second floor stopping to listen in the kitchen they peered at the pantry peeked out windows with frightened eyes and finally set to work frying hamburger on the stove after five minutes of working silence fern looked sadly over at roberta and said ive been thinking were old and feeble and dont like to admit it were dangerous we owe a debt to society for running off and a kind of silence fell on the frying in the kitchen as the two sisters faced each other nothing in their hands i think thatfern stared at the wall for a long timewe shouldnt drive the green machine ever again roberta picked up a plate and held it in her thin hand notever she said no but said roberta we dont have toto get rid of it do we we can keep it cant we fern considered this yes i guess we can keep it at least thatll be something ill go out now and disconnect the batteries roberta was leaving just as frank their younger brother only fiftysix years entered hi sisters he cried roberta brushed past him without a word and walked out into the summer dusk frank was carrying a newspaper which fern immediately snatched from him trembling she looked it through and through and sighing gave it back to him saw doug spaulding outside just now said he had a message for you said for you not to worryhe saw everything and everythings all right what did he mean by that im sure i wouldnt know fem turned her back and searched for her handkerchief oh well these kids frank looked at his sisters back for a long moment then shrugged supper almost ready he asked pleasantly yes fern set the kitchen table there was a bulbing cry from outside once twice three timesfar away whats that frank peered through the kitchen window into the dusk whats roberta up to look at her out there sitting in the green machine poking the rubber horn once twice more in the dusk softly like some kind of mournful animal the bulbing sound was pinched out whats got into her demanded frank you just leave her alone screamed fern frank looked surprised a moment later roberta entered quietly without looking at anyone and they all sat down to supper the first light on the roof outside very early morning the leaves on all the trees tremble with a soft awakening to any breeze the dawn may offer and then far off around a curve of silver track comes the trolley balanced on four small steelblue wheels and it is painted the color of tangerines epaulets of shimmery brass cover it and pipings of gold and its chrome bell bings if the ancient motorman taps it with a wrinkled shoe the numerals on the trolleys front and sides are bright as lemons within its seats prickle with cool green moss something like a buggy whip flings up from its roof to brush the spider thread high in the passing trees from which it takes its juice from every window blows an incense the allpervasive blue and secret smell of summer storms and lightning down the long elmshadowed streets the trolley moves along the motormans graygloved hand touched gently timelessly to the levered controls at noon the motorman stopped is car in the middle of the block and leaned out hey and douglas and charlie and tom and all the boys and girls on the block saw the gray glove waving and dropped from trees and left skip ropes in white snakes on lawns to run and sit in the green plush seats and there was no charge mr tridden the conductor kept his glove over the mouth of the money box as he moved the trolley on down the shady block calling hey said charlie where are we going last ride said mr tridden eyes on the high electric wire ahead no more trolley bus starts to run tomorrow going to retire me with a pension they are soa free ride for everyone watch out he ricocheted the brass handle the trolley groaned and swung round an endless green curve and all the time in the world held still as if only the children and mr tridden and his miraculous machine were riding an endless river away last day asked douglas stunned they cant do that its bad enough the green machine is gone locked up in the garage and no arguments and bad enough my new tennis shoes are getting old and slowing down howll i get around butbutthey cant take off the trolley why said douglas no matter how you look at it a bus aint a trolley dont make the same kind of noise dont have tracks or wires dont throw sparks dont pour sand on the tracks dont have the same colors dont have a bell dont let down a step like a trolley does hey thats right said charlie i always get a kick watching a trolley let down the step like an accordion sure said douglas and then they were at the end of the line the silver tracks abandoned for eighteen years ran on into rolling country in people took the trolley out to chessmans park with vast picnic hampers the track never ripped up still lay rusting among the hills heres where we turn around said charlie heres where youre wrong mr tridden snapped the emergency generator switch now the trolley with a bump and a sailing glide swept past the city limits turned off the street and swooped downhill through intervals of odorous sunlight and vast acreages of shadow that smelled of toadstools here and there creek waters flushed the tracks and sun filtered through trees like green glass they slid whispering on meadows washed with wild sunflowers past abandoned way stations empty of all save transferpunched confetti to follow a forest stream into a summer country while douglas talked why just the smell of a trolley thats different i been on chicago buses they smell funny trolleys are too slow said mr tridden going to put busses on fusses for people and busses for school the trolley whined to a stop from overhead mr tridden reached down huge picnic hampers yelling the children helped him carry the baskets out by a creek that emptied into a silent lake where an ancient bandstand stood crumbling into termite dust they sat eating ham sandwiches and fresh strawberries and waxy oranges and mr tridden told them how it had been twenty years ago the band playing on that ornate stand at night the men pumping air into their brass horns the plump conductor flinging perspiration from his baton the children and fireflies running in the deep grass the ladies with long dresses and high pompadours treading the wooden xylophone walks with men in choking collars there was the walk now all softened into a fiber mush by the years the lake was silent and blue and serene and fish peacefully threaded the bright reeds and the motorman murmured on and on and the children felt it was some other year with mr tridden looking wonderfully young his eyes lighted like small bulbs blue and electric it was a drifting easy day nobody rushing and the forest all about the sun held in one position as mr triddens voice rose and fell and a darning needle sewed along the air stitching restitching designs both golden and invisible a bee settled into flower humming and humming the trolley stood like an enchanted calliope simmering where the sun fell on it the trolley was on their hands a brass smell as they ate ripe cherries the bright odor of the trolley blew from their clothes on the summer wind a loon flew over the sky crying somebody shivered mr tridden worked on his gloves well time to go parentsll think i stole you all for good the trolley was silent and cool dark like the inside of an icecream drugstore with a soft green rustling of velvet buff the seats were turned by the quiet children so they sat with their backs to the silent lake the deserted bandstand and the wooden planks that made a kind of music if you walked down the shore on them into other lands bing went the soft bell under mr triddens foot and they soared back over sunabandoned withered flower meadows through woods toward a town that seemed to crush the sides of the trolley with bricks and asphalt and wood when mr tridden stopped to let the children out in shady streets charlie and douglas were the last to stand near the opened tongue of the trolley the folding step breathing electricity watching mr triddens gloves on the brass controls douglas ran his fingers on the green creek moss looked at the silver the brass the wine color of the ceiling well so long again mr tridden goodby boys see you around mr tridden see you around there was a soft sigh of air the door collapsed shut tucking up its corrugated tongue the trolley sc slowly down the late afternoon brighter than the sun tangerine all flashing gold and lemon turned a far con wheeling and vanished gone away school busses charlie walked to the curb won even give us a chance to be late to school come get you a your front door never be late again in all our lives think of that nightmare doug just think it all over but douglas standing on the lawn was seeing how it would be tomorrow when the men would pour hot tar over the silver tracks so you would never know a trolley had e run this way he knew it would take as many years as could think of now to forget the tracks no matter how deeply buried some morning in autumn spring or winter he kn hed wake and if he didnt go near the window if he just lay deep and snug and warm in his bed he would hear it faint and far away and around the bend of the morning street up the avenue between the even rows of sycamore elm and maple it the quietness before the start of living past his house h would hear the familiar sounds like the ticking of a doe the rumble of a dozen metal barrels rolling the hum of single immense dragonfly at dawn like a merrygoround like a small electrical storm the color of blue lightning coming here and gone the trolleys chime the hiss like a sc fountain spigot as it let down and took up its step and starting of the dream again as on it sailed along its way traveling a hidden and buried track to some hidden and buried destination kickthecan after supper asked charlie sure said douglas kickthecan the facts about john huff aged twelve are simple and soon stated he could pathfind more trails than any choctaw or cherokee since time began could leap from the sky like a chimpanzee from a vine could live underwater two minutes and slide fifty yards downstream from where you last saw him the baseballs you pitched him he hit in the apple trees knocking down harvests he could jump sixfoot orchard walls swing up branches faster and come down fat with peaches quicker than anyone else in the gang he ran laughing he sat easy he was not a bully he was kind his hair was dark and curly and his teeth were white as cream he remembered the words to all the cowboy songs and would teach you if you asked he knew the names of all the wild flowers and when the moon would rise and set and when the tides came in or out he was in fact the only god living in the whole of green town illinois during the twentieth century that douglas spaulding knew of and right now he and douglas were hiking out beyond town on another warm and marbleround day the sky blue blownglass reaching high the creeks bright with mirror waters fanning over white stones it was a day as perfect as the flame of a candle douglas walked through it thinking it would go on this way forever the perfection the roundness the grass smell traveled on out ahead as far and fast as the speed of light the sound of a good friend whistling like an oriole pegging the softball as you horsedanced keyjingled the dusty paths all of it was complete everything could be touched things stayed near things were at hand and would remain it was such a fine day and then suddenly a cloud crossed the sky covered the sun and did not move again john huff had been speaking quietly for several minutes now douglas stopped on the path and looked over at him john say that again you heard me the first time doug did you say you weregoing away got my train ticket here in my pocket whoowhoo clang shushshushshushshush whooooooooo his voice faded john took the yellow and green train ticket solemnly from his pocket and they both looked at it tonight said douglas my gosh tonight we were going to play red light green light and statues how come all of a sudden you been here in green town all my life you just dont pick up and leave its my father said john hes got a job in milwaukee we werent sure until today my gosh here it is with the baptist picnic next week and the big carnival labor day and halloweencant your dad wait till then john shook his head good grief said douglas let me sit down they sat under an old oak tree on the side of the hill looking back at town and the sun made large trembling shadows around them it was cool as a cave in under the tree out beyond in sunlight the town was painted with heat the windows all gaping douglas wanted to run back in there where the town by its very weight its houses their bulk might enclose and prevent johns ever getting up and running off but were friends douglas said helplessly we always will be said john youll come back to visit every week or so wont you dad says only once or twice a year its eighty miles eighty miles aint far shouted douglas no its not far at all said john my grandmas got a phone ill call you or maybe well all visit up your way too thatd be great john said nothing for a long while well said douglas lets talk about something what my gosh if youre going away we got a million things to talk about all the things we wouldve talked about next month the month after praying mantises zeppelins acrobats sword swallowers go on like you was back there grasshoppers spitting tobacco funny thing is it dont feel like talking about grasshoppers you always did sure john looked steadily at the town but it guess this just aint the time john whats wrong you look funny john had closed his eyes and screwed up his face doug the terle house upstairs you know sure the colored windowpanes on the little round windows have they always been there sure you positive darned old windows been there since before we were born why i never saw them before today said john on the way walking through town i looked up and there they were doug what was i doing all these years i didnt see them you had other things to do did i john turned and looked in a kind of panic at douglas gosh doug why should those dam windows scare me i mean thats nothing to be scared of is it its just he floundered its just if i didnt see these windows until today what else did i miss and what about all the things i did see here in town will i be able to remember them when i go away anything you want to remember you remember t went to camp two summers ago up there i remembered no you didnt you told me you woke nights and couldnt remember your mothers face no some nights it happens to me in my own house scares heck out of me i got to go in my folks room and look at their faces while they sleep to be sure and i go back

as pie cot a motionpicture machine in my head lying in bed nights i can just turn on a light in my head and out it comes on the wall clear as heck and there youll be yelling and waving at me shut your eyes doug now tell me what color eyes i got dont peek what color eyes i got douglas began to sweat his eyelids twitched nervously aw heck john thats not fair tell me brown john turned away no sir what do you mean no youre not even close john closed his eyes turn around here said douglas open up let me see its no use said john you forgot already just the way i said turn around here douglas grabbed him by the hair and turned him slowly okay doug john opened his eyes green douglas dismayed let his hand drop your eyes are green well thats close to brown almost hazel doug dont lie to me all right said doug quietly i wont they sat there listening to the other boys running up the hill shrieking and yelling at them they raced along the railroad tracks opened their lunch in brownpaper sacks and sniffed deeply of the waxwrapped deviledham sandwiches and greensea pickles and colored peppermints they ran and ran again and douglas bent to scorch his ear on the hot steel rails hearing trains so far away they were unseen voyagings in other lands sending morsecode messages to him here under the killing sun douglas stood up stunned john for john was running and this was terrible because if you ran time ran you yelled and screamed and raced and rolled and tumbled and all of a sudden the sun was gone and the whistle was blowing and you were on your long way home to supper when you werent looking the sun got around behind you the only way to keep things slow was to watch everything and do nothing you could stretch a day to three days sure just by watching john there was no way to get him to help now save by a trick john ditch ditch the others yelling douglas and john sprinted off kiting the wind downhill letting gravity work for them over meadows around barns until at last the sound of the pursuers faded john and douglas climbed into a haystack which was like a great bonfire crisping under them lets not do anything said john just what i was going to say said douglas they sat quietly getting their breath there was a small sound like an insect in the hay they both heard it but they didnt look at the sound when douglas moved his wrist the sound ticked in another part of the haystack when he brought his arm around on his lap the sound ticked in his lap he let his eyes fall in a brief flicker the watch said three oclock douglas moved his right hand stealthily to the ticking pulled out the watch stem he set the hands back now they had all the time they would ever need to look long and close at the world feel the sun move like a fiery wind over the sky but at last john must have felt the bodiless weight of their shadows shift and lean and he spoke doug what time is it twothirty john looked at the sky dont thought douglas looks more like threethirty four said john boy scout you learn them things douglas sighed and slowly turned the watch ahead john watched him do this silently douglas looked up john punched him not hard at all in the arm with a swift stroke a plunge a train came and went so quickly the boys all leaped aside yelling shaking their fists after it douglas and john with them the train roared down the track two hundred people in it gone the dust followed it a little way toward the south then settled in the golden silence among the blue rails the boys were walking home im going to cincinnati when im seventeen and be a railroad fireman said charlie woodman i got an uncle in new york said jim ill go there and be a printer doug did not ask the others already the trains were chanting and he saw their faces drifting off on back observation platforms or pressed to windows one by one they slid away and then the empty track and the summer sky and himself on another train run in another direction douglas felt the earth move under his feet and saw their shadows move off the grass and color the air he swallowed hard then gave a screaming yell pulled back his fist shot the indoor ball whistling in the sky last one homes a rhinos behind they pounded down the tracks laughing flailing the air there went john huff not touching the ground at all and here came douglas touching it all the time it was seven oclock supper over and the boys gathering one by one from the sound of their house doors slammed and their parents crying to them not to slam the doors douglas and tom and charlie and john stood among half a dozen others and it was time for hideandseek and statues just one game said john then i got to go home the train leaves at nine whos going to be it me said douglas that the first time i ever heard of anybody volunteering to be it said tom douglas looked at john for a long moment start running he cried the boys scattered yelling john backed away then turned and began to lope douglas counted slowly he let them run far spread out separate each to his own small world when they had got their momentum up and were almost out of sight he took a deep breath statues everyone froze very quietly douglas moved across the lawn to where john huff stood like an iron deer in the twilight far away the other boys stood hands up faces grimaced eyes bright as stuffed squirrels but here was john alone and motionless and no one rushing or making a great outcry to spoil this moment douglas walked around the statue one way walked around the statue the other way the statue did not move it did not speak it looked at the horizon its mouth half smiling it was like that time years ago in chicago when they had visited a big place where the carved marble figures were and his walking around them in the silence so here was john huff with grass stains on his knees and the seat of his pants and cuts on his fingers and scabs on his elbows here was john huff with the quiet tennis shoes his feet sheathed in silence there was the mouth that had chewed many an apricot pie come summer and said many a quiet thing or two about life and the lay of the land and there were the eyes not blind like statues eyes but filled with molten green gold and there the dark hair blowing now north now south or any direction in the little breeze there was and there the hands with all the town on them dirt from roads and barkslivers from trees the fingers that smelled of hemp and vine and green apple old coins or picklegreen frogs there were the ears with the sunlight shining through them like bright warm peach wax and here invisible his spearmintbreath upon the air john now said douglas dont you move so much as an eyelash i absolutely command you to stay here and not move at all for the next three hours doug johns lips moved freeze said douglas john went back to looking at the sky but he was not smiling now i got to go he whispered not a muscle its the game i just got to get home now said john now the statue moved took its hands down out of the air and turned its head to look at douglas they stood looking at each other the other kids were putting their arms down too well play one more round said john except this time im it run the boys ran freeze the boys froze douglas with them not a muscle shouted john not a hair he came and stood by douglas boy this is the only way to do it he said douglas looked off at the twilight sky frozen statues every single one of you the next three minutes said john douglas felt john walking around him even as he had walked around john a moment ago he felt john sock him on the arm once not too hard so long he said then there was a rushing sound and he knew without looking that there was nobody behind him now far away a train whistle sounded douglas stood that way for a full minute waiting for the sound of the running to fade but it did not stop hes still running away but he doesnt sound any further off thought douglas why doesnt he stop running and then he realized it was only the sound of his heart in his body stop he jerked his hand to his chest stop running i dont like that sound and then he felt himself walking across the lawns among all the other statues now and whether they too were coming to life he did not know they did not seem to be moving at all for that matter he himself was only moving from the knees down the rest of him was cold stone and very heavy going up the front porch of his house he turned suddenly to look at the lawns behind him the lawns were empty a series of rifle shots screen doors banged one after the other a sunset volley along the street statues are best he thought theyre the only things you can keep on your lawn dont ever let them move once you do you cant do a thing with them suddenly his fist shot out like a piston from his side and it shook itself hard at the lawns and the street and the gathering dusk his face was choked with blood his eyes were blazing john he cried you john john youre my enemy you hear youre no friend of mine dont come back now ever get away you enemy you hear thats what you are its all off between us youre dirt thats all dirt john you hear me john as if a wick had been turned a little lower in a great clear lamp beyond the town the sky darkened still more he stood on the porch his mouth gasping and working his fist still thrust straight out at that house across the street and down the way he looked at the fist and it dissolved the world dissolved beyond it going upstairs in the dark where he could only feel his face but see nothing of himself not even his fists he told himself over and over im mad im angry i hate him im mad im angry i hate him ten minutes later slowly he reached the top of the stairs in the dark tom said douglas just promise me one thing okay its a promise what you may be my brother and maybe i hate you sometimes but stick around all right you mean youll let me follow you and the older guys when you go on hikes wellsureeven that what i mean is dont go away huh dont let any cars run over you or fall off a cliff i should say not whatta you think i am anyway cause if worst comes to worst and both of us are real oldsay forty or fortyfive some daywe can own a gold mine out west and sit there smoking corn silk and growing beards growing beards boy like i say you stick around and dont let nothing happen you can depend on me said tom its not you i worry about said douglas its the way god runs the world tom thought about this for a moment hes all right doug said tom he tries she came out of the the bathroom putting iodine on her finger where she had almost lopped it off cutting herself a chunk of cocoanut cake just then the mailman came up the porch steps opened the door and walked in the door slammed elmira brown jumped a foot sam she cried she waved her iodined finger on the air to cool it im still not used to my husband being a postman every time you just walk in it scares the life out of me sam brown stood there with the mail pouch half empty scratching his head he looked back out the door as if a fog had suddenly rolled in on a calm sweet summer morn sam youre home early she said cant stay he said in a puzzled voice spit it out whats wrong she came over and looked into his face maybe nothing maybe lots i just delivered some mail to clara goodwater up the street clara goodwater now dont get your dander up books it was from the johnsonsmith company racine wisconsin title of one booklets see now he screwed up his face then unscrewed it albertus magnusthats it being the approved verified sympathetic and natural egyptian secrets or he peered at the ceiling to summon the lettering white and black art for man and beast revealing the forbidden knowledge and mysteries of ancient philosophers clara goodwaters you say walking along i had a good chance to peek at the front pages no harm in that hidden secrets of life unveiled by that celebrated student philosopher chemist naturalist psychomist astrologer alchemist metallurgist sorcerer explanator of the mysteries of wizards and witchcraft together with recondite views of numerous arts and sciencesobscure plain practical etc there by god i got a head like a box brownie got the words even if i havent got the sense elmira stood looking at her iodined finger as if it were pointed at her by a stranger clara goodwater she murmured looked me right in the eye as i handed it over said going to be a witch firstclass no doubt get my diploma in no time set up business hex crowds and individuals old and young big and small then she kinda laughed put her nose in that book and went in elmira stared at a bruise on her arm carefully tongued a loose tooth in her jaw a door slammed tom spaulding kneeling on elmira browns front lawn looked up he had been wandering about the neighborhood seeing how the ants were doing here or there and had found a particularly good hill with a big hole in which all kinds of fiery bright pismires were tumbling about scissoring the air and wildly carrying little packets of dead grasshopper and infinitesimal bird down into the earth now here was something else mrs brown swaying on the edge of her porch as if shed just found out the world was falling through space at sixty trillion miles a second behind her was mr brown who didnt know the miles per second and probably wouldnt care if he did know you tom said mrs brown i need moral support and the equivalent of the blood of the lamb with me come along and off she rushed squashing ants and kicking tops off dandelions and trotting big spiky holes in flower beds as she cut across yards tom knelt a moment longer studying mrs browns shoulder blades and spine as she toppled down the street he read the bones and they were eloquent of melodrama and adventure a thing he did not ordinarily connect with ladies even though mrs brown had the remnants of a pirates mustache a moment later he was in tandem with her mrs brown you sure look mad you dont know what mad is boy watch out cried tom mrs elmira brown fell right over an iron dog lying asleep there on the green grass mrs brown you see mrs brown sat there clara goodwater did this to me magic magic never mind boy heres the steps you go first and kick any invisible strings out of the way ring that doorbell but pull your finger off quick the juicell burn you to a cinder tom did not touch the bell clara goodwater mrs brown flicked the bell button with her iodined finger far away in the cool dim empty rooms of the big old house a silver bell tinkled and faded tom listened still farther away there was a stir of mouselike running a shadow perhaps a blowing curtain moved in a distant parlor hello said a quiet voice and quite suddenly mrs goodwater was there fresh as a stick of peppermint behind the screen why hello there tom elmira what dont rush me we came over about your practicing to be a fullfledged witch mrs goodwater smiled your husbands not only a mailman but a guardian of the law got a nose out to here he didnt look at no mail hes ten minutes between houses laughing at post cards and tryin on mailorder shoes it aint what he seen its what you

across a driveway elmira screamed mrs brown cried tom a car backing out of a garage ran right over elmiras right big toe mrs elmira browns foot hurt her in the middle of the night so she got up and went down to the kitchen and ate some cold chicken and made a neat painfully accurate list of things first illnesses in the past year three colds four mild attacks of indigestion one seizure of bloat

cost she debated going back to bed ten thousand dollars in personal suffering try to settle this out of court she said half aloud eh said her husband awake she lay down in bed i simply refuse to die beg pardon he said i wont die she said staring at the ceiling thats what i always claimed said her husband and turned over to snore in the morning mrs elmira brown was up early and down to the library and then to the drugstore and back to the house where she was busy mixing all kinds of chemicals when her husband sam came home with an empty mail pouch at noon lunchs in the icebox elmira stirred a greenlooking porridge in a large glass good lord whats that asked her husband looks like a milk shake been left out in the sun for forty years got kind of a fungus on it fight magic with magic you going to drink that just before i go up into the honeysuckle ladies lodge for the big doings samuel brown sniffed the concoction take my advice get up those steps first then drink it whats in it snow from angels wings well really menthol to cool hells fires that burn you it says in this book i got at the library the juice of a fresh grape off the vine for thinking clear sweet thoughts in the face of dark visions it says also red rhubarb cream of tartar white sugar white of eggs spring water and clover buds with the strength of the good earth in them oh i could go on all day its here in the list good against bad white against black i cant lose oh youll win all right said her husband but will you know it think good thoughts im on my way to get tom for my charm poor boy said her husband innocent like you say and about to be tom limb from limb bargainbasement day at the honeysuckle lodge tomll survive said elmira and taking the bubbling concoction with her hid inside a quaker oats box with the lid on went out the door without catching her dress or snagging her new ninetyeightcent stockings realizing this she was smug all the way to toms house where he waited for her in his white summer suit as she had instructed phew said tom what you got in that box destiny said elmira i sure hope so said tom walking about two paces ahead of her the honeysuckle ladies lodge was full of ladies looking in each others mirrors and tugging at their skirts and asking to be sure their slips werent showing at one oclock mrs elmira brown came up the steps with a boy in white clothes he was holding his nose and screwing up one eye so he could only half see where he was going mrs brown looked at the crowd and then at the quaker oats box and opened the top and looked in and gasped and put the top back on without drinking any of that stuff in there she moved inside the hall and with her moved a rustling as of taffeta all the ladies whispering in a tide after her she sat down in back with tom and tom looked more miserable than ever the one eye he had open looked at the crowd of ladies and shut up for good sitting there elmira got the potion out and drank it slowly down at onethirty the president mrs goodwater banged the gavel and all but two dozen of the ladies quit talking ladies she called out over the summer sea of silks and laces capped here and there with white or gray its election time but before we start i believe mrs elmira brown wife of our eminent graphologist a titter ran through the room whats graphologist elmira elbowed tom twice i dont know whispered tom fiercely eyes shut feeling that elbow come out of darkness at him wife as i say of our eminent handwriting expert samuel brownmore laughterof the u s postal service continued mrs goodwater mrs brown wants to give us some opinions mrs brown elmira stood up her chair fell over backward and snapped shut like a bear trap on itself she jumped an inch off the floor and teetered on her heels which gave off cracking sounds like they would fall to dust any moment i got plenty to say she said holding the empty quaker oats box in one hand with a bible she grabbed tom with the other and plowed forward hitting several peoples elbows and muttering to them watch what youre doing careful you to reach the platform turn and knock a glass of water dripping over the table she gave mrs goodwater another bristly scowl when this happened and let her mop it up with a tiny handkerchief then with a secret look of triumph elmira drew forth the empty philter glass and held it up displaying it for mrs goodwater and whispering you know what was in this its inside me now lady the charmed circle surrounds me no knife can cleave no hatchet break through the ladies all talking did not hear mrs goodwater nodded held up her hands and there was silence elmira held tight to toms hand tom kept his eyes shut wincing ladies elmira said i sympathize with you i know what youve been through these last ten years i know why you voted for mrs goodwater here youve got boys girls and men to feed youve got budgets to follow you couldnt afford to have your milk sour your bread fall or your cakes as flat as wheels you didnt want mumps chicken pox and whooping cough in your house all in three weeks you didnt want your husband crashing his car or electrocuting himself on the hightension wires outside town but now all of thats over you can come out in the open now no more heartburns or backaches because ive brought the good word and were going to exorcise this witch weve got here everybody looked around but didnt see any witch i mean your president cried elmira me mrs goodwater waved at everyone today breathed elmira holding onto the desk for support i went to the library i looked up counteractions how to get rid of people who take advantage of others how to make witches leave off and go and i found a way to fight for all our rights i can feel the power growing i got the magic of all kinds of good roots and chemicals in me i got she paused and swayed she blinked once i got cream of tartar andi gotwhite hawkweed and milk soured in the light of the moon and she stopped and thought for a moment she shut her mouth and a tiny sound came from deep inside her and worked up through to come out the comers of her lips she closed her eyes for a moment to see where the strength was mrs brown you feelin all right asked mrs goodwater feelin fine said mrs brown slowly i put in some pulverized carrots and parsley root cut fine juniper berry again she paused as if a voice had said stop to her and she looked out across all those faces the room she noticed was beginning to turn slowly first from left to right then right to left rosemary roots and crowfoot flower she said rather dimly she let go of toms hand tom opened one eye and looked at her bay leaves nasturtium petals she said maybe you better sit down said mrs goodwater one lady at the side went and opened a window dry betel nuts lavender and crabapple seed said mrs brown and stopped quick now lets have the election got to have the votes ill tabulate no hurry elmira said mrs goodwater yes there is elmira took a deep trembling breath remember ladies no more fear do like you always wanted to do vote for me and the room was moving again up and down honesty in government all those in favor of mrs goodwater for president say aye aye said the whole room all those in favor of mrs elmira brown said elmira in a faint voice she swallowed after a moment she spoke alone aye she said she stood stunned on the rostrum a silence filled the room from wall to wall in that silence mrs elmira brown made a croaking sound she put her hand on her throat she turned and looked dimly at mrs goodwater who now very casually drew forth from her purse a small wax doll in which were a number of rusted thumbtacks tom said elmira show me the way to the ladies room yes m they began to walk and then hurry and then run elmira ran on ahead through the crowd down the aisle she reached the door and started left no elmira right right cried mrs goodwater elmira turned left and vanished there was a noise like coal down a chute elmira the ladies ran around like a girls basketball team colliding with each other only mrs goodwater made a straight line she found tom looking down the stairwell his hands clenched to the banister forty steps he moaned forty steps to the ground later on and for months and years after it was told how like an inebriate elmira brown negotiated those steps touching every one on her long way down it was claimed that when she began the fall she was sick to unconsciousness and that this made her skeleton rubber so she kind of rolled rather than ricocheted she landed at the bottom blinking and feeling better having left whatever it was that had made her uneasy all along the way true she was so badly bruised she looked like a tattooed lady but no not a wrist was sprained or an ankle twisted she held her head funny for three days kind of peering out of the sides of her eyeballs instead of turning to look but the important thing was mrs goodwater at the bottom of the steps pillowing elmiras head on her lap and dropping tears on her as the ladies gathered hysterically elmira i promise elmira i swear if you just live if you dont die you hear me elmira listen ill use my

elmira brown doing the same and after the two of them came all the one hundred twentythree members of the lodge not knowing if theyd just returned from a funeral or were on their way to a ball he watched them pass and shook his head dont need me no more he said no more at all so he tiptoed down the stairs before they missed him holding tight to the rail all the way for what its worth said tom theres the whole thing in a nutshell the ladies carrying on like crazy everybody standing around blowing their noses elmira brown sitting there at the bottom of the steps nothing broke her it bones made out of jello i suspect and the witch sobbin on her shoulder and then all of them goin upstairs suddenly laughing cryyi you figure it out i got out of there fast tom loosened his shirt and took off his tie magic you say asked douglas magic six ways from sunday you believe it yes i do and no i dont boy this town is full of stuff douglas peered off at the horizon where clouds filled the sky with immense shapes of old gods and warriors spells and wax dolls and needles and elixirs you said wasnt much as an elixir but awful fine as an upchuck blap wowie tom clutched his stomach and stuck out his tongue witches said douglas he squinted his eyes mysteriously and then there is that day when all around all around you hear the dropping of the apples one by one from the trees at first it is one here and one there and then it is three and then it is four and then nine and twenty until the apples plummet like rain fall like horse hoofs in the soft darkening grass and you are the last apple on the tree and you wait for the wind to work you slowly free from your hold upon the sky and drop you down and down long before you hit the grass you will have forgotten there ever was a tree or other apples or a summer or green grass below you will fall in darkness no colonel freeleigh opened his eyes quickly sat erect in his wheel chair he jerked his cold hand out to find the telephone it was still there he crushed it against his chest for a moment blinking i dont like that dream he said to his empty room at last his fingers trembling he lifted the receiver and called the longdistance operator and gave her a number and waited watching the bedroom door as if at any moment a plague of sons daughters grandsons nurses doctors might swarm in to seize away this last vital luxury he permitted his failing senses many days or was it years ago when his heart had thrust like a dagger through his ribs and flesh he had heard the boys belowtheir names what were they charles charlie chuck yes and douglas and tom he remembered calling his name far down the hall but the door being locked in their faces the boys turned away you cant be excited the doctor said no visitors no visitors no it visitors and he heard the boys moving across the street he saw them he waved and they waved back colonel colonel and now he sat alone with the little gray toad of a heart flopping weakly here or there in his chest from time to time colonel freeleigh said the operator heres your call mexico city erickson and now the far away but infinitely clear voice bueno jorge cried the old man senor freeleigh again this costs money let it cost you know what to do si the window the window jorge if you please a moment said the voice and thousands of miles away in a southern land in an office in a building in that land there was the sound of footsteps retreating from the phone the old man leaned forward gripping the receiver tight to his wrinkled ear that ached with waiting for the next sound the raising of a window ah sighed the old man the sounds of mexico city on a hot yellow noon through the open window into the waiting phone he c see jorge standing there holding the mouthpiece out out the bright day senor no no please let me listen he listened to the hooting of many metal horns squealing of brakes the calls of vendors selling redpurple bananas and jungle oranges in their stalls colonel freeleighs feet began to move hanging from the edge of his wheel chair making the motions of a man walking his eyes squeezed tight he gave a series of immense sniffs as if to gain the odors of meats hung on iron hooks in sunshine cloaked with flies like a mantle of raisins the smell of stone alleys wet with morning rain he could feel the sun bum his spinybearded cheek and he was twentyfive years old again walking walking looking smiling happy to be alive very much alert drinking in colors and smells a rap on the door quickly he hid the phone under his lap robe the nurse entered hello she said have you been good yes the old mans voice was mechanical he could hardly see the shock of a simple rap on the door was such that part of him was still in another city far removed he waited for his mind to rush homeit must be here to answer questions act sane be polite ive come to check your pulse not now said the old man youre not going anywhere are you she smiled he looked at the nurse steadily he hadnt been anywhere in ten years give me your wrist her fingers hard and precise searched for the sickness in his pulse like a pair of calipers whatve you been doing to excite yourself she demanded nothing her gaze shifted and stopped on the empty phone table at that instant a horn sounded faintly two thousand miles away she took the receiver from under the lap robe and held it before his face why do you do this to yourself you promised you wouldnt thats how you hurt yourself in the first place isnt it getting excited talking too much those boys up here jumping around they sat quietly and listened said the colonel and i told them things theyd never heard the buffalo i told them the bison it was worth it i dont care i was in a pure fever and i was alive it doesnt matter if being so alive kills a man its better to have the quick fever every time now give me that phone if you wont let the boys come up and sit politely i can at least talk to someone outside the room im sorry colonel your grandson will have to know about this i prevented his having the phone taken out last week now it looks like ill let him go ahead this is my house my phone i pay your salary he said to make you well not get you excited she wheeled his chair across the room to bed with you now young man from bed he looked back at the phone and kept looking at it im going to the store for a few minutes the nurse said just to be sure you dont use the phone again im hiding your wheel chair in the hall she wheeled the empty chair out the door in the downstairs entry he heard her pause and dial the extension phone was she phoning mexico city he wondered she wouldnt dare the front door shut he thought of the last week here alone in his room and the secret narcotic calls across continents an isthmus whole jungle countries of rain forest blueorchid plateaus lakes and hillstalking talkingto buenos airesandlimario de janeiro he lifted himself in the cool bed tomorrow the telephone gone what a greedy fool he had been he slipped his brittle ivory legs down from the bed marveling at their desiccation they seemed to be things which had been fastened to his body while he slept one night while his younger legs were taken off and burned in the cellar furnace over the years they had destroyed all of him removing hands arms and legs and leaving him with substitutes as delicate and useless as chess pieces and now they were tampering with something more intangiblethe memory they were trying to cut the wires which led back into another year he was across the room in a stumbling run grasping the phone he took it with him as he slid down the wall to sit upon the floor he got the longdistance operator his heart exploding within him faster and faster a blackness in his eyes hurry hurry he waited bueno jorge we were cut off you must not phone again senior said the faraway voice your nurse called me she says you are very ill i must hang up no jorge please the old man pleaded one last time listen to me theyre taking the phone out tomorrow i can never call you again jorge said nothing the old man went on for the love of god jorge for friendship then for the old days you dont know what it means youre my age but you can move i havent moved anywhere in ten years he dropped the phone and had trouble picking it up his chest was so thick with pain jorge you are still there arent you this will be the last time said jorge i promise the phone was laid on a desk thousands of miles away once more with that clear familiarity the footsteps the pause and at last the raising of the window listen whispered the old man to himself and he heard a thousand people in another sunlight and the faint tinkling music of an organ grinder playing la marimbaoh a lovely dancing tune with eyes tight the old man put up his hand as if to click pictures of an old cathedral and his body was heavier with flesh younger and he felt the hot pavement underfoot he wanted to say youre still there arent you all of you people in that city in the time of the early siesta the shops closing the little boys crying loteria nacional para hoy to sell lottery tickets you are all there the people in the city i cant believe i was ever among you when you are away i from a city it becomes a fantasy any town new york chicago with its people becomes improbable with distance just as i am improbable here in illinois in a small town by a quiet lake all of us improbable to one another because we are not present to one another and it is so good to hear the sounds and know that mexico city is still there and the people moving and living he sat with the receiver tightly pressed to his ear and at last the dearest most improbable sound of allthe sound of a green trolley car going around a comera trolley burdened with brown and alien and beautiful people and the sound of other people running and calling out with triumph as they leaped up and swung aboard and vanished around a corner on the shrieking rails and were borne away in the sunblazed distance to leave only the sound of tortillas frying on the market stoves or was it merely the ever rising and falling hum and burn of static quivering along two thousand miles of copper wire the old man sat on the floor time passed a downstairs door opened slowly light footsteps came in hesitated then ventured up the stairs voices murmured we shouldnt be here he phoned me i tell you he needs visitors bad we cant let him down hes sick sure but he said to come when the nurses out well only stay a second say hello and the door to the bedroom moved wide the three boys stood looking in at the old man seated there on the floor colonel freeleigh said douglas softly there was something in his silence that made them all shut up their mouths they approached almost on tiptoe douglas bent down disengaged the phone from the old mans now quite cold fingers douglas lifted the receiver to his own ear listened above the static he heard a strange a far a final sound two thousand miles away the closing of a window boom said tom boom boom boom he sat on the civil war cannon in the courthouse square douglas in front of the cannon clutched his heart and fell down on the grass but he did not get up he just lay there his face thoughtful you look like youre going to get out the old pencil any second now said tom let me think said douglas looking at the cannon he rolled over and gazed at the sky and the trees above him tom it just hit me what yesterday ching ling soo died yesterday the civil war ended right here in this town forever yesterday mr lincoln died right here and so did general lee and general grantl and a hundred thousand others facing north and south and yesterday afternoon at colonel freeleighs house a herd of buffalobison as big as all green town illinois went off the cliff into nothing at all yesterday a whole lot of dust settled for good and i didnt even appreciate it at the time its awful tom its awful what we going to do without all those soldiers and generals lee and grant and honest abe what we going to do without ching ling soo it never dreamed so many people could die so fast tom but they did they sure did tom sat astride the cannon looking down at his brother as his voice trailed away you got your tablet with you douglas shook his head better get home and put all that down before you forget it it aint every day you got half the population of the world keeling over on you douglas sat up and then stood up he walked across the courthouse lawn slowly chewing his lower lip boom said tom quietly boom boom then he raised his voice doug i killed you three times crossing the grass doug you hear me hey doug okay all right for you he lay down on the cannon and sighted along the crusted barrel he squinted one eye boom he whispered at that dwindling figure boom there twentynine there thirty there thirtyone the lever plunged the tin caps crushed atop the filled bottles flickered bright yellow grandfather handed the last bottle to douglas second harvest of the summer junes on the shelf heres july now justaugust up ahead douglas raised the bottle of warm dandelion wine but did not set it on the shelf he saw the other numbered bottles waiting there one like another in no way different all bright all regular all selfcontained theres the day i found i was alive he thought and why isnt it brighter than the others theres the day john huff fell off the edge of the world gone why isnt it darker than the others where where all the summer dogs leaping like dolphins in the windbraided and unbraided tides of what where lightning smell of green machine or trolley did the wine remember it did not or seemed not anyway somewhere a book said once all the talk ever talked all the songs ever sung still lived had vibrated way out in space and if you could travel to far centauri you could hear george washington talking in his sleep or caesar surprised at the knife in his back so much for sounds what about light then all things once seen they didnt just die that couldnt be it must be then that somewhere searching the world perhaps in the dripping multiboxed honeycombs where light was an amber sap stored by pollenfired bees or in the thirty thousand lenses of the noon dragonflys gemmed skull you might find all the colors and sights of the world in any one year or pour one single drop of this dandelion wine beneath a microscope and perhaps the entire world of july fourth would firework out in vesuvius showers this he would have to believe and yetlooking here at this bottle which by its number signalized the day when colonel freeleigh had stumbled and fallen six feet into the earth douglas could not find so much as a gram of dark sediment not a speck of the great flouring buffalo dust not a flake of sulphur from the guns at shiloh august up ahead said douglas sure but the way things are going therell be no machines no friends and dam few dandelions for the last harvest doom doom you sound like a funeral bell tolling said grandfather talk like that is worse than swearing i wont wash out your mouth with soap however a thimbleful of dandelion wine is indicated here now swig it down whats it taste like im a fireeater whoosh now upstairs run three times around the block do five somersets six pushups climb two trees and youll be concertmaster instead of chief mourner get on his way running douglas thought four pushups one tree and two somersets will do it and out there in the middle of the first day of august just getting into his car was bill forrester who shouted he ir was going downtown for some extraordinary ice cream or other and would anyone join him so not five minutes later jiggled and steamed into a better mood douglas found himself stepping in off the fiery pavements and moving through the grotto of sodascented air of vanilla freshness at the drugstore to sit at the snowmarble fountain with bill forrester they then asked for a recital of the most unusual ices and when the fountain man said old fashioned limevanilla ice thats it said bill forrester yes sir said douglas and while waiting they turned slowly on their rotating stools the silver spigots the gleaming mirrors the hushed whirlaround ceiling fans the green shades over the small windows the harpwire chairs passed under their moving gaze they stopped turning their eyes had touched upon the face and form of miss helen loomis ninetyfive years old icecream spoon in hand ice cream in mouth young man she said to bill forrester you are a person of taste and imagination also you have the will power of ten men otherwise you would not dare veer away from the common flavors listed on the menu and order straight out without quibble or reservation such an unheardof thing as limevanilla ice he bowed his head solemnly to her come sit with me both of you she said well talk of strange ice creams and such things as we seem to have a bent for dont be afraidill foot the bill smiling they carried their dishes to her table and sat you look like a spaulding she said to the boy youve got your grandfathers head and you youre william forrester you write for the chronicle a good enough column ive heard more about you than id care to tell i know you said bill forrester youre helen loomis he hesitated then continued t was in love with you once he said now thats the way i like a conversation to open she dug quietly at her ice cream thats grounds for another meeting nodont tell me where or when or how you were in love with me well save that for next time youve taken away my appetite with your talk look there now well i must get home anyway since youre a reporter come for tea tomorrow between three and four its just possible i can sketch out the history of this town since it was a trading post for you and so well both have something for our curiosity to chew on mr forrester you remind me of a gentleman i went with seventy yes seventy years ago she sat across from them and it was like talking with a gray and lost quivering moth the voice came from far away inside the grayness and the oldness wrapped in the powders of pressed flowers and ancient butterflies well she arose will you come tomorrow i most certainly will said bill forrester and she went off into the town on business leaving the young boy and the young man there looking after her slowly finishing their ice cream william forrester spent the next morning checking local news items for the paper had time after lunch for some local news items for the paper had time after lunch for some fishing in the river outside town caught only some small fish which he threw back happily and without thinking about it or at least not noticing that he had thought about it at three oclock he found his car taking him down a certain street he watched with interest as his hands turned the steering wheel and motored him up a vast circular drive where he stopped under an ivycovered entry letting himself out he was conscious of the fact that his car was like his pipe old chewedon unkempt in this huge green garden by this freshly painted threestory victorian house he saw a faint ghostlike movement at the far end of the garden heard a whispery cry and saw that miss loomis was there removedi across time and distance seated alone the tea service glittering its soft silver surfaces waiting for him this is the first time a woman has ever been ready and waiting he said walking up it is also he admitted the first time in my life i have been on time for an appointment why is that she asked propped back in her wicker chair i dont know he admitted well she started pouring tea to start things off what do you think of the world i dont know anything the beginning of wisdom as they say when youre seventeen you know everything when youre twentyseven if you still know everything youre still seventeen you seem to have learned quite a lot over the years it is the privilege of old people to seem to know everything but its an act and a mask like every other act and mask between ourselves we old ones wink at each other and smile saying how do you like my mask my act my certainty isnt life a play dont i play it well they both laughed quietly he sat back and let the laughter come naturally from his mouth for the first time in many months when they quieted she held her teacup in her two hands and looked into it do you know its lucky we met so late i wouldnt have wanted you to meet me when i was twentyone and full of foolishness they have special laws for pretty girls twentyone so you think i was pretty he nodded goodhumoredly but how can you tell she asked when you meet a dragon that has eaten a swan do you guess by the few feathers left around the mouth thats what it isa body like this is a dragon all scales and folds so the dragon ate the white swan i havent seen her for years i cant even remember what she looks like i feel her though shes safe inside still alive the essential swan hasnt changed a feather do you know there are some mornings in spring or fall when i wake and thinkill run across the fields into the woods and pick wild strawberries or ill swim in the lake or ill dance all night tonight until dawn and then in a rage discover im in this old and ruined dragon im the princess in the crumbled tower no way out waiting for her prince charming you should have written books my dear boy i have written what else was there for an old maid i was a crazy creature with a headful of carnival spangles until i was thirty and then the only man i ever really cared for stopped waiting and married someone else so in spite in anger at myself i told myself i deserved my fate for not having married when the best chance was at hand i started traveling my luggage was snowed under blizzards of travel stickers i have been alone in paris alone in vienna alone in london and all in all it is very much like being alone in green town illinois it is in essence being alone oh you have plenty of time to think improve your manners sharpen your conversations but i sometimes think i could easily trade a verb tense or a curtsy for some company that would stay over for a thirtyyear weekend they drank their tea oh such a rush of selfpity she said goodnaturedly about yourself now youre thirtyone and still not married let me put it this way he said women who act and think and talk like you are rare my she said seriously you mustnt expect young women to talk like me that comes later theyre much too young first of all and secondly the average man runs helterskelter the moment he finds anything like a brain in a lady youve probably met quite a few brainy ones who hid it most successfully from you youll have to pry around a bit to find the odd beetle lift a few boards they were laughing again i shall probably be a meticulous old bachelor he said no no you mustnt do that it wouldnt be right you shouldnt even be here this afternoon this is a street which ends only in an egyptian pyramid pyramids are all very nice but mummies are hardly fit companions where would you like to go what would you really like to do with your life see istanbul port said nairobi budapest write a book smoke too many cigarettes fall off a cliff but get caught in a tree halfway down get shot at a few times in a dark alley on a moroccan midnight love a beautiful woman well i dont think i can provide them all she said but ive traveled and i can tell you about many of those places and if youd care to run across my front lawn tonight about eleven and if im still awake ill fire off a civil war musket at you will that satisfy your masculine urge for adventure that would be just fine where would you like to go first i can take you there you know i can weave a spell just name it london cairo cairo makes your face turn on like a light so lets go to cairo just relax now put some of that nice tobacco in that pipe of yours and sit back he sat back lit his pipe half smiling relaxing and listened and she began to talk cairo she said the hour passed in jewels and alleys and winds from the egyptian desert the sun was golden and the nile was muddy where it lapped down to the deltas and there was someone very young and very quick at the top of the pyramid laughing calling to him to come on up the shadowy side into the sun and he was climbing she putting her hand down to help him up the last step and then they were laughing on camel back loping toward the great stretched bulk of the sphinx and late at night in the native quarter there was the tinkle of small hammers on bronze and silver and music from some stringed instruments fading away and away and away william forrester opened his eyes miss helen loomis had finished the adventure and they were home again very familiar to each other on the best of terms in the garden the tea cold in the silver pourer the biscuits dried in the latened sun he sighed and stretched and sighed again ive never been so comfortable in my life nor i ive kept you late i should have gone an hour ago you know i love every minute of it but what you should see in an old silly woman he lay back in his chair and half closed his eyes and looked at her he squinted his eyes so the merest filament of light came through he tilted his head ever so little this way then that what are you doing she asked uncomfortably he said nothing but continued looking if you do this just right he murmured you can adjust make allowances to himself he was thinking you can erase lines adjust the time factor turn back the years suddenly he started whats wrong she asked but then it was gone he opened his eyes to catch it that was a mistake he should have stayed back idling erasing his eyes gently half closed for just a moment he said i saw it saw what the swan of course he thought his mouth must have pantomimed the words the next instant she was sitting very straight in her chair her hands were in her lap rigid her eyes were fixed upon him and as he watched feeling helpless each of her eyes cupped and brimmed itself full im sorry he said terribly sorry no dont be she held herself rigid and did not touch her face or her eyes her hands remained one atop the other holding on youd better go now yes you may come tomorrow but go now please and dont say any more he walked off through the garden leaving her by her table in the shade he could not bring himself to look back four days eight days twelve days passed and he was invited to teas to suppers to lunches they sat talking through the long green afternoonsthey talked of art of literature of life of society and politics they ate ice creams and squabs and drank good wines i dont care what anyone says she said and people are saying things arent they he shifted uneasily i knew it a womans never safe even when ninetyfive from gossip i could stop visiting oh no she cried and recovered in a quieter voice she said you know you cant do that you know you dont care what they think do you so long as we know its all right i dont care he said nowshe settled backlets play our game where shall it be this time paris i think paris paris he said nodding quietly well she began its the year and were boarding the ship in new york harbor theres our luggage here are our tickets there goes the sky line now were at sea now were coming into marseilles here she was on a bridge looking into the clear waters of the seine and here he was suddenly a moment later beside her looking down at the tides of summer flowing past here she was with an aperitif in her talcumwhite fingers and here he was with amazing quickness bending toward her to tap her wineglass with his his face appeared in mirrored halls at versailles over steaming smorgasbords in stockholm and they counted the barber poles in the venice canals the things she had done alone they were now doing together i the middle of august they sat staring at one another one late afternoon do you realize he said ive seen you nearly every day for two and a half weeks impossible ive enjoyed it immensely yes but there are so many young girls youre everything they are notkind intelligent witty nonsense kindness and intelligence are the preoccupations of age being cruel and thoughtless is far more fascinating when youre twenty she paused and drew a breath now im going to embarrass you do you recall that first afternoon we met in the soda fountain you said that you had had some degree ofshall we say affection for me at one time youve purposely put me off on this by never mentioning it again now im forced to ask you to explain the whole uncomfortable thing he didnt seem to know what to say thats embarrassing he protested spit it out i saw your picture once years ago i never let my picture be taken this was an old one taken when you were twenty oh that its quite a joke each time i give to a charity or attend a ball they dust that picture off and print it everyone in town laughs even i its cruel of the paper no i told them if you want a picture of me use the one taken back in let them remember me that way keep the lid down in the name of the good lord during the service ill tell you all about it he folded his hands and looked at them and paused a moment he was remembering the picture now and it was very clear in his mind there was time here in the garden to think of every aspect of the photograph and of helen loomis very young posing for her picture the first time alone and beautiful he thought of her quiet shyly smiling face it was the face of spring it was the face of summer it was the warmness of clover breath pomegranate glowed in her lips and the noon sky in her eyes to touch her face was that always new experience of opening your window one december morning early and putting out your hand to the first white cool powdering of snow that had come silently with no announcement in the night and all of this this breathwarmness and plumtenderness was held forever in one miracle of photographic chemistry which no clock winds could blow upon to change one hour or one second this fine first cool white snow would never melt but live a thousand summers that was the photograph that was the way he knew her now he was talking again after the remembering and the thinking over and the holding of the picture in his mind when i first saw that pictureit was a simple straightforward picture with a simple hairdoi didnt know it had been taken that long ago the item in the paper said something about helen loomis marshaling the town ball that night i tore the picture from the paper i carried it with me all that day i intended going to the ball then late in the afternoon someone saw me looking at the picture and told me about it how the picture of the beautiful girl had been taken so long ago and used every year since by the paper and they said i shouldnt go to the town ball that night carrying that picture and looking for you they sat in the garden for a long minute he glanced over at her face she was looking at the farthest garden wall and the pink roses climbing there there was no way to tell what she was thinking her face showed nothing she rocked for a little while in her chair and then said softly shall we have some more tea there you are they sat sipping the tea then she reached over and patted his arm thank you for what for wanting to come to find me at the dance for clipping out my picture for everything thank you so very much they walked about the garden on the paths and now she said its my turn do you remember i mentioned a certain young man who once attended me seventy years ago oh hes been dead fifty years now at least but when he was very young and very handsome he rode a fast horse off for days or on summer nights over the meadows around town he had a healthy wild face always sunburned his hands were always cut and he fumed like a stovepipe and walked as if he were going to fly apart wouldnt keep a job quit those he had when he felt like it and one day he sort of rode off away from me because i was even wilder than he and wouldnt settle down and that was that i never thought the day would come when i would see him alive again but youre pretty much alive you spill ashes around like he did youre clumsy and graceful combined i know everything youre going to do before you do it but after youve done it im always surprised reincarnations a lot of milkmush to me but the other day i felt what if i called robert robert to you on the street would william forrester turn around i dont know he said neither do i thats what makes life interesting august was almost over the first cool touch of autumn moved slowly through the town and there was a softening and the first gradual burning fever of color in every tree a faint flush and coloring in the hills and the color of lions in the wheat fields now the pattern of days was familiar and repeated like a penman beautifully inscribing again and again in practice a series of its and ws and ms day after day the line repeated in delicate rills william forrester walked across the garden one early august afternoon to find helen loomis writing with great care at the tea table she put aside her pen and ink ive been writing you a letter she said well my being here saves you the trouble no this is a special letter look at it she showed him the blue envelope which she now sealed and pressed flat remember how it looks when you receive this in the mail youll know im dead thats no way to talk is it sit down and listen to me he sat my dear william she said under the parasol shade in a few days i will be dead no she put up her hand i dont want you to say a thing im not afraid when you live as long as ive lived you lose that too i never liked lobster in my life and mainly because id never tried it on my eightieth birthday i tried it i cant say im greatly excited over lobster still but i have no doubt as to its taste now and i dont fear it i dare say death will be a lobster too and i can come to terms with it she motioned with her hands but enough of that the important thing is that i shant be seeing you again there will be no services i believe that a woman who has passed through that particular door has as much right to privacy as a woman who has retired for the night you cant predict death he said at last for fifty years ive watched the grandfather clock in the hall william after it is wound i can predict to the hour when it will stop old people are no different they can feel the machinery slow down and the last weights shift oh please dont look that wayplease dont i cant help it he said weve had a nice time havent we it has been very special here talking every day it was that muchoverburdened and worn phrase referred to as a meeting of the minds she turned the blue envelope in her hands ive always known that the quality of love was the mind even though the body sometimes refuses this knowledge the body lives for itself it lives only to feed and wait for the night its essentially nocturnal but what of the mind which is born of the sun william and must spend thousands of hours of a lifetime awake and aware can you balance off the body that pitiful selfish thing of night against a whole lifetime of sun and intellect i dont know i only know there has been your mind here and my mind here and the afternoons have been like none i can remember there is still so much to talk about but we must save it for another time we dont seem to have much time now no but perhaps there will be another time time is so strange and life is twice as strange the cogs miss the wheels turn and lives interlace too early or too late i lived too long that much is certain and you were born either too early or too late it was a terrible bit of timing but perhaps i am being punished for being a silly girl anyway the next spin around wheels might function right again meantime you must find a nice girl and be married and be happy but you must promise me one thing anything you must promise me not to live to be too old william if it is at all convenient die before youre fifty it may take a bit of doing but i advise this simply because there is no telling when another helen loomis might be born it would be dreadful wouldnt it if you lived on to be very very old and some afternoon in walked down main street and saw me standing there aged twentyone and the whole thing out of balance again i dont think we could go through any more afternoons like these weve had no matter how pleasant do you a thousand gallons of tea and five hundred biscuits is enough for one friendship so you must have an attack of pneumonia some time in about twenty years for i dont know how long they let you linger on the other side perhaps they send you back immediately but i shall do my best william really i shall and everything put right and in balance do you know what might happen you tell me some afternoon in or a young man named tom smith or john green or a name like that will be walking downtown and will stop in the drugstore and order appropriately a dish of some unusual ice cream a young girl the same age will be sitting there and when she hears the name of that ice cream something will happen i cant say what or how she wont know why or how assuredly nor will the young man it will simply be that the name of that ice cream will be a very good thing to both of them theyll talk and later when they know each others names theyll walk from the drugstore together she smiled at him this is all very neat but forgive an old lady for tying things in neat packets its a silly trifle to leave you now lets talk of something else what shall we talk about is there any place in the world we havent traveled to yet have we been to stockholm yes its a fine town glasgow yes where then why not green town illinois he said here we havent really visited our own town together at all she settled back as did he and she said ill tell you how it was then when i was only nineteen in this town a long time ago it was a night in winter and she was skating lightly over a pond of white moon ice her image gliding and whispering under her it was a night in summer in this town of fire in the air in the cheeks in the heart your eyes full of the glowing and shuttingoff color of fireflies it was a rustling night in october and there she stood pulling taffy from a hook in the kitchen singing and there she was running on the moss by the river and swimming in the granite pit beyond town on a spring night in the soft deep warm waters and now it was the fourth of july with rockets slamming the sky and every porch full of now redfire now bluefire now whitefire faces hers dazzling bright among them as the last rocket died can you see all these things asked helen loomis can you see me doing them and being with them yes said william forrester eyes closed i can see you and then she said and then her voice moved on and on as the afternoon grew late and the twilight deepened quickly but her voice moved in the garden and anyone passing on the road at a far distance could have heard its moth sound faintly faintly two days later william forrester was at his desk in his room when the letter came douglas brought it upstairs and handed it to bill and looked as if he knew what was in it william forrester recognized the blue envelope but did not open it he simply put it in his shirt pocket looked at the boy for a moment and said come on doug my treat they walked downtown saying very little douglas preserving the silence he sensed was necessary autumn which had threatened for a time was gone summer was back full boiling the clouds and scouring the metal sky they turned in at the drugstore and sat at the marble fountain william forrester took the letter out and laid it before him and still did not open it he looked out at the yellow sunlight on the concrete and on the green awnings and shining on the gold letters of the window signs across the street and he looked at the calendar on the wall august he looked at his wrist watch and felt his heart beat slowly saw the second hand of the watch moving moving with no speed at all saw the calendar frozen there with its one day seeming forever the sun nailed to the sky with no motion toward sunset whatever the warm air spread under the sighing fans over his head a number of women laughed by the open door and were gone through his vision which was focused beyond them at the town itself and the high courthouse clock he opened the letter and began to read he turned slowly on the revolving chair he tried the words again and again silently on his tongue and at last spoke them aloud and repeated them a dish of limevanilla ice he said a dish of limevanilla ice douglas and tom and charlie came panting along the unshaded street tom answer me true now answer what true what ever happened to happy endings they got them on shows at saturday matinees sure but what about life all i know is i feel good going to bed nights doug thats a happy ending once a day next morning im up and maybe things go bad but all i got to do is remember that im going to bed that night and just lying there a while makes everything okay im talking about mr forrester and old miss loomis nothing we can do shes dead i know but dont you figure someone slipped up there you mean about him thinking she was the same age as her picture and her a trillion years old all the time no sir i think its swell swell for gosh sakes the last few days when mr forrester told me a little here or a little there and i finally put it all togetherboy did i bawl my head off i dont even know why i wouldnt change one bit of it if you changed it what would we have to talk about nothing and besides i like to cry after i cry hard its like its morning again and im starting the day over i heard everything now you just wont admit you like crying too you cry just so long and everythings fine and theres your happy ending and youre ready to go back out and walk around with folks again and its the start of goshknowswhatall any time now mr forrester will think it over and see its just the only way and have a good cry and then look around and see its morning again even though its five in the afternoon that dont sound like no happy ending to me a good nights sleep or a tenminute bawl or a pint of chocolate ice cream or all three together is good medicine doug you listen to tom spaulding m d shut up you guys said charlie were almost there they turned a corner deep in winter they had looked for bits and pieces of summer and found it in furnace cellars or in bonfires on the edge of frozen skating ponds at night now in summer they went searching for some little bit some piece of the forgotten winter rounding the corner they felt a continual light rain spray down from a vast brick building to refresh them as they read the sign they knew by heart the sign which showed them what theyd come searching for summers ice house summers ice house on a summer day they said the words laughing and moved to peer into that tremendous cavern where in fifty onehundred and twohundredpound chunks the glaciers the icebergs the fallen but not forgotten snows of january slept in ammoniac steams and crystal drippings feel that sighed charlie woodman what more could you ask for the winter breath was exhaled again and again about them as they stood in the glary day smelling the wet wood platform with the perpetual mist shimmering in rainbows down from the ice machinery above they chewed icicles that froze their fingers so they had to grip the ice in handkerchiefs and suck the linen all that steam all that fog whispered tom the snow queen remember that story nobody believes in that stuff snow queens now so dont be surprised if this is where she came to hide out because nobody believes in her anymore they looked and saw the vapors rise and drift in long swathes of cool smoke no said charlie you know who lives here only one guy a guy who gives you goosepimples just to think of him charlie dropped his voice very low the lonely one the lonely one born raised and lives here all that winter tom all that cold doug where else would he come from to make us shiver the hottest nights of the year dont it smell like him you know darn well it does the lonely onethe lonely one the mists and vapors curled in darkness tom screamed its okay doug charlie grinned i just dropped a little bitty hunk of ice down toms back is all the courthouse clock chimed seven times the echoes of the chimes faded warm summer twilight here in upper illinois country in this little town deep far away from everything kept to itself by a river and a forest and a meadow and a lake the sidewalks still scorched the stores closing and the streets shad owed and there were two moons the clock moon with four faces in four night directions above the solemn black courthouse and the real moon rising in vanilla whiteness from the dark east in the drugstore fans whispered in the high ceiling in the rococo shade of porches a few invisible people sat cigars glowed pink on occasion screen doors whined their springs and slammed on the purple bricks of the summernight streets douglas spaulding ran dogs and boys followed after hi miss lavinia the boys loped away waving after them quietly lavinia nebbs sat all alone with a tall cool lemonade in her white i fingers tapping it to her lips sipping waiting here i am lavinia she turned and there was francine all in snow white at the bottom steps of the porch in the smell of zinnias and hibiscus lavinia nebbs locked her front door and leaving her lemonade glass half empty on the porch said its a fine night for the movie they walked down the street where you going girls cried miss fern and miss roberta from their porch over the way lavinia called back through the soft ocean of darkness to the elite theater to see charlie chaplin wont catch us out on no night like this wailed miss fern not with the lonely one strangling women lock ourselves up in our closet with a gun oh bosh lavinia heard the old womens door bang and lock and she drifted on feeling the warm breath of summer night shimmering off the ovenbaked sidewalks it was like walking on a hard crust of freshly warmed bread the heat pulsed under your dress along your legs with a stealthy and not unpleasant sense of invasion lavinia you dont believe all that about the lonely one do you those women like to see their tongues dance just the same hattie mcdollis was killed two months ago roberta ferry the month before and now elizabeth ramsells disappeared hattie mcdollis was a silly girl walked off with a traveling man i bet but the others all of them strangled their tongues sticking out their mouths they say they stood upon the edge of the ravine that cut the town half in two behind them were the lit houses and music ahead was deepness moistness fireflies and dark maybe we shouldnt go to the show tonight said francine the lonely one might follow and kill us i dont like that ravine look at it will you lavinia looked and the ravine was a dynamo that never stopped running night or day there was a great moving hum a bumbling and murmuring of creature insect or plant life it smelled like a greenhouse of secret vapors and ancient washed shales and quicksands and always the black dynamo humming with sparkles like great electricity where fireflies moved on the air it wont be me coming back through this old ravine tonight late so darned late itll be you lavinia you down the steps and over the bridge and maybe the lonely one there bosh said lavinia nebbs itll be you alone on the path listening to your shoes not me you all alone on the way back to your house lavinia dont you get lonely living in that house old maids love to live alone lavinia pointed at the hot shadowy path leading down into the dark lets take the short cut im afraid its early lonely one wont be out till late lavinia took the others arm and led her down and down the crooked path into the cricket warmth and frog sound and mosquitodelicate silence they brushed through summerscorched grass burs prickling at their bare ankles lets run gasped francine no they turned a curve in the pathand there it was in the singing deep night in the shade of warm trees as if she had laid herself out to enjoy the soft stars and the easy wind her hands at either side of her like the oars of a delicate craft lay elizabeth ramsell francine screamed dont scream lavinia put out her hands to hold onto francine who was whimpering and choking dont dont the woman lay as if she had floated there her face moonlit her eyes wide and like flint her tongue sticking from her mouth shes dead said francine oh shes dead dead shes dead lavinia stood in the middle of a thousand warm shadows with the crickets screaming and the frogs loud wed better get the police she said at last hold me lavinia hold me im cold oh ive never been so cold in all my life lavinia held francine and the policemen were brushing through the crackling grass flashlights ducked about voices mingled and the night grew toward eightthirty its like december i need a sweater said francine eyes shut against lavinia the policeman said i guess you can go now ladies you might drop by the station tomorrow for a little more questioning lavinia and francine walked away from the police and the sheet over the delicate thing upon the ravine grass lavinia felt her heart going loudly in her and she was cold too with a february cold there were bits of sudden snow all over her flesh and the moon washed her brittle fingers whiter and she remembered doing all the talking while francine just sobbed against her a voice called from far off you want an escort ladies no well make it said lavinia to nobody and they walked on they walked through the nuzzling whispering ravine the ravine of whispers and clicks the little world of investigation growing small behind them with its lights and voices ive never seen a dead person before said francine lavinia examined her watch as if it was a thousand miles away on an arm and wrist grown impossibly distant its only eightthirty well pick up helen and get on to the show the show francine jerked its what we need weve got to forget this its not good to remember if we went home now wed remember well go to the show as if nothing happened lavinia you dont mean it i never meant anything more in my life we need to laugh now and forget but elizabeths back thereyour friend my friend we cant help her we can only help ourselves come on they started up the ravine side on the stony path in the dark and suddenly there barring their way standing very still in one spot not seeing them but looking on down at the moving lights and the body and listening to the official voices was douglas spaulding he stood there white as a mushroom with his hands at his sides staring down into the ravine get home cried francine he did not hear you shrieked francine get home get out of this place you hear get home get home get home douglas jerked his head stared at them as if they were i not there his mouth moved he gave a bleating sound then silently he whirled about and ran he ran silently up the distant hills into the warm darkness francine sobbed and cried again and doing this walked on with lavinia nebbs there you are i thought you ladiesd never come helen greer stood tapping her foot atop her porch steps youre only an hour late thats all what happened we started francine lavinia clutched her arm tight there was a commotion somebody found elizabeth ramsell in the ravine dead was shedead lavinia nodded helen gasped and put her hand to her throat who found her lavinia held francines wrist firmly we dont know the three young women stood in the summer night looking at each other ive got a notion to go in the house and lock the doors said helen at last but finally she went to get a sweater for though it was still warm she too complained of the sudden winter night while she was gone francine whispered frantically why didnt you tell her why upset her said lavinia tomorrow tomorrows plenty of time the three women moved along the street under the black trees past suddenly locked houses how soon the news had spread outward from the ravine from house to house porch to porch telephone to telephone now passing the three women felt eyes looking out at them from curtained windows as locks rattled into place how strange the popsicle the vanilla night the night of closepacked ice cream of mosquitolotioned wrists the night of running children suddenly veered from their games and put away behind glass behind wood the popsicles in melting puddles of lime and strawberry where they fell when the children were scooped indoors strange the hot rooms with the sweating people pressed tightly back into them behind the bronze knobs and knockers baseball bats and balls lay upon the unfootprinted lawns a halfdrawn whitechalk game of hopscotch lay on the broiled steamed sidewalk it was as if someone had predicted freezing weather a moment ago were crazy being out on a night like this said helen lonely one wont kill three ladies said lavinia theres safety in numbers and besides its too soon the killings always come a month separated a shadow fell across their terrified faces a figure loomed behind a tree as if someone had struck an organ a terrible blow with his fist the three women gave off a scream in three different shrill notes got you roared a voice the man plunged at them he came into the light laughing he leaned against a tree pointing at the ladies weakly laughing again hey im the lonely one said frank dillon frank dillon frank frank said lavinia if you ever do a childish thing like that again may someone riddle you with bullets what a thing to do francine began to cry hysterically frank dillon stopped smiling say im sorry go away said lavinia havent you heard about elizabeth ramsellfound dead in the ravine you running around scaring women dont speak to us again aw now they moved he moved to follow stay right there mr lonely one and scare yourself go take a look at elizabeth ramsells face and see if its funny good night lavinia took the other two on along the street of trees and stars francine holding a kerchief to her face francine it was only a joke helen turned to lavinia whys she crying so hard well tell you when we get downtown were going to the show no matter what enoughs enough come on now get your money ready were almost there the drugstore was a small pool of sluggish air which the great wooden fans stirred in tides of arnica and tonic and sodasmell out onto the brick streets i need a nickels worth of green peppermint chews said lavinia to the druggist his face was set and pale like all the faces they had seen on the halfempty streets for eating in the show said lavinia as the druggist weighed out a nickels worth of the green candy with a silver shovel you sure look pretty tonight ladies you looked cool this afternoon miss lavinia when you was in for a chocolate soda so cool and nice that someone asked after you oh man sitting at the counterwatched you walk out said to mesay whos that why thats lavinia nebbs prettiest maiden lady in town i said shes beautiful he said where does she live here the druggist paused uncomfortably you didnt said francine you didnt give him her address i hope you didnt i guess i didnt think i said oh over on park street you know near the ravine a casual remark but now tonight them finding the body i heard a minute ago i thought my god whatve i done he handed over the package much too full you fool cried francine and tears were in her eyes im sorry course maybe it was nothing lavinia stood with the three people looking at her staring at her she felt nothing except perhaps the slightest prickle of excitement in her throat she held out her money automatically theres no charge on those peppermints said the druggist turning to shuffle some papers well i know what im going to do right now helen stalked out of the drugshop im calling a taxi to take us all home ill be no part of a hunting party for you lavinia that man was up to no good asking about you you want to be dead in the ravine next it was just a man said lavinia turning in a slow circle to look at the town so is frank dillon a man but maybe hes the lonely one francine hadnt come out with them they noticed and turning they found her arriving i made him give me a descriptionthe druggist i made him tell what the man looked like a stranger she said in a dark suit sort of pale and thin were all overwrought said lavinia i simply wont take a taxi if you get one if im the next victim let me be the next theres all too little excitement in life especially for a maiden lady thirtythree years old so dont you mind if i enjoy it anyway its silly im not beautiful oh but you are lavinia youre the loveliest lady in town now that elizabeth is francine stopped you keep men off at a distance if youd only relax youd been married years ago stop sniveling francine heres the theater box office im paying fortyone cents to see charlie chaplin if you two want a taxi go on ill sit alone and go home alone lavinia youre crazy we cant let you do that they entered the theater the first showing was over intermission was on and the dim auditorium was sparsely populated the three ladies sat halfway down front in the smell of ancient brass polish and watched the manager step through the worn red velvet curtains to make an announcement the police have asked us to close early tonight so everyone can be out at a decent hour therefore we are cutting our short subjects and running our feature again immediately the show will be over at eleven everyone is advised to go straight home dont linger on the streets that means us lavinia whispered francine the lights went out the screen leaped to life lavinia whispered helen what as we came in a man in a dark suit across the street crossed over he just walked down the aisle and is sitting in the row behind us oh helen right behind us one by one the three women turned to look they saw a white face there flickering with unholy light from the silver screen it seemed to be all mens faces hovering there in the dark im going to get the manager helen was gone up the aisle stop the film lights helen come back cried lavinia rising they tapped their empty soda glasses down each with a vanilla mustache on their upper lip which they found with their tongues laughing you see how silly said lavinia all that riot for nothing how embarrassing im sorry said helen faintly the clock said eleventhirty now they had come out of the dark theater away from the buttering rush of men and women hurrying everywhere nowhere on the street while laughing at helen helen was trying to laugh at herself helen when you ran up that aisle crying lights i thought id die that poor man the theater managers brother from racine i apologized said helen looking up at the great fan still whirling whirling the warm late night air stirring restirring the smells of vanilla raspberry peppermint and lysol we shouldnt have stopped for these sodas the police warned oh bosh the police laughed lavinia im not afraid of anything the lonely one is a million miles away now he wont be back for weeks and the policell get him then just wait wasnt the film wonderful closing up ladies the druggist switched off the lights in the cool whitetiled silence outside the streets were swept clean and empty of cars it or trucks or people bright lights still burned in the small store windows where the warm wax dummies lifted pink wax hands fired with bluewhite diamond rings or flourished orange wax legs to reveal hosiery the hot blueglass eyes of the mannequins watched as the ladies drifted down the empty river bottom street their images shimmering in the windows like blossoms seen under darkly moving waters do you suppose if we screamed theyd do anything who the dummies the window people oh francine well there were a thousand people in the windows stiff and silent and three people on the street the echoes following like gunshots from store fronts across the way when they tapped their heels on the baked pavement a red neon sign flickered dimly buzzed like a dying insect as they passed baked and white the long avenues lay ahead blowing and tall in a wind that touched only their leafy summits the trees stood on either side of the three small women seen from the courthouse peak they appeared like three thistles far away first well walk you home francine no ill walk you home dont be silly you live way out at electric park if you walked me home youd have to come back across the ravine alone yourself and if so much as a leaf fell on you youd drop dead francine said i can stay the night at your house youre the pretty one and so they walked they drifted like three prim clothes forms over a moonlit sea of lawn and concrete lavinia watching the black trees bit by each side of her listening to the voices of her friends murmuring trying to laugh and the night seemed to quicken they seemed to run while walking slowly everything seemed fast and the color of hot snow lets sing said lavinia they sang shine on shine on harvest moon they sang sweetly and quietly arm in arm not looking back they felt the hot sidewalk cooling underfoot moving moving listen said lavinia they listened to the summer night the summernight crickets and the faroff tone of the courthouse clock making i it eleven fortyfive listen lavinia listened a porch swing creaked in the dark and there was mr terle not saying anything to anybody alone on his swing having a last cigar they saw the pink ash swinging gently to and fro now the lights were going going gone the little house lights and big house lights and yellow lights and green hurricane lights the candles and oil lamps and porch lights and everything felt locked up in brass and iron and steel everything thought lavinia is boxed and locked and wrapped and shaded she imagined the people in their moonlit beds and their breathing in the summernight rooms safe and together and here we are thought lavinia our footsteps on along the baked summer evening sidewalk and above us the lonely street lights shining down making a drunken shadow heres your house francine good night lavinia helen stay here tonight its late almost midnight now you can sleep in the parlor ill make hot chocolateitll be such fun francine was holding them both now close to her no thanks said lavinia and francine began to cry oh not again francine said lavinia i dont want you dead sobbed francine the tears running straight down her cheeks youre so fine and nice i want you alive please oh please francine i didnt know how much this has done to you i promise ill phone when i get home oh will you and tell you im safe yes and tomorrow well have a picnic lunch at electric park with ham sandwiches ill make myself hows that youll see ill live forever youll phone then i promised didnt i good night good night rushing upstairs francine whisked behind a door which slammed to be snapbolted tight on the instant now said lavinia to helen ill walk you home the courthouse clock struck the hour the sounds blew across a town that was empty emptier than it had ever been over empty streets and empty lots and empty lawns the sound faded nine ten eleven twelve counted lavinia with helen on her arm dont you feel funny asked helen how do you mean when you think of us being out here on the sidewalks under the trees and all those people safe behind locked doors lying in their beds were practically the only walking people out in the open in a thousand miles i bet the sound of the deep warm dark ravine came near in a minute they stood before helens house looking at each other for a long time the wind blew the odor of cut grass between them the moon was sinking in a sky that was beginning to cloud i dont suppose its any use asking you to stay lavinia ill be going on sometimes sometimes what sometimes i think people want to die youve acted odd all evening im just not afraid said lavinia and im curious i suppose and im using my head logically the lonely one cant be around the police and all the police are home with their covers up over their ears lets just say im enjoying myself precariously but safely if there was any real chance of anything happening to me id stay here with you you can be sure of that maybe part of you doesnt want to live anymore you and francine honestly i feel so guilty ill be drinking some hot cocoa just as you reach the ravine bottom and walk on the bridge drink a cup for me good night lavinia nebbs walked alone down the midnight street down the late summernight silence she saw houses with the dark windows and far away she heard a dog barking in five minutes she thought ill be safe at home in five minutes ill be phoning silly little francine ill she heard the mans voice a mans voice singing far away among the trees oh give me a june night the moonlight and you she walked a little faster the voice sang in my armswith all your charms down the street in the dim moonlight a man walked slowly and casually along i can run knock on one of these doors thought lavinia if i must oh give me a june night sang the man and he carried a long club in his hand the moonlight and you well look whos here what a time of night for you to be out miss nebbs officer kennedy and thats who it was of course id better see you home thanks ill make it but you live across the ravine yes she thought but i wont walk through the ravine with any man not even an officer how do i know who the lonely one is no she said ill hurry ill wait right here he said if you need any help give a yell voices carry good here ill come running thank you she went on leaving him under a light humming to himself alone here i am she thought the ravine she stood on the edge of the one hundred and thirteen steps that went down the steep hill and then across the bridge seventy yards and up the hills leading to park street and only one lantern to see by three minutes from now she thought ill be putting my key in my house door nothing can happen in just one hundred eighty seconds she started down the long darkgreen steps into the deep ravine one two three four five six seven eight nine ten steps she counted in a whisper she felt she was running but she was not running fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty steps she breathed one fifth of the way she announced to herself the ravine was deep black and black black and the world was gone behind the world of safe people in bed the locked doors the town the drugstore the theater the lights everything was gone only the ravine existed and lived black and huge about her nothings happened has it no one around is there twentyfour twentyfive steps remember that old ghost story you told each other when you were children she listened to her shoes on the steps the story about the dark man coming in your house and you upstairs in bed and now hes at the first step coming up to your room and now hes at the second step and now hes at the third step and the fourth step and the fifth oh how you used to laugh and scream at that story and now the horrid dark mans at the twelfth step and now hes opening the door of your room and now hes standing by your bed i got you she screamed it was like nothing shed ever heard that scream she had never screamed that loud in her life she stopped she froze she clung to the wooden banister her heart exploded in her the sound of the terrified beating filled the universe there there she screamed to herself at the bottom of the steps a man under the light no now hes gone he was waiting there she listened silence the bridge was empty nothing she thought holding her heart nothing fool that story i told myself how silly what shall i do her heartbeats faded shall i call the officerdid he hear me scream she listened nothing nothing ill go the rest of the way that silly story she began again counting the steps thirtyfive thirtysix careful dont fall oh i am a fool thirtyseven steps thirtyeight nine and forty and two makes fortytwoalmost halfway she froze again wait she told herself she took a step there was an echo she took another step another echo another step just a fraction of a moment later someones following me she whispered to the ravine to the black crickets and darkgreen hidden frogs and the black stream someones on the steps behind me i dont dare turn around another step another echo every time i take a step they take one a step and an echo weakly she asked of the ravine officer kennedy is that you the crickets were still the crickets were listening the night was listening to her for a change all of the far summernight meadows and close summernight trees were suspending motion leaf shrub star and meadow grass ceased their particular tremors and were listening to lavinia nebbss heart and perhaps a thousand miles away across locomotivelonely country in an empty way station a single traveler reading a dim newspaper under a solitary naked bulb might raise up his head listen and think whats that and decide only a woodchuck surely beating on a hollow log but it was lavinia nebbs it was most surely the heart of lavinia nebbs silence a summernight silence which lay for a thousand miles which covered the earth like a white and shadowy sea faster faster she went down the steps run she heard music in a mad way in a silly way she heard the great surge of music that pounded at her and she realized as she ran as she ran in panic and terror that some part of her mind was dramatizing borrowing from the turbulent musical score of some private drama and the music was rushing and pushing her now higher and higher faster faster plummeting and scurrying down and down into the pit of the ravine only a little way she prayed one hundred eight nine one hundred ten steps the bottom now run across the bridge she told her legs what to do her arms her body her terror she advised all parts of herself in this white and terrible moment over the roaring creek waters on the hollow thudding swaying almost alive resilient bridge planks she ran followed by the wild footsteps behind behind with the music following too the music shrieking and babbling hes following dont turn dont look if you see him youll not be able to move youll be so frightened just run run she ran across the bridge oh god god please please let me get up the hill now up the path now between the hills oh god its dark and everything so far away ii i screamed now it wouldnt help i cant scream anyway heres the top of the path heres the street oh god please let me be safe if i get home safe ill never go out alone i was a fool let me admit it i was a fool i didnt know what terror was but if you let me get home from this ill never go without helen or francine again heres the street across the street she crossed the street and rushed up the sidewalk oh god the porch my house oh god please give me time to get inside and lock the door and ill be safe and theresilly thing to noticewhy did she notice instantly no time no timebut there it was anyway flashing bythere on the porch rail the halffilled glass of lemonade she had abandoned a long time a year half an evening ago the lemonade glass sitting calmly imperturbably there on the railand she heard her clumsy feet on the porch and listened and felt her hands scrabbling and ripping at the lock with the key she heard her heart she heard her inner voice screaming the key fit unlock the door quick quick the door opened now inside slam it she slammed the door now lock it bar it lock it she gasped wretchedly lock it tight tight the door was locked and bolted tight the music stopped she listened to her heart again and the sound of it diminishing into silence home oh god safe at home safe safe and safe at home she slumped against the door safe safe listen not a sound safe safe oh thank god safe at home ill never go out at night again ill stay home i wont go over that ravine again ever safe oh safe safe home so good so good safe safe inside the door locked wait look out the window she looked why theres no one there at all nobody there was nobody following me at all nobody running after me she got her breath and almost laughed at herself it stands to reason if a man had been following me hed have caught me im not a fast runner theres no one on the porch or in the yard how silly of me i wasnt running from anything that ravines as safe as anyplace just the same its nice to be home homes the really good warm place the only place to be she put her hand out to the light switch and stopped what she asked what what behind her in the living room someone cleared his throat good grief they ruin everything dont take it so hard charlie well whatre we going to talk about now its no use talking the lonely one if he aint even alive its not scary anymore dont know about you charlie said tom im going back to summers ice house and sit in the door and pretend hes alive and get cold all up and down my spine thats cheating you got to take your chills where you can find

across here i saw that lemonade glass right on the porch rail half empty thought id like to drink it like to drink it i thought i was in the ravine and i was here right in the middle of it all tom and charlie in turn ignored douglas for that matter said tom i dont really think the lonely one is dead you were here this morning when the ambulance came to bring that man out on the stretcher werent you

business you want shed laid down and let him squeeze her windpipe no but the least she couldve done is gallop out of the house and down the street screaming lonely one lonely one long enough to give

lonely one aint dead i saw his face you saw his face doug saw his face didnt you doug what yes i think so yes everybody saw his face answer me this then did it look like the lonely one to you i said

charlie was off waving his arms yelling tom stood on the sidewalk in front of lavinia nebbs house his face pale my gosh he whispered whatve i gone and done now he turned to douglas i say doug whatve i gone and done now douglas was staring at the house his lips moved i was there last night in the ravine i saw elizabeth ramsell it came by here last night on the way home i saw the lemonade glass there on the rail just last night it was i could drink that i thought i could drink that she was a woman with a broom or a dustpan or a washrag or a mixing spoon in her hand you saw her cutting piecrust in the morning humming to it or you saw her setting out the baked pies at noon or taking them in cool at dusk she rang porcelain cups like a swiss bell ringer to their place she glided through the halls as steadily as a vacuum machine seeking finding and setting to rights she made mirrors of every window to catch the sun she strolled but twice through any garden trowel in hand and the flowers raised their quivering fires upon the warm air in her wake she slept quietly and turned no more than three times in a night as relaxed as a white glove to which at dawn a brisk hand will return waking she touched people like pictures to set their frames straight but now grandma said everyone greatgrandma now it was as if a huge sum in arithmetic were finally drawing to an end she had stuffed turkeys chickens squabs gentlemen and boys she had washed ceilings walls invalids and children she had laid linoleum repaired bicycles wound clocks stoked furnaces swabbed iodine on ten thousand grievous wounds her hands had flown all around about and down gentling this holding that throwing baseballs swinging bright croquet mallets seeding black earth or fixing covers over dumplings ragouts and children wildly strewn by slumber she had pulled down shades pinched out candles turned switches andgrown old looking back on thirty billions of things started carried finished and done it all summed up totaled out the last decimal was placed the final zero swung slowly into line now chalk in hand she stood back from life a silent hour before reaching for the eraser let me see now said greatgrandma let me see with no fuss or further ado she traveled the house in an evercircling inventory reached the stairs at last and making no special announcement she took herself up three flights to her room where silently she laid herself out like a fossil imprint under the snowing cool sheets of her bed and began to die again the voices grandma greatgrandma the rumor of what she was doing dropped down the stairwell hit and spread ripples through the rooms out doors and windows and along the street of elms to the edge of the green ravine here now here the family surrounded her bed just let me lie she whispered her ailment could not be seen in any microscope it was a mild but everdeepening tiredness a dim weighing of her sparrow body sleepy sleepier sleepiest as for her children and her childrens childrenit seemed impossible that with such a simple act the most leisurely act in the world she could cause such apprehension greatgrandma now listenwhat youre doing is no better than breaking a lease this house will fall down without you you must give us at least a years notice greatgrandma opened one eye ninety years gazed calmly out at her physicians like a dustghost from a high cupola window in a fastemptying house tom the boy was sent alone to her whispering bed tom she said faintly far away in the southern seas theres a day in each mans life when he knows its time to shake hands with all his friends and say goodbye and sail away and he does and its naturalits just his time thats how it is today im so like you sometimes sitting through saturday matinees until nine at night when we send your dad to bring you home tom when the time comes that the same cowboys are shooting the same indians on the same mountaintop then its best to fold back the seat and head for the door with no regrets and no walking backward up the aisle so im leaving while im still happy and still entertained douglas was summoned next to her side grandma wholl shingle the roof next spring every april for as far back as there were calendars you thought you heard woodpeckers tapping the housetop but no it was greatgrandma somehow transported singing pounding nails replacing shingles high in the sky douglas she whispered dont ever let anyone do the shingles unless its fun for them look around come april and say whod like to fix the roof and whichever face lights up is the face you want douglas because up there on that roof you can see the whole town going toward the country and the country going toward the edge of the earth and the river shining and the morning lake and birds on the trees down under you and the best of the wind all around above any one of those should be enough to make a person climb a weather vane some spring sunrise its a powerful hour if you give it half a chance her voice sank to a soft flutter douglas was crying she roused herself again now why are you doing that because he said you wont be here tomorrow she turned a small hand mirror from herself to the boy he looked at her face and himself in the mirror and then at her face again as she said tomorrow morning ill get up at seven and wash behind my ears ill run to church with charlie woodman ill picnic at electric park ill swim run barefoot fall out of trees chew spearmint gum douglas douglas for shame you cut your fingernails dont you yes m and you dont yell when your body makes itself over every seven years or so old cells dead and new ones added to your fingers and your heart you dont mind that do you no m well consider then boy any man saves fingernail clippings is a fool you ever see a snake bother to keep his peeled skin thats about all you got here today in this bed is fingernails and snake skin one good breath would send me up in flakes important thing is not the me thats lying here but the me thats sitting on the edge of the bed looking back at me and the me thats downstairs cooking supper or out in the garage under the car or in the library reading all the new parts they count im not really dying today no person ever died that had a family ill be around a long time a thousand years from now a whole township of my offspring will be biting sour apples in the gumwood shade thats my answer to anyone asks big questions quick now send in the rest at last the entire family stood like people seeing someone off at the rail station waiting in the room well said greatgrandma there i am im not humble so its nice seeing you standing around my bed now next week theres late gardening and closetcleaning and clothesbuying for the children to do and since that part of me which is called for convenience greatgrandma wont be here to step it along those other parts of me called uncle bert and leo and tom and douglas and all the other names will have to take over each to his own yes grandma i dont want any halloween parties here tomorrow dont want anyone saying anything sweet about me i said it all in my time and my pride ive tasted every victual and danced every dance now theres one last tart i havent bit on one tune i havent whistled but im not afraid im truly curious death wont get a crumb by my mouth i wont keep and savor so dont you worry over me now all of you go and let me find my sleep somewhere a door closed quietly thats better alone she snuggled luxuriously down through the warm snowbank of linen and wool sheet and cover and the colors of the patchwork quilt were bright as the circus banners of old time lying there she felt as small and secret as on those mornings eightysomeodd years ago when wakening she comforted her tender bones in bed a long time back she thought i dreamed a dream and was enjoying it so much when someone wakened me and that was the day when i was born and now now let me seeshe cast her mind back where was i she thought ninety yearshow to take up the thread and the pattern of that lost dream again she put out a small hand thereyes that was it she smiled deeper in the warm snow hill she turned her head upon her pillow that was better now yes now she saw it shaping in her mind quietly and with a serenity like a sea moving along an endless and selfrefreshing shore now she let the old dream touch and lift her from the snow and drift her above the scarceremembered bed downstairs she thought they are polishing the silver and rummaging the cellar and dusting in the halls she could hear them living all through the house its all right whispered greatgrandma as the dream floated her like everything else in this life its fitting and the sea moved her back down the shore a ghost cried tom no said a voice just me the ghastly light flowed into the dark applescented bedroom a quartsize mason jar seemingly suspended upon space flickered many twilightcolored flakes of light on and off in this pallid illumination douglass eyes shone pale and solemn he was so tan his face and hands were dissolved in darkness and his nightgown seemed a disembodied spirit my gosh hissed tom two dozen three dozen fireflies shh for cryyi what you got em for we got caught reading nights with flashlights under our sheets right so nobodyll suspect an old jar of fireflies folksll think its just a night museum doug youre a genius but doug did not answer very gravely he placed the intermittently signaling light source upon the night table and picked up his pencil and began to write large and long on his tablet with the fireflies burning dying burning dying and his eyes glinting with three dozen fugitive bits of pale green color he block printed for ten and then twenty minutes aligning and realigning writing and rewriting the facts that he had gathered all too swiftly during the season tom watched hypnotized by the small bonfire of insects leaping and furling within the jar until he froze sleeping raised on elbow while douglas wrote on he summed it all up on a final page you cant depend on things because like machines for instance they fall apart or rust or rot or maybe never get finished at all or wind up in garages like tennis shoes you can only run so far so fast and then the earths got you again like trolleys trolleys big as they are always come to the end of the line you cant depend on people because they go away strangers die people you know fairly well die friends die people murder people like in books your own folks can die so he held onto a double fistful of breath let it hiss out slow grabbed more breath and let it whisper through his tightgritted teeth so he finished in huge heavily blocked capitals so if trolleys and runabouts and friends and near friends can go away for a while or go away forever or rust or fall apart or die and if people can be murdered and if someone like great grandma who was going to live forever can dieif all of this is true then i douglas spaulding some day must but the fireflies as if extinguished by his somber thoughts had softly turned themselves off i cant write any more anyway thought douglas i wont write any more i wont i wont finish it tonight he looked over at tom asleep on his upraised elbow and hand he touched toms wrist and tom collapsed into a sighing ruin back upon the bed douglas picked up the mason jar with the cold dark lumps in it and the cool lights flicked on again as if given life by his hand he lifted the mason jar to where it shone fitfully on his summingup the final words waited to be written but he went instead to the window and pushed the screen frame out he unscrewed the top of the jar and tilted the fireflies in a pale shower of sparks down the windless night they found their wings and flew away douglas watched them go they departed like the pale fragments of a final twilight in the history of a dying world they went like the few remaining shreds of warm hope from his hand they left his face and his body and the space inside his body to darkness they left him empty as the mason jar which now without knowing that he did so he took back into bed with him when he tried to sleep there she sat in her glass coffin night after night her body melted by the carnival blaze of summer frozen in the ghost winds of winter waiting with her sickle smile and carved hooked and waxpoured nose hovering above her pale pink and wrinkled wax hands poised forever above the ancient fannedout deck of cards the tarot witch a delicious name the tarot witch you thrust a penny in the silver slot and far away below behind inside machinery groaned and cogged levers stroked wheels spun and in her case the witch raised up her glittery face to blind you with a single needle stare her implacable left hand moved down to stroke and fritter enigmatic tarotcard skulls devils hanging men hermits cardinals and clowns while her head hung close to delve your misery or murder hope or health your rebirths each morning and deaths renewals by night then she spidered a calligraphers pen across the back of a single card and let it titter down the chute into your hands whereupon the witch with a last veiled glimmer of her eyes froze back in her eternal caul for weeks months years awaiting the next copper penny to revive her from oblivion now waxen dead she suffered the two boys approach douglas fingerprinted the glass there she is its a wax dummy said tom why do you want me to see her all the time asking why yelled douglas because thats why because because the arcade lights dimmedbecause one day you discover you are alive explosion concussion illumination delight you laugh you dance around you shout but not long after the sun goes out snow falls but no one sees it on an august noon at the cowboy matinee last saturday a man had dropped down dead on the whitehot screen douglas had cried out for years he had seen billions of cowboys shot hung burned destroyed but now this one particular man hell never walk run sit laugh cry wont do anything ever thought douglas now hes turning cold douglass teeth chattered his heart pumped sludge in his chest he shut his eyes and let the convulsion shake him he had to get away from these other boys because they werent thinking about death they just laughed and yelled at the dead man as if he still lived douglas and the dead man were on a boat pulling away with all the others left behind on the bright shore running jumping hilarious with motion not knowing that the boat the dead man and douglas were going going and now gone into darkness weeping douglas ran to the lemonsmelling mens room where sick it seemed a fire hydrant churned three times from his throat and waiting for the sickness to pass he thought all the people i know who died this summer colonel freeleigh dead i didnt know it before why greatgrandma dead too reallytruly not only that buthe paused me no they cant kill me yes said a voice yes any time they want to they can no matter how you kick or scream they just put a big hand over you and youre still i dont want to die douglas screamed without a sound youll have to anyway said the voice youll have to anyway the sunlight outside the theater blazed down upon unreal street unreal buildings and people moving slowly as if under a bright and heavy ocean of pure burning gas and him thinking that now now at last he must go home and finish out the final line in his nickel tablet some day i douglas spaulding must die it had taken him ten minutes to get up enough courage to cross the street his heart slowing and there was the arcade and he saw the strange wax witch back where she had always hidden in cool dusty shadow with the fates and furies tucked under her fingernails a car passing flashed an explosion of light through the arcade jumping the shadows making it seem that the wax woman nodded swiftly for him to enter and he had gone in at the witchs summoning and come forth five minutes later certain of survival now he must show tom she looks almost alive said tom she is alive ill show you he shoved a penny in the slot nothing happened douglas yelled across the arcade at mr black the proprietor seated on an upended sodapop crate uncorking and taking a swig from a threequarters empty bottle of brownyellow liquid hey somethings wrong with the witch mr black shuffled over his eyes half closed his breath sharp and strong somethings wrong with the pinball wrong with the peep show wrong with the electrocute yourself for a penny machine he struck the case hey in there come alive the witch sat unperturbed costs me more to fix her each month than she earns mr black reached behind the case and hung a sign out of order over her face she aint the only things out of order me you this town this country the whole world to hell with it he shook his fist at the woman the junk heap for you you hear me the junk heap he walked off and plunged himself down on the sodapop crate to feel the coins in his money apron again like it was his stomach giving him pain she just cantoh she cant be out of order said douglas stricken shes old said tom grandpa says she was here when he was a boy and before so its bound to be some day shed konk out and come on now whispered douglas oh please please write so tom can see he shoved another coin stealthily into the machine please the boys pressed the glass their breath made cumulus clouds on the pane then deep inside the box a whisper a whir and slowly the witchs head rose up and looked at the boys and there was something in her eyes that froze them as her hand began to scrabble almost frantically back and forth upon the tarots to pause hurry on return her head bent down one hand came to rest and a shuddering shook the machine as the other hand wrote paused wrote and stopped at last with a paroxysm so violent the glass in the case chimed the witchs face bent in a rigid mechanical misery almost fisted into a ball then the machinery gasped and a single cog slipped and a tiny tarot card tickled down the flue into douglass cupped hands shes alive shes working again whats the card say doug its the same one she wrote for me last saturday listen and douglas read hey nonny no men are fools that wish to die ist not fine to dance and sing when the bells of death do ring ist not fine to swim in wine and turn upon the toe and sing hey nonny no when the winds blow and the seas flow hey nonny no is that all it says said tom at the bottom is a message prediction a long life and a lively one thats more like it now how about one for me tom put his coin in the witch shuddered a card fell into his hand last one off the premises is the witchs behind said tom calmly they ran out so fast the proprietor gasped and clutched fortyfive copper pennies in one fist thirtysix in the other outside the glare of the uneasy street lights douglas and tom made a terrible discovery the tarot card was empty there was no message that cant be dont get excited doug its just a plain old card we only lost a penny its not just a plain old card its more than a penny its life and death under the fluttering moth light in the street douglass face was milky as he stared at the card and turned it rustling trying somehow to put words on it she ran out of ink she never runs out of ink he looked at mr black sitting there finishing off his bottle and cursing not knowing how lucky he was living in the arcade please he thought dont let the arcade fall apart too bad enough that friends disappeared people were killed and buried in the real world but let the arcade run along the way it was please please now douglas knew why the arcade had drawn him so steadily this week and drew him still tonight for there was a world completely set in place predictable certain sure with its bright silver slots its terrible gorilla behind glass forever stabbed by waxen hero to save still more waxen heroine and then the flipping waterfalling chitter of keystone kops on eternal photographic spindles set spiraling in darkness by indianhead pennies under naked bulb light the kops forever in collision or nearcollision with train truck streetcar forever gone off piers in oceans which did not drown because there they rushed to collide again with train truck streetcar dive off old and beautifully familiar pier worlds within worlds the penny peek shows which you cranked to repeat old rites and formulas there when you wished the wright brothers sailed sandy winds at kittyhawk teddy roosevelt exposed his dazzling teeth san francisco was built and burned burned and built as long as sweaty coins fed selfsatisfied machines douglas looked around at this night town where anything at all might happen now a minute from now here by night of day how few the slots to shove your money in how few the cards delivered to your hand for reading and if read how few made sense here in the world of people you might give time money and prayer with little or no return but there in the arcade you could hold lightning with the can you take it electrical machine when you pried its chromed handles apart as the power waspstung sizzled sewed your vibrant fingers you punched a bag and saw how many hundred pounds of sinew were available in your arm to strike the world if it need be struck there grip a robots hand to indianwrestle out your fury and light the bulbs half up a numbered chart where fireworks at the summit proved your violence supreme in the arcade then you did this and this and that and that occurred you came forth in peace as from a church unknown before and now now the witch moving but silent and perhaps soon dead in her crystal coffin he looked at mr black droning there defying all worlds even his own someday the fine machinery would rust from lack of loving care the keystone kops freeze forever half in half out of the lake half caught half struck by locomotive the wright brothers never get their kite machine off the ground tom douglas said we got to sit in the library and figure this thing out they moved on down the street the white unwritten card passing between them they sat inside the library in the lidded green light and then they sat outside on the carved stone lion dangling their feet over its back frowning old man black all the time screaming at her threatening to kill her you cant kill whats never lived doug he treats the witch like shes alive or was once alive or something screaming at her so maybe shes finally given up or maybe she hasnt given up at all buts taken a secret way to warn us her lifes in danger invisible ink lemon juice maybe theres a message here she didnt want mr black to see in case he looked while we were in his arcade hold on i got some matches why would she write us doug hold the card here douglas struck a match and ran it under the card ouch the words aint on my fingers doug so keep the match away there cried douglas and there it was a faint spidery scrawl which began to shape itself in a spiral of incredible corkscrew calligraphers letters dark on lighta word two words three the card its on fire tom yelled and let it drop stomp on it but by the time they had jumped up to smash their feet on the stony spine of the ancient lion the card was a black ruin doug now well never know what it said douglas held the flaking warm ashes in the palm of his hand no i saw i remember the words the ashes blew about in his fingers whispering you remember in that charlie chase comedy last spring where the frenchman was drowning and kept yelling something in french which charlie chase couldnt figure secours secours and someone told charlie what it meant and he jumped in and saved the man well on this card with my own eyes i saw it secours why would she write it in french so mr black wouldnt know dumb doug it was just an old watermark coming out when you scorched the card tom saw douglass face and stopped okay dont look mad it was sucker or whatever but there were other words mme tarot it said tom i got it now mme tarots real lived a long time ago told fortunes i saw her picture once in the encyclopedia people came from all over europe to see her well dont you figure it now yourself think tom think tom sat back down on the lions back looking along the street to where the arcade lights flickered thats not the real mrs tarot inside that glass box under all that red and blue silk and all that old halfmelted wax sure maybe a long time ago someone got jealous or hated her and poured wax overj her and kept her prisoner forever and shes passed down the line from villain to villain and wound up here centuries later in green town illinoisworking for indianhead pennies instead of the crown heads of europe villains mr black names black shirts black pantsre black ties black movie villains wear black dont they but why didnt she yell last year the year before who knows every night for a hundred years shes been writing messages in lemon juice on cards but everybody read her regular message nobody thought like us to run a match over the back to bring out the real message lucky i know what secours means okay she said help now what we save her of course steal her out from under mr blacks nose huh and wind up witches ourselves in glass boxes with wax poured on our faces the next ten thousand years tom the librarys here well arm ourselves with spells and magic philters to fight mr black theres only one magic philter will fix mr black said tom soons he gets enough pennies any one evening hewell lets see tom drew some coins from his pocket this just might do it doug you go read the books ill run back and look at the keystone kops fifteen times i never get tired by the time you meet me at the arcade it might be the old philter will be working for us tom i hope you know what youre doing doug you want to rescue this princess or not douglas whirled and plunged tom watched the library doors wham shut and settle then he leaped over the lions back and down into the night on the library steps the ashes of the tarot card fluttered blew away the arcade was dark inside the pinball machines lay dim and enigmatic as dust scribblings in a giants cave the peep shows stood with teddy roosevelt and the wright brothers faintly smirking or just cranking up a wooden propeller the witch sat in her case her waxen eyes cauled then suddenly one eye glittered a flashlight bobbed outside through the dusty arcade windows a heavy figure lurched against the locked door a key scrabbled into the lock the door slammed open stayed open there was a sound of thick breathing its only me old girl said mr black swaying outside on the street coming along with his nose in a book douglas found tom hiding in a door nearby shh said tom it worked the keystone kops fifteen times and when mr black heard me drop all that money in his eyes popped he opened the machine took out the pennies threw me out and went across to the speakeasy for the magic philter douglas crept up and peered into the shadowy arcade and saw the two gorilla figures there one not moving at all the wax heroine in his arms the other one standing stunned in the middle of the room weaving slightly from side to side oh tom whispered douglas youre a genius hes just full of magic philter aint he you can say that again what did you find out douglas tapped the book and talked in a low voice mme tarot like i said told all about death and destiny and stuff in rich folks parlors but she made one mistake she predicted napoleons defeat and death to his face so douglass voice faded as he looked again through the dusty window at that distant figure seated quietly in her crystal case secours murmured douglas old napoleon just called in mme tussauds waxworks and had them drop the tarot witch alive in boiling wax and nownow watch out doug mr black in there hes got a club or something this was true inside cursing horribly the huge figure of mr black lurched in his hand a camping knife seethed on the air six inches from the witchs face hes picking on her because shes the only humanlooking thing in the whole darn joint said tom he wont do her no harm hell fall over any second and sleep it off no sir said douglas he knows she warned us and were coming to rescue her he doesnt want us revealing his guilty secret so maybe tonight hes going to destroy her once and for all how could he know she warned us we didnt even know ourselves till we got away from here he made her tell put coins in the machine thats one thing she cant lie on the cards all them tarot skulls and bones she just cant help telling the truth and she gave him a card sure with two little knights on it no bigger than kids you see thats us clubs in our hands coming down the street one last time cried mr black from the cave inside im puttin the coin in one last time now dammit tell me is this damn arcade ever goin to make money or do i declare bankruptcy like all women sit there cold fish while a man starves gimme the card there now let me see he held up the card to the light oh my gosh whispered douglas get ready no cried mr black liar liar take that he smashed his fist through the case glass exploded in a great shower of starlight it seemed and fell away in darkness the witch sat naked in the open air reserved and calm waiting for the second blow no douglas plunged through the door mr black doug cried tom mr black wheeled at toms shout he raised the knife blindly in the air as if to strike douglas froze then eyes wide lids blinking once mr black turned perfectly so he fell with his back toward the floor and took what seemed a thousand years to strike his flashlight flung from his right hand the knife scuttling away like a silverfish from the left tom moved slowly in to look at the longstrewn figure in the dark doug is he dead no just the shock of mme tarots predictions boy hes got a scalded look horrible thats what the cards must have been the man slept noisily on the floor douglas picked up the strewn tarot cards put them trembling in his pocket come on tom lets get her out of here before its too late kidnap her youre crazy you wanna be guilty of aiding and abetting an even worse crime murder for instance for gosh sakes you cant kill a dam old dummy but doug was not listening he had reached through the open case and now as if she had waited for too many years the wax tarot witch with a rustling sigh leaned forward and fell slowly slowly down into his arms the town clock struck nine fortyfive the moon was high and filled all the sky with a warm but wintry light the sidewalk was solid silver on which black shadows moved douglas moved with the thing of velvet and fairy wax in his arms stopping to hide in pools of shadow under trembling trees alone he listened looking back a sound of running mice tom burst around the corner and pulled up beside him doug i stayed behind i was afraid mr black was wellthen he began to come aliveswearing oh doug if he catches you with his dummy what will our folks think stealing quiet they listened to the moonlit river of street behind them now tom you can come help me rescue her but you cant if you say dummy or talk loud or drag along as so much dead weight ill help tom assumed half the weight my gosh shes light she was real young when napoleon douglas stopped old people are heavy thats how you tell but why tell me why all this running around for her doug why why douglas blinked and stopped things had gone so fast he had run so far and his blood was so high he had long since forgotten why only now as they moved again along the sidewalk shadows like black butterflies on their eyelids the thick smell of dusty wax on their hands did he have time to reason why and slowly speak of it his voice as strange as moonlight tom a couple weeks ago i found out i was alive boy did i hop around and then just last week in the movies i found out id have to die someday i never thought of that really and all of a sudden it was like knowing the y m c a was going to be shut up forever or school which isnt so bad as we like to think being over for good and all the peach trees outside town shriveling up and the ravine being filled in and no place to play ever again and me sick in bed for as long as i could think and everything dark and i got scared so i dont know what i want to do is this help mme tarot ill hide her a few weeks or months while i look up in the blackmagic books at the library how to undo spells and get her out of the wax to run around in the world again after all this time and shell be so grateful shell lay out the cards with all those devils and cups and swords and bones on them and tell me what sump holes to walk around and when to stay in bed on certain thursday afternoons ill live forever or next thing to it you dont believe that yes i do or most of it watch it now heres the ravine well cut down through by the dump heap and tom stopped douglas had stopped him the boys did not turn but they heard the heavy clubbing blows of feet behind them each one like a shotgun set off in the bed of a dry lake not far away someone was shouting and cursing tom you let him follow you as they ran a giant hand lifted and tossed them aside and mr black was there laying to left and right and the boys crying out on the grass saw the raving man spittle showering the air from his biting teeth and widened lips he held the witch by her neck and one arm and glared with fiery eyes down on the boys this is mine to do with like i want what you mean taking her caused all my troublemoney business everything heres what i think of her no shouted douglas but like a great iron catapult the huge arms hoisted the figure up against the moon and flourished and wheeled the fragile body upon the stars and let it fly out with a curse and a rustling wind down the air into the ravine to tumble and take avalanches of junk with her into white dust and cinders no said douglas sitting there looking down no the big man toppled on the rim of the hill gasping you just thank god it wasnt you i did that to he moved unsteadily away falling once getting up talking to himself laughing swearing then gone douglas sat on the edge of the ravine and wept after a long while he blew his nose he looked at tom tom its late dadll be out walking looking for us we shouldve been home an hour ago run back along washington street get dad and bring him here youre not going down in that ravine shes city property now on the trash dump and nobody cares what happens not even mr black tell dad what hes coming here for and he dont have to be seen coming home with me and her ill take her the back way around and nobodyll ever know she wont be no good to you now her machinery all busted we cant leave her out in the rain dont you see tom sure tom moved slowly off douglas let himself down the hill walking in piles of cinder and old paper and tin cans halfway down he stopped and listened he peered at the multicolored dimness the great landslide below mme tarot he almost whispered mme tarot at the bottom of the hill in the moonlight he thought he saw her white wax hand move it was a piece of white paper blowing but he went toward it anyway the town dock struck midnight the house lights around were mostly turned out in the workshop garage the two boys and the man stood back from the witch who now sat rearranged and at peace in an old wicker chair before an oilclothcovered card table upon which were spread in fantastic fans of popes and clowns and cardinals and deaths and suns and comets the tarot cards upon which one wax hand touched father was speaking know how it is when i was a boy when the circus left town i ran around collecting a million posters later it was breeding rabbits and magic i built illusions in the attic and couldnt get them out he nodded to the witch oh i remember she told my fortune once thirty years ago well clean her up good then come in to bed well build her a special case saturday he moved out the garage door but stopped when douglas spoke softly dad thanks thanks for the walk home thanks heck said father and was gone the two boys left alone with the witch looked at each other gosh right down the main street we go all four of us you me dad the witch dads one in a million tomorrow said douglas i go down and buy the rest of the machine from mr black for ten bucks or hell throw it out sure tom looked at the old woman there in the wicker chair boy she sure looks alive i wonder whats inside little tiny bird bones all thats left of mme tarot after napoleon no machinery at all why dont we just cut her open and see plenty of time for that tom when well in a year two years when im fourteen or fifteen thens the time to do it right now i dont want to know nothing except shes here and tomorrow i get to work on the spells to let her escape forever some night youll hear that a strange beautiful italian girl was seen downtown in a summer dress buying a ticket for the east and everyone saw her at the station and saw her on the train as it pulled out and everyone said she was the prettiest girl they ever saw and when you hear that tomand believe me the news will get around fast nobody knowing where she came from or where she wentthen youll know i worked the spell and set her free and then as i said a year two years from now on that night when that train pulls out itll be the time when we can cut through the wax with her gone youre liable to find nothing but little cogs and wheels and stuff inside her thats how it is douglas picked up the witchs hand and moved it over the dance of life the frolic of bonewhite death the dates and dooms the fates and follies tapping touching whispering her worndown fingernails her face tilted with some secret equilibrium and looked at the boys and the eyes flashed bright in the raw bulb light unblinking tell your fortune tom asked douglas quietly sure a card fell from the witchs voluminous sleeve tom you see that a card hidden away and now she throws it out at us douglas held the card to the light its blank ill put it in a matchbox full of chemicals during the night tomorrow well open the box and there the messagell be whatll it say douglas closed his eyes the better to see the words itll say thanks from your humble servant and grateful friend mme floristan mariani tarot

forever you and me tom well live forever all that on just this one card all that every single bit of it tom in the light of the electric bulb they bent the two boys heads down the witchs head down staring and staring at the beautiful blank but promising white card their bright eyes sensing each and every incredibly hidden word that would soon rise up from pale oblivion hey said tom in the softest of voices and douglas repeated in a glorious whisper hey faintly the voice chanted under the fiery green trees at noon nine ten eleven twelve douglas moved slowly across the lawn tom what you counting thirteen fourteen shut up sixteen seventeen cicadas eighteen nineteen cicadas oh hell tom unsqueezed his eyes hell hell hell better not let people hear you swearing hell hell hell is a place tom cried now i got to start all over i was counting the times the cicadas buzz every fifteen seconds he held up his two dollar watch you time it then add thirtynine and you get the temperature at that very moment he looked at the watch one eye shut tilted his head and whispered again one two three douglas turned his head slowly listening somewhere in the burning bonecolored sky a great copper wire was strummed and shaken again and again the piercing metallic vibrations like charges of raw electricity fell in paralyzing shocks from the stunned trees seven counted tom eight douglas walked slowly up the porch steps painfully he peered into the hall he stayed there a moment then slowly he stepped back out on the porch and called weakly to tom its exactly eightyseven degrees fahrenheit twentyseven twentyeight hey tom you hear me i hear youthirty thirtyone get away two three thirtyfour you can stop counting now right inside on that old thermometer its eightyseven and going up without the help of no katydids cicadas thirtynine forty not katydids fortytwo eightyseven degrees i thought youd like to know fortyfive thats inside not outside fortynine fifty fiftyone fiftytwo fiftythree fiftythree plus thirtynine isninetytwo degrees who says i say not eightyseven degrees fahrenheit but ninetytwo degrees spaulding you and who else tom jumped up and stood redfaced staring at the sun me and the cicadas thats who me and the cicadas youre outnumbered ninetytwo ninetytwo ninetytwo degrees spaulding by gosh they both stood looking at the merciless unclouded sky like a camera that has broken and stares shutter wide at a motionless and stricken town dying in a fiery sweat douglas shut his eyes and saw two idiot suns dancing on the reverse side of the pinkly translucent lids one two three douglas felt his lips move four five six this time the cicadas sang even faster from noontime to sundown from midnight to sunrise one man one horse and one wagon were known to all twentysix thousand three hundred fortynine inhabitants of green town illinois in the middle of the day for no reason quickly apparent children would stop still and say here comes mr jonas here comes ned here comes the wagon older folks might peer north or south east or west and see no sign of the man named jonas the horse named ned or the wagon which was a conestoga of the kind that bucked the prairie tides to beach on the wilderness but then if you borrowed the ear of a dog and tuned it high and stretched it taut you could hear miles and miles across the town a singing like a rabbi in the lost lands a moslem in a tower always mr jonass voice went clear before him so people had a half an hour an hour to prepare for his arrival and by the time his wagon appeared the curbs were lined by children as for a parade so here came the wagon and on its high board seat under a persimmoncolored umbrella the reins like a stream of water in his gentle hands was mr jonas singing junk junk no sir not junk junk junk no maam not junk bricabracs brickbats knitting needles knickknacks kickshaws curies camisoles cameos but junk junk no sir not junk as anyone could tell who had heard the songs mr jonas made up as he passed he was no ordinary junkman to all appearances yes the way he dressed in tatters of mosscorduroy and the felt cap on his head covered with old presidential campaign buttons going back before manila bay but he was unusual in this way not only did he tread the sunlight but often you could see him and his horse swimming along the moonlit streets circling and recircling by night the islands the blocks where all the people lived he had known all of his life and in that wagon he carried things he had picked up here and there and carried for a day or a week or a year until someone wanted and needed them then all they had to say was i want that clock or how about the mattress and jonas would hand it over take no money and drive away considering the words for another tune so it happened that often he was the only man alive in all green town at three in the morning and often people with headaches seeing him amble by with his moonshimmered horse would run out to see if by chance he had aspirin which he did more than once he had delivered babies at four in the morning and only then had people noticed how incredibly clean his hands and fingernails werethe hands of a rich man who had another life somewhere they could not guess sometimes he would drive people to work downtown or sometimes when men could not sleep go up on their porch and bring cigars and sit with them and smoke and talk until dawn whoever he was or whatever he was and no matter how different and crazy he seemed he was not crazy as he himself had often explained gently he had tired of business in chicago many years before and looked around for a way to spend the rest of his life couldnt stand churches though he appreciated their ideas and having a tendency toward preaching and decanting knowledge he bought the horse and wagon and set out to spend the rest of his life seeing to it that one part of town had a chance to pick over what the other part of town had cast off he looked upon himself as a kind of process like osmosis that made various cultures within the city limits available one to another he could not stand waste for he knew that one mans junk is another mans luxury so adults and especially children clambered up to peer over into the vast treasure horde in the back of the wagon now remember said mr jonas you can have what you want if you really want it the test is ask yourself do i want it with all my heart could i live through the day without it if you figure to be dead by sundown grab the darned thing and run ill be happy to let you have whatever it is and the children searched the vast heaps of parchments and brocades and bolts of wallpaper and marble ash trays and vests and roller skates and great fat overstuffed chairs and end tables and crystal chandeliers for a while you just heard whispering and rattling and tinkling mr jonas watched comfortably puffing on his pipe and the children knew he watched sometimes their hands reached out for a game of checkers or a string of beads or an old chair and just as they touched it they looked up and there were mr jonass eyes gently questioning them and they pulled their hand away and looked further on until at last each of them put their hand on a single item and left it there their faces came up and this time their faces were so bright mr jonas had to laugh he put up his hand as if to fend off the brightness of their faces from his eyes he covered his eyes for a moment when he did this the children yelled their thanks grabbed their roller skates or clay tiles or bumbershoots and dropping off ran and the children came back in a moment with something of their own in their hands a doll or a game they had grown tired of something the fun had gone out of like the flavor from gum and now it was time for it to pass on to some other part of town where seen for the first time it would be revivified and would revivify others these tokens of exchange were shyly dropped over the rim of the wagon down into unseen riches and then the wagon was trundling on flickering light on its great spindling sunflower wheels and mr jonas singing again junk junk no sir not junk no maam not junk until he was out of sight and only the dogs in the shadow pools under trees heard the rabbi in the wilderness and twitched their tails junk fading junk a whisper junk gone and the dogs asleep the sidewalks were haunted by dust ghosts all night as the furnace wind summoned them up swung them about and gentled them down in a warm spice on the lawns trees shaken by the footsteps of latenight strollers sifted avalanches of dust from midnight on it seemed a volcano beyond the town was showering redhot ashes everywhere crusting slumberless night watchmen and irritable dogs each house was a yellow attic smoldering with spontaneous combustion at three in the morning dawn then was a time where things changed element for element air ran like hot spring waters nowhere with no sound the lake was a quantity of steam very still and deep over valleys of fish and sand held baking under its serene vapors tar was poured licorice in the streets red bricks were brass and gold roof tops were paved with bronze the hightension wires were lightning held forever blazing a threat above the unslept houses the cicadas sang louder and yet louder the sun did not rise it overflowed in his room his face a bubbled mass of perspiration douglas melted on his bed wow said tom entering come on doug well drown in the river all day douglas breathed out douglas breathed in sweat trickled down his neck doug you awake the slightest nod of the head you dont feel good huh boy this housell burn down today he put his hand on douglass brow it was like touching a blazing stove lid he pulled his fingers away startled he turned and went downstairs mom he said dougs really sick his mother taking eggs out of the icebox stopped let a quick look of concern cross her face put the eggs back and followed tom upstairs douglas had not moved so much as a finger the cicadas were screaming now at noon running as if the sun were after him to smash him to the ground the doctor pulled up on the front porch gasping his eyes weary already and gave his bag to tom at one oclock the doctor came out of the house shaking his head tom and his mother stood behind the screen door as the doctor talked in a low voice saying over and over again he didnt know he didnt know he put his panama hat on his head gazed at the sunlight blistering and shriveling the trees overhead hesitated like a man plunging into the outer rim of hell and ran again for his car the exhaust of the car left a great pall of blue smoke in the pulsing air for five minutes after he was gone tom took the ice pick in the kitchen and chipped a pound of ice into prisms which he carried upstairs mother was sitting on the bed and the only sound in the room was douglas breathing in steam and breathing out fire they put the ice in handkerchiefs on his face and along his body they drew the shades and made the room like a cave they sat there until two oclock bringing up more ice then they touched douglass brow again and it was like a lamp that had burned all night after touching him you looked at your fingers to make sure they werent seared to the bone mother opened her mouth to say something but the cicadas were so loud now they shook dust down from the ceiling inside redness inside blindness douglas lay listening to the dim piston of his heart and the muddy ebb and flow of the blood in his arms and legs his lips were heavy and would not move his thoughts were heavy and barely ticked like seed pellets falling in an hourglass slow one by falling one tick around a bright steel comer of rail a trolley swung throwing a crumbling wave of sizzling sparks its clamorous bell knocking ten thousand times until it blended with the cicadas mr tridden waved the trolley stormed around a comer like a cannonade and dissolved mr tridden tick a pellet fell tick chugachugding woowoooo on the roof top a boy locomoted pulling an invisible whistle string then froze into a statue john john huff you hate you john john were pals dont hate you no john fell down the elmtree corridor like someone falling down an endless summer well dwindling away tick john huff tick sand pellet dropping tick john douglas moved his head flat over crashing on the white white terribly white pillow the ladies in the green machine sailed by in a sound of black seal barking lifting hands as white as doves they sank into the lawns deep waters their gloves still waving to him as the grass closed over miss fern miss roberta tick tick and quickly then from a window across the way colonel freeleigh leaned out with the face of a clock and buffalo dust sprang up in the street colonel freeleigh spanged and rattled his jaw fell open a mainspring shot out and dangled on the air instead of his tongue he collapsed like a puppet on the sill one arm still waving mr auffmann rode by in something that was bright and something like the trolley and the green electric runabout and it trailed glorious clouds and it put out your eyes like the sun mr auffmann did you invent it he cried did you finally build the happiness machine but then he saw there was no bottom to the machine mr auffmann ran along on the ground carrying the whole incredible frame from his shoulders happiness doug here goes happiness and he went the way of the trolley john huff and the dovefingered ladies above on the roof a tapping sound taprapbang pause taprapbang nail and hammer hammer and nail a bird choir and an old woman singing in a frail but hearty voice yes well gather at the riverriver river yes well gather at the riverthat flows by the throne of god grandma greatgrandma tap softly tap tap softly river river and now it was only the birds picking up their tiny feet and putting them down again on the roof rattlerattle scratch peep peep soft soft river douglas took one breath and let it all out at once wailing he did not hear his mother run into the room a fly like the burning ash of a cigarette fell upon his senseless hand sizzled and flew away four oclock in the afternoon flies dead on the pavement dogs wet mops in their kennels shadows herded under trees downtown stores shut up and locked the lake shore empty the lake full of thousands of people up to their necks in the warm but soothing water fourfifteen along the brick streets of town the junk wagon moved and mr jonas singing on it tom driven out of the house by the scorched look on douglass face walked slowly down to the curb as the wagon stopped hi mr jonas hello tom tom and mr jonas were alone on the street with all that beautiful junk in the wagon to look at and neither of them looking at it mr jonas didnt say anything right away he lit his pipe and puffed it nodding his head as if he knew before he asked that something was wrong tom he said its my brother said tom its doug mr jonas looked up at the house hes sick said tom hes dying oh now that cant be so said mr jonas scowling around at the very real world where nothing that vaguely looked like death could be found on this quiet day hes dying said tom and the doctor doesnt know whats wrong the heat he said nothing but the heat can that be mr jonas can the heat kill people even in a dark room well said mr jonas and stopped for tom was crying now i always thought i hated himthats what i thoughtwe fight half the timei guess i did hate himsometimesbut nownow oh mr jonas if only if only what boy if only you had something in this wagon would help something i could pick and take upstairs and make him okay tom cried again mr jonas took out his red bandanna handkerchief and handed it to tom tom wiped his nose and eyes with the handkerchief its been a tough summer tom said lots of things have happened to doug tell me about them said the junkman well said tom gasping for breath not quite done crying yet he lost his best aggie for one a real beaut and on top of that somebody stole his catchers mitt it cost a dollar ninetyfive then there was the bad trade he made of his fossil stones and shell collection with charlie woodman for a tarzan clay statue you got by saving up macaroni box tops dropped the tarzan statue on the sidewalk second day he had it thats a shame said the junkman and really saw all the pieces on the cement then he didnt get the book of magic tricks he wanted for his birthday got a pair of pants and a shirt instead thats enough to ruin the summer right there parents sometimes forget how it is said mr jonas sure tom continued in a low voice then dougs genuine set of toweroflondon manacles got left out all night and rusted and worst of all i grew one inch taller catching up with him almost is that all asked the junkman quietly i could think of ten dozen other things all as bad or worse some summers you get a run of luck like that its been silverfish getting in his comics collection or mildew in his new tennis shoes ever since doug got out of school i remember years like that said the junkman he looked off at the sky and there were all the years so there you are mr jonas thats it thats why hes dying tom stopped and looked away let me think said mr jonas can you help mr jonas can you mr jonas looked deep in the big old wagon and shook his head now in the sunlight his face looked tired and he was beginning to perspire then he peered into the mounds of vases and peeling lamp shades and marble nymphs and satyrs made of greening copper he sighed he turned and picked up the reins and gave them a gentle shake tom he said looking at the horses back ill see you later i got to plan i got to look around and come again after supper even then who knows until then he reached down and picked up a little set of japanese windcrystals hang these in his upstairs window they make a nice cool music tom stood with the windcrystals in his hands as the wagon rolled away he held them up and there was no wind they did not move they could not make a sound seven oclock the town resembled a vast hearth over which the shudderings of heat moved again and again from the west charcoalcolored shadows quivered outward from every house every tree a redhaired man moved along below tom seeing him illumined by the dying but ferocious sun saw a torch proudly carrying itself saw a fiery fox saw the devil marching in his own country at seventhirty mrs spaulding came out of the back door of the house to empty some watermelon rinds into the garbage pail and saw mr jonas standing there how is the boy said mr jonas mrs spaulding stood there for a moment a response trembling on her lips may i see him please said mr jonas still she could say nothing i know the boy well he said seen him most every day of his life since he was out and around ive something for him in the wagon hes not she was going to say conscious but she said awake hes not awake mr jonas the doctor said hes not to be disturbed oh we dont know whats wrong even if hes not awake said mr jonas id like to talk to him sometimes the things you hear in your sleep are more important you listen better it gets through im sorry mr jonas i just cant take the chance mrs spaulding caught hold of the screendoor handle and held fast to it thanks thank you anyway for coming by yes maam said mr jonas he did not move he stood looking up at the window above mrs spaulding went in the house and shut the screen door upstairs on his bed douglas breathed it was a sound like a sharp knife going in and out in and out of a sheath at eight oclock the doctor came and went again shaking his head his coat off his tie untied looking as if he had lost thirty pounds that day at nine oclock tom and mother and father carried a cot outside and brought douglas down to sleep in the yard under the apple tree where if there might be a wind it would find him sooner than in the terrible rooms above then they went back and forth until eleven oclock when they set the alarm clock to wake them at three and chip more ice to refill the packs the house was dark and still at last and they slept at twelve thirtyfive douglass eyes flinched the moon had begun to rise and far away a voice began to sing it was a high sad voice rising and falling it was a clear voice and it was in tune you could not make out the words the moon came over the edge of the lake and looked upon green town illinois and saw it all and showed it all every house every tree every prehistoricremembering dog twitching in his simple dreams and it seemed that the higher the moon the nearer and louder and clearer the voice that was singing and douglas turned in his fever and sighed perhaps it was an hour before the moon spilled all its light upon the world perhaps less but the voice was nearer now and a sound like the beating of a heart which was really the motion of a horses hoofs on the brick streets muffled by the hot thick foliage of the trees and there was another sound like a door slowly opening or closing squeaking squealing softly from time to time the sound of a wagon and down the street in the light of the risen moon came the horse pulling the wagon and the wagon riding the lean body of mr jonas easy and casual on the high seat he wore his hat as if he were still out under the summer sun and he moved his hands on occasion to ripple the reins like a flow of water on the air above the horses back very slowly the wagon moved down the street with mr jonas singing and in his sleep douglas seemed for a moment to stop breathing and listen air air who will buy this air air like water and air like icebuy it once and youll buy it twiceheres the april airheres an autumn breezeheres papaya wind from the antilles air air sweet pickled airfairrarefrom everywherebottled and capped and scented with thyme all that you want of air for a dime at the end of this the wagon was at the curb and someone stood in the yard treading his shadow carrying two beetlegreen bottles which glittered like cats eyes mr jonas looked at the cot there and called the boys name once twice three times softly mr jonas swayed in indecision looked at the bottles he carried made his decision and moved forward stealthily to sit on the grass and look at this boy crushed down by the great weight of summer doug he said you just lie quiet you dont have to say anything or open your eyes you dont even have to pretend to listen but inside there i know you hear me and its old jonas your friend your friend he repeated and nodded he reached up and picked an apple off the tree turned it round took a bite chewed and continued some people turn sad awfully young he said no special reason it seems but they seem almost to be born that way they bruise easier tire faster cry quicker remember longer and as i say get sadder younger than anyone else in the world i know for im one of them he took another bite of the apple and chewed it well now where are we he asked a hot night not a breath stirring in august he answered himself killing hot and a long summer its been and too much happening eh too much and its getting on toward one oclock and no sign of a wind or rain and in a moment now im going to get up and go but when i go and remember this clearly i will leave these two bottles here upon your bed and when ive gone i want you to wait a little while and then slowly open your eyes and sit up and reach over and drink the contents of these bottles not with your mouth no drink with your nose tilt the bottles uncork them and let what is in them go right down into your head read the labels first of course but here let me read them for you he lifted one bottle into the light green dusk for dreaming brand pure northern air he read derived from the atmosphere of the white arctic in the spring of and mixed with the wind from the upper hudson valley in the month of april and containing particles of dust seen shining in the sunset of one day in the meadows around grinnell iowa when a cool air rose to be captured from a lake and a little creek and a natural spring now the small print he said he squinted also containing molecules of vapor from menthol lime papaya and watermelon and all other watersmelling coolsavored fruits and trees like camphor and herbs like wintergreen and the breath of a rising wind from the des plaines river itself guaranteed most refreshing and cool to be taken on summer nights when the heat passes ninety he picked up the other bottle this one the same save ive collected a wind from the aran isles and one from off dublin bay with salt on it and a strip of flannel fog from the coast of iceland he put the two bottles on the bed one last direction he stood by the cot and leaned over and spoke quietly when youre drinking these remember it was bottled by a friend the s j jonas bottling company green town illinoisaugust a vintage year boya vintage year a moment later there was the sound of reins slapping the back of the horse in the moonlight and the rumble of the wagon down the street and away after a moment douglass eyes twitched and very slowly opened mother whispered tom dad doug its doug hes going to be well i just went down to check and come on tom ran out of the house his parents followed douglas was asleep as they approached tom motioned to his parents smiling wildly they bent over the cot a single exhalation a pause a single exhalation a pause as the three bent there douglass mouth was slightly open and from his lips and from the thin vents of his nostrils gently there rose a scent of cool night and cool water and cool white snow and cool green moss and cool moonlight on silver pebbles lying at the bottom of a quiet river and cool clear water at the bottom of a small white stone well it was like holding their heads down for a brief moment to the pulse of an applescented fountain flowing cool up into the air and washing their faces they could not move for a long time the next morning was a morning of no caterpillars the world that had been full to bursting with tiny bundles of black and brown fur trundling on their way to green leaf and tremulous grass blade was suddenly empty the sound that was no sound the billion footfalls of the caterpillars stomping through their own universe died tom who said he could hear that sound precious as it was looked with wonder at a town where not a single birds mouthful stirred too the cicadas had ceased then in the silence a great sighing rustle began and they knew then why the absence of caterpillar and abrupt silence of cicada summer rain the rain began light a touch the rain increased and fell heavily it played the sidewalks and roofs like great pianos and upstairs douglas inside again like a fall of snow in his bed turned his head and opened his eyes to see the freshly falling sky and slowly slowly twitch his fingers toward his yellow nickel pad and yellow ticonderoga pencil there was a great flurry of arrival somewhere trumpets were shouting somewhere rooms were teeming with boarders and neighbors having afternoon tea an aunt had arrived and her name was rose and you could hear her voice clarion clear above the others and you could imagine her warm and huge as a hothouse rose exactly like her name filling any room she sat in but right now to douglas the voice the commotion were nothing at all he had come from his own house and now stood outside grandmas kitchen door just as grandma having excused herself from the chicken squabble in the parlor whisked into her own domain and set about making supper she saw him standing there opened the screen door for him kissed his brow brushed his pale hair back from his eyes looked him straight on in the face to see if the fever had fallen to ashes and seeing that it had went on singing to her work grandma he had often wanted to say is this where the world began for surely it had begun in no other than a place like this the kitchen without doubt was the center of creation all things revolved about it it was the pediment that sustained the temple eyes shut to let his nose wander he snuffed deeply he moved in the hellfire steams and sudden bakingpowder flurries of snow in this miraculous climate where grandma with the look of the indies in her eyes and the flesh of two firm warm hens in her bodice grandma of the thousand arms shook basted whipped beat minced diced peeled wrapped salted stirred blind he touched his way to the pantry door a squeal of laughter rang from the parlor teacups tinkled but he moved on into the cool underwater green and wildpersimmon country where the slung and hanging odor of creamy bananas ripened silently and bumped his head gnats fitted angrily about vinegar cruets and his ears he opened his eyes he saw bread waiting to be cut into slices of warm summer cloud doughnuts strewn like clown hoops from some edible game the faucets turned on and off in his cheeks here on the plumshadowed side of the house with maple leaves making a creekwater running in the hot wind at the window he read spicecabinet names how do i thank mr jonas he wondered for what hes done how do i thank him how pay him back no way no way at all you just cant pay what then what pass it on somehow he thought pass it on to someone else keep the chain moving look around find someone and pass it on that was the only way cayenne marjoram cinnamon the names of lost and fabulous cities through which storms of spice bloomed up and dusted away he tossed the cloves that had traveled from some dark continent where once they had spilled on milk marble jackstones for children with licorice hands and looking at one single label on a jar he felt himself gone round the calendar to that private day this summer when he had looked at the circling world and found himself at its center the word on the jar was relish and he was glad he had decided to live relish what a special name for the minced pickle sweetly crushed in its whitecapped jar the man who had named it what a man he must have been roaring stamping around he must have tromped the joys of the world and jammed them in this jar and writ in a big hand shouting relish for its very sound meant rolling in sweet fields with roistering chestnut mares mouths bearded with grass plunging your head fathoms deep in trough water so the sea poured cavernously through your head relish he put out his hand and here wassavory whats grandma cooking for dinner tonight said aunt roses voice from the real world of afternoon in the parlor no one knows what grandma cooks said grandfather home from the office early to tend this immense flower until we sit at table theres always mystery always suspense well i always like to know what im going to eat cried aunt rose and laughed the chandelier prisms in the dining room rang with pain douglas moved deeper into pantry darkness savorythats a swell word and basil and betel capsicum curry all great but relish now relish with a capital r no argument thats the best trailing veils of steam grandma came and went and came again with covered dishes from kitchen to table while the assembled company waited in silence no one lifted lids to peer in at the hidden victuals at last grandma sat down grandpa said grace and immediately thereafter the silverware flew up like a plague of locusts on the air when everyones mouths were absolutely crammed full of miracles grandmother sat back and said well how do you like it and the relatives including aunt rose and the boarders their teeth deliciously mortared together at this moment faced a terrible dilemma speak and break the spell or continue allowing this honeysyrup food of the gods to dissolve and melt away to glory in their mouths they looked as if they might laugh or cry at the cruel dilemma they looked as if they might sit there forever untouched by fire or earthquake or shooting in the street a massacre of innocents in the yard overwhelmed with effluviums and promises of immortality all villains were innocent in this moment of tender herbs sweet celeries luscious roots the eye sped over a snow field where lay fricassees salmagundis gumbos freshly invented succotashes chowders ragouts the only sound was a primeval bubbling from the kitchen and the clocklike chiming of forkonplate announcing the seconds instead of the hours and then aunt rose gathered her indomitable pinkness and health and strength into herself with one deep breath and fork poised on air looking at the mystery there impaled spoke in much too loud a voice oh its beautiful food all right but what is this thing were eating the lemonade stopped tinkling in the frosty glasses the forks ceased flashing on the air and came to rest on the table douglas gave aunt rose that look which a shot deer gives the hunter before it falls dead wounded surprise appeared in each face down the line the food was selfexplanatory wasnt it it was its own philosophy it asked and answered its own questions wasnt it enough that your blood and your body asked no more than this moment of ritual and rare incense i really dont believe said aunt rose that anyone heard my question at last grandma let her lips open a trifle to allow the answer out i call this our thursday special we have it regularly this was a lie in all the years not one single dish resembled another was this one from the deep green sea had that one been shot from blue summer air was it a swimming food or a flying food had it pumped blood or chlorophyll had it walked or leaned after the sun no one knew no one asked no one cared the most people did was stand in the kitchen door and peer at the bakingpowder explosions enjoy the clangs and rattles and bangs like a factory gone wild where grandma stared half blindly about letting her fingers find their way among canisters and bowls was she conscious of her talent hardly if asked about her cooking grandma would look down at her hands which some glorious instinct sent on journeys to be gloved in flour r to plumb disencumbered turkeys wristdeep in search of their animal souls her gray eyes blinked from spectacles warped by forty years of oven blasts and blinded with strewings of pepper and sage so she sometimes flung cornstarchver steaks amazingly tender succulent steaks and sometimes dropped apricots into meat leaves crosspollinated meats herbs fruits vegetables with no prejudice no tolerance for recipe or formula save that at the final moment of delivery mouths watered blood thundered in response her lands then like the hands of greatgrandma before her were grandmas mystery delight and life she looked at them in astonishment but let them live their life the way they must absolutely lead it but now for the first time in endless years here was an upstart a questioner a laboratory scientist almost speaking out where silence could have been a virtue yes yes but what did you put in this thursday special why said grandma evasively what does it taste like to you aunt rose sniffed the morsel on the fork beef or is it lamb ginger or is it cinnamon ham sauce bilberries some biscuit thrown in chives almonds thats it exactly said grandma second helpings everyone a great uproar ensued a clashing of plates a swarming of arms a rush of voices which hoped to drown blasphemous inquiry forever douglas talking louder and making more motions than the rest but in their faces you could see their world tottering their happiness in danger for they were the privileged members of a household which rushed from work or play when the first dinner bell was so much as clapped once in the hall their arrival in the dining room had been for countless years a sort of frantic musical chairs as they shook out napkins in a white fluttering and seized up utensils as if recently starved in solitary confinement waiting for the summons to fall downstairs in a mass of twitching elbows and overflow themselves at table now they clamored nervously making obvious jokes darting glances at aunt rose as if she concealed a bomb in that ample bosom that was ticking steadily on toward their doom aunt rose sensing that silence was indeed a blessing devoted herself to three helpings of whatever it was on the plate and went upstairs to unlace her corset grandma said aunt rose down again oh what a kitchen you keep its really a mess now you must admit bottles and dishes and boxes all over the labels off most everything so how do you tell what youre using id feel guilty if you didnt let me help you set things to rights while im visiting here let me roll up my sleeves no thank you very much said grandma douglas heard them through the library walls and his heart thumped its like a turkish bath in here said aunt rose lets have some windows open roll up those shades so we can see what were doing light hurts my eyes said grandma i got the broom ill wash the dishes and stack them away neat i got to help now dont say a word go sit down said grandma why grandma think how itd help your cooking youre a wonderful cook its true but if youre this good in all this chaospure chaoswhy think how fine youd be once things were put where you could lay hands on them i never thought of that said grandma think on it then say for instance modern kitchen methods helped you improve your cooking just ten or fifteen per cent your menfolk are already pure animal at the table this time next week theyll be dying like flies from overeating food so pretty and fine they wont be able to stop the knife and fork you really think so said grandma beginning to be interested grandma dont give in whispered douglas to the library wall but to his horror he heard them sweeping and dusting throwing out halfempty sacks pasting new labels on cans putting dishes and pots and pans in drawers that had stood empty for years even the knives which had lain like a catch of silvery fish on the kitchen tables were dumped into boxes grandfather had been listening behind douglas for a full five minutes somewhat uneasily he scratched his chin now that i think of it that kitchens been a mess right on down the line things need a little arrangement no doubt and if what aunt rose claims is true doug boy itll be a rare experience at supper tomorrow night yes sir said douglas a rare experience whats that asked grandma aunt rose took a wrapped gift from behind her back grandma opened it a cookbook she cried she let it drop on the table i dont need one of those a handful of this a pinch of that a thimbleful of something else is all i ever use ill help you market said aunt rose and while were at it i been noticing your glasses grandma you mean to say you been going around all these years peering through spectacles like those with chipped lenses all kind of bent how do you see your way around without falling flat in the flour bin were taking you right down for new glasses and off they marched grandma bewildered on roses elbow into the summer afternoon they returned with groceries new glasses and a hairdo for grandma grandma looked as if she had been chased around town she gasped as rose helped her into the house there you are grandma now you got everything where you can find it now you can see come on doug said grandfather lets take a walk around the block and work up an appetite this is going to be a night in history one of the best darned suppers ever served or ill eat my vest suppertime smiling people stopped smiling douglas chewed one bit of food for three minutes and then pretending to wipe his mouth lumped it in his napkin he saw tom and dad do the same people swashed the food together making roads and patterns drawing pictures in the gravy forming castles of the potatoes secretly passing meat chunks to the dog grandfather excused himself early im full he said all the boarders were pale and silent grandma poked her own plate nervously isnt it a fine meal aunt rose asked everyone got it on the table half an hour early too but the others were thinking that monday followed sunday and tuesday followed monday and so on for an entire week of sad breakfasts melancholy lunches and funereal dinners in a few minutes the dining room was empty upstairs the boarders brooded in their rooms grandma moved slowly stunned into her kitchen this said grandfather has gone far enough he went to the foot of the stairs and called up into the dusty sunlight come on down everyone the boarders murmured all of them locked in the dim comfortable library grandfather quietly passed a derby hat for the kitty he said then he put his hand heavily on douglass shoulder douglas we have a great mission for you son now listen and he whispered his warm friendly breath into the boys ear douglas found aunt rose alone cutting flowers in the garden the next afternoon aunt rose he said gravely why dont we go for a walk right now ill show you the butterfly ravine just down that way they walked together all around town douglas talked swiftly nervously not looking at her listening only to the courthouse clock strike the afternoon hours strolling back under the warm summer elms toward the house aunt rose suddenly gasped and put her hand to her throat there on the bottom of the porch step was her luggage neatly packed on top of one suitcase fluttering in the summer breeze was a pink railroad ticket the boarders all ten of them were seated on the porch stiffly grandfather like a train conductor a mayor a good friend came down the steps solemnly rose he said to her taking her hand and shaking it up and down i have something to say to you what is it said aunt rose aunt rose he said goodbye they heard the train chant away into the late afternoon hours the porch was empty the luggage gone aunt roses room unoccupied grandfather in the library groped behind e a poe for a small medicine bottle smiling grandma came home from a solitary shopping expedition to town wheres aunt rose we said goodbye to her at the station said grandfather we all wept she hated to go but she sent her best love to you and said she would return again in twelve years grandfather took out his solid gold watch and now i suggest we all repair to the library for a glass of sherry while waiting for grandma to fix one of her amazing banquets grandma walked off to the back of the house everyone talked and laughed and listenedthe boarders grandfather and douglas and they heard the quiet sounds in the kitchen when grandma rang the bell they herded to the dining room elbowing their way everyone took a huge bite grandma watched the faces of her boarders silently they stared at their plates their hands in their laps the food cooling unchewed in their cheeks ive lost it grandma said ive lost my touch and she began to cry she got up and wandered out into her neatly ordered labeled kitchen her hands moving futilely before her the boarders went to bed hungry douglas heard the courthouse clock chime tenthirty eleven then midnight heard the boarders stirring in their beds like a tide moving under the moonlit roof of the vast house he knew they were all awake thinking and sad after a long time he sat up in bed he began to smile at the wall and the mirror he saw himself grinning as he opened the door and crept downstairs the parlor was dark and smelled old and alone he held his breath he fumbled into the kitchen and stood waiting a moment then he began to move he took the baking powder out of its fine new tin and put it in an old flour sack the way it had always been he dusted the white flour into an old cookie crock he removed the sugar from the metal bin marked sugar and sifted it into a familiar series of smaller bins marked spices cutlery string he put the cloves where they had lain for years littering the bottom of half a dozen drawers he brought the dishes and knives and forks and spoons back out on top of the tables he found grandmas new eyeglasses on the parlor mantel and hid them in the cellar he kindled a great fire in the old woodburning stove using pages from the new cookbook by one oclock in the still morning a huge husking roar shot up in the black stovepipe such a wild roar that the house if it had ever slept at all awoke he heard the rustle of grandmas slippers down the hall stairs she stood in the kitchen blinking at the chaos douglas was hidden behind the pantry door at onethirty in the deep dark morning the cooking odors blew up through the windy corridors of the house down the stairs one by one came women in curlers men in bathrobes to tiptoe and peer into the kitchenlit only by fitful gusts of red fire from the hissing stove and there in the black kitchen at two of a warm summer morning grandma floated like an apparition amidst bangings and clatterings half blind once more her fingers groping instinctively in the dimness shaking out spice clouds over bubbling pots and simmering kettles her face in the firelight red magical and enchanted as she seized and stirred and poured the sublime foods quiet quiet the boarders laid the best linens and gleaming silver and lit candles rather than switch on electric lights and snap the spell grandfather arriving home from a late evenings work at the printing office was startled to hear grace being said in the candlelit dining room as for the food the meats were deviled the sauces curried the greens mounded with sweet butter the biscuits splashed with jeweled honey everything toothsome luscious and so miraculously refreshing that a gentle lowing broke out as from a pasturage of beasts gone wild in clover one and all cried out their gratitude for their loosefitting night clothes at threethirty on sunday morning with the house warm with eaten food and friendly spirits grandfather pushed back his chair and gestured magnificently from the library he fetched a copy of shakespeare he laid it on a platter which he presented to his wife grandma he said i ask only that tomorrow night for supper you cook us this very fine volume i am certain we all agree that by the time it reaches the table tomorrow at twilight it will be delicate succulent brown and tender as the breast of the autumn pheasant grandma held the book in her hands and cried happily they lingered on toward dawn with brief desserts wine from those wild flowers growing in the front yard and then as the first birds winked to life and the sun threatened the eastern sky they all crept upstairs douglas listened to the stove cooling in the faraway kitchen he heard grandma go to bed junkman he thought mr jonas wherever you are youre thanked youre paid back i passed it on i sure did i think i passed it on he slept and dreamed in the dream the bell was ringing and all of them were yelling and rushing down to breakfast and then quite suddenly summer was over he knew it first when walking downtown tom grabbed his arm and pointed gasping at the dimestore window they stood there unable to move because of the things from another world displayed so neatly so innocently so frighteningly there pencils doug ten thousand pencils oh my gosh nickel tablets dime tablets notebooks erasers water colors rulers compasses a hundred thousand of them dont look maybe its just a mirage no moaned tom in despair school school straight on ahead why why do dime stores show things like that in windows before summers even over ruin half the vacation they walked on home and found grandfather alone on the sere baldspotted lawn plucking the last few dandelions they worked with him silently for a time and then douglas bent in his own shadow said tom if this years gone like this what will next year be better or worse dont ask me tom blew a tune on a dandelion stem i didnt make the world he thought about it though some days i feel like i did he spat happily i got a hunch said douglas what next years going to be even bigger days will be brighter nights longer and darker more people dying more babies born and me in the middle of it all you and two zillion other people doug remember day like today murmured douglas i feel itll bejust me need any help said tom just yell what could a tenyearold brother do a tenyearold brotherll be eleven next summer ill unwind the world like the rubber band on a golf balls insides every morning put it back together every night show you how if you ask crazy always was tom crossed his eyes stuck out his tongue always will be douglas laughed they went down in the cellar with grandpa and while he decapitated the flowers they looked at all the summer shelves and glimmering there in the motionless streams the bottles of dandelion wine numbered from one to ninetyodd there the ketchup bottles most of them full now stood burning in the cellar twilight one for every living summer day boy said tom what a swell way to save june july and august real practical grandfather looked up considered this and smiled better than putting things in the attic you never use again this way you get to live the summer over for a minute or two here or there along the way through the winter and when the bottles are empty the summers gone for good and no regrets and no sentimental trash lying about for you to stumble over forty years from now clean smokeless efficient thats dandelion wine the two boys pointed along the rows of bottles theres the first day of summer theres the new tennis shoes day sure and theres the green machine buffalo dust and ching ling soo the tarot witch the lonely one its not really over said tom itll never be over ill remember what happened on every day of this year forever it was over before it began said grandpa unwinding the wine press i dont remember a thing that happened except some new type of grass that wouldnt need cutting youre joking no sir doug tom youll find as you get older the days kind of blurcant tell one from the other but heck said tom on monday this week it rollerskated at electric park tuesday i ate chocolate cake wednesday i fell in the crick thursday fell off a swinging vine the weeks been full of things and today ill remember today because the leaves outside are beginning to get all red and yellow wont be long theyll be all over the lawn and well jump in piles of them and burn them ill never forget today ill always remember i know grandfather looked up through the cellar window at the latesummer trees stirring in a colder wind of course you will tom he said of course you will and they left the mellow light of the dandelion wine and went upstairs to carry out the last few rituals of summer for they felt that now the final day the final night had come as the day grew late they realized that for two or three nights now porches had emptied early of their inhabitants the air had a different drier smell and grandma was talking of hot coffee instead of iced tea the open whitefluttercurtained windows were closing in the great bays cold cuts were giving way to steamed beef the mosquitoes were gone from the porch and surely when they abandoned the conflict the war with time was really done there was nothing for it but that humans also forsake the battleground now tom and douglas and grandfather stood as they had stood three months or was it three long centuries ago on this front porch which creaked like a ship slumbering at night in growing swells and they sniffed the air inside the boys bones felt like chalk and ivory instead of green mint sticks and licorice whips as earlier in the year but the new cold touched grandfathers skeleton first like a raw hand chording the yellow bass piano keys in the dining room as the compass turns so turned grandfather north i guess he said deliberating we wont be coming out here anymore and the three of them clanked the chains shaken down from the porchceiling eyelets and carried the swing like a weathered bier around to the garage followed by a blowing of the first dried leaves inside they heard grandma poking up a fire in the library the windows shook with a sudden gust of wind douglas spending a last night in the cupola tower above grandma and grandpa wrote in his tablet everything runs backward now like matinee films sometimes where people jump out of water onto diving boards come september you push down the windows you pushed up take off the sneakers you put on pull on the hard shoes you threw away last june people run in the house now like birds jumping back inside clocks one minute porches loaded everyone gabbing thirty to a dozen next minute doors slam talk stops and leaves fall off trees like crazy he looked from the high window at the land where the crickets were strewn like dried figs in the creek beds at a sky where birds would wheel south now through the cry of autumn loons and where trees would go up in a great fine burning of color on the steely clouds way out in the country tonight he could smell the pumpkins ripening toward the knife and the triangle eye and the singeing candle here in town the first few scarves of smoke unwound from chimneys and the faint faraway quaking of iron was the rush of black hard rivers of coal down chutes building high dark mounds in cellar bins but it was late and getting later douglas in the high cupola above the town moved his hand everyone clothes off he waited the wind blew icing the windowpane brush teeth he waited again now he said at last out with the lights he blinked and the town winked out its lights sleepily here there as the courthouse clock struck ten tenthirty eleven and drowsy midnight the last ones nowtherethere he lay in his bed and the town slept around him and the ravine was dark and the lake was moving quietly on its shore and everyone his family his friends the old people and the young slept on one street or another in one house or another or slept in the far country churchyards he shut his eyes june dawns july noons august evenings over finished done and gone forever with only the sense of it all left here in his head now a whole autumn a white winter a cool and greening spring to figure sums and totals of summer past and if he should forget the dandelion wine stood in the cellar numbered huge for each and every day he would go there often stare straight into the sun until he could stare no more then close his eyes and consider the burned spots the fleeting scars left dancing on his warm eyelids arranging rearranging each fire and reflection until the pattern was clear so thinking he slept and sleeping put an end to summer
